18 .
this week , marc young considers the constitutional controversy surrounding the poll . i may have lived in germany too long . how else can i explain going online during my recent holiday in sardinia to read up on the latest political happenings in berlin ? admittedly , i was n't constantly mulling the possible unconstitutionality of germany 's early general election as i was splashing about in the island 's emerald green seas or sleeping on a white sandy beach .
however , just the fact that i was checking up on gerhard schröder and angela merkel after quaffing down a tasty cappuccino clearly outs me as a teutonic political junky . fortunately , such predilections should serve me well in this new weekly column .
from the perspective of an informed outsider , i will aim to analyze and scrutinize what could be the most important german election campaign in a generation .
i encourage readers to use the feedback link at the bottom of each commentary to share their own thoughts on the topics i delve into . it wo n't be news to anyone who occasionally visits dw-world that germany is in the midst of a serious economic crisis .
whoever wins the election in september will have to tackle the county 's twin woes of high unemployment and sluggish growth .
but the next chancellor will also have to address a crisis of confidence affecting germany 's collective psyche . that is , if there even is an election . all major political parties and an overwhelming majority of the public support schröder 's decision to bring forward the general election by a year , but germany 's constitutional court could still put the brakes on a campaign that is now in full swing . circumventing the constitution ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's constitutional court in karlsruhe .
that 's because schröder , who can not dissolve parliament himself , was forced to fake losing a confidence vote to trigger the early election one year before his second four-year term had ended .
that has led some disgruntled backbenchers of schröder 's own center-left coalition of social democrats and greens to petition the country 's highest court to stop the poll on the grounds the chancellor circumvented the constitution . i would tend to agree with the assessment that the confidence vote was less than kosher .
however , i also think germany desperately needs to be shaken out of its current self-pitying , reform-fearing , navel-gazing malaise .
and the best way to do that is by going to the polls this fall .
the country ca n't afford to wait another year .
berlin would face certain political gridlock as schröder 's agenda would be stymied by the conservative opposition , which controls the upper house of parliament , and rebel leftwing mps in his own party . that still does n't completely eliminate all of the queasiness i feel about clearly disingenuous path taken toward an early election and is why the next government will also need to pursue an amendment to the constitution allowing the chancellor to dissolve parliament in future . stable democracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german flag flying next to the glass dome of the reichstag .
yes , germany 's post-war founding fathers had plenty of good reasons for making the dissolution of the bundestag a difficult affair .
germany 's basic law was written to prevent the political instability seen during the weimar republic that helped hitler come to power in 1933 .
but who can seriously argue today that modern germany is not a stable and mature democracy ? as far as representing the will of the voters , germany 's system of proportional representation is vastly superior to the first-past-post methods used by britain and many other countries .
but it is an anachronism that the chancellor does not have the power to dissolve parliament like the leaders of other parliamentary democracies . it is time for that to change .
the present dire state germany finds itself in means politicians and the public are willing to let the blatantly faked confidence vote last month slide with a wink and nudge .
but unless the basic law is amended to avoid such a situation in the future , germany 's leaders will be tacitly legitimizing such political hocus pocus . and that would be far more damaging to germany 's democratic institutions than by giving the chancellor the power to dissolve parliament . marc young , dw-world send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de köhler gives go ahead for early elections german president horst köhler told his compatriots on thursday that he would dissolve parliament and called for federal elections on september 18 .

18 .
this week , marc young considers the constitutional controversy surrounding the poll . i may have lived in germany too long . how else can i explain going online during my recent holiday in sardinia to read up on the latest political happenings in berlin ? admittedly , i was n't constantly mulling the possible unconstitutionality of germany 's early general election as i was splashing about in the island 's emerald green seas or sleeping on a white sandy beach .
however , just the fact that i was checking up on gerhard schröder and angela merkel after quaffing down a tasty cappuccino clearly outs me as a teutonic political junky . fortunately , such predilections should serve me well in this new weekly column .
from the perspective of an informed outsider , i will aim to analyze and scrutinize what could be the most important german election campaign in a generation .
i encourage readers to use the feedback link at the bottom of each commentary to share their own thoughts on the topics i delve into . it wo n't be news to anyone who occasionally visits dw-world that germany is in the midst of a serious economic crisis .
whoever wins the election in september will have to tackle the county 's twin woes of high unemployment and sluggish growth .
but the next chancellor will also have to address a crisis of confidence affecting germany 's collective psyche . that is , if there even is an election . all major political parties and an overwhelming majority of the public support schröder 's decision to bring forward the general election by a year , but germany 's constitutional court could still put the brakes on a campaign that is now in full swing . circumventing the constitution ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's constitutional court in karlsruhe .

it recounts the story of seven million people , who left germany in search of a better life . at the site where steamboats and sailing ships docked to take on emigrants in the 19th century , the new museum now offers visitors a chance to relive the beginning of these journeys into the unknown .
the center wants to serve both as a memorial and a place for people to relive the past .
officials for the public-private project hope that 170,000 people from both sides of the atlantic will come to visit each year . sabine süss , the museum 's director , recently took visitors on a preview tour of the building that includes displays built by movie set designers and prop masters that allow guests to feel like they 're really just about to board a ship . bildunterschrift : a set design of a ship at the museum " once you 've left the waiting hall , you end up on the pier here , " she said .

there are boxes everywhere , you see luggage and really start to feel like you 're getting ready to emigrate . " süss is thrilled with the work of the film professionals , who have recreated the scenes in the 20 million-euro -lrb- $ 24.6-million -rrb- building .

i was torn , but the thrill kept me going . " bildunterschrift : emigration scenes adorn the wall of the center while von schweinitz left on a modern ocean liner , emigrants still traveled on sailing ships a century earlier .
it was a strenuous trip , süss said . " we 're in a sailing ship now and these are the sleeping quarters , " she explained while touring a replica of a boat .
" this was also the room were people stayed during the day and throughout the entire journey that took 70 , 80 days .
it was extremely crowded and people did n't know each other and often did n't even speak the same language . " telling stories in the 19th century alone , 35 million europeans packed their bags in search of a better life abroad .

a new nationwide study shows that youths have a " considerable fear " of the future . the release of unemployment figures by the german federal labor agency has become a monthly thorn in the side for the gerhard schröder 's administration .
the numbers are gloomy for those without a job .
in july , unemployment stood at 4.77 million , or 11.5 percent .
the dark job picture is now also casting its shadow on the youth of germany .
according to a study conducted by the bertelsmann foundation , over half of the teenagers asked said they were skeptical or downright pessimistic about their chances to find a job after graduating from school .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german trade union federation is resorting to more exotic events , such as this job parade on may 1 , to help youths find work " our study shows that teenagers in germany - particularly those in secondary schools -lrb- hauptschule -rrb- - have a considerable fear of the future in light of the miserable job market and the chronic shortage of training positions , " said foundation chairman prof. heribert meffert in a statement .
less education , greater anxiety it 's exactly those from secondary schools for those students not bound for university who feel that their chances of finding a job are poor .
in the study , more than four of every five asked responded that those aiming for their secondary school degree be at a disadvantage when looking for an apprenticeship or employment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal labor agency logo meffert sees a great danger in the developments .
high youth unemployment would be a threat to the nation 's economy because those teenagers who fail to find a job after completing school are in danger of becoming part of gernany 's long-term unemployed . that 's doubly dangerous : the state would have to pay them welfare benefits , plus they are not paying into the state 's coffers for social benefits .
in addition , the increasing number of retirees means the creation of a gap of some three million skilled laborers , technicians and craftsmen by the year 2015 .
the perceived fragile situation on the job market has created a sense of urgency amongst adolescents .
almost two-thirds of them say they are willing to invest more time for their professional futures - and rightfully so .
eighty-one percent answered that the highest hurdle in the landing of training position is a lack of such positions .
only 26 percent feel that their grades and performance at school are hindrance in finding work .
no time to panic as autumn approaches , the number of those still without a training position stands at 246,400 with only 76,500 available .
last week , the german trade union federation -lrb- dgb -rrb- accused employers of not keeping their word , namely that all youths could find a position .
according to the dgb 's ingrid sehrbock , the adolescents ' situation is getting worse each day .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economics and labor minister wolfgang clement georg braun , the president of the german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- , did not dispute the lack of positions but points out that 205,000 more apprenticeship contracts have been signed in the first seven months this year than last .
german labor minister wolfgang clement -lrb- photo -rrb- said for all sides to not yet panic .
the job training market is not very transparent .
many employers first register open apprenticeships with the local chamber of commerce , and then later with the labor agency , making it hard to judge just how many total number training positions are available .
it also varies extremely from region to region .
in munich , there is a surplus of apprenticeships .
that contrasts with the dire situation in the eastern part of the country .
on average , some 100 job-seekers are fighting for 37 apprenticeships in that economically depressed region .
with the poor prospects there , the fears of many german youths may turn out to be all too real . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de young germans prove big spenders germans have long been accused of being too prudent when it comes to spending .

-lrb- june 21 , 2005 -rrb- the german fear of unemployment angst over the hovering specter of unemployment reached an all-time high last january as the number of unemployed climbed to over five million .

a new nationwide study shows that youths have a " considerable fear " of the future . the release of unemployment figures by the german federal labor agency has become a monthly thorn in the side for the gerhard schröder 's administration .
the numbers are gloomy for those without a job .
in july , unemployment stood at 4.77 million , or 11.5 percent .
the dark job picture is now also casting its shadow on the youth of germany .
according to a study conducted by the bertelsmann foundation , over half of the teenagers asked said they were skeptical or downright pessimistic about their chances to find a job after graduating from school .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german trade union federation is resorting to more exotic events , such as this job parade on may 1 , to help youths find work " our study shows that teenagers in germany - particularly those in secondary schools -lrb- hauptschule -rrb- - have a considerable fear of the future in light of the miserable job market and the chronic shortage of training positions , " said foundation chairman prof. heribert meffert in a statement .
less education , greater anxiety it 's exactly those from secondary schools for those students not bound for university who feel that their chances of finding a job are poor .
in the study , more than four of every five asked responded that those aiming for their secondary school degree be at a disadvantage when looking for an apprenticeship or employment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal labor agency logo meffert sees a great danger in the developments .
high youth unemployment would be a threat to the nation 's economy because those teenagers who fail to find a job after completing school are in danger of becoming part of gernany 's long-term unemployed . that 's doubly dangerous : the state would have to pay them welfare benefits , plus they are not paying into the state 's coffers for social benefits .
in addition , the increasing number of retirees means the creation of a gap of some three million skilled laborers , technicians and craftsmen by the year 2015 .
the perceived fragile situation on the job market has created a sense of urgency amongst adolescents .
almost two-thirds of them say they are willing to invest more time for their professional futures - and rightfully so .
eighty-one percent answered that the highest hurdle in the landing of training position is a lack of such positions .
only 26 percent feel that their grades and performance at school are hindrance in finding work .

it recounts the story of seven million people , who left germany in search of a better life . at the site where steamboats and sailing ships docked to take on emigrants in the 19th century , the new museum now offers visitors a chance to relive the beginning of these journeys into the unknown .
the center wants to serve both as a memorial and a place for people to relive the past .
officials for the public-private project hope that 170,000 people from both sides of the atlantic will come to visit each year . sabine süss , the museum 's director , recently took visitors on a preview tour of the building that includes displays built by movie set designers and prop masters that allow guests to feel like they 're really just about to board a ship . bildunterschrift : a set design of a ship at the museum " once you 've left the waiting hall , you end up on the pier here , " she said .
" the year 's 1880 .
you 're standing in front of a huge side of a ship , which sits in a basin .
there are boxes everywhere , you see luggage and really start to feel like you 're getting ready to emigrate . " süss is thrilled with the work of the film professionals , who have recreated the scenes in the 20 million-euro -lrb- $ 24.6-million -rrb- building .
there 's a gangway that moves when visitors walk on it , giving them at least an idea of what it must have been like . mixed feelings helga von schweinitz left germany for the united states on the ship " italia " in 1957 in search for a job . " it was a mixture of excitement about the unknown and a fear of leaving everything behind , " she said .
" my father was standing on the pier and kept waving and waving and i saw that he was crying .
i was torn , but the thrill kept me going . " bildunterschrift : emigration scenes adorn the wall of the center while von schweinitz left on a modern ocean liner , emigrants still traveled on sailing ships a century earlier .
it was a strenuous trip , süss said . " we 're in a sailing ship now and these are the sleeping quarters , " she explained while touring a replica of a boat .
" this was also the room were people stayed during the day and throughout the entire journey that took 70 , 80 days .
it was extremely crowded and people did n't know each other and often did n't even speak the same language . " telling stories in the 19th century alone , 35 million europeans packed their bags in search of a better life abroad .
in bremerhaven , 15 of these life stories are recounted to serve as guides for visitors . they help to explain motives for leaving - many did n't emigrate voluntarily , as the example of a young jewish doctor shows , who fled germany for america , but could never work in her profession again . bildunterschrift : interactive displays at the museum interactive displays also give people a chance to search for their own relatives who emigrated or simply scroll through passenger lists . one name that comes up on the lists is volker schmeissner .
as a 26-year-old student from tübingen in southwestern germany .
he left for the united states in 1961 . bildunterschrift : view of the center at night " this was the last bit of germany i saw , " he said .
" it was a memory that stayed .
i keep getting asked where my roots are and were i can go to find them documented .

it recounts the story of seven million people , who left germany in search of a better life . at the site where steamboats and sailing ships docked to take on emigrants in the 19th century , the new museum now offers visitors a chance to relive the beginning of these journeys into the unknown .
the center wants to serve both as a memorial and a place for people to relive the past .
officials for the public-private project hope that 170,000 people from both sides of the atlantic will come to visit each year . sabine süss , the museum 's director , recently took visitors on a preview tour of the building that includes displays built by movie set designers and prop masters that allow guests to feel like they 're really just about to board a ship . bildunterschrift : a set design of a ship at the museum " once you 've left the waiting hall , you end up on the pier here , " she said .
" the year 's 1880 .
you 're standing in front of a huge side of a ship , which sits in a basin .
there are boxes everywhere , you see luggage and really start to feel like you 're getting ready to emigrate . " süss is thrilled with the work of the film professionals , who have recreated the scenes in the 20 million-euro -lrb- $ 24.6-million -rrb- building .
there 's a gangway that moves when visitors walk on it , giving them at least an idea of what it must have been like . mixed feelings helga von schweinitz left germany for the united states on the ship " italia " in 1957 in search for a job . " it was a mixture of excitement about the unknown and a fear of leaving everything behind , " she said .
" my father was standing on the pier and kept waving and waving and i saw that he was crying .
i was torn , but the thrill kept me going . " bildunterschrift : emigration scenes adorn the wall of the center while von schweinitz left on a modern ocean liner , emigrants still traveled on sailing ships a century earlier .
it was a strenuous trip , süss said . " we 're in a sailing ship now and these are the sleeping quarters , " she explained while touring a replica of a boat .
" this was also the room were people stayed during the day and throughout the entire journey that took 70 , 80 days .
it was extremely crowded and people did n't know each other and often did n't even speak the same language . " telling stories in the 19th century alone , 35 million europeans packed their bags in search of a better life abroad .
in bremerhaven , 15 of these life stories are recounted to serve as guides for visitors . they help to explain motives for leaving - many did n't emigrate voluntarily , as the example of a young jewish doctor shows , who fled germany for america , but could never work in her profession again . bildunterschrift : interactive displays at the museum interactive displays also give people a chance to search for their own relatives who emigrated or simply scroll through passenger lists . one name that comes up on the lists is volker schmeissner .
as a 26-year-old student from tübingen in southwestern germany .
he left for the united states in 1961 . bildunterschrift : view of the center at night " this was the last bit of germany i saw , " he said .
" it was a memory that stayed .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 08.08.2005 schily defends preventive detention plan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schily rejected claims that his proposals harked back to the nazis german interior minister otto schily on monday defended his plan to extend preventive detention measures which would allow police to keep terror suspects in custody for several months without having committed a crime . schily said in berlin that such a measure might be the only way of keeping terrorists in check when other steps could not be taken or failed to achieve the desired effect . schily rejected criticism from some german lawmakers who had compared his ideas to the nazis ' system of detention in the 1930s , which was installed with a view to eliminating critics of the dictatorship . addressing the media at a press conference in berlin , schily insisted that an extended preventive detention system could become an effective means to clamp down on the activities of potential terrorists . he was reacting to massive criticism voiced by green party ministers last week who claimed that such a system would be highly undemocratic and reminiscent of the nazis ' practice of dealing with unwanted people : schily rejects ' unconstitutional ' claims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " it 's silly to liken a democracy which defends itself against terrorism to a terrorist dictatorship which used to prosecute democrats , " he said .
" preventive detention - no matter for how long a period - is not unconstitutional , as long as it has the judiciary involved to the extent it should be , and i 'm not saying we should do away with that . " " but we have to ask ourselves in all seriousness , " he continued , " whether our hands should be tied , if certain persons known to have contacts with terrorist networks and who can not be extradited under german law can not be held in preventive custody for a longer period , if need be .
we have a different threat perception now , and we are called upon to react to it accordingly . " schily addressed the media together with the heads of the country 's most important intelligence agencies .
he used the occasion to call for more powers for the federal criminal office -lrb- bka -rrb- which can only act when a crime has already been committed . current situation " unsatisfactory " " we have to see to it that the federal criminal office is put in a position to take preventive measures in order to avoid a possible crime , " said schily .
" it 's absurd that right now it can only step into action when a crime has already been committed .
if the constitution needs to be changed to furnish the office with wider powers then let ’ s go for it . " he says . " the current situation is highly unsatisfactory in my view , but i know that some ministers at state level are of a different opinion , " he added . schily also called the news conference to report about the work of a new anti-terror center in berlin , founded in december of last year .
the center employs 180 intelligence officers from about 40 agencies and is designed to exchange information about terrorist threats directly . information exchange aiding investigations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto schily , jörg ziercke , right , president of the bka , heinz fromm , president of the office for the protection of the constitution .
the president of the bka , jörg zierke , said the office had been doing an excellent job in helping to ward off terrorist threats . " with the center in place , we are now much faster in exchanging relevant intelligence information among our various agencies , " zierke said .
" it 's all about creating a more efficient early warning system , as far as terrorist threats are concerned .
and it ’ s all about closer coordination and making sure that our findings are of more value when it comes to taking suspects to court . " hardy graupner -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schily demands tougher anti-terror laws germany is in need of tougher laws to protect against terrorists - including the ability to detain people who could be dangerous - interior minister otto schily said .

" preventive detention - no matter for how long a period - is not unconstitutional , as long as it has the judiciary involved to the extent it should be , and i 'm not saying we should do away with that . " " but we have to ask ourselves in all seriousness , " he continued , " whether our hands should be tied , if certain persons known to have contacts with terrorist networks and who can not be extradited under german law can not be held in preventive custody for a longer period , if need be .
we have a different threat perception now , and we are called upon to react to it accordingly . " schily addressed the media together with the heads of the country 's most important intelligence agencies .
he used the occasion to call for more powers for the federal criminal office -lrb- bka -rrb- which can only act when a crime has already been committed . current situation " unsatisfactory " " we have to see to it that the federal criminal office is put in a position to take preventive measures in order to avoid a possible crime , " said schily .
" it 's absurd that right now it can only step into action when a crime has already been committed .
if the constitution needs to be changed to furnish the office with wider powers then let ’ s go for it . " he says . " the current situation is highly unsatisfactory in my view , but i know that some ministers at state level are of a different opinion , " he added . schily also called the news conference to report about the work of a new anti-terror center in berlin , founded in december of last year .
the center employs 180 intelligence officers from about 40 agencies and is designed to exchange information about terrorist threats directly . information exchange aiding investigations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto schily , jörg ziercke , right , president of the bka , heinz fromm , president of the office for the protection of the constitution .

a new nationwide study shows that youths have a " considerable fear " of the future . the release of unemployment figures by the german federal labor agency has become a monthly thorn in the side for the gerhard schröder 's administration .
the numbers are gloomy for those without a job .
in july , unemployment stood at 4.77 million , or 11.5 percent .
the dark job picture is now also casting its shadow on the youth of germany .
according to a study conducted by the bertelsmann foundation , over half of the teenagers asked said they were skeptical or downright pessimistic about their chances to find a job after graduating from school .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german trade union federation is resorting to more exotic events , such as this job parade on may 1 , to help youths find work " our study shows that teenagers in germany - particularly those in secondary schools -lrb- hauptschule -rrb- - have a considerable fear of the future in light of the miserable job market and the chronic shortage of training positions , " said foundation chairman prof. heribert meffert in a statement .
less education , greater anxiety it 's exactly those from secondary schools for those students not bound for university who feel that their chances of finding a job are poor .
in the study , more than four of every five asked responded that those aiming for their secondary school degree be at a disadvantage when looking for an apprenticeship or employment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal labor agency logo meffert sees a great danger in the developments .
high youth unemployment would be a threat to the nation 's economy because those teenagers who fail to find a job after completing school are in danger of becoming part of gernany 's long-term unemployed . that 's doubly dangerous : the state would have to pay them welfare benefits , plus they are not paying into the state 's coffers for social benefits .
in addition , the increasing number of retirees means the creation of a gap of some three million skilled laborers , technicians and craftsmen by the year 2015 .
the perceived fragile situation on the job market has created a sense of urgency amongst adolescents .
almost two-thirds of them say they are willing to invest more time for their professional futures - and rightfully so .
eighty-one percent answered that the highest hurdle in the landing of training position is a lack of such positions .
only 26 percent feel that their grades and performance at school are hindrance in finding work .
no time to panic as autumn approaches , the number of those still without a training position stands at 246,400 with only 76,500 available .
last week , the german trade union federation -lrb- dgb -rrb- accused employers of not keeping their word , namely that all youths could find a position .
according to the dgb 's ingrid sehrbock , the adolescents ' situation is getting worse each day .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economics and labor minister wolfgang clement georg braun , the president of the german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- , did not dispute the lack of positions but points out that 205,000 more apprenticeship contracts have been signed in the first seven months this year than last .
german labor minister wolfgang clement -lrb- photo -rrb- said for all sides to not yet panic .
the job training market is not very transparent .
many employers first register open apprenticeships with the local chamber of commerce , and then later with the labor agency , making it hard to judge just how many total number training positions are available .
it also varies extremely from region to region .
in munich , there is a surplus of apprenticeships .
that contrasts with the dire situation in the eastern part of the country .
on average , some 100 job-seekers are fighting for 37 apprenticeships in that economically depressed region .

a new nationwide study shows that youths have a " considerable fear " of the future . the release of unemployment figures by the german federal labor agency has become a monthly thorn in the side for the gerhard schröder 's administration .
the numbers are gloomy for those without a job .
in july , unemployment stood at 4.77 million , or 11.5 percent .
the dark job picture is now also casting its shadow on the youth of germany .
according to a study conducted by the bertelsmann foundation , over half of the teenagers asked said they were skeptical or downright pessimistic about their chances to find a job after graduating from school .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german trade union federation is resorting to more exotic events , such as this job parade on may 1 , to help youths find work " our study shows that teenagers in germany - particularly those in secondary schools -lrb- hauptschule -rrb- - have a considerable fear of the future in light of the miserable job market and the chronic shortage of training positions , " said foundation chairman prof. heribert meffert in a statement .
less education , greater anxiety it 's exactly those from secondary schools for those students not bound for university who feel that their chances of finding a job are poor .
in the study , more than four of every five asked responded that those aiming for their secondary school degree be at a disadvantage when looking for an apprenticeship or employment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal labor agency logo meffert sees a great danger in the developments .
high youth unemployment would be a threat to the nation 's economy because those teenagers who fail to find a job after completing school are in danger of becoming part of gernany 's long-term unemployed . that 's doubly dangerous : the state would have to pay them welfare benefits , plus they are not paying into the state 's coffers for social benefits .
in addition , the increasing number of retirees means the creation of a gap of some three million skilled laborers , technicians and craftsmen by the year 2015 .
the perceived fragile situation on the job market has created a sense of urgency amongst adolescents .
almost two-thirds of them say they are willing to invest more time for their professional futures - and rightfully so .
eighty-one percent answered that the highest hurdle in the landing of training position is a lack of such positions .
only 26 percent feel that their grades and performance at school are hindrance in finding work .
no time to panic as autumn approaches , the number of those still without a training position stands at 246,400 with only 76,500 available .
last week , the german trade union federation -lrb- dgb -rrb- accused employers of not keeping their word , namely that all youths could find a position .
according to the dgb 's ingrid sehrbock , the adolescents ' situation is getting worse each day .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economics and labor minister wolfgang clement georg braun , the president of the german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- , did not dispute the lack of positions but points out that 205,000 more apprenticeship contracts have been signed in the first seven months this year than last .
german labor minister wolfgang clement -lrb- photo -rrb- said for all sides to not yet panic .
the job training market is not very transparent .
many employers first register open apprenticeships with the local chamber of commerce , and then later with the labor agency , making it hard to judge just how many total number training positions are available .
it also varies extremely from region to region .
in munich , there is a surplus of apprenticeships .
that contrasts with the dire situation in the eastern part of the country .
on average , some 100 job-seekers are fighting for 37 apprenticeships in that economically depressed region .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 08.08.2005 schily defends preventive detention plan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schily rejected claims that his proposals harked back to the nazis german interior minister otto schily on monday defended his plan to extend preventive detention measures which would allow police to keep terror suspects in custody for several months without having committed a crime . schily said in berlin that such a measure might be the only way of keeping terrorists in check when other steps could not be taken or failed to achieve the desired effect . schily rejected criticism from some german lawmakers who had compared his ideas to the nazis ' system of detention in the 1930s , which was installed with a view to eliminating critics of the dictatorship . addressing the media at a press conference in berlin , schily insisted that an extended preventive detention system could become an effective means to clamp down on the activities of potential terrorists . he was reacting to massive criticism voiced by green party ministers last week who claimed that such a system would be highly undemocratic and reminiscent of the nazis ' practice of dealing with unwanted people : schily rejects ' unconstitutional ' claims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " it 's silly to liken a democracy which defends itself against terrorism to a terrorist dictatorship which used to prosecute democrats , " he said .
" preventive detention - no matter for how long a period - is not unconstitutional , as long as it has the judiciary involved to the extent it should be , and i 'm not saying we should do away with that . " " but we have to ask ourselves in all seriousness , " he continued , " whether our hands should be tied , if certain persons known to have contacts with terrorist networks and who can not be extradited under german law can not be held in preventive custody for a longer period , if need be .
we have a different threat perception now , and we are called upon to react to it accordingly . " schily addressed the media together with the heads of the country 's most important intelligence agencies .
he used the occasion to call for more powers for the federal criminal office -lrb- bka -rrb- which can only act when a crime has already been committed . current situation " unsatisfactory " " we have to see to it that the federal criminal office is put in a position to take preventive measures in order to avoid a possible crime , " said schily .
" it 's absurd that right now it can only step into action when a crime has already been committed .
if the constitution needs to be changed to furnish the office with wider powers then let ’ s go for it . " he says . " the current situation is highly unsatisfactory in my view , but i know that some ministers at state level are of a different opinion , " he added . schily also called the news conference to report about the work of a new anti-terror center in berlin , founded in december of last year .
the center employs 180 intelligence officers from about 40 agencies and is designed to exchange information about terrorist threats directly . information exchange aiding investigations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto schily , jörg ziercke , right , president of the bka , heinz fromm , president of the office for the protection of the constitution .
the president of the bka , jörg zierke , said the office had been doing an excellent job in helping to ward off terrorist threats . " with the center in place , we are now much faster in exchanging relevant intelligence information among our various agencies , " zierke said .
" it 's all about creating a more efficient early warning system , as far as terrorist threats are concerned .
and it ’ s all about closer coordination and making sure that our findings are of more value when it comes to taking suspects to court . " hardy graupner -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schily demands tougher anti-terror laws germany is in need of tougher laws to protect against terrorists - including the ability to detain people who could be dangerous - interior minister otto schily said .

3 , 2005 -rrb- schily wants more police capabilities the london attacks have sparked disagreement between state governors and interior minister schily on expanding police capabilities .

the german government has appealed to the mullahs in tehran to consider carefully the eu 's proposals . in a moment that the european union hoped would not come , iran has partially resumed sensitive nuclear fuel work at its isfahan nuclear facility .
the move came after the un 's nuclear watchdog iaea began installing surveillance equipment , and sent a clear signal that iran , at least for the moment , is not going to bow to the wishes of britain , france and germany , known as the eu-3 , to desist from its uranium conversion operations .
earlier monday , iaea officials had said the recommencement would not start until later in the week .
the crisis rose to a new level after iran last week rejected as " unacceptable " a package of proposals from the eu-3 aimed at securing guarantees that tehran 's nuclear program was not a cover for efforts to build a nuclear bomb .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many say iran 's new president mahmoud ahmadinejad is playing hardball with europe in addition to the rejection , ultraconservative iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , just five days in office , also turned heads by naming ali larijani as the country 's new atomic energy commissioner .
the western press refers to larijani as a hardliner .
larijani replaces hassan rowhani , who has managed to maintain dialogue with the west through thick and thin over the last two years , and his appointment will worry some western negotiators .
germany appeals to mullahs the reactions from berlin to the resumption of activity at isfahan were quick , sharp but also appellative .
german foreign minister joschka fischer urged iran monday to return to talks with the eu .
he said the eu-3 were doing everything in their power " to avert a negative development with disastrous consequences . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : talks between the eu and iran over the isfahan facility have come to an impasse " we hope iran will now examine the comprehensive proposal from the eu-3 very carefully and seriously .
we hope that iran does n't make any miscalculations here .
we are thoroughly convinced that the suggestion of the eu-3 provide a good foundation for further talks , " plötner said in berlin .
the social democratic deputy chair and foreign affairs expert , gernot erler , said the moves by iran constituted what he called " a step closer to a serious international crisis . "
erler said iran was close to being sanctioned .
that threat seems not to intimidate tehran .
iran has insisted on resuming the process at isfahan , which turns uranium ore into a feed gas for enrichment , despite the risk of being hauled before the un security council .
nine months for naught bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politics still must bow to the will of muslim leaders in iran .
here , president ahmadinejad when taking his oath of office the eu , which has been negotiating with iran for nine months , has called for an emergency meeting tuesday of the iaea board , which is expected to issue an ultimatum demanding a commitment to suspend nuclear fuel work .
yet escalation seems to be the game that tehran wants to play according to the german army 's iran expert , hans krech .
not only the reactivation of the isfahan facility indicates this but also the appointment of larijani , who has described giving up iran 's right to uranium enrichment in exchange for eu incentives as like swapping " a pearl for a sweet , " makes more difficult negotiations inevitable . dw staff / afp -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de crisis looms as iran rejects eu nuke offer iran on friday rejected a broad package of trade and technology incentives offered by the european union if it agreed to abandon all nuclear fuel work , risking an international crisis .

the german government has appealed to the mullahs in tehran to consider carefully the eu 's proposals . in a moment that the european union hoped would not come , iran has partially resumed sensitive nuclear fuel work at its isfahan nuclear facility .
the move came after the un 's nuclear watchdog iaea began installing surveillance equipment , and sent a clear signal that iran , at least for the moment , is not going to bow to the wishes of britain , france and germany , known as the eu-3 , to desist from its uranium conversion operations .
earlier monday , iaea officials had said the recommencement would not start until later in the week .
the crisis rose to a new level after iran last week rejected as " unacceptable " a package of proposals from the eu-3 aimed at securing guarantees that tehran 's nuclear program was not a cover for efforts to build a nuclear bomb .

the western press refers to larijani as a hardliner .
larijani replaces hassan rowhani , who has managed to maintain dialogue with the west through thick and thin over the last two years , and his appointment will worry some western negotiators .
germany appeals to mullahs the reactions from berlin to the resumption of activity at isfahan were quick , sharp but also appellative .
german foreign minister joschka fischer urged iran monday to return to talks with the eu .
he said the eu-3 were doing everything in their power " to avert a negative development with disastrous consequences . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : talks between the eu and iran over the isfahan facility have come to an impasse " we hope iran will now examine the comprehensive proposal from the eu-3 very carefully and seriously .
we hope that iran does n't make any miscalculations here .
we are thoroughly convinced that the suggestion of the eu-3 provide a good foundation for further talks , " plötner said in berlin .
the social democratic deputy chair and foreign affairs expert , gernot erler , said the moves by iran constituted what he called " a step closer to a serious international crisis . "
erler said iran was close to being sanctioned .
that threat seems not to intimidate tehran .
iran has insisted on resuming the process at isfahan , which turns uranium ore into a feed gas for enrichment , despite the risk of being hauled before the un security council .

that 's because schröder , who can not dissolve parliament himself , was forced to fake losing a confidence vote to trigger the early election one year before his second four-year term had ended .
that has led some disgruntled backbenchers of schröder 's own center-left coalition of social democrats and greens to petition the country 's highest court to stop the poll on the grounds the chancellor circumvented the constitution . i would tend to agree with the assessment that the confidence vote was less than kosher .

the present dire state germany finds itself in means politicians and the public are willing to let the blatantly faked confidence vote last month slide with a wink and nudge .
but unless the basic law is amended to avoid such a situation in the future , germany 's leaders will be tacitly legitimizing such political hocus pocus . and that would be far more damaging to germany 's democratic institutions than by giving the chancellor the power to dissolve parliament . marc young , dw-world send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de köhler gives go ahead for early elections german president horst köhler told his compatriots on thursday that he would dissolve parliament and called for federal elections on september 18 .

schröder and merkel much to the annoyance of their partners in government the greens , germany 's social democrats have begun discussing the possibility of a grand coalition with the conservative opposition . chancellor gerhard schröder and social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- chief franz müntefering have ruled it out .
many in the party , also fail to see the common ground .
but now there 's increasing talk by some ministers in the schröder administration that after expected general election on september 18 , the unthinkable may just become reality - a grand coalition with the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
a number of senior social democrats backtracked on previous statements and came out in support of the idea of a grand coalition - if everything else fails .
social democrat labor and economics minister wolfgang clement said it would be no sin to enter a grand coalition .
he called it a reasonable democratic option and one which could open up new opportunities to reform the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finance minister hans eichel has expressed he 's open to a grand coaltion speaking in the same vein , social democrat finance minister hans eichel insisted that a grand coalition was definitely not beyond his imagination .
he claimed that both the social democrats and the opposition conservatives had an interest in cutting the country 's gaping budget deficit and saw opportunities to cut obsolete state subsidies together .
interior minister otto schily has also joined the list , saying on german public television on monday that should the election end with the defeat of the current center-left coalition , then the party should n't " rule out the option of a grand coalition . "
criticism from coalition partner , left the odd-man out in the grand coalition constellation is naturally the spd 's current junior coalition partner , the green party .
greens ' co-chair krista sager told the berliner zeitung that a possible cdu-spd coalition was the " stupidest common denominator . "
she also said that she was n't surprised that some social democrats were " grasping for straws . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " fresh ideas " of the greens are turning sour under speculation of a possible grand coaltion the party 's other co-leader , reinhard bütikofer , attacked the utterances of the ministers , saying to the leipziger zeitung that they should then tell the voters how much they want to raise the vat , whether they want to implement an unfair health care system and whether german soldiers should be sent to iraq .
the speaker of the spd 's left-wing , michael müller , believes such talk is premature at this point of the campaign .
" i think that people like wolfgang clement and hans eichel should be a little more careful and restrained with regard to coalitions , " müller said .
polls point to grand coalition the resistance of the greens and some within the spd can not cover up the results from the most recent opinion polls .
the new socialist left party is gaining momentum , taking away votes from the spd .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the increasing popularity of the left party is throwing a monkey wrench in the plans of the mainstream parties also , german voters , at one time anxious for a new government , seem to be getting cold feet .
for the first time since february , the cdu and their potential partners form the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- no longer tallied more than 50 percent in opinion polls .
fdp chair guido westerwelle , who would like to avoid talk of grand coalition , is instead talking up his imagined worst-case scenario .
" the alternative to a cdu-fdp coalition is n't a grand coalition , " he told the tabloid bild , " but rather a leftist majority in the german parliament .

18 .
this week , marc young considers the constitutional controversy surrounding the poll . i may have lived in germany too long . how else can i explain going online during my recent holiday in sardinia to read up on the latest political happenings in berlin ? admittedly , i was n't constantly mulling the possible unconstitutionality of germany 's early general election as i was splashing about in the island 's emerald green seas or sleeping on a white sandy beach .
however , just the fact that i was checking up on gerhard schröder and angela merkel after quaffing down a tasty cappuccino clearly outs me as a teutonic political junky . fortunately , such predilections should serve me well in this new weekly column .
from the perspective of an informed outsider , i will aim to analyze and scrutinize what could be the most important german election campaign in a generation .
i encourage readers to use the feedback link at the bottom of each commentary to share their own thoughts on the topics i delve into . it wo n't be news to anyone who occasionally visits dw-world that germany is in the midst of a serious economic crisis .
whoever wins the election in september will have to tackle the county 's twin woes of high unemployment and sluggish growth .
but the next chancellor will also have to address a crisis of confidence affecting germany 's collective psyche . that is , if there even is an election . all major political parties and an overwhelming majority of the public support schröder 's decision to bring forward the general election by a year , but germany 's constitutional court could still put the brakes on a campaign that is now in full swing . circumventing the constitution ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's constitutional court in karlsruhe .
that 's because schröder , who can not dissolve parliament himself , was forced to fake losing a confidence vote to trigger the early election one year before his second four-year term had ended .
that has led some disgruntled backbenchers of schröder 's own center-left coalition of social democrats and greens to petition the country 's highest court to stop the poll on the grounds the chancellor circumvented the constitution . i would tend to agree with the assessment that the confidence vote was less than kosher .
however , i also think germany desperately needs to be shaken out of its current self-pitying , reform-fearing , navel-gazing malaise .
and the best way to do that is by going to the polls this fall .
the country ca n't afford to wait another year .
berlin would face certain political gridlock as schröder 's agenda would be stymied by the conservative opposition , which controls the upper house of parliament , and rebel leftwing mps in his own party . that still does n't completely eliminate all of the queasiness i feel about clearly disingenuous path taken toward an early election and is why the next government will also need to pursue an amendment to the constitution allowing the chancellor to dissolve parliament in future . stable democracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german flag flying next to the glass dome of the reichstag .
yes , germany 's post-war founding fathers had plenty of good reasons for making the dissolution of the bundestag a difficult affair .
germany 's basic law was written to prevent the political instability seen during the weimar republic that helped hitler come to power in 1933 .
but who can seriously argue today that modern germany is not a stable and mature democracy ? as far as representing the will of the voters , germany 's system of proportional representation is vastly superior to the first-past-post methods used by britain and many other countries .
but it is an anachronism that the chancellor does not have the power to dissolve parliament like the leaders of other parliamentary democracies . it is time for that to change .
the present dire state germany finds itself in means politicians and the public are willing to let the blatantly faked confidence vote last month slide with a wink and nudge .
but unless the basic law is amended to avoid such a situation in the future , germany 's leaders will be tacitly legitimizing such political hocus pocus . and that would be far more damaging to germany 's democratic institutions than by giving the chancellor the power to dissolve parliament . marc young , dw-world send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de köhler gives go ahead for early elections german president horst köhler told his compatriots on thursday that he would dissolve parliament and called for federal elections on september 18 .
-lrb- july 22 , 2005 -rrb- early german elections in legal limbo germany 's ruling coalition may have purposely lost a confidence vote to trigger early elections , but the country 's president or supreme court could yet kibosh the hopes of both politicians and the public for a new poll .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 08.08.2005 german youths fear future joblessness großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the lucky ones : german youths fear not having a job german teenagers , particularly those leaving school to go directly into the workforce , are preparing themselves for the worst .
a new nationwide study shows that youths have a " considerable fear " of the future . the release of unemployment figures by the german federal labor agency has become a monthly thorn in the side for the gerhard schröder 's administration .
the numbers are gloomy for those without a job .
in july , unemployment stood at 4.77 million , or 11.5 percent .
the dark job picture is now also casting its shadow on the youth of germany .
according to a study conducted by the bertelsmann foundation , over half of the teenagers asked said they were skeptical or downright pessimistic about their chances to find a job after graduating from school .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german trade union federation is resorting to more exotic events , such as this job parade on may 1 , to help youths find work " our study shows that teenagers in germany - particularly those in secondary schools -lrb- hauptschule -rrb- - have a considerable fear of the future in light of the miserable job market and the chronic shortage of training positions , " said foundation chairman prof. heribert meffert in a statement .
less education , greater anxiety it 's exactly those from secondary schools for those students not bound for university who feel that their chances of finding a job are poor .
in the study , more than four of every five asked responded that those aiming for their secondary school degree be at a disadvantage when looking for an apprenticeship or employment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal labor agency logo meffert sees a great danger in the developments .
high youth unemployment would be a threat to the nation 's economy because those teenagers who fail to find a job after completing school are in danger of becoming part of gernany 's long-term unemployed . that 's doubly dangerous : the state would have to pay them welfare benefits , plus they are not paying into the state 's coffers for social benefits .
in addition , the increasing number of retirees means the creation of a gap of some three million skilled laborers , technicians and craftsmen by the year 2015 .
the perceived fragile situation on the job market has created a sense of urgency amongst adolescents .
almost two-thirds of them say they are willing to invest more time for their professional futures - and rightfully so .
eighty-one percent answered that the highest hurdle in the landing of training position is a lack of such positions .
only 26 percent feel that their grades and performance at school are hindrance in finding work .
no time to panic as autumn approaches , the number of those still without a training position stands at 246,400 with only 76,500 available .
last week , the german trade union federation -lrb- dgb -rrb- accused employers of not keeping their word , namely that all youths could find a position .
according to the dgb 's ingrid sehrbock , the adolescents ' situation is getting worse each day .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economics and labor minister wolfgang clement georg braun , the president of the german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- , did not dispute the lack of positions but points out that 205,000 more apprenticeship contracts have been signed in the first seven months this year than last .
german labor minister wolfgang clement -lrb- photo -rrb- said for all sides to not yet panic .
the job training market is not very transparent .
many employers first register open apprenticeships with the local chamber of commerce , and then later with the labor agency , making it hard to judge just how many total number training positions are available .
it also varies extremely from region to region .
in munich , there is a surplus of apprenticeships .
that contrasts with the dire situation in the eastern part of the country .
on average , some 100 job-seekers are fighting for 37 apprenticeships in that economically depressed region .
with the poor prospects there , the fears of many german youths may turn out to be all too real . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de young germans prove big spenders germans have long been accused of being too prudent when it comes to spending .
but the same ca n't be said of the country 's children and teenagers who are displaying a huge appetite for buying clothes and accessories .
-lrb- june 21 , 2005 -rrb- the german fear of unemployment angst over the hovering specter of unemployment reached an all-time high last january as the number of unemployed climbed to over five million .
germany 's neighbors have similar problems , but the fear seems less severe .

a new nationwide study shows that youths have a " considerable fear " of the future . the release of unemployment figures by the german federal labor agency has become a monthly thorn in the side for the gerhard schröder 's administration .
the numbers are gloomy for those without a job .
in july , unemployment stood at 4.77 million , or 11.5 percent .
the dark job picture is now also casting its shadow on the youth of germany .
according to a study conducted by the bertelsmann foundation , over half of the teenagers asked said they were skeptical or downright pessimistic about their chances to find a job after graduating from school .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german trade union federation is resorting to more exotic events , such as this job parade on may 1 , to help youths find work " our study shows that teenagers in germany - particularly those in secondary schools -lrb- hauptschule -rrb- - have a considerable fear of the future in light of the miserable job market and the chronic shortage of training positions , " said foundation chairman prof. heribert meffert in a statement .
less education , greater anxiety it 's exactly those from secondary schools for those students not bound for university who feel that their chances of finding a job are poor .
in the study , more than four of every five asked responded that those aiming for their secondary school degree be at a disadvantage when looking for an apprenticeship or employment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal labor agency logo meffert sees a great danger in the developments .

in addition , the increasing number of retirees means the creation of a gap of some three million skilled laborers , technicians and craftsmen by the year 2015 .

it recounts the story of seven million people , who left germany in search of a better life . at the site where steamboats and sailing ships docked to take on emigrants in the 19th century , the new museum now offers visitors a chance to relive the beginning of these journeys into the unknown .
the center wants to serve both as a memorial and a place for people to relive the past .
officials for the public-private project hope that 170,000 people from both sides of the atlantic will come to visit each year . sabine süss , the museum 's director , recently took visitors on a preview tour of the building that includes displays built by movie set designers and prop masters that allow guests to feel like they 're really just about to board a ship . bildunterschrift : a set design of a ship at the museum " once you 've left the waiting hall , you end up on the pier here , " she said .

it was a strenuous trip , süss said . " we 're in a sailing ship now and these are the sleeping quarters , " she explained while touring a replica of a boat .
" this was also the room were people stayed during the day and throughout the entire journey that took 70 , 80 days .
it was extremely crowded and people did n't know each other and often did n't even speak the same language . " telling stories in the 19th century alone , 35 million europeans packed their bags in search of a better life abroad .

18 .
this week , marc young considers the constitutional controversy surrounding the poll . i may have lived in germany too long . how else can i explain going online during my recent holiday in sardinia to read up on the latest political happenings in berlin ? admittedly , i was n't constantly mulling the possible unconstitutionality of germany 's early general election as i was splashing about in the island 's emerald green seas or sleeping on a white sandy beach .
however , just the fact that i was checking up on gerhard schröder and angela merkel after quaffing down a tasty cappuccino clearly outs me as a teutonic political junky . fortunately , such predilections should serve me well in this new weekly column .
from the perspective of an informed outsider , i will aim to analyze and scrutinize what could be the most important german election campaign in a generation .
i encourage readers to use the feedback link at the bottom of each commentary to share their own thoughts on the topics i delve into . it wo n't be news to anyone who occasionally visits dw-world that germany is in the midst of a serious economic crisis .
whoever wins the election in september will have to tackle the county 's twin woes of high unemployment and sluggish growth .
but the next chancellor will also have to address a crisis of confidence affecting germany 's collective psyche . that is , if there even is an election . all major political parties and an overwhelming majority of the public support schröder 's decision to bring forward the general election by a year , but germany 's constitutional court could still put the brakes on a campaign that is now in full swing . circumventing the constitution ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's constitutional court in karlsruhe .
that 's because schröder , who can not dissolve parliament himself , was forced to fake losing a confidence vote to trigger the early election one year before his second four-year term had ended .
that has led some disgruntled backbenchers of schröder 's own center-left coalition of social democrats and greens to petition the country 's highest court to stop the poll on the grounds the chancellor circumvented the constitution . i would tend to agree with the assessment that the confidence vote was less than kosher .
however , i also think germany desperately needs to be shaken out of its current self-pitying , reform-fearing , navel-gazing malaise .
and the best way to do that is by going to the polls this fall .
the country ca n't afford to wait another year .
berlin would face certain political gridlock as schröder 's agenda would be stymied by the conservative opposition , which controls the upper house of parliament , and rebel leftwing mps in his own party . that still does n't completely eliminate all of the queasiness i feel about clearly disingenuous path taken toward an early election and is why the next government will also need to pursue an amendment to the constitution allowing the chancellor to dissolve parliament in future . stable democracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german flag flying next to the glass dome of the reichstag .
yes , germany 's post-war founding fathers had plenty of good reasons for making the dissolution of the bundestag a difficult affair .
germany 's basic law was written to prevent the political instability seen during the weimar republic that helped hitler come to power in 1933 .
but who can seriously argue today that modern germany is not a stable and mature democracy ? as far as representing the will of the voters , germany 's system of proportional representation is vastly superior to the first-past-post methods used by britain and many other countries .
but it is an anachronism that the chancellor does not have the power to dissolve parliament like the leaders of other parliamentary democracies . it is time for that to change .
the present dire state germany finds itself in means politicians and the public are willing to let the blatantly faked confidence vote last month slide with a wink and nudge .
but unless the basic law is amended to avoid such a situation in the future , germany 's leaders will be tacitly legitimizing such political hocus pocus . and that would be far more damaging to germany 's democratic institutions than by giving the chancellor the power to dissolve parliament . marc young , dw-world send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de köhler gives go ahead for early elections german president horst köhler told his compatriots on thursday that he would dissolve parliament and called for federal elections on september 18 .
-lrb- july 22 , 2005 -rrb- early german elections in legal limbo germany 's ruling coalition may have purposely lost a confidence vote to trigger early elections , but the country 's president or supreme court could yet kibosh the hopes of both politicians and the public for a new poll .
-lrb- july 7 , 2005 -rrb- schröder loses confidence vote with an impassive face , german chancellor gerhard schröder received the news that the vote of confidence in the bundestag ended just as he hoped - in failure .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 08.08.2005 reliving the german emigration experience großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the center recounts journeys to the new world billed europe 's largest theme museum , the new german emigration center opens in the northern port town of bremerhaven monday .
it recounts the story of seven million people , who left germany in search of a better life . at the site where steamboats and sailing ships docked to take on emigrants in the 19th century , the new museum now offers visitors a chance to relive the beginning of these journeys into the unknown .
the center wants to serve both as a memorial and a place for people to relive the past .
officials for the public-private project hope that 170,000 people from both sides of the atlantic will come to visit each year . sabine süss , the museum 's director , recently took visitors on a preview tour of the building that includes displays built by movie set designers and prop masters that allow guests to feel like they 're really just about to board a ship . bildunterschrift : a set design of a ship at the museum " once you 've left the waiting hall , you end up on the pier here , " she said .
" the year 's 1880 .
you 're standing in front of a huge side of a ship , which sits in a basin .
there are boxes everywhere , you see luggage and really start to feel like you 're getting ready to emigrate . " süss is thrilled with the work of the film professionals , who have recreated the scenes in the 20 million-euro -lrb- $ 24.6-million -rrb- building .
there 's a gangway that moves when visitors walk on it , giving them at least an idea of what it must have been like . mixed feelings helga von schweinitz left germany for the united states on the ship " italia " in 1957 in search for a job . " it was a mixture of excitement about the unknown and a fear of leaving everything behind , " she said .
" my father was standing on the pier and kept waving and waving and i saw that he was crying .
i was torn , but the thrill kept me going . " bildunterschrift : emigration scenes adorn the wall of the center while von schweinitz left on a modern ocean liner , emigrants still traveled on sailing ships a century earlier .
it was a strenuous trip , süss said . " we 're in a sailing ship now and these are the sleeping quarters , " she explained while touring a replica of a boat .
" this was also the room were people stayed during the day and throughout the entire journey that took 70 , 80 days .
it was extremely crowded and people did n't know each other and often did n't even speak the same language . " telling stories in the 19th century alone , 35 million europeans packed their bags in search of a better life abroad .
in bremerhaven , 15 of these life stories are recounted to serve as guides for visitors . they help to explain motives for leaving - many did n't emigrate voluntarily , as the example of a young jewish doctor shows , who fled germany for america , but could never work in her profession again . bildunterschrift : interactive displays at the museum interactive displays also give people a chance to search for their own relatives who emigrated or simply scroll through passenger lists . one name that comes up on the lists is volker schmeissner .
as a 26-year-old student from tübingen in southwestern germany .
he left for the united states in 1961 . bildunterschrift : view of the center at night " this was the last bit of germany i saw , " he said .
" it was a memory that stayed .
i keep getting asked where my roots are and were i can go to find them documented .

the german government has appealed to the mullahs in tehran to consider carefully the eu 's proposals . in a moment that the european union hoped would not come , iran has partially resumed sensitive nuclear fuel work at its isfahan nuclear facility .
the move came after the un 's nuclear watchdog iaea began installing surveillance equipment , and sent a clear signal that iran , at least for the moment , is not going to bow to the wishes of britain , france and germany , known as the eu-3 , to desist from its uranium conversion operations .
earlier monday , iaea officials had said the recommencement would not start until later in the week .
the crisis rose to a new level after iran last week rejected as " unacceptable " a package of proposals from the eu-3 aimed at securing guarantees that tehran 's nuclear program was not a cover for efforts to build a nuclear bomb .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many say iran 's new president mahmoud ahmadinejad is playing hardball with europe in addition to the rejection , ultraconservative iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , just five days in office , also turned heads by naming ali larijani as the country 's new atomic energy commissioner .
the western press refers to larijani as a hardliner .
larijani replaces hassan rowhani , who has managed to maintain dialogue with the west through thick and thin over the last two years , and his appointment will worry some western negotiators .
germany appeals to mullahs the reactions from berlin to the resumption of activity at isfahan were quick , sharp but also appellative .
german foreign minister joschka fischer urged iran monday to return to talks with the eu .
he said the eu-3 were doing everything in their power " to avert a negative development with disastrous consequences . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : talks between the eu and iran over the isfahan facility have come to an impasse " we hope iran will now examine the comprehensive proposal from the eu-3 very carefully and seriously .
we hope that iran does n't make any miscalculations here .
we are thoroughly convinced that the suggestion of the eu-3 provide a good foundation for further talks , " plötner said in berlin .
the social democratic deputy chair and foreign affairs expert , gernot erler , said the moves by iran constituted what he called " a step closer to a serious international crisis . "
erler said iran was close to being sanctioned .
that threat seems not to intimidate tehran .
iran has insisted on resuming the process at isfahan , which turns uranium ore into a feed gas for enrichment , despite the risk of being hauled before the un security council .
nine months for naught bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politics still must bow to the will of muslim leaders in iran .
here , president ahmadinejad when taking his oath of office the eu , which has been negotiating with iran for nine months , has called for an emergency meeting tuesday of the iaea board , which is expected to issue an ultimatum demanding a commitment to suspend nuclear fuel work .
yet escalation seems to be the game that tehran wants to play according to the german army 's iran expert , hans krech .
not only the reactivation of the isfahan facility indicates this but also the appointment of larijani , who has described giving up iran 's right to uranium enrichment in exchange for eu incentives as like swapping " a pearl for a sweet , " makes more difficult negotiations inevitable . dw staff / afp -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de crisis looms as iran rejects eu nuke offer iran on friday rejected a broad package of trade and technology incentives offered by the european union if it agreed to abandon all nuclear fuel work , risking an international crisis .

the german government has appealed to the mullahs in tehran to consider carefully the eu 's proposals . in a moment that the european union hoped would not come , iran has partially resumed sensitive nuclear fuel work at its isfahan nuclear facility .
the move came after the un 's nuclear watchdog iaea began installing surveillance equipment , and sent a clear signal that iran , at least for the moment , is not going to bow to the wishes of britain , france and germany , known as the eu-3 , to desist from its uranium conversion operations .
earlier monday , iaea officials had said the recommencement would not start until later in the week .

springer is expected to pay out the outstanding preferred shareholders at 14.10 euros per share in cash , which is below the current market price . springer management confident despite the reservations of media representatives , watchdogs and analysts , the springer management is confident that the announced takeover will go smoothly .

" " springer should n't rejoice too soon .
i am positive that the antitrust authorities will closely inspect the merger , " said stiegler . the italian syndrome monika griefahn -lrb- spd -rrb- , president of the parliamentary committee on culture and media , expressed her concern for the future of media diversity in germany .
as a counter-measure to the homogenization of media power , griefahn is advocating the creation of advisory boards under public law that would accompany commercial radio and tv stations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : monika griefahn is advocating public control of private media companies " above all , we should avoid developing relationships similar to those in italy , " griefahn said , referring to the much criticized concentration of power of information under the umbrella of prime minister silvio berlusconi 's media empire . representatives of other german media groups were equally concerned .
michael grabner , vice-president of holtzbrinck publishing group from stuttgart and publisher of such widely circulated german newspapers as die zeit and handelsblatt , stressed that the springer - prosiebensat.1 merger would create " a great media power not only in the field of journalism , but also on the advertising market . " antitrust claims holtzbrinck is planning to take a firm stand on the takeover issue before the german antitrust authorities .
according to german law , any company that has an economic interest in a merger being under investigation may approach the antitrust authorities to present their point of view .
by doing so , they also gain access to the records of the given case as well as the right to appeal against the decision of the antitrust authority before the courts . when holtzbrinck announced its intention to purchase the berlin-based newspapers berliner zeitung and kurier in 2004 , the antitrust authority did not give its go-ahead out of fear of creating a press monopoly in the german capital . " we expect the same standards to be applied to springer , " grabner said . a thorough investigation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : springer publishing is diversifying in oder to catch up with bertelsmann ulf vöge , president of the german governmental antitrust body , said that the potential effects of the announced merger on the media market would be thoroughly investigated , taking into consideration the cross-medial integration of print and television , which has no precedent in germany . analysts with the german westlb bank changed their recommendations for prosiebensat.1 shares from " outperform " to " neutral , " citing uncertain exchange value for the stockholders of prosiebensat.1 preferred shares , unattractive cash compensation and lack of estimates for the potential of the company after the merger .
springer is expected to pay out the outstanding preferred shareholders at 14.10 euros per share in cash , which is below the current market price . springer management confident despite the reservations of media representatives , watchdogs and analysts , the springer management is confident that the announced takeover will go smoothly . " we are certain that we have good arguments for dispelling all concerns , " said a spokesperson for springer on sunday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friede springer : trying to preserve her husband 's legacy friede springer , majority owner of the publishing group , denied claims that the merger was meant to create an opinion-bending powerhouse . " i am only thinking about securing the future of my husband 's publishing company , " she said . " to do that , we need a second leg to stand on , " she said . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinions split on springer-prosieben deal the possible merger of german publishing giant axel springer with broadcaster prosiebensat.1 has caused mixed reactions with some praising the move and others fearing a media monopoly .

the german government has appealed to the mullahs in tehran to consider carefully the eu 's proposals . in a moment that the european union hoped would not come , iran has partially resumed sensitive nuclear fuel work at its isfahan nuclear facility .
the move came after the un 's nuclear watchdog iaea began installing surveillance equipment , and sent a clear signal that iran , at least for the moment , is not going to bow to the wishes of britain , france and germany , known as the eu-3 , to desist from its uranium conversion operations .
earlier monday , iaea officials had said the recommencement would not start until later in the week .
the crisis rose to a new level after iran last week rejected as " unacceptable " a package of proposals from the eu-3 aimed at securing guarantees that tehran 's nuclear program was not a cover for efforts to build a nuclear bomb .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many say iran 's new president mahmoud ahmadinejad is playing hardball with europe in addition to the rejection , ultraconservative iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , just five days in office , also turned heads by naming ali larijani as the country 's new atomic energy commissioner .
the western press refers to larijani as a hardliner .
larijani replaces hassan rowhani , who has managed to maintain dialogue with the west through thick and thin over the last two years , and his appointment will worry some western negotiators .
germany appeals to mullahs the reactions from berlin to the resumption of activity at isfahan were quick , sharp but also appellative .
german foreign minister joschka fischer urged iran monday to return to talks with the eu .
he said the eu-3 were doing everything in their power " to avert a negative development with disastrous consequences . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : talks between the eu and iran over the isfahan facility have come to an impasse " we hope iran will now examine the comprehensive proposal from the eu-3 very carefully and seriously .
we hope that iran does n't make any miscalculations here .
we are thoroughly convinced that the suggestion of the eu-3 provide a good foundation for further talks , " plötner said in berlin .
the social democratic deputy chair and foreign affairs expert , gernot erler , said the moves by iran constituted what he called " a step closer to a serious international crisis . "
erler said iran was close to being sanctioned .
that threat seems not to intimidate tehran .
iran has insisted on resuming the process at isfahan , which turns uranium ore into a feed gas for enrichment , despite the risk of being hauled before the un security council .
nine months for naught bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politics still must bow to the will of muslim leaders in iran .
here , president ahmadinejad when taking his oath of office the eu , which has been negotiating with iran for nine months , has called for an emergency meeting tuesday of the iaea board , which is expected to issue an ultimatum demanding a commitment to suspend nuclear fuel work .
yet escalation seems to be the game that tehran wants to play according to the german army 's iran expert , hans krech .
not only the reactivation of the isfahan facility indicates this but also the appointment of larijani , who has described giving up iran 's right to uranium enrichment in exchange for eu incentives as like swapping " a pearl for a sweet , " makes more difficult negotiations inevitable . dw staff / afp -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de crisis looms as iran rejects eu nuke offer iran on friday rejected a broad package of trade and technology incentives offered by the european union if it agreed to abandon all nuclear fuel work , risking an international crisis .

" " springer should n't rejoice too soon .
i am positive that the antitrust authorities will closely inspect the merger , " said stiegler . the italian syndrome monika griefahn -lrb- spd -rrb- , president of the parliamentary committee on culture and media , expressed her concern for the future of media diversity in germany .
as a counter-measure to the homogenization of media power , griefahn is advocating the creation of advisory boards under public law that would accompany commercial radio and tv stations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : monika griefahn is advocating public control of private media companies " above all , we should avoid developing relationships similar to those in italy , " griefahn said , referring to the much criticized concentration of power of information under the umbrella of prime minister silvio berlusconi 's media empire . representatives of other german media groups were equally concerned .
michael grabner , vice-president of holtzbrinck publishing group from stuttgart and publisher of such widely circulated german newspapers as die zeit and handelsblatt , stressed that the springer - prosiebensat.1 merger would create " a great media power not only in the field of journalism , but also on the advertising market . " antitrust claims holtzbrinck is planning to take a firm stand on the takeover issue before the german antitrust authorities .
according to german law , any company that has an economic interest in a merger being under investigation may approach the antitrust authorities to present their point of view .
by doing so , they also gain access to the records of the given case as well as the right to appeal against the decision of the antitrust authority before the courts . when holtzbrinck announced its intention to purchase the berlin-based newspapers berliner zeitung and kurier in 2004 , the antitrust authority did not give its go-ahead out of fear of creating a press monopoly in the german capital . " we expect the same standards to be applied to springer , " grabner said . a thorough investigation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : springer publishing is diversifying in oder to catch up with bertelsmann ulf vöge , president of the german governmental antitrust body , said that the potential effects of the announced merger on the media market would be thoroughly investigated , taking into consideration the cross-medial integration of print and television , which has no precedent in germany . analysts with the german westlb bank changed their recommendations for prosiebensat.1 shares from " outperform " to " neutral , " citing uncertain exchange value for the stockholders of prosiebensat.1 preferred shares , unattractive cash compensation and lack of estimates for the potential of the company after the merger .
springer is expected to pay out the outstanding preferred shareholders at 14.10 euros per share in cash , which is below the current market price . springer management confident despite the reservations of media representatives , watchdogs and analysts , the springer management is confident that the announced takeover will go smoothly . " we are certain that we have good arguments for dispelling all concerns , " said a spokesperson for springer on sunday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friede springer : trying to preserve her husband 's legacy friede springer , majority owner of the publishing group , denied claims that the merger was meant to create an opinion-bending powerhouse . " i am only thinking about securing the future of my husband 's publishing company , " she said . " to do that , we need a second leg to stand on , " she said . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinions split on springer-prosieben deal the possible merger of german publishing giant axel springer with broadcaster prosiebensat.1 has caused mixed reactions with some praising the move and others fearing a media monopoly .

the german government has appealed to the mullahs in tehran to consider carefully the eu 's proposals . in a moment that the european union hoped would not come , iran has partially resumed sensitive nuclear fuel work at its isfahan nuclear facility .
the move came after the un 's nuclear watchdog iaea began installing surveillance equipment , and sent a clear signal that iran , at least for the moment , is not going to bow to the wishes of britain , france and germany , known as the eu-3 , to desist from its uranium conversion operations .
earlier monday , iaea officials had said the recommencement would not start until later in the week .
the crisis rose to a new level after iran last week rejected as " unacceptable " a package of proposals from the eu-3 aimed at securing guarantees that tehran 's nuclear program was not a cover for efforts to build a nuclear bomb .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many say iran 's new president mahmoud ahmadinejad is playing hardball with europe in addition to the rejection , ultraconservative iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , just five days in office , also turned heads by naming ali larijani as the country 's new atomic energy commissioner .
the western press refers to larijani as a hardliner .
larijani replaces hassan rowhani , who has managed to maintain dialogue with the west through thick and thin over the last two years , and his appointment will worry some western negotiators .
germany appeals to mullahs the reactions from berlin to the resumption of activity at isfahan were quick , sharp but also appellative .
german foreign minister joschka fischer urged iran monday to return to talks with the eu .
he said the eu-3 were doing everything in their power " to avert a negative development with disastrous consequences . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : talks between the eu and iran over the isfahan facility have come to an impasse " we hope iran will now examine the comprehensive proposal from the eu-3 very carefully and seriously .
we hope that iran does n't make any miscalculations here .
we are thoroughly convinced that the suggestion of the eu-3 provide a good foundation for further talks , " plötner said in berlin .
the social democratic deputy chair and foreign affairs expert , gernot erler , said the moves by iran constituted what he called " a step closer to a serious international crisis . "
erler said iran was close to being sanctioned .
that threat seems not to intimidate tehran .
iran has insisted on resuming the process at isfahan , which turns uranium ore into a feed gas for enrichment , despite the risk of being hauled before the un security council .
nine months for naught bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politics still must bow to the will of muslim leaders in iran .
here , president ahmadinejad when taking his oath of office the eu , which has been negotiating with iran for nine months , has called for an emergency meeting tuesday of the iaea board , which is expected to issue an ultimatum demanding a commitment to suspend nuclear fuel work .
yet escalation seems to be the game that tehran wants to play according to the german army 's iran expert , hans krech .
not only the reactivation of the isfahan facility indicates this but also the appointment of larijani , who has described giving up iran 's right to uranium enrichment in exchange for eu incentives as like swapping " a pearl for a sweet , " makes more difficult negotiations inevitable . dw staff / afp -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de crisis looms as iran rejects eu nuke offer iran on friday rejected a broad package of trade and technology incentives offered by the european union if it agreed to abandon all nuclear fuel work , risking an international crisis .

if the constitution needs to be changed to furnish the office with wider powers then let ’ s go for it . " he says .

" " springer should n't rejoice too soon .
i am positive that the antitrust authorities will closely inspect the merger , " said stiegler . the italian syndrome monika griefahn -lrb- spd -rrb- , president of the parliamentary committee on culture and media , expressed her concern for the future of media diversity in germany .
as a counter-measure to the homogenization of media power , griefahn is advocating the creation of advisory boards under public law that would accompany commercial radio and tv stations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : monika griefahn is advocating public control of private media companies " above all , we should avoid developing relationships similar to those in italy , " griefahn said , referring to the much criticized concentration of power of information under the umbrella of prime minister silvio berlusconi 's media empire . representatives of other german media groups were equally concerned .
michael grabner , vice-president of holtzbrinck publishing group from stuttgart and publisher of such widely circulated german newspapers as die zeit and handelsblatt , stressed that the springer - prosiebensat.1 merger would create " a great media power not only in the field of journalism , but also on the advertising market . " antitrust claims holtzbrinck is planning to take a firm stand on the takeover issue before the german antitrust authorities .
according to german law , any company that has an economic interest in a merger being under investigation may approach the antitrust authorities to present their point of view .
by doing so , they also gain access to the records of the given case as well as the right to appeal against the decision of the antitrust authority before the courts . when holtzbrinck announced its intention to purchase the berlin-based newspapers berliner zeitung and kurier in 2004 , the antitrust authority did not give its go-ahead out of fear of creating a press monopoly in the german capital . " we expect the same standards to be applied to springer , " grabner said . a thorough investigation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : springer publishing is diversifying in oder to catch up with bertelsmann ulf vöge , president of the german governmental antitrust body , said that the potential effects of the announced merger on the media market would be thoroughly investigated , taking into consideration the cross-medial integration of print and television , which has no precedent in germany . analysts with the german westlb bank changed their recommendations for prosiebensat.1 shares from " outperform " to " neutral , " citing uncertain exchange value for the stockholders of prosiebensat.1 preferred shares , unattractive cash compensation and lack of estimates for the potential of the company after the merger .
springer is expected to pay out the outstanding preferred shareholders at 14.10 euros per share in cash , which is below the current market price . springer management confident despite the reservations of media representatives , watchdogs and analysts , the springer management is confident that the announced takeover will go smoothly . " we are certain that we have good arguments for dispelling all concerns , " said a spokesperson for springer on sunday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friede springer : trying to preserve her husband 's legacy friede springer , majority owner of the publishing group , denied claims that the merger was meant to create an opinion-bending powerhouse .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 08.08.2005 german youths fear future joblessness großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the lucky ones : german youths fear not having a job german teenagers , particularly those leaving school to go directly into the workforce , are preparing themselves for the worst .
a new nationwide study shows that youths have a " considerable fear " of the future . the release of unemployment figures by the german federal labor agency has become a monthly thorn in the side for the gerhard schröder 's administration .
the numbers are gloomy for those without a job .
in july , unemployment stood at 4.77 million , or 11.5 percent .
the dark job picture is now also casting its shadow on the youth of germany .
according to a study conducted by the bertelsmann foundation , over half of the teenagers asked said they were skeptical or downright pessimistic about their chances to find a job after graduating from school .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german trade union federation is resorting to more exotic events , such as this job parade on may 1 , to help youths find work " our study shows that teenagers in germany - particularly those in secondary schools -lrb- hauptschule -rrb- - have a considerable fear of the future in light of the miserable job market and the chronic shortage of training positions , " said foundation chairman prof. heribert meffert in a statement .
less education , greater anxiety it 's exactly those from secondary schools for those students not bound for university who feel that their chances of finding a job are poor .
in the study , more than four of every five asked responded that those aiming for their secondary school degree be at a disadvantage when looking for an apprenticeship or employment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal labor agency logo meffert sees a great danger in the developments .
high youth unemployment would be a threat to the nation 's economy because those teenagers who fail to find a job after completing school are in danger of becoming part of gernany 's long-term unemployed . that 's doubly dangerous : the state would have to pay them welfare benefits , plus they are not paying into the state 's coffers for social benefits .
in addition , the increasing number of retirees means the creation of a gap of some three million skilled laborers , technicians and craftsmen by the year 2015 .
the perceived fragile situation on the job market has created a sense of urgency amongst adolescents .
almost two-thirds of them say they are willing to invest more time for their professional futures - and rightfully so .
eighty-one percent answered that the highest hurdle in the landing of training position is a lack of such positions .
only 26 percent feel that their grades and performance at school are hindrance in finding work .
no time to panic as autumn approaches , the number of those still without a training position stands at 246,400 with only 76,500 available .
last week , the german trade union federation -lrb- dgb -rrb- accused employers of not keeping their word , namely that all youths could find a position .
according to the dgb 's ingrid sehrbock , the adolescents ' situation is getting worse each day .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economics and labor minister wolfgang clement georg braun , the president of the german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- , did not dispute the lack of positions but points out that 205,000 more apprenticeship contracts have been signed in the first seven months this year than last .
german labor minister wolfgang clement -lrb- photo -rrb- said for all sides to not yet panic .
the job training market is not very transparent .
many employers first register open apprenticeships with the local chamber of commerce , and then later with the labor agency , making it hard to judge just how many total number training positions are available .
it also varies extremely from region to region .
in munich , there is a surplus of apprenticeships .
that contrasts with the dire situation in the eastern part of the country .
on average , some 100 job-seekers are fighting for 37 apprenticeships in that economically depressed region .
with the poor prospects there , the fears of many german youths may turn out to be all too real . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de young germans prove big spenders germans have long been accused of being too prudent when it comes to spending .
but the same ca n't be said of the country 's children and teenagers who are displaying a huge appetite for buying clothes and accessories .
-lrb- june 21 , 2005 -rrb- the german fear of unemployment angst over the hovering specter of unemployment reached an all-time high last january as the number of unemployed climbed to over five million .

schröder and merkel much to the annoyance of their partners in government the greens , germany 's social democrats have begun discussing the possibility of a grand coalition with the conservative opposition . chancellor gerhard schröder and social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- chief franz müntefering have ruled it out .
many in the party , also fail to see the common ground .
but now there 's increasing talk by some ministers in the schröder administration that after expected general election on september 18 , the unthinkable may just become reality - a grand coalition with the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
a number of senior social democrats backtracked on previous statements and came out in support of the idea of a grand coalition - if everything else fails .
social democrat labor and economics minister wolfgang clement said it would be no sin to enter a grand coalition .
he called it a reasonable democratic option and one which could open up new opportunities to reform the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finance minister hans eichel has expressed he 's open to a grand coaltion speaking in the same vein , social democrat finance minister hans eichel insisted that a grand coalition was definitely not beyond his imagination .
he claimed that both the social democrats and the opposition conservatives had an interest in cutting the country 's gaping budget deficit and saw opportunities to cut obsolete state subsidies together .
interior minister otto schily has also joined the list , saying on german public television on monday that should the election end with the defeat of the current center-left coalition , then the party should n't " rule out the option of a grand coalition . "
criticism from coalition partner , left the odd-man out in the grand coalition constellation is naturally the spd 's current junior coalition partner , the green party .
greens ' co-chair krista sager told the berliner zeitung that a possible cdu-spd coalition was the " stupidest common denominator . "
she also said that she was n't surprised that some social democrats were " grasping for straws . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " fresh ideas " of the greens are turning sour under speculation of a possible grand coaltion the party 's other co-leader , reinhard bütikofer , attacked the utterances of the ministers , saying to the leipziger zeitung that they should then tell the voters how much they want to raise the vat , whether they want to implement an unfair health care system and whether german soldiers should be sent to iraq .
the speaker of the spd 's left-wing , michael müller , believes such talk is premature at this point of the campaign .
" i think that people like wolfgang clement and hans eichel should be a little more careful and restrained with regard to coalitions , " müller said .
polls point to grand coalition the resistance of the greens and some within the spd can not cover up the results from the most recent opinion polls .
the new socialist left party is gaining momentum , taking away votes from the spd .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the increasing popularity of the left party is throwing a monkey wrench in the plans of the mainstream parties also , german voters , at one time anxious for a new government , seem to be getting cold feet .
for the first time since february , the cdu and their potential partners form the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- no longer tallied more than 50 percent in opinion polls .
fdp chair guido westerwelle , who would like to avoid talk of grand coalition , is instead talking up his imagined worst-case scenario .
" the alternative to a cdu-fdp coalition is n't a grand coalition , " he told the tabloid bild , " but rather a leftist majority in the german parliament . " dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cdu / spd coalition bad news for economy economists assessing the possibility of a grand coalition of the spd and cdu in german government after the september election are concerned that such a coupling could spell more trouble for the economy .
-lrb- july 27 , 2005 -rrb- hot air or higher prices ?

18 .
this week , marc young considers the constitutional controversy surrounding the poll . i may have lived in germany too long . how else can i explain going online during my recent holiday in sardinia to read up on the latest political happenings in berlin ? admittedly , i was n't constantly mulling the possible unconstitutionality of germany 's early general election as i was splashing about in the island 's emerald green seas or sleeping on a white sandy beach .
however , just the fact that i was checking up on gerhard schröder and angela merkel after quaffing down a tasty cappuccino clearly outs me as a teutonic political junky . fortunately , such predilections should serve me well in this new weekly column .
from the perspective of an informed outsider , i will aim to analyze and scrutinize what could be the most important german election campaign in a generation .
i encourage readers to use the feedback link at the bottom of each commentary to share their own thoughts on the topics i delve into . it wo n't be news to anyone who occasionally visits dw-world that germany is in the midst of a serious economic crisis .
whoever wins the election in september will have to tackle the county 's twin woes of high unemployment and sluggish growth .
but the next chancellor will also have to address a crisis of confidence affecting germany 's collective psyche . that is , if there even is an election . all major political parties and an overwhelming majority of the public support schröder 's decision to bring forward the general election by a year , but germany 's constitutional court could still put the brakes on a campaign that is now in full swing . circumventing the constitution ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's constitutional court in karlsruhe .
that 's because schröder , who can not dissolve parliament himself , was forced to fake losing a confidence vote to trigger the early election one year before his second four-year term had ended .
that has led some disgruntled backbenchers of schröder 's own center-left coalition of social democrats and greens to petition the country 's highest court to stop the poll on the grounds the chancellor circumvented the constitution . i would tend to agree with the assessment that the confidence vote was less than kosher .
however , i also think germany desperately needs to be shaken out of its current self-pitying , reform-fearing , navel-gazing malaise .
and the best way to do that is by going to the polls this fall .
the country ca n't afford to wait another year .
berlin would face certain political gridlock as schröder 's agenda would be stymied by the conservative opposition , which controls the upper house of parliament , and rebel leftwing mps in his own party . that still does n't completely eliminate all of the queasiness i feel about clearly disingenuous path taken toward an early election and is why the next government will also need to pursue an amendment to the constitution allowing the chancellor to dissolve parliament in future . stable democracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german flag flying next to the glass dome of the reichstag .
yes , germany 's post-war founding fathers had plenty of good reasons for making the dissolution of the bundestag a difficult affair .
germany 's basic law was written to prevent the political instability seen during the weimar republic that helped hitler come to power in 1933 .
but who can seriously argue today that modern germany is not a stable and mature democracy ? as far as representing the will of the voters , germany 's system of proportional representation is vastly superior to the first-past-post methods used by britain and many other countries .
but it is an anachronism that the chancellor does not have the power to dissolve parliament like the leaders of other parliamentary democracies . it is time for that to change .
the present dire state germany finds itself in means politicians and the public are willing to let the blatantly faked confidence vote last month slide with a wink and nudge .
but unless the basic law is amended to avoid such a situation in the future , germany 's leaders will be tacitly legitimizing such political hocus pocus . and that would be far more damaging to germany 's democratic institutions than by giving the chancellor the power to dissolve parliament . marc young , dw-world send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de köhler gives go ahead for early elections german president horst köhler told his compatriots on thursday that he would dissolve parliament and called for federal elections on september 18 .

the german government has appealed to the mullahs in tehran to consider carefully the eu 's proposals . in a moment that the european union hoped would not come , iran has partially resumed sensitive nuclear fuel work at its isfahan nuclear facility .
the move came after the un 's nuclear watchdog iaea began installing surveillance equipment , and sent a clear signal that iran , at least for the moment , is not going to bow to the wishes of britain , france and germany , known as the eu-3 , to desist from its uranium conversion operations .
earlier monday , iaea officials had said the recommencement would not start until later in the week .
the crisis rose to a new level after iran last week rejected as " unacceptable " a package of proposals from the eu-3 aimed at securing guarantees that tehran 's nuclear program was not a cover for efforts to build a nuclear bomb .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many say iran 's new president mahmoud ahmadinejad is playing hardball with europe in addition to the rejection , ultraconservative iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , just five days in office , also turned heads by naming ali larijani as the country 's new atomic energy commissioner .
the western press refers to larijani as a hardliner .
larijani replaces hassan rowhani , who has managed to maintain dialogue with the west through thick and thin over the last two years , and his appointment will worry some western negotiators .
germany appeals to mullahs the reactions from berlin to the resumption of activity at isfahan were quick , sharp but also appellative .
german foreign minister joschka fischer urged iran monday to return to talks with the eu .
he said the eu-3 were doing everything in their power " to avert a negative development with disastrous consequences . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : talks between the eu and iran over the isfahan facility have come to an impasse " we hope iran will now examine the comprehensive proposal from the eu-3 very carefully and seriously .
we hope that iran does n't make any miscalculations here .
we are thoroughly convinced that the suggestion of the eu-3 provide a good foundation for further talks , " plötner said in berlin .
the social democratic deputy chair and foreign affairs expert , gernot erler , said the moves by iran constituted what he called " a step closer to a serious international crisis . "
erler said iran was close to being sanctioned .
that threat seems not to intimidate tehran .
iran has insisted on resuming the process at isfahan , which turns uranium ore into a feed gas for enrichment , despite the risk of being hauled before the un security council .
nine months for naught bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politics still must bow to the will of muslim leaders in iran .
here , president ahmadinejad when taking his oath of office the eu , which has been negotiating with iran for nine months , has called for an emergency meeting tuesday of the iaea board , which is expected to issue an ultimatum demanding a commitment to suspend nuclear fuel work .
yet escalation seems to be the game that tehran wants to play according to the german army 's iran expert , hans krech .
not only the reactivation of the isfahan facility indicates this but also the appointment of larijani , who has described giving up iran 's right to uranium enrichment in exchange for eu incentives as like swapping " a pearl for a sweet , " makes more difficult negotiations inevitable . dw staff / afp -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de crisis looms as iran rejects eu nuke offer iran on friday rejected a broad package of trade and technology incentives offered by the european union if it agreed to abandon all nuclear fuel work , risking an international crisis .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 08.08.2005 german youths fear future joblessness großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the lucky ones : german youths fear not having a job german teenagers , particularly those leaving school to go directly into the workforce , are preparing themselves for the worst .
a new nationwide study shows that youths have a " considerable fear " of the future . the release of unemployment figures by the german federal labor agency has become a monthly thorn in the side for the gerhard schröder 's administration .
the numbers are gloomy for those without a job .
in july , unemployment stood at 4.77 million , or 11.5 percent .
the dark job picture is now also casting its shadow on the youth of germany .
according to a study conducted by the bertelsmann foundation , over half of the teenagers asked said they were skeptical or downright pessimistic about their chances to find a job after graduating from school .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german trade union federation is resorting to more exotic events , such as this job parade on may 1 , to help youths find work " our study shows that teenagers in germany - particularly those in secondary schools -lrb- hauptschule -rrb- - have a considerable fear of the future in light of the miserable job market and the chronic shortage of training positions , " said foundation chairman prof. heribert meffert in a statement .
less education , greater anxiety it 's exactly those from secondary schools for those students not bound for university who feel that their chances of finding a job are poor .
in the study , more than four of every five asked responded that those aiming for their secondary school degree be at a disadvantage when looking for an apprenticeship or employment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal labor agency logo meffert sees a great danger in the developments .
high youth unemployment would be a threat to the nation 's economy because those teenagers who fail to find a job after completing school are in danger of becoming part of gernany 's long-term unemployed . that 's doubly dangerous : the state would have to pay them welfare benefits , plus they are not paying into the state 's coffers for social benefits .
in addition , the increasing number of retirees means the creation of a gap of some three million skilled laborers , technicians and craftsmen by the year 2015 .
the perceived fragile situation on the job market has created a sense of urgency amongst adolescents .
almost two-thirds of them say they are willing to invest more time for their professional futures - and rightfully so .
eighty-one percent answered that the highest hurdle in the landing of training position is a lack of such positions .
only 26 percent feel that their grades and performance at school are hindrance in finding work .
no time to panic as autumn approaches , the number of those still without a training position stands at 246,400 with only 76,500 available .
last week , the german trade union federation -lrb- dgb -rrb- accused employers of not keeping their word , namely that all youths could find a position .
according to the dgb 's ingrid sehrbock , the adolescents ' situation is getting worse each day .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economics and labor minister wolfgang clement georg braun , the president of the german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- , did not dispute the lack of positions but points out that 205,000 more apprenticeship contracts have been signed in the first seven months this year than last .
german labor minister wolfgang clement -lrb- photo -rrb- said for all sides to not yet panic .
the job training market is not very transparent .
many employers first register open apprenticeships with the local chamber of commerce , and then later with the labor agency , making it hard to judge just how many total number training positions are available .
it also varies extremely from region to region .
in munich , there is a surplus of apprenticeships .
that contrasts with the dire situation in the eastern part of the country .
on average , some 100 job-seekers are fighting for 37 apprenticeships in that economically depressed region .
with the poor prospects there , the fears of many german youths may turn out to be all too real . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de young germans prove big spenders germans have long been accused of being too prudent when it comes to spending .

-lrb- june 21 , 2005 -rrb- the german fear of unemployment angst over the hovering specter of unemployment reached an all-time high last january as the number of unemployed climbed to over five million .

the german government has appealed to the mullahs in tehran to consider carefully the eu 's proposals . in a moment that the european union hoped would not come , iran has partially resumed sensitive nuclear fuel work at its isfahan nuclear facility .
the move came after the un 's nuclear watchdog iaea began installing surveillance equipment , and sent a clear signal that iran , at least for the moment , is not going to bow to the wishes of britain , france and germany , known as the eu-3 , to desist from its uranium conversion operations .
earlier monday , iaea officials had said the recommencement would not start until later in the week .
the crisis rose to a new level after iran last week rejected as " unacceptable " a package of proposals from the eu-3 aimed at securing guarantees that tehran 's nuclear program was not a cover for efforts to build a nuclear bomb .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many say iran 's new president mahmoud ahmadinejad is playing hardball with europe in addition to the rejection , ultraconservative iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , just five days in office , also turned heads by naming ali larijani as the country 's new atomic energy commissioner .
the western press refers to larijani as a hardliner .
larijani replaces hassan rowhani , who has managed to maintain dialogue with the west through thick and thin over the last two years , and his appointment will worry some western negotiators .
germany appeals to mullahs the reactions from berlin to the resumption of activity at isfahan were quick , sharp but also appellative .
german foreign minister joschka fischer urged iran monday to return to talks with the eu .
he said the eu-3 were doing everything in their power " to avert a negative development with disastrous consequences . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : talks between the eu and iran over the isfahan facility have come to an impasse " we hope iran will now examine the comprehensive proposal from the eu-3 very carefully and seriously .
we hope that iran does n't make any miscalculations here .
we are thoroughly convinced that the suggestion of the eu-3 provide a good foundation for further talks , " plötner said in berlin .
the social democratic deputy chair and foreign affairs expert , gernot erler , said the moves by iran constituted what he called " a step closer to a serious international crisis . "
erler said iran was close to being sanctioned .
that threat seems not to intimidate tehran .
iran has insisted on resuming the process at isfahan , which turns uranium ore into a feed gas for enrichment , despite the risk of being hauled before the un security council .

it recounts the story of seven million people , who left germany in search of a better life . at the site where steamboats and sailing ships docked to take on emigrants in the 19th century , the new museum now offers visitors a chance to relive the beginning of these journeys into the unknown .
the center wants to serve both as a memorial and a place for people to relive the past .
officials for the public-private project hope that 170,000 people from both sides of the atlantic will come to visit each year . sabine süss , the museum 's director , recently took visitors on a preview tour of the building that includes displays built by movie set designers and prop masters that allow guests to feel like they 're really just about to board a ship . bildunterschrift : a set design of a ship at the museum " once you 've left the waiting hall , you end up on the pier here , " she said .

it was a strenuous trip , süss said . " we 're in a sailing ship now and these are the sleeping quarters , " she explained while touring a replica of a boat .
" this was also the room were people stayed during the day and throughout the entire journey that took 70 , 80 days .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 08.08.2005 schily defends preventive detention plan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schily rejected claims that his proposals harked back to the nazis german interior minister otto schily on monday defended his plan to extend preventive detention measures which would allow police to keep terror suspects in custody for several months without having committed a crime . schily said in berlin that such a measure might be the only way of keeping terrorists in check when other steps could not be taken or failed to achieve the desired effect . schily rejected criticism from some german lawmakers who had compared his ideas to the nazis ' system of detention in the 1930s , which was installed with a view to eliminating critics of the dictatorship . addressing the media at a press conference in berlin , schily insisted that an extended preventive detention system could become an effective means to clamp down on the activities of potential terrorists . he was reacting to massive criticism voiced by green party ministers last week who claimed that such a system would be highly undemocratic and reminiscent of the nazis ' practice of dealing with unwanted people : schily rejects ' unconstitutional ' claims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " it 's silly to liken a democracy which defends itself against terrorism to a terrorist dictatorship which used to prosecute democrats , " he said .

a new nationwide study shows that youths have a " considerable fear " of the future . the release of unemployment figures by the german federal labor agency has become a monthly thorn in the side for the gerhard schröder 's administration .
the numbers are gloomy for those without a job .
in july , unemployment stood at 4.77 million , or 11.5 percent .
the dark job picture is now also casting its shadow on the youth of germany .
according to a study conducted by the bertelsmann foundation , over half of the teenagers asked said they were skeptical or downright pessimistic about their chances to find a job after graduating from school .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german trade union federation is resorting to more exotic events , such as this job parade on may 1 , to help youths find work " our study shows that teenagers in germany - particularly those in secondary schools -lrb- hauptschule -rrb- - have a considerable fear of the future in light of the miserable job market and the chronic shortage of training positions , " said foundation chairman prof. heribert meffert in a statement .
less education , greater anxiety it 's exactly those from secondary schools for those students not bound for university who feel that their chances of finding a job are poor .
in the study , more than four of every five asked responded that those aiming for their secondary school degree be at a disadvantage when looking for an apprenticeship or employment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal labor agency logo meffert sees a great danger in the developments .
high youth unemployment would be a threat to the nation 's economy because those teenagers who fail to find a job after completing school are in danger of becoming part of gernany 's long-term unemployed . that 's doubly dangerous : the state would have to pay them welfare benefits , plus they are not paying into the state 's coffers for social benefits .
in addition , the increasing number of retirees means the creation of a gap of some three million skilled laborers , technicians and craftsmen by the year 2015 .
the perceived fragile situation on the job market has created a sense of urgency amongst adolescents .
almost two-thirds of them say they are willing to invest more time for their professional futures - and rightfully so .
eighty-one percent answered that the highest hurdle in the landing of training position is a lack of such positions .
only 26 percent feel that their grades and performance at school are hindrance in finding work .
no time to panic as autumn approaches , the number of those still without a training position stands at 246,400 with only 76,500 available .
last week , the german trade union federation -lrb- dgb -rrb- accused employers of not keeping their word , namely that all youths could find a position .
according to the dgb 's ingrid sehrbock , the adolescents ' situation is getting worse each day .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economics and labor minister wolfgang clement georg braun , the president of the german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- , did not dispute the lack of positions but points out that 205,000 more apprenticeship contracts have been signed in the first seven months this year than last .
german labor minister wolfgang clement -lrb- photo -rrb- said for all sides to not yet panic .
the job training market is not very transparent .
many employers first register open apprenticeships with the local chamber of commerce , and then later with the labor agency , making it hard to judge just how many total number training positions are available .
it also varies extremely from region to region .
in munich , there is a surplus of apprenticeships .
that contrasts with the dire situation in the eastern part of the country .
on average , some 100 job-seekers are fighting for 37 apprenticeships in that economically depressed region .
with the poor prospects there , the fears of many german youths may turn out to be all too real . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de young germans prove big spenders germans have long been accused of being too prudent when it comes to spending .

18 .
this week , marc young considers the constitutional controversy surrounding the poll . i may have lived in germany too long . how else can i explain going online during my recent holiday in sardinia to read up on the latest political happenings in berlin ? admittedly , i was n't constantly mulling the possible unconstitutionality of germany 's early general election as i was splashing about in the island 's emerald green seas or sleeping on a white sandy beach .
however , just the fact that i was checking up on gerhard schröder and angela merkel after quaffing down a tasty cappuccino clearly outs me as a teutonic political junky . fortunately , such predilections should serve me well in this new weekly column .
from the perspective of an informed outsider , i will aim to analyze and scrutinize what could be the most important german election campaign in a generation .
i encourage readers to use the feedback link at the bottom of each commentary to share their own thoughts on the topics i delve into . it wo n't be news to anyone who occasionally visits dw-world that germany is in the midst of a serious economic crisis .
whoever wins the election in september will have to tackle the county 's twin woes of high unemployment and sluggish growth .
but the next chancellor will also have to address a crisis of confidence affecting germany 's collective psyche . that is , if there even is an election . all major political parties and an overwhelming majority of the public support schröder 's decision to bring forward the general election by a year , but germany 's constitutional court could still put the brakes on a campaign that is now in full swing . circumventing the constitution ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's constitutional court in karlsruhe .
that 's because schröder , who can not dissolve parliament himself , was forced to fake losing a confidence vote to trigger the early election one year before his second four-year term had ended .
that has led some disgruntled backbenchers of schröder 's own center-left coalition of social democrats and greens to petition the country 's highest court to stop the poll on the grounds the chancellor circumvented the constitution . i would tend to agree with the assessment that the confidence vote was less than kosher .
however , i also think germany desperately needs to be shaken out of its current self-pitying , reform-fearing , navel-gazing malaise .
and the best way to do that is by going to the polls this fall .
the country ca n't afford to wait another year .
berlin would face certain political gridlock as schröder 's agenda would be stymied by the conservative opposition , which controls the upper house of parliament , and rebel leftwing mps in his own party . that still does n't completely eliminate all of the queasiness i feel about clearly disingenuous path taken toward an early election and is why the next government will also need to pursue an amendment to the constitution allowing the chancellor to dissolve parliament in future . stable democracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german flag flying next to the glass dome of the reichstag .
yes , germany 's post-war founding fathers had plenty of good reasons for making the dissolution of the bundestag a difficult affair .
germany 's basic law was written to prevent the political instability seen during the weimar republic that helped hitler come to power in 1933 .
but who can seriously argue today that modern germany is not a stable and mature democracy ? as far as representing the will of the voters , germany 's system of proportional representation is vastly superior to the first-past-post methods used by britain and many other countries .
but it is an anachronism that the chancellor does not have the power to dissolve parliament like the leaders of other parliamentary democracies . it is time for that to change .
the present dire state germany finds itself in means politicians and the public are willing to let the blatantly faked confidence vote last month slide with a wink and nudge .
but unless the basic law is amended to avoid such a situation in the future , germany 's leaders will be tacitly legitimizing such political hocus pocus . and that would be far more damaging to germany 's democratic institutions than by giving the chancellor the power to dissolve parliament . marc young , dw-world send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de köhler gives go ahead for early elections german president horst köhler told his compatriots on thursday that he would dissolve parliament and called for federal elections on september 18 .
-lrb- july 22 , 2005 -rrb- early german elections in legal limbo germany 's ruling coalition may have purposely lost a confidence vote to trigger early elections , but the country 's president or supreme court could yet kibosh the hopes of both politicians and the public for a new poll .
-lrb- july 7 , 2005 -rrb- schröder loses confidence vote with an impassive face , german chancellor gerhard schröder received the news that the vote of confidence in the bundestag ended just as he hoped - in failure .

18 .
this week , marc young considers the constitutional controversy surrounding the poll . i may have lived in germany too long . how else can i explain going online during my recent holiday in sardinia to read up on the latest political happenings in berlin ? admittedly , i was n't constantly mulling the possible unconstitutionality of germany 's early general election as i was splashing about in the island 's emerald green seas or sleeping on a white sandy beach .
however , just the fact that i was checking up on gerhard schröder and angela merkel after quaffing down a tasty cappuccino clearly outs me as a teutonic political junky . fortunately , such predilections should serve me well in this new weekly column .
from the perspective of an informed outsider , i will aim to analyze and scrutinize what could be the most important german election campaign in a generation .
i encourage readers to use the feedback link at the bottom of each commentary to share their own thoughts on the topics i delve into . it wo n't be news to anyone who occasionally visits dw-world that germany is in the midst of a serious economic crisis .
whoever wins the election in september will have to tackle the county 's twin woes of high unemployment and sluggish growth .
but the next chancellor will also have to address a crisis of confidence affecting germany 's collective psyche . that is , if there even is an election . all major political parties and an overwhelming majority of the public support schröder 's decision to bring forward the general election by a year , but germany 's constitutional court could still put the brakes on a campaign that is now in full swing . circumventing the constitution ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's constitutional court in karlsruhe .
that 's because schröder , who can not dissolve parliament himself , was forced to fake losing a confidence vote to trigger the early election one year before his second four-year term had ended .
that has led some disgruntled backbenchers of schröder 's own center-left coalition of social democrats and greens to petition the country 's highest court to stop the poll on the grounds the chancellor circumvented the constitution . i would tend to agree with the assessment that the confidence vote was less than kosher .
however , i also think germany desperately needs to be shaken out of its current self-pitying , reform-fearing , navel-gazing malaise .
and the best way to do that is by going to the polls this fall .
the country ca n't afford to wait another year .
berlin would face certain political gridlock as schröder 's agenda would be stymied by the conservative opposition , which controls the upper house of parliament , and rebel leftwing mps in his own party . that still does n't completely eliminate all of the queasiness i feel about clearly disingenuous path taken toward an early election and is why the next government will also need to pursue an amendment to the constitution allowing the chancellor to dissolve parliament in future . stable democracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german flag flying next to the glass dome of the reichstag .

the present dire state germany finds itself in means politicians and the public are willing to let the blatantly faked confidence vote last month slide with a wink and nudge .

schröder and merkel much to the annoyance of their partners in government the greens , germany 's social democrats have begun discussing the possibility of a grand coalition with the conservative opposition . chancellor gerhard schröder and social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- chief franz müntefering have ruled it out .
many in the party , also fail to see the common ground .
but now there 's increasing talk by some ministers in the schröder administration that after expected general election on september 18 , the unthinkable may just become reality - a grand coalition with the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
a number of senior social democrats backtracked on previous statements and came out in support of the idea of a grand coalition - if everything else fails .
social democrat labor and economics minister wolfgang clement said it would be no sin to enter a grand coalition .
he called it a reasonable democratic option and one which could open up new opportunities to reform the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finance minister hans eichel has expressed he 's open to a grand coaltion speaking in the same vein , social democrat finance minister hans eichel insisted that a grand coalition was definitely not beyond his imagination .
he claimed that both the social democrats and the opposition conservatives had an interest in cutting the country 's gaping budget deficit and saw opportunities to cut obsolete state subsidies together .
interior minister otto schily has also joined the list , saying on german public television on monday that should the election end with the defeat of the current center-left coalition , then the party should n't " rule out the option of a grand coalition . "
criticism from coalition partner , left the odd-man out in the grand coalition constellation is naturally the spd 's current junior coalition partner , the green party .
greens ' co-chair krista sager told the berliner zeitung that a possible cdu-spd coalition was the " stupidest common denominator . "
she also said that she was n't surprised that some social democrats were " grasping for straws . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " fresh ideas " of the greens are turning sour under speculation of a possible grand coaltion the party 's other co-leader , reinhard bütikofer , attacked the utterances of the ministers , saying to the leipziger zeitung that they should then tell the voters how much they want to raise the vat , whether they want to implement an unfair health care system and whether german soldiers should be sent to iraq .
the speaker of the spd 's left-wing , michael müller , believes such talk is premature at this point of the campaign .
" i think that people like wolfgang clement and hans eichel should be a little more careful and restrained with regard to coalitions , " müller said .
polls point to grand coalition the resistance of the greens and some within the spd can not cover up the results from the most recent opinion polls .
the new socialist left party is gaining momentum , taking away votes from the spd .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the increasing popularity of the left party is throwing a monkey wrench in the plans of the mainstream parties also , german voters , at one time anxious for a new government , seem to be getting cold feet .
for the first time since february , the cdu and their potential partners form the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- no longer tallied more than 50 percent in opinion polls .
fdp chair guido westerwelle , who would like to avoid talk of grand coalition , is instead talking up his imagined worst-case scenario .
" the alternative to a cdu-fdp coalition is n't a grand coalition , " he told the tabloid bild , " but rather a leftist majority in the german parliament .

schröder and merkel much to the annoyance of their partners in government the greens , germany 's social democrats have begun discussing the possibility of a grand coalition with the conservative opposition . chancellor gerhard schröder and social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- chief franz müntefering have ruled it out .
many in the party , also fail to see the common ground .
but now there 's increasing talk by some ministers in the schröder administration that after expected general election on september 18 , the unthinkable may just become reality - a grand coalition with the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
a number of senior social democrats backtracked on previous statements and came out in support of the idea of a grand coalition - if everything else fails .
social democrat labor and economics minister wolfgang clement said it would be no sin to enter a grand coalition .
he called it a reasonable democratic option and one which could open up new opportunities to reform the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finance minister hans eichel has expressed he 's open to a grand coaltion speaking in the same vein , social democrat finance minister hans eichel insisted that a grand coalition was definitely not beyond his imagination .
he claimed that both the social democrats and the opposition conservatives had an interest in cutting the country 's gaping budget deficit and saw opportunities to cut obsolete state subsidies together .
interior minister otto schily has also joined the list , saying on german public television on monday that should the election end with the defeat of the current center-left coalition , then the party should n't " rule out the option of a grand coalition . "
criticism from coalition partner , left the odd-man out in the grand coalition constellation is naturally the spd 's current junior coalition partner , the green party .
greens ' co-chair krista sager told the berliner zeitung that a possible cdu-spd coalition was the " stupidest common denominator . "
she also said that she was n't surprised that some social democrats were " grasping for straws . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " fresh ideas " of the greens are turning sour under speculation of a possible grand coaltion the party 's other co-leader , reinhard bütikofer , attacked the utterances of the ministers , saying to the leipziger zeitung that they should then tell the voters how much they want to raise the vat , whether they want to implement an unfair health care system and whether german soldiers should be sent to iraq .
the speaker of the spd 's left-wing , michael müller , believes such talk is premature at this point of the campaign .
" i think that people like wolfgang clement and hans eichel should be a little more careful and restrained with regard to coalitions , " müller said .
polls point to grand coalition the resistance of the greens and some within the spd can not cover up the results from the most recent opinion polls .
the new socialist left party is gaining momentum , taking away votes from the spd .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the increasing popularity of the left party is throwing a monkey wrench in the plans of the mainstream parties also , german voters , at one time anxious for a new government , seem to be getting cold feet .
for the first time since february , the cdu and their potential partners form the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- no longer tallied more than 50 percent in opinion polls .
fdp chair guido westerwelle , who would like to avoid talk of grand coalition , is instead talking up his imagined worst-case scenario .
" the alternative to a cdu-fdp coalition is n't a grand coalition , " he told the tabloid bild , " but rather a leftist majority in the german parliament .

a new nationwide study shows that youths have a " considerable fear " of the future . the release of unemployment figures by the german federal labor agency has become a monthly thorn in the side for the gerhard schröder 's administration .
the numbers are gloomy for those without a job .
in july , unemployment stood at 4.77 million , or 11.5 percent .
the dark job picture is now also casting its shadow on the youth of germany .
according to a study conducted by the bertelsmann foundation , over half of the teenagers asked said they were skeptical or downright pessimistic about their chances to find a job after graduating from school .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german trade union federation is resorting to more exotic events , such as this job parade on may 1 , to help youths find work " our study shows that teenagers in germany - particularly those in secondary schools -lrb- hauptschule -rrb- - have a considerable fear of the future in light of the miserable job market and the chronic shortage of training positions , " said foundation chairman prof. heribert meffert in a statement .
less education , greater anxiety it 's exactly those from secondary schools for those students not bound for university who feel that their chances of finding a job are poor .
in the study , more than four of every five asked responded that those aiming for their secondary school degree be at a disadvantage when looking for an apprenticeship or employment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal labor agency logo meffert sees a great danger in the developments .
high youth unemployment would be a threat to the nation 's economy because those teenagers who fail to find a job after completing school are in danger of becoming part of gernany 's long-term unemployed . that 's doubly dangerous : the state would have to pay them welfare benefits , plus they are not paying into the state 's coffers for social benefits .
in addition , the increasing number of retirees means the creation of a gap of some three million skilled laborers , technicians and craftsmen by the year 2015 .
the perceived fragile situation on the job market has created a sense of urgency amongst adolescents .
almost two-thirds of them say they are willing to invest more time for their professional futures - and rightfully so .
eighty-one percent answered that the highest hurdle in the landing of training position is a lack of such positions .
only 26 percent feel that their grades and performance at school are hindrance in finding work .
no time to panic as autumn approaches , the number of those still without a training position stands at 246,400 with only 76,500 available .
last week , the german trade union federation -lrb- dgb -rrb- accused employers of not keeping their word , namely that all youths could find a position .
according to the dgb 's ingrid sehrbock , the adolescents ' situation is getting worse each day .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economics and labor minister wolfgang clement georg braun , the president of the german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- , did not dispute the lack of positions but points out that 205,000 more apprenticeship contracts have been signed in the first seven months this year than last .
german labor minister wolfgang clement -lrb- photo -rrb- said for all sides to not yet panic .
the job training market is not very transparent .
many employers first register open apprenticeships with the local chamber of commerce , and then later with the labor agency , making it hard to judge just how many total number training positions are available .
it also varies extremely from region to region .
in munich , there is a surplus of apprenticeships .
that contrasts with the dire situation in the eastern part of the country .
on average , some 100 job-seekers are fighting for 37 apprenticeships in that economically depressed region .
with the poor prospects there , the fears of many german youths may turn out to be all too real . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de young germans prove big spenders germans have long been accused of being too prudent when it comes to spending .
but the same ca n't be said of the country 's children and teenagers who are displaying a huge appetite for buying clothes and accessories .
-lrb- june 21 , 2005 -rrb- the german fear of unemployment angst over the hovering specter of unemployment reached an all-time high last january as the number of unemployed climbed to over five million .

a new nationwide study shows that youths have a " considerable fear " of the future . the release of unemployment figures by the german federal labor agency has become a monthly thorn in the side for the gerhard schröder 's administration .
the numbers are gloomy for those without a job .
in july , unemployment stood at 4.77 million , or 11.5 percent .
the dark job picture is now also casting its shadow on the youth of germany .
according to a study conducted by the bertelsmann foundation , over half of the teenagers asked said they were skeptical or downright pessimistic about their chances to find a job after graduating from school .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german trade union federation is resorting to more exotic events , such as this job parade on may 1 , to help youths find work " our study shows that teenagers in germany - particularly those in secondary schools -lrb- hauptschule -rrb- - have a considerable fear of the future in light of the miserable job market and the chronic shortage of training positions , " said foundation chairman prof. heribert meffert in a statement .
less education , greater anxiety it 's exactly those from secondary schools for those students not bound for university who feel that their chances of finding a job are poor .
in the study , more than four of every five asked responded that those aiming for their secondary school degree be at a disadvantage when looking for an apprenticeship or employment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal labor agency logo meffert sees a great danger in the developments .
high youth unemployment would be a threat to the nation 's economy because those teenagers who fail to find a job after completing school are in danger of becoming part of gernany 's long-term unemployed . that 's doubly dangerous : the state would have to pay them welfare benefits , plus they are not paying into the state 's coffers for social benefits .
in addition , the increasing number of retirees means the creation of a gap of some three million skilled laborers , technicians and craftsmen by the year 2015 .
the perceived fragile situation on the job market has created a sense of urgency amongst adolescents .
almost two-thirds of them say they are willing to invest more time for their professional futures - and rightfully so .
eighty-one percent answered that the highest hurdle in the landing of training position is a lack of such positions .
only 26 percent feel that their grades and performance at school are hindrance in finding work .
no time to panic as autumn approaches , the number of those still without a training position stands at 246,400 with only 76,500 available .
last week , the german trade union federation -lrb- dgb -rrb- accused employers of not keeping their word , namely that all youths could find a position .
according to the dgb 's ingrid sehrbock , the adolescents ' situation is getting worse each day .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economics and labor minister wolfgang clement georg braun , the president of the german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- , did not dispute the lack of positions but points out that 205,000 more apprenticeship contracts have been signed in the first seven months this year than last .
german labor minister wolfgang clement -lrb- photo -rrb- said for all sides to not yet panic .
the job training market is not very transparent .
many employers first register open apprenticeships with the local chamber of commerce , and then later with the labor agency , making it hard to judge just how many total number training positions are available .
it also varies extremely from region to region .
in munich , there is a surplus of apprenticeships .
that contrasts with the dire situation in the eastern part of the country .

18 .
this week , marc young considers the constitutional controversy surrounding the poll . i may have lived in germany too long . how else can i explain going online during my recent holiday in sardinia to read up on the latest political happenings in berlin ? admittedly , i was n't constantly mulling the possible unconstitutionality of germany 's early general election as i was splashing about in the island 's emerald green seas or sleeping on a white sandy beach .
however , just the fact that i was checking up on gerhard schröder and angela merkel after quaffing down a tasty cappuccino clearly outs me as a teutonic political junky . fortunately , such predilections should serve me well in this new weekly column .
from the perspective of an informed outsider , i will aim to analyze and scrutinize what could be the most important german election campaign in a generation .
i encourage readers to use the feedback link at the bottom of each commentary to share their own thoughts on the topics i delve into . it wo n't be news to anyone who occasionally visits dw-world that germany is in the midst of a serious economic crisis .
whoever wins the election in september will have to tackle the county 's twin woes of high unemployment and sluggish growth .
but the next chancellor will also have to address a crisis of confidence affecting germany 's collective psyche . that is , if there even is an election . all major political parties and an overwhelming majority of the public support schröder 's decision to bring forward the general election by a year , but germany 's constitutional court could still put the brakes on a campaign that is now in full swing . circumventing the constitution ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's constitutional court in karlsruhe .
that 's because schröder , who can not dissolve parliament himself , was forced to fake losing a confidence vote to trigger the early election one year before his second four-year term had ended .
that has led some disgruntled backbenchers of schröder 's own center-left coalition of social democrats and greens to petition the country 's highest court to stop the poll on the grounds the chancellor circumvented the constitution . i would tend to agree with the assessment that the confidence vote was less than kosher .
however , i also think germany desperately needs to be shaken out of its current self-pitying , reform-fearing , navel-gazing malaise .
and the best way to do that is by going to the polls this fall .
the country ca n't afford to wait another year .
berlin would face certain political gridlock as schröder 's agenda would be stymied by the conservative opposition , which controls the upper house of parliament , and rebel leftwing mps in his own party . that still does n't completely eliminate all of the queasiness i feel about clearly disingenuous path taken toward an early election and is why the next government will also need to pursue an amendment to the constitution allowing the chancellor to dissolve parliament in future . stable democracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german flag flying next to the glass dome of the reichstag .
yes , germany 's post-war founding fathers had plenty of good reasons for making the dissolution of the bundestag a difficult affair .
germany 's basic law was written to prevent the political instability seen during the weimar republic that helped hitler come to power in 1933 .
but who can seriously argue today that modern germany is not a stable and mature democracy ? as far as representing the will of the voters , germany 's system of proportional representation is vastly superior to the first-past-post methods used by britain and many other countries .
but it is an anachronism that the chancellor does not have the power to dissolve parliament like the leaders of other parliamentary democracies . it is time for that to change .
the present dire state germany finds itself in means politicians and the public are willing to let the blatantly faked confidence vote last month slide with a wink and nudge .
but unless the basic law is amended to avoid such a situation in the future , germany 's leaders will be tacitly legitimizing such political hocus pocus . and that would be far more damaging to germany 's democratic institutions than by giving the chancellor the power to dissolve parliament . marc young , dw-world send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de köhler gives go ahead for early elections german president horst köhler told his compatriots on thursday that he would dissolve parliament and called for federal elections on september 18 .
-lrb- july 22 , 2005 -rrb- early german elections in legal limbo germany 's ruling coalition may have purposely lost a confidence vote to trigger early elections , but the country 's president or supreme court could yet kibosh the hopes of both politicians and the public for a new poll .

schröder and merkel much to the annoyance of their partners in government the greens , germany 's social democrats have begun discussing the possibility of a grand coalition with the conservative opposition . chancellor gerhard schröder and social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- chief franz müntefering have ruled it out .
many in the party , also fail to see the common ground .
but now there 's increasing talk by some ministers in the schröder administration that after expected general election on september 18 , the unthinkable may just become reality - a grand coalition with the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
a number of senior social democrats backtracked on previous statements and came out in support of the idea of a grand coalition - if everything else fails .
social democrat labor and economics minister wolfgang clement said it would be no sin to enter a grand coalition .
he called it a reasonable democratic option and one which could open up new opportunities to reform the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finance minister hans eichel has expressed he 's open to a grand coaltion speaking in the same vein , social democrat finance minister hans eichel insisted that a grand coalition was definitely not beyond his imagination .
he claimed that both the social democrats and the opposition conservatives had an interest in cutting the country 's gaping budget deficit and saw opportunities to cut obsolete state subsidies together .
interior minister otto schily has also joined the list , saying on german public television on monday that should the election end with the defeat of the current center-left coalition , then the party should n't " rule out the option of a grand coalition . "
criticism from coalition partner , left the odd-man out in the grand coalition constellation is naturally the spd 's current junior coalition partner , the green party .
greens ' co-chair krista sager told the berliner zeitung that a possible cdu-spd coalition was the " stupidest common denominator . "
she also said that she was n't surprised that some social democrats were " grasping for straws . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " fresh ideas " of the greens are turning sour under speculation of a possible grand coaltion the party 's other co-leader , reinhard bütikofer , attacked the utterances of the ministers , saying to the leipziger zeitung that they should then tell the voters how much they want to raise the vat , whether they want to implement an unfair health care system and whether german soldiers should be sent to iraq .
the speaker of the spd 's left-wing , michael müller , believes such talk is premature at this point of the campaign .
" i think that people like wolfgang clement and hans eichel should be a little more careful and restrained with regard to coalitions , " müller said .
polls point to grand coalition the resistance of the greens and some within the spd can not cover up the results from the most recent opinion polls .
the new socialist left party is gaining momentum , taking away votes from the spd .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the increasing popularity of the left party is throwing a monkey wrench in the plans of the mainstream parties also , german voters , at one time anxious for a new government , seem to be getting cold feet .
for the first time since february , the cdu and their potential partners form the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- no longer tallied more than 50 percent in opinion polls .
fdp chair guido westerwelle , who would like to avoid talk of grand coalition , is instead talking up his imagined worst-case scenario .
" the alternative to a cdu-fdp coalition is n't a grand coalition , " he told the tabloid bild , " but rather a leftist majority in the german parliament .

the german government has appealed to the mullahs in tehran to consider carefully the eu 's proposals . in a moment that the european union hoped would not come , iran has partially resumed sensitive nuclear fuel work at its isfahan nuclear facility .
the move came after the un 's nuclear watchdog iaea began installing surveillance equipment , and sent a clear signal that iran , at least for the moment , is not going to bow to the wishes of britain , france and germany , known as the eu-3 , to desist from its uranium conversion operations .
earlier monday , iaea officials had said the recommencement would not start until later in the week .
the crisis rose to a new level after iran last week rejected as " unacceptable " a package of proposals from the eu-3 aimed at securing guarantees that tehran 's nuclear program was not a cover for efforts to build a nuclear bomb .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many say iran 's new president mahmoud ahmadinejad is playing hardball with europe in addition to the rejection , ultraconservative iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , just five days in office , also turned heads by naming ali larijani as the country 's new atomic energy commissioner .
the western press refers to larijani as a hardliner .
larijani replaces hassan rowhani , who has managed to maintain dialogue with the west through thick and thin over the last two years , and his appointment will worry some western negotiators .
germany appeals to mullahs the reactions from berlin to the resumption of activity at isfahan were quick , sharp but also appellative .
german foreign minister joschka fischer urged iran monday to return to talks with the eu .
he said the eu-3 were doing everything in their power " to avert a negative development with disastrous consequences . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : talks between the eu and iran over the isfahan facility have come to an impasse " we hope iran will now examine the comprehensive proposal from the eu-3 very carefully and seriously .

we are thoroughly convinced that the suggestion of the eu-3 provide a good foundation for further talks , " plötner said in berlin .
the social democratic deputy chair and foreign affairs expert , gernot erler , said the moves by iran constituted what he called " a step closer to a serious international crisis . "
erler said iran was close to being sanctioned .
that threat seems not to intimidate tehran .
iran has insisted on resuming the process at isfahan , which turns uranium ore into a feed gas for enrichment , despite the risk of being hauled before the un security council .
nine months for naught bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politics still must bow to the will of muslim leaders in iran .
here , president ahmadinejad when taking his oath of office the eu , which has been negotiating with iran for nine months , has called for an emergency meeting tuesday of the iaea board , which is expected to issue an ultimatum demanding a commitment to suspend nuclear fuel work .
yet escalation seems to be the game that tehran wants to play according to the german army 's iran expert , hans krech .

the german government has appealed to the mullahs in tehran to consider carefully the eu 's proposals . in a moment that the european union hoped would not come , iran has partially resumed sensitive nuclear fuel work at its isfahan nuclear facility .
the move came after the un 's nuclear watchdog iaea began installing surveillance equipment , and sent a clear signal that iran , at least for the moment , is not going to bow to the wishes of britain , france and germany , known as the eu-3 , to desist from its uranium conversion operations .
earlier monday , iaea officials had said the recommencement would not start until later in the week .
the crisis rose to a new level after iran last week rejected as " unacceptable " a package of proposals from the eu-3 aimed at securing guarantees that tehran 's nuclear program was not a cover for efforts to build a nuclear bomb .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many say iran 's new president mahmoud ahmadinejad is playing hardball with europe in addition to the rejection , ultraconservative iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , just five days in office , also turned heads by naming ali larijani as the country 's new atomic energy commissioner .
the western press refers to larijani as a hardliner .
larijani replaces hassan rowhani , who has managed to maintain dialogue with the west through thick and thin over the last two years , and his appointment will worry some western negotiators .
germany appeals to mullahs the reactions from berlin to the resumption of activity at isfahan were quick , sharp but also appellative .
german foreign minister joschka fischer urged iran monday to return to talks with the eu .
he said the eu-3 were doing everything in their power " to avert a negative development with disastrous consequences . "

" " springer should n't rejoice too soon .
i am positive that the antitrust authorities will closely inspect the merger , " said stiegler . the italian syndrome monika griefahn -lrb- spd -rrb- , president of the parliamentary committee on culture and media , expressed her concern for the future of media diversity in germany .
as a counter-measure to the homogenization of media power , griefahn is advocating the creation of advisory boards under public law that would accompany commercial radio and tv stations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : monika griefahn is advocating public control of private media companies " above all , we should avoid developing relationships similar to those in italy , " griefahn said , referring to the much criticized concentration of power of information under the umbrella of prime minister silvio berlusconi 's media empire . representatives of other german media groups were equally concerned .
michael grabner , vice-president of holtzbrinck publishing group from stuttgart and publisher of such widely circulated german newspapers as die zeit and handelsblatt , stressed that the springer - prosiebensat.1 merger would create " a great media power not only in the field of journalism , but also on the advertising market . " antitrust claims holtzbrinck is planning to take a firm stand on the takeover issue before the german antitrust authorities .
according to german law , any company that has an economic interest in a merger being under investigation may approach the antitrust authorities to present their point of view .
by doing so , they also gain access to the records of the given case as well as the right to appeal against the decision of the antitrust authority before the courts . when holtzbrinck announced its intention to purchase the berlin-based newspapers berliner zeitung and kurier in 2004 , the antitrust authority did not give its go-ahead out of fear of creating a press monopoly in the german capital . " we expect the same standards to be applied to springer , " grabner said . a thorough investigation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : springer publishing is diversifying in oder to catch up with bertelsmann ulf vöge , president of the german governmental antitrust body , said that the potential effects of the announced merger on the media market would be thoroughly investigated , taking into consideration the cross-medial integration of print and television , which has no precedent in germany . analysts with the german westlb bank changed their recommendations for prosiebensat.1 shares from " outperform " to " neutral , " citing uncertain exchange value for the stockholders of prosiebensat.1 preferred shares , unattractive cash compensation and lack of estimates for the potential of the company after the merger .
springer is expected to pay out the outstanding preferred shareholders at 14.10 euros per share in cash , which is below the current market price . springer management confident despite the reservations of media representatives , watchdogs and analysts , the springer management is confident that the announced takeover will go smoothly . " we are certain that we have good arguments for dispelling all concerns , " said a spokesperson for springer on sunday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friede springer : trying to preserve her husband 's legacy friede springer , majority owner of the publishing group , denied claims that the merger was meant to create an opinion-bending powerhouse . " i am only thinking about securing the future of my husband 's publishing company , " she said . " to do that , we need a second leg to stand on , " she said . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinions split on springer-prosieben deal the possible merger of german publishing giant axel springer with broadcaster prosiebensat.1 has caused mixed reactions with some praising the move and others fearing a media monopoly .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 08.08.2005 iran resumes enrichment activity großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : isfahan enrichment facility : not particularly high-tech in appearance iranian technicians have taken the first steps to resume enrichment activity at its isfahan facility .
the german government has appealed to the mullahs in tehran to consider carefully the eu 's proposals . in a moment that the european union hoped would not come , iran has partially resumed sensitive nuclear fuel work at its isfahan nuclear facility .
the move came after the un 's nuclear watchdog iaea began installing surveillance equipment , and sent a clear signal that iran , at least for the moment , is not going to bow to the wishes of britain , france and germany , known as the eu-3 , to desist from its uranium conversion operations .
earlier monday , iaea officials had said the recommencement would not start until later in the week .
the crisis rose to a new level after iran last week rejected as " unacceptable " a package of proposals from the eu-3 aimed at securing guarantees that tehran 's nuclear program was not a cover for efforts to build a nuclear bomb .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many say iran 's new president mahmoud ahmadinejad is playing hardball with europe in addition to the rejection , ultraconservative iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , just five days in office , also turned heads by naming ali larijani as the country 's new atomic energy commissioner .
the western press refers to larijani as a hardliner .
larijani replaces hassan rowhani , who has managed to maintain dialogue with the west through thick and thin over the last two years , and his appointment will worry some western negotiators .
germany appeals to mullahs the reactions from berlin to the resumption of activity at isfahan were quick , sharp but also appellative .
german foreign minister joschka fischer urged iran monday to return to talks with the eu .
he said the eu-3 were doing everything in their power " to avert a negative development with disastrous consequences . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : talks between the eu and iran over the isfahan facility have come to an impasse " we hope iran will now examine the comprehensive proposal from the eu-3 very carefully and seriously .
we hope that iran does n't make any miscalculations here .
we are thoroughly convinced that the suggestion of the eu-3 provide a good foundation for further talks , " plötner said in berlin .
the social democratic deputy chair and foreign affairs expert , gernot erler , said the moves by iran constituted what he called " a step closer to a serious international crisis . "
erler said iran was close to being sanctioned .
that threat seems not to intimidate tehran .
iran has insisted on resuming the process at isfahan , which turns uranium ore into a feed gas for enrichment , despite the risk of being hauled before the un security council .
nine months for naught bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politics still must bow to the will of muslim leaders in iran .
here , president ahmadinejad when taking his oath of office the eu , which has been negotiating with iran for nine months , has called for an emergency meeting tuesday of the iaea board , which is expected to issue an ultimatum demanding a commitment to suspend nuclear fuel work .
yet escalation seems to be the game that tehran wants to play according to the german army 's iran expert , hans krech .
not only the reactivation of the isfahan facility indicates this but also the appointment of larijani , who has described giving up iran 's right to uranium enrichment in exchange for eu incentives as like swapping " a pearl for a sweet , " makes more difficult negotiations inevitable . dw staff / afp -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de crisis looms as iran rejects eu nuke offer iran on friday rejected a broad package of trade and technology incentives offered by the european union if it agreed to abandon all nuclear fuel work , risking an international crisis .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 08.08.2005 iran resumes enrichment activity großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : isfahan enrichment facility : not particularly high-tech in appearance iranian technicians have taken the first steps to resume enrichment activity at its isfahan facility .
the german government has appealed to the mullahs in tehran to consider carefully the eu 's proposals . in a moment that the european union hoped would not come , iran has partially resumed sensitive nuclear fuel work at its isfahan nuclear facility .
the move came after the un 's nuclear watchdog iaea began installing surveillance equipment , and sent a clear signal that iran , at least for the moment , is not going to bow to the wishes of britain , france and germany , known as the eu-3 , to desist from its uranium conversion operations .
earlier monday , iaea officials had said the recommencement would not start until later in the week .
the crisis rose to a new level after iran last week rejected as " unacceptable " a package of proposals from the eu-3 aimed at securing guarantees that tehran 's nuclear program was not a cover for efforts to build a nuclear bomb .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many say iran 's new president mahmoud ahmadinejad is playing hardball with europe in addition to the rejection , ultraconservative iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , just five days in office , also turned heads by naming ali larijani as the country 's new atomic energy commissioner .
the western press refers to larijani as a hardliner .
larijani replaces hassan rowhani , who has managed to maintain dialogue with the west through thick and thin over the last two years , and his appointment will worry some western negotiators .
germany appeals to mullahs the reactions from berlin to the resumption of activity at isfahan were quick , sharp but also appellative .
german foreign minister joschka fischer urged iran monday to return to talks with the eu .
he said the eu-3 were doing everything in their power " to avert a negative development with disastrous consequences . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : talks between the eu and iran over the isfahan facility have come to an impasse " we hope iran will now examine the comprehensive proposal from the eu-3 very carefully and seriously .
we hope that iran does n't make any miscalculations here .
we are thoroughly convinced that the suggestion of the eu-3 provide a good foundation for further talks , " plötner said in berlin .
the social democratic deputy chair and foreign affairs expert , gernot erler , said the moves by iran constituted what he called " a step closer to a serious international crisis . "
erler said iran was close to being sanctioned .
that threat seems not to intimidate tehran .
iran has insisted on resuming the process at isfahan , which turns uranium ore into a feed gas for enrichment , despite the risk of being hauled before the un security council .
nine months for naught bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politics still must bow to the will of muslim leaders in iran .
here , president ahmadinejad when taking his oath of office the eu , which has been negotiating with iran for nine months , has called for an emergency meeting tuesday of the iaea board , which is expected to issue an ultimatum demanding a commitment to suspend nuclear fuel work .
yet escalation seems to be the game that tehran wants to play according to the german army 's iran expert , hans krech .
not only the reactivation of the isfahan facility indicates this but also the appointment of larijani , who has described giving up iran 's right to uranium enrichment in exchange for eu incentives as like swapping " a pearl for a sweet , " makes more difficult negotiations inevitable . dw staff / afp -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de crisis looms as iran rejects eu nuke offer iran on friday rejected a broad package of trade and technology incentives offered by the european union if it agreed to abandon all nuclear fuel work , risking an international crisis .

the eu is unhappy but dw 's mideast expert peter philipp does n't think that the move should change negotiation strategies .

the german government has appealed to the mullahs in tehran to consider carefully the eu 's proposals . in a moment that the european union hoped would not come , iran has partially resumed sensitive nuclear fuel work at its isfahan nuclear facility .
the move came after the un 's nuclear watchdog iaea began installing surveillance equipment , and sent a clear signal that iran , at least for the moment , is not going to bow to the wishes of britain , france and germany , known as the eu-3 , to desist from its uranium conversion operations .
earlier monday , iaea officials had said the recommencement would not start until later in the week .
the crisis rose to a new level after iran last week rejected as " unacceptable " a package of proposals from the eu-3 aimed at securing guarantees that tehran 's nuclear program was not a cover for efforts to build a nuclear bomb .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many say iran 's new president mahmoud ahmadinejad is playing hardball with europe in addition to the rejection , ultraconservative iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , just five days in office , also turned heads by naming ali larijani as the country 's new atomic energy commissioner .
the western press refers to larijani as a hardliner .
larijani replaces hassan rowhani , who has managed to maintain dialogue with the west through thick and thin over the last two years , and his appointment will worry some western negotiators .
germany appeals to mullahs the reactions from berlin to the resumption of activity at isfahan were quick , sharp but also appellative .
german foreign minister joschka fischer urged iran monday to return to talks with the eu .
he said the eu-3 were doing everything in their power " to avert a negative development with disastrous consequences . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : talks between the eu and iran over the isfahan facility have come to an impasse " we hope iran will now examine the comprehensive proposal from the eu-3 very carefully and seriously .
we hope that iran does n't make any miscalculations here .
we are thoroughly convinced that the suggestion of the eu-3 provide a good foundation for further talks , " plötner said in berlin .
the social democratic deputy chair and foreign affairs expert , gernot erler , said the moves by iran constituted what he called " a step closer to a serious international crisis . "
erler said iran was close to being sanctioned .
that threat seems not to intimidate tehran .
iran has insisted on resuming the process at isfahan , which turns uranium ore into a feed gas for enrichment , despite the risk of being hauled before the un security council .

it recounts the story of seven million people , who left germany in search of a better life . at the site where steamboats and sailing ships docked to take on emigrants in the 19th century , the new museum now offers visitors a chance to relive the beginning of these journeys into the unknown .
the center wants to serve both as a memorial and a place for people to relive the past .
officials for the public-private project hope that 170,000 people from both sides of the atlantic will come to visit each year . sabine süss , the museum 's director , recently took visitors on a preview tour of the building that includes displays built by movie set designers and prop masters that allow guests to feel like they 're really just about to board a ship . bildunterschrift : a set design of a ship at the museum " once you 've left the waiting hall , you end up on the pier here , " she said .
" the year 's 1880 .
you 're standing in front of a huge side of a ship , which sits in a basin .
there are boxes everywhere , you see luggage and really start to feel like you 're getting ready to emigrate . " süss is thrilled with the work of the film professionals , who have recreated the scenes in the 20 million-euro -lrb- $ 24.6-million -rrb- building .
there 's a gangway that moves when visitors walk on it , giving them at least an idea of what it must have been like . mixed feelings helga von schweinitz left germany for the united states on the ship " italia " in 1957 in search for a job . " it was a mixture of excitement about the unknown and a fear of leaving everything behind , " she said .
" my father was standing on the pier and kept waving and waving and i saw that he was crying .
i was torn , but the thrill kept me going . " bildunterschrift : emigration scenes adorn the wall of the center while von schweinitz left on a modern ocean liner , emigrants still traveled on sailing ships a century earlier .
it was a strenuous trip , süss said . " we 're in a sailing ship now and these are the sleeping quarters , " she explained while touring a replica of a boat .
" this was also the room were people stayed during the day and throughout the entire journey that took 70 , 80 days .
it was extremely crowded and people did n't know each other and often did n't even speak the same language . " telling stories in the 19th century alone , 35 million europeans packed their bags in search of a better life abroad .
in bremerhaven , 15 of these life stories are recounted to serve as guides for visitors . they help to explain motives for leaving - many did n't emigrate voluntarily , as the example of a young jewish doctor shows , who fled germany for america , but could never work in her profession again . bildunterschrift : interactive displays at the museum interactive displays also give people a chance to search for their own relatives who emigrated or simply scroll through passenger lists . one name that comes up on the lists is volker schmeissner .
as a 26-year-old student from tübingen in southwestern germany .
he left for the united states in 1961 . bildunterschrift : view of the center at night " this was the last bit of germany i saw , " he said .
" it was a memory that stayed .
i keep getting asked where my roots are and were i can go to find them documented .

a new nationwide study shows that youths have a " considerable fear " of the future . the release of unemployment figures by the german federal labor agency has become a monthly thorn in the side for the gerhard schröder 's administration .
the numbers are gloomy for those without a job .
in july , unemployment stood at 4.77 million , or 11.5 percent .
the dark job picture is now also casting its shadow on the youth of germany .
according to a study conducted by the bertelsmann foundation , over half of the teenagers asked said they were skeptical or downright pessimistic about their chances to find a job after graduating from school .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german trade union federation is resorting to more exotic events , such as this job parade on may 1 , to help youths find work " our study shows that teenagers in germany - particularly those in secondary schools -lrb- hauptschule -rrb- - have a considerable fear of the future in light of the miserable job market and the chronic shortage of training positions , " said foundation chairman prof. heribert meffert in a statement .
less education , greater anxiety it 's exactly those from secondary schools for those students not bound for university who feel that their chances of finding a job are poor .
in the study , more than four of every five asked responded that those aiming for their secondary school degree be at a disadvantage when looking for an apprenticeship or employment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal labor agency logo meffert sees a great danger in the developments .
high youth unemployment would be a threat to the nation 's economy because those teenagers who fail to find a job after completing school are in danger of becoming part of gernany 's long-term unemployed . that 's doubly dangerous : the state would have to pay them welfare benefits , plus they are not paying into the state 's coffers for social benefits .
in addition , the increasing number of retirees means the creation of a gap of some three million skilled laborers , technicians and craftsmen by the year 2015 .
the perceived fragile situation on the job market has created a sense of urgency amongst adolescents .
almost two-thirds of them say they are willing to invest more time for their professional futures - and rightfully so .
eighty-one percent answered that the highest hurdle in the landing of training position is a lack of such positions .
only 26 percent feel that their grades and performance at school are hindrance in finding work .
no time to panic as autumn approaches , the number of those still without a training position stands at 246,400 with only 76,500 available .
last week , the german trade union federation -lrb- dgb -rrb- accused employers of not keeping their word , namely that all youths could find a position .
according to the dgb 's ingrid sehrbock , the adolescents ' situation is getting worse each day .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economics and labor minister wolfgang clement georg braun , the president of the german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- , did not dispute the lack of positions but points out that 205,000 more apprenticeship contracts have been signed in the first seven months this year than last .
german labor minister wolfgang clement -lrb- photo -rrb- said for all sides to not yet panic .
the job training market is not very transparent .
many employers first register open apprenticeships with the local chamber of commerce , and then later with the labor agency , making it hard to judge just how many total number training positions are available .
it also varies extremely from region to region .
in munich , there is a surplus of apprenticeships .
that contrasts with the dire situation in the eastern part of the country .
on average , some 100 job-seekers are fighting for 37 apprenticeships in that economically depressed region .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 08.08.2005 german youths fear future joblessness großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the lucky ones : german youths fear not having a job german teenagers , particularly those leaving school to go directly into the workforce , are preparing themselves for the worst .
a new nationwide study shows that youths have a " considerable fear " of the future . the release of unemployment figures by the german federal labor agency has become a monthly thorn in the side for the gerhard schröder 's administration .
the numbers are gloomy for those without a job .
in july , unemployment stood at 4.77 million , or 11.5 percent .
the dark job picture is now also casting its shadow on the youth of germany .
according to a study conducted by the bertelsmann foundation , over half of the teenagers asked said they were skeptical or downright pessimistic about their chances to find a job after graduating from school .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german trade union federation is resorting to more exotic events , such as this job parade on may 1 , to help youths find work " our study shows that teenagers in germany - particularly those in secondary schools -lrb- hauptschule -rrb- - have a considerable fear of the future in light of the miserable job market and the chronic shortage of training positions , " said foundation chairman prof. heribert meffert in a statement .
less education , greater anxiety it 's exactly those from secondary schools for those students not bound for university who feel that their chances of finding a job are poor .
in the study , more than four of every five asked responded that those aiming for their secondary school degree be at a disadvantage when looking for an apprenticeship or employment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal labor agency logo meffert sees a great danger in the developments .
high youth unemployment would be a threat to the nation 's economy because those teenagers who fail to find a job after completing school are in danger of becoming part of gernany 's long-term unemployed . that 's doubly dangerous : the state would have to pay them welfare benefits , plus they are not paying into the state 's coffers for social benefits .
in addition , the increasing number of retirees means the creation of a gap of some three million skilled laborers , technicians and craftsmen by the year 2015 .
the perceived fragile situation on the job market has created a sense of urgency amongst adolescents .
almost two-thirds of them say they are willing to invest more time for their professional futures - and rightfully so .
eighty-one percent answered that the highest hurdle in the landing of training position is a lack of such positions .
only 26 percent feel that their grades and performance at school are hindrance in finding work .
no time to panic as autumn approaches , the number of those still without a training position stands at 246,400 with only 76,500 available .

however , just the fact that i was checking up on gerhard schröder and angela merkel after quaffing down a tasty cappuccino clearly outs me as a teutonic political junky . fortunately , such predilections should serve me well in this new weekly column .

that 's because schröder , who can not dissolve parliament himself , was forced to fake losing a confidence vote to trigger the early election one year before his second four-year term had ended .
that has led some disgruntled backbenchers of schröder 's own center-left coalition of social democrats and greens to petition the country 's highest court to stop the poll on the grounds the chancellor circumvented the constitution . i would tend to agree with the assessment that the confidence vote was less than kosher .
however , i also think germany desperately needs to be shaken out of its current self-pitying , reform-fearing , navel-gazing malaise .
and the best way to do that is by going to the polls this fall .
the country ca n't afford to wait another year .
berlin would face certain political gridlock as schröder 's agenda would be stymied by the conservative opposition , which controls the upper house of parliament , and rebel leftwing mps in his own party . that still does n't completely eliminate all of the queasiness i feel about clearly disingenuous path taken toward an early election and is why the next government will also need to pursue an amendment to the constitution allowing the chancellor to dissolve parliament in future . stable democracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german flag flying next to the glass dome of the reichstag .

18 .
this week , marc young considers the constitutional controversy surrounding the poll . i may have lived in germany too long . how else can i explain going online during my recent holiday in sardinia to read up on the latest political happenings in berlin ? admittedly , i was n't constantly mulling the possible unconstitutionality of germany 's early general election as i was splashing about in the island 's emerald green seas or sleeping on a white sandy beach .
however , just the fact that i was checking up on gerhard schröder and angela merkel after quaffing down a tasty cappuccino clearly outs me as a teutonic political junky . fortunately , such predilections should serve me well in this new weekly column .
from the perspective of an informed outsider , i will aim to analyze and scrutinize what could be the most important german election campaign in a generation .
i encourage readers to use the feedback link at the bottom of each commentary to share their own thoughts on the topics i delve into . it wo n't be news to anyone who occasionally visits dw-world that germany is in the midst of a serious economic crisis .
whoever wins the election in september will have to tackle the county 's twin woes of high unemployment and sluggish growth .
but the next chancellor will also have to address a crisis of confidence affecting germany 's collective psyche . that is , if there even is an election . all major political parties and an overwhelming majority of the public support schröder 's decision to bring forward the general election by a year , but germany 's constitutional court could still put the brakes on a campaign that is now in full swing . circumventing the constitution ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's constitutional court in karlsruhe .
that 's because schröder , who can not dissolve parliament himself , was forced to fake losing a confidence vote to trigger the early election one year before his second four-year term had ended .
that has led some disgruntled backbenchers of schröder 's own center-left coalition of social democrats and greens to petition the country 's highest court to stop the poll on the grounds the chancellor circumvented the constitution . i would tend to agree with the assessment that the confidence vote was less than kosher .
however , i also think germany desperately needs to be shaken out of its current self-pitying , reform-fearing , navel-gazing malaise .
and the best way to do that is by going to the polls this fall .
the country ca n't afford to wait another year .
berlin would face certain political gridlock as schröder 's agenda would be stymied by the conservative opposition , which controls the upper house of parliament , and rebel leftwing mps in his own party . that still does n't completely eliminate all of the queasiness i feel about clearly disingenuous path taken toward an early election and is why the next government will also need to pursue an amendment to the constitution allowing the chancellor to dissolve parliament in future . stable democracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german flag flying next to the glass dome of the reichstag .
yes , germany 's post-war founding fathers had plenty of good reasons for making the dissolution of the bundestag a difficult affair .
germany 's basic law was written to prevent the political instability seen during the weimar republic that helped hitler come to power in 1933 .
but who can seriously argue today that modern germany is not a stable and mature democracy ? as far as representing the will of the voters , germany 's system of proportional representation is vastly superior to the first-past-post methods used by britain and many other countries .
but it is an anachronism that the chancellor does not have the power to dissolve parliament like the leaders of other parliamentary democracies . it is time for that to change .
the present dire state germany finds itself in means politicians and the public are willing to let the blatantly faked confidence vote last month slide with a wink and nudge .
but unless the basic law is amended to avoid such a situation in the future , germany 's leaders will be tacitly legitimizing such political hocus pocus . and that would be far more damaging to germany 's democratic institutions than by giving the chancellor the power to dissolve parliament . marc young , dw-world send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de köhler gives go ahead for early elections german president horst köhler told his compatriots on thursday that he would dissolve parliament and called for federal elections on september 18 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 08.08.2005 springer-prosieben merger under scrutiny großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dawn of a new cross-media epoch for springer publishing the announced takeover of the german broadcaster prosiebensat.1 by the publishing giant axel springer is raising concerns about the effects it may have on the diversity of the german media scene . reactions to the deal in which axel springer , the largest german newspaper publisher , will take over the country 's largest tv broadcaster , prosiebensat.1 , have been mixed in germany . while bavarian prime minister edmund stoiber of the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- was among the first to greet the announced merger as an " obvious strengthening of the media sector in germany , " his political opponents from the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- expressed a great deal of concern . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ludwig stiegler : the merger is not yet a done deal ludwig stiegler , vice-president of the spd group in the german parliament , described the proposed merger as " a worrisome concentration of influence in one conservative publishing house . " " springer should n't rejoice too soon .
i am positive that the antitrust authorities will closely inspect the merger , " said stiegler . the italian syndrome monika griefahn -lrb- spd -rrb- , president of the parliamentary committee on culture and media , expressed her concern for the future of media diversity in germany .
as a counter-measure to the homogenization of media power , griefahn is advocating the creation of advisory boards under public law that would accompany commercial radio and tv stations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : monika griefahn is advocating public control of private media companies " above all , we should avoid developing relationships similar to those in italy , " griefahn said , referring to the much criticized concentration of power of information under the umbrella of prime minister silvio berlusconi 's media empire . representatives of other german media groups were equally concerned .
michael grabner , vice-president of holtzbrinck publishing group from stuttgart and publisher of such widely circulated german newspapers as die zeit and handelsblatt , stressed that the springer - prosiebensat.1 merger would create " a great media power not only in the field of journalism , but also on the advertising market .

the german government has appealed to the mullahs in tehran to consider carefully the eu 's proposals . in a moment that the european union hoped would not come , iran has partially resumed sensitive nuclear fuel work at its isfahan nuclear facility .
the move came after the un 's nuclear watchdog iaea began installing surveillance equipment , and sent a clear signal that iran , at least for the moment , is not going to bow to the wishes of britain , france and germany , known as the eu-3 , to desist from its uranium conversion operations .
earlier monday , iaea officials had said the recommencement would not start until later in the week .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 08.08.2005 german youths fear future joblessness großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the lucky ones : german youths fear not having a job german teenagers , particularly those leaving school to go directly into the workforce , are preparing themselves for the worst .
a new nationwide study shows that youths have a " considerable fear " of the future . the release of unemployment figures by the german federal labor agency has become a monthly thorn in the side for the gerhard schröder 's administration .
the numbers are gloomy for those without a job .
in july , unemployment stood at 4.77 million , or 11.5 percent .
the dark job picture is now also casting its shadow on the youth of germany .
according to a study conducted by the bertelsmann foundation , over half of the teenagers asked said they were skeptical or downright pessimistic about their chances to find a job after graduating from school .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german trade union federation is resorting to more exotic events , such as this job parade on may 1 , to help youths find work " our study shows that teenagers in germany - particularly those in secondary schools -lrb- hauptschule -rrb- - have a considerable fear of the future in light of the miserable job market and the chronic shortage of training positions , " said foundation chairman prof. heribert meffert in a statement .
less education , greater anxiety it 's exactly those from secondary schools for those students not bound for university who feel that their chances of finding a job are poor .
in the study , more than four of every five asked responded that those aiming for their secondary school degree be at a disadvantage when looking for an apprenticeship or employment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal labor agency logo meffert sees a great danger in the developments .
high youth unemployment would be a threat to the nation 's economy because those teenagers who fail to find a job after completing school are in danger of becoming part of gernany 's long-term unemployed . that 's doubly dangerous : the state would have to pay them welfare benefits , plus they are not paying into the state 's coffers for social benefits .
in addition , the increasing number of retirees means the creation of a gap of some three million skilled laborers , technicians and craftsmen by the year 2015 .
the perceived fragile situation on the job market has created a sense of urgency amongst adolescents .
almost two-thirds of them say they are willing to invest more time for their professional futures - and rightfully so .
eighty-one percent answered that the highest hurdle in the landing of training position is a lack of such positions .
only 26 percent feel that their grades and performance at school are hindrance in finding work .
no time to panic as autumn approaches , the number of those still without a training position stands at 246,400 with only 76,500 available .
last week , the german trade union federation -lrb- dgb -rrb- accused employers of not keeping their word , namely that all youths could find a position .
according to the dgb 's ingrid sehrbock , the adolescents ' situation is getting worse each day .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economics and labor minister wolfgang clement georg braun , the president of the german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- , did not dispute the lack of positions but points out that 205,000 more apprenticeship contracts have been signed in the first seven months this year than last .
german labor minister wolfgang clement -lrb- photo -rrb- said for all sides to not yet panic .
the job training market is not very transparent .
many employers first register open apprenticeships with the local chamber of commerce , and then later with the labor agency , making it hard to judge just how many total number training positions are available .
it also varies extremely from region to region .
in munich , there is a surplus of apprenticeships .
that contrasts with the dire situation in the eastern part of the country .
on average , some 100 job-seekers are fighting for 37 apprenticeships in that economically depressed region .
with the poor prospects there , the fears of many german youths may turn out to be all too real . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de young germans prove big spenders germans have long been accused of being too prudent when it comes to spending .

schröder and merkel much to the annoyance of their partners in government the greens , germany 's social democrats have begun discussing the possibility of a grand coalition with the conservative opposition . chancellor gerhard schröder and social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- chief franz müntefering have ruled it out .
many in the party , also fail to see the common ground .
but now there 's increasing talk by some ministers in the schröder administration that after expected general election on september 18 , the unthinkable may just become reality - a grand coalition with the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
a number of senior social democrats backtracked on previous statements and came out in support of the idea of a grand coalition - if everything else fails .
social democrat labor and economics minister wolfgang clement said it would be no sin to enter a grand coalition .
he called it a reasonable democratic option and one which could open up new opportunities to reform the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finance minister hans eichel has expressed he 's open to a grand coaltion speaking in the same vein , social democrat finance minister hans eichel insisted that a grand coalition was definitely not beyond his imagination .
he claimed that both the social democrats and the opposition conservatives had an interest in cutting the country 's gaping budget deficit and saw opportunities to cut obsolete state subsidies together .
interior minister otto schily has also joined the list , saying on german public television on monday that should the election end with the defeat of the current center-left coalition , then the party should n't " rule out the option of a grand coalition . "
criticism from coalition partner , left the odd-man out in the grand coalition constellation is naturally the spd 's current junior coalition partner , the green party .

a new nationwide study shows that youths have a " considerable fear " of the future . the release of unemployment figures by the german federal labor agency has become a monthly thorn in the side for the gerhard schröder 's administration .
the numbers are gloomy for those without a job .
in july , unemployment stood at 4.77 million , or 11.5 percent .
the dark job picture is now also casting its shadow on the youth of germany .
according to a study conducted by the bertelsmann foundation , over half of the teenagers asked said they were skeptical or downright pessimistic about their chances to find a job after graduating from school .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german trade union federation is resorting to more exotic events , such as this job parade on may 1 , to help youths find work " our study shows that teenagers in germany - particularly those in secondary schools -lrb- hauptschule -rrb- - have a considerable fear of the future in light of the miserable job market and the chronic shortage of training positions , " said foundation chairman prof. heribert meffert in a statement .
less education , greater anxiety it 's exactly those from secondary schools for those students not bound for university who feel that their chances of finding a job are poor .
in the study , more than four of every five asked responded that those aiming for their secondary school degree be at a disadvantage when looking for an apprenticeship or employment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal labor agency logo meffert sees a great danger in the developments .
high youth unemployment would be a threat to the nation 's economy because those teenagers who fail to find a job after completing school are in danger of becoming part of gernany 's long-term unemployed . that 's doubly dangerous : the state would have to pay them welfare benefits , plus they are not paying into the state 's coffers for social benefits .
in addition , the increasing number of retirees means the creation of a gap of some three million skilled laborers , technicians and craftsmen by the year 2015 .
the perceived fragile situation on the job market has created a sense of urgency amongst adolescents .
almost two-thirds of them say they are willing to invest more time for their professional futures - and rightfully so .
eighty-one percent answered that the highest hurdle in the landing of training position is a lack of such positions .
only 26 percent feel that their grades and performance at school are hindrance in finding work .
no time to panic as autumn approaches , the number of those still without a training position stands at 246,400 with only 76,500 available .
last week , the german trade union federation -lrb- dgb -rrb- accused employers of not keeping their word , namely that all youths could find a position .
according to the dgb 's ingrid sehrbock , the adolescents ' situation is getting worse each day .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economics and labor minister wolfgang clement georg braun , the president of the german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- , did not dispute the lack of positions but points out that 205,000 more apprenticeship contracts have been signed in the first seven months this year than last .
german labor minister wolfgang clement -lrb- photo -rrb- said for all sides to not yet panic .
the job training market is not very transparent .
many employers first register open apprenticeships with the local chamber of commerce , and then later with the labor agency , making it hard to judge just how many total number training positions are available .
it also varies extremely from region to region .
in munich , there is a surplus of apprenticeships .
that contrasts with the dire situation in the eastern part of the country .
on average , some 100 job-seekers are fighting for 37 apprenticeships in that economically depressed region .

the group which wrote the report was made up of representatives of wales ' four regional social care partnerships , the welsh local government association , trade union unison , the british association of social workers , the care council for wales and the society of chief personnel officers .
paul elliott , head of local government for unison wales , welcomed the report .
he added : " the recruitment and retention crisis in social work is acute and is ... impacting on the most vulnerable members of our society . "

the crew on board the space shuttle have conducted inspections of discovery 's belly and repairs to the shuttle have also been carried out .
stephen robinson has begun a unique spacewalk , going under the orbiter 's belly to remove two ceramic strips sticking out between heatshield tiles .
nasa engineers are concerned the strips would cause part of discovery to overheat as it re-enters the earth 's atmosphere .
discovery had been due to return to earth on 7 august , but nasa has decided to extend the mission by an extra day .
what do you think of the mission so far ?
how do you feel about the mission being extended ?
what do you think about the repairs ?

read a selection of your comments below .
click here to read a second page of your comments the following comments reflect the balance of opinion we have received so far : the money that is spent by the american government on space exploration could be much better spent on healthcare and education .
this would be much more beneficial to the american people than discovery 's mission .
carolynne burkholder , vancouver , british columbia i can not believe that the crew had to cobble together a hacksaw norman west , truro , cornwall i can not believe that the crew had to cobble together a hacksaw .
a small box of tools from any diy shop would have done the job .
also removing a gap filler between the tiles exposes a gap .
surely the wind can get in and potentially lift a tile causing a fatal problem .
norman west , truro , cornwall whilst i can see that advances may be made through this work , i saw two items on the news last night - one about children dying because they have n't got a few quid , the other about spending millions on keeping the shuttles going in and out of space .
priority check please .
mark , didcot , england space travel is dangerous , pioneers are going to die , but it is worthwhile .
what is needed now are new spaceships to let us travel between planets .
at the moment all our eggs are in one basket , we need to find other homes on other worlds .
we have made this one nearly uninhabitable .
i would go into space whatever the risk .
ruth , walsall maybe if all the countries stopped being so petty and pooled their resources , we 'd have superior technology and fewer incidents like this .
we do n't need to race against each other anymore to try and prove who 's superior ; instead we should look to a future of co-operation .
gaz , cardiff , uk i will never understand why we waste so much money on primitive space stations john gearing , st. helens , uk i will never understand why we waste so much money on primitive space stations and shuttles which clearly have no function for the human race at this time .
i do n't know why we do n't get all our experts and fund them in coming up with unmanned technologies and technology in shuttles that could take us to planets not to a tin can in the sky which is over expensive and serves no function to the mass population .
john gearing , st. helens , uk fascinating a brit would ask the question why the us is sending people into space .
as the brit , george mallory said in 1924 , " because its there " .
mt everest killed mallory and we remember him for his quest .
in a similar quest , the us will continue to go into space - because its there .
john b , windermere , florida do some of these contributors have no soul ?
what could be more magnificent than seeing human beings taking risks to explore the unknown ; triumphing over the problems they meet along the way ; opening up new horizons for the rest of us ?
yes let 's invest in a new space transportation system , and more manned flights , and unmanned probes and a bigger , better space station .
but to claim that stopping the current flights is sensible shows no faith in the species at all .
stop looking down at the ground and start looking up at the stars .
john r smith , uk please , armchair scientists , let the experts at nasa do their job making the risk calculations .
they 've got the know-how and the tools to make the decisions .
not you or me .
joe , usa this is the most ridiculous expenditure of precious funds in a time of great national travail .
nasa is an anachronism , a patronistic pet rock that has no justification whatsoever , especially in the current environment in which civilized societies are fighting for their mere existence .
the irresponsibility in launching this mission in the face of known deficiencies is appalling .
c. a. la varre , newport , ri usa the media paints such a doom and gloom picture of what is happening above us phil , hampshire , uk why-oh-why does the media take such a negative view to what the men and women on sts114 are doing .
the media paints such a doom and gloom picture of what is happening above us .
we as a united world should watch and praise these people who are up there performing the most fantastic things known to mankind .
yes there is a difficult time coming on returning to earth but the crew at this time seem very positive about it .
may i suggest that you all watch nasa tv on the web for real live happenings .
phil , hampshire , uk nasa is undergoing drastic changes .
i think the us should pause and take stock of what 's happening to their space missions .
give it a break , sort out problems and return 10years later .
i wonder how the us ever landed man on the moon ?
did they really ?
i wonder !
errol , dubai , uae space flight is still in its infancy .
so the fact that an astronaut was able to make a repair to the shuttle in space is a great triumph .
nasa should look on this feat in a positive light , not a negative one .
we know in the days of sailing ships as they travelled the globe to discover new lands , there were many times when sailors had to climb up masts in storms to make repairs , so is repairing space craft in flight any different ?
leon aarons , petach israel another piece of space theatre , justifying manned flight .
unmanned craft can put payloads into orbit much more cheaply , as well as exploring other planets .
martin , dubai , uae i 've just seen a picture of the tool , held together with strong tape that the astronauts used .
it 's great to imagine that a billion-dollar aircraft can be saved by a bit of strong tape and some elbow grease !
it 's that sort of thinking that 's saved astronauts in the past .
good luck to them , hope humans carry on going into space for many more years .
dave , manchester , uk this spacewalk and repair demonstrates two things .
firstly , the courage and initiative of the astronauts , secondly , the importance of retiring the ageing shuttle fleet and building a modern spacecraft .
electronics and materials technology have advanced tremendously in the past 30 years , but the shuttle is still using outdated technology .
gordon mcstraun , uk so , the offending piece if gap filler from between a couple of heat shields .
i 'm no nasa expert , but does n't this mean that the is now a gap between these tiles ?
michael , bucks , uk the astronauts are all volunteers , they know the risks involved , and that is why i praise and thank them kirsty , cambridge , uk i think it is fantastic that discovery has launched and its mission is going well .
a lesson has been learnt from colombia , and indeed , challenger .
the astronauts are all volunteers , they know the risks involved , and that is why i praise and thank them .
they are incredible people .
kirsty , cambridge , uk so what if the filler problem has to be fixed with a jerry-rigged hacksaw ?
this type of ingenuity has been saving lives since the age of tall ships and can only reflect well on the tenacity of the nasa engineers and astronauts .
remember when the progress hit mir ?
apollo 13 ?
we need the experience of these problems to give us the know-how to survive in space and give us the confidence in our ability to solve problems on longer , bolder voyages .
tim parker , edinburgh , scotland i work with remote operated vehicles in the oil and gas industry .
i am amazed that the crew of the discovery need to cobble together a makeshift hacksaw to carry out a job on the tiles .
the shuttles are old and things will go wrong so you would expect a decent tool kit to be onboard .
james , paderne , portugal why are the americans still sending people into space ?
if they want to explore they should be thinking of unmanned flights with intelligent technology which can spend decades in space .
this should help the ozone layer repair itself .
more is needed to be done to explore and catalogue this planet and its systems , this will be of more benefit to mankind and our home than space travel .
haz , nottingham , uk is going up in the shuttle much more dangerous than sailing unknown oceans a few hundred years ago in wooden ships ?
thank goodness that throughout history not everyone has wanted to sit at home in comfort in their own small world .
simon , manchester , uk with so many comings and goings to and from iss , would it not be sensible for just the bare minimum of crew to return in this shuttle and send up a half-empty shuttle to collect the rest of them ?
why take unnecessary risks ?
fraser irving , sheffield , uk until now , the shuttle missions have been routine , like taking a walk in the park .
but the reality of danger with the loss of two shuttles has almost brought the space program to its knees .
should it continue ?
of course it must go on because too much is at stake .
closing the space station , and not looking into space is the worst we can do .
life on earth is becoming dangerous .
we must look to the stars if humanity is to survive .
walter , chapel hill , nc i think - and hope - this flight is one of the safest ever .
my guess is the problems have appeared simply because they have been looking for them far more carefully than before .
however , there 's no doubt a replacement spacecraft is needed .
the private " space ship one " has a slow re-entry , avoiding thermal problems .
is this possible from orbit ?
and a separate , unmanned cargo vehicle seems a " no-brainer " .
simon , bristol it must be frightening for the astronauts but the space programme must prevail anya , london pioneers always take risks so that everyone else can eventually follow .
it must be frightening for the astronauts but the space programme must prevail .
updated technology is definitely needed .
unmanned missions are a good idea , but ultimately there is no substitute for human actions and reactions .
anya , london interesting to note that the two shuttle losses have not been due to design or engineering flaws in the shuttle themselves , but rather the propulsion system .
for 30 year old vehicles , i think the shuttles are doing pretty well , and i am sure they will continue for a long time .
matt , bristol space exploration is dangerous and the crew knows this better than any of us - and they still volunteered for it .
my view is that we need to continue to explore space and the shuttle repair should be seen as an experience that needs to be faced at some time .
let 's not be weak about this .
george , chelmsford what nasa has done is simply awesome .
nasa is the adventurer of our era , looking at and investigating things that are far bigger than us .
i say ground the space shuttles , but do not skimp on quickly building bigger , better , and safer spacecraft to replace them .
sk , ithaca , ny space technology is too integrated in our daily lives now peter byrd , worcester the few people who mock space projects should not use anything connected with space technology as a protest !
i bet hardly anyone would manage it or really want to .
space technology is too integrated in our daily lives now ; we all enjoy the advantages we get from it .
nasa tv via the net alone shows me how wonderful space is .
peter byrd , worcester i have just returned from florida where i was privileged enough to witness the breathtaking launch first hand .
it seems as though there are increasing difficulties using these shuttles .
are the lives of 7 astronauts each time it takes off a risk that is worth taking ?
matt , london given the loss of columbia and the uncertainty of this mission , nasa should scrap the shuttle programme .
luck prevented previous disasters and it would appear nasa 's luck has run out .
what makes them feel confident that they can repair in space what they failed to repair in two years on the ground ?
my thoughts are with the families of those on the iss .
phil , bracknell , uk the problems with discovery must have been encountered with all the previous shuttle flights .
it appears that each time it took off , it was russian roulette as to whether it would return safely .
this program should be abandoned until a new and safer means of transporting the shuttle into space can be developed .
chris , brazil will the resulting depression between the tiles create a possibility of a chink in the armour ?
k chowksey , bangalore , india even if the pieces sticking out are pulled or hacked , will the resulting depression between the tiles create a possibility of a chink in the armour ?
even a depression can alter the aerodynamic behaviour -lrb- as in golf balls -rrb- .
this will create uneven heat distribution .
k chowksey , bangalore , india from the idealists point of view we really should not be thinking about costs here .
space exploration is vital , not only to our technological development as a species , but also in terms of our wider understanding of the universe .
the whole nasa infrastructure is quite frankly awesome .
every endeavour has its risks and we 've seen the tragic consequences of those risks with the previous accidents .
chris , bracknell we need to explore space ; when you go to hospital and have a cat scan or an mri , that technology has come from the space program .
there is nothing wrong with the shuttle - the problem is with the way it is maintained .
they need to do better , i do n't know why do n't they paint it again , and seal the foam .
carol , pa , usa the saddest thing for me about this mission is that the next time the iss is visible from england on august 11th , the shuttle will have already left .
hopefully we 'll get to see the shuttle during the next mission .
after the moon , the iss is the brightest object in the night sky .
john airey , peterborough i looked at the images of the underside of the shuttle and thought that it looked like really bad bathroom tiling rob , spain major advances need to be made to the whole concept of effective re-entry heat-shield technology .
even before lift-off , i looked at the images of the underside of the shuttle and thought that it looked like really bad bathroom tiling .
initially , i expected it to be a smooth , seamless surface , but it was a patchwork of light and dark areas with patches that looked more raised than others .
i assume that tiles are the best option at the moment , but in future this issue needs to be solved completely .
rob , spain if nasa has decided to just rip out the relatively small strips protruding from between the heat shield tiles , then why ca n't they ask astronaut steve robinson to take his experimental repair kit out with him and fill the gaps with the mastic gum that they used to ' fix ' the tiles in their earlier experiments ?
paul greer , gothenburg , sweden i worked as an engineer on skylab in the 70s and i consider this nasa debacle a disgrace .
unknown risk is one thing , but gambling with lives on known problems with solutions is unacceptable .
i say : bring some crew home in russian capsule , leave the rest of the crew up there , fix the foam on atlantis -lrb- and everything else possible -rrb- and then send a rescue mission .
then ground the antiques and use modern technology to build new spacecraft .
rich dusek , orchard lake , mi , us bruce from huntsville says it 's not a trivial engineering problem and he 's probably right .
but that does n't alter the documented fact that nasa has sent people into space against the advice of contractors who have told them that certain aspects are n't safe .
if shuttles are prone to bits falling off then they should n't be flying .
david , chelmsford uk nasa do n't build all the parts and therefore an outside company may be partly responsible james , uk why do people expect space travel to be perfectly safe ?
look at any picture of launch and remember the orange tank is full of fuel and both white rockets once started ca n't be stopped .
man in space is an essential part of our future .
the earth can not sustain us forever particularly its natural resources .
i also think people should recognise that nasa do n't build all the parts and therefore an outside company may be partly responsible .
james , uk the problems with the space transportation system are a classic example of what happens when whole-life costs are not taken into account during early design phases of the system .
congress chose to buy shuttle on the cheap , opting for solid fuel boosters and a disposable fuel tank instead of spending extra money upfront to design a fully-reusable fly-back first stage to take the orbiter into space .
the result has been far higher operating costs and , tragically , the loss of fourteen astronauts .
will it be too much to hope that senior agency managers and politicians will learn these lessons in defining our future access to space ?
in europe as well as the usa .
phil , bath , uk so far this particular mission has been very worrying for relatives of the discovery crew .
any venture into space is a risk , but this one seems to have gone ahead knowing this risk factor was much higher than usual .
why are these missions so important ?
the risk factor is too great to risk innocent lives .
stop them now .
jose a holmes , loughborough , england i wish the crew a safe return but am sorry to see resources wasted on a manned flight with little real value for essentially political and pr reasons while much more scientifically valuable unmanned work is scaled back to pay for it .
this is all about the advancement of the usa , not science .
julian , london , uk the debris issue has been present in the shuttle programme from day one .
the tiles themselves are so fragile you can break them with one hand .
the space shuttle is a wonderful vehicle , but sadly owing to it 's bizarre design , is inherently dangerous and needs to be replaced soon .
as richard feynman said after the challenger disaster , " for a successful technology , reality must take precedence over public relations , for nature can not be fooled . "
chris dyer , bristol , england the immediate future of the space program will be best served by robot missions dr malcolm fairbairn , uk / sweden i , like most people connected with astrophysics , think that the immediate future of the space program will be best served by robot missions for at least the next twenty years .
it 's not taking a step backwards ; it 's about developing and testing new technologies which will eventually be applied to human spaceflight .
for the same amount of money you get much more science done with robotic missions because you do n't have to worry about the fragile humans .
dr malcolm fairbairn , uk / sweden as an aerospace engineer , in this particular instance i am not worried about discovery .
all indications are that the debris did no damage .
long term , though , it could be a problem .
the space shuttle has never fulfilled the promises that were made for it .
it is an expensive vehicle of very limited utility .
it consumes resources which could be better used elsewhere in the us space program .
andrew ogilvie , modesto , california , usa robert heinlein said it : " the earth is too small and fragile a basket for humanity to keep all its eggs in . "
the only safe place to be when disaster comes -lrb- an asteroid for example -rrb- is somewhere else .
well done , discovery .
keep it up .
john fielder , workington , uk there are a lot of negative comments on here by people who really have not done their research .
there are so many inventions that have come to be due to space travel most are indirect , technology passed to the public after it has been created to aid nasa and the like in various projects .
adam ransom , birmingham space flight is one of the things that most excites me jehuda arieh veenman , haifa , israel space flight is one of the things that most excites me .
it breaks my heart that foam broke off the insulation again .
apparently , the design has a basic flaw ; the vulnerable heat shield is exposed to a bombardment of debris falling of during take off .
in the more old fashioned designs , the heat shields were protected during take off .
jehuda arieh veenman , haifa , israel it seems to me that the logical fix for the launch system would be to mount the shuttle higher relative to the fuel tank .
the coldness of the fuel is always going to be a problem in causing freezing of water and air in and around the foam insulation .
since that is the nature of the beast , get the shuttle out of harms way above the possible falling debris nigel dandridge-perry , los angeles ca , usa good luck discovery , i look forward to seeing a safe flight back to earth .
mark , dorset there is no progress with manned missions .
it 's more of the same .
while unmanned missions are discovering lakes of water on mars , landing on distant moons and exploring planets , the manned missions are trying to work out how to stop foam falling off the fuel tank .
leave floating around in orbit to the chinese and get exploring .
matt , amsterdam , the netherlands -lrb- ex .
uk -rrb- the shuttle programme shows the greatness the human race can achieve when we focus d ward , portsmouth those who fly orbiters know the risks and accept the challenge .
the shuttle programme shows the greatness the human race can achieve when we focus .
a commitment should be made to give it whatever financial support it needs to continue .
nasa tv shows discovery 's latest mission is gripping .
we owe it to those astronauts who have lost their lives in space exploration , to carry on the work that they could n't finish .
d ward , portsmouth i have become addicted to nasa tv over the last few days , and find myself staring into space , thinking of discovery up there somewhere ... looking back on our little planet from a distance .
i am surely concerned about the debris ; remember nasa did not think this would be a problem for the ill-fated columbia crew either .
they have spent two years and thousands of dollars on this problem - so yes , i think we should be concerned , not only about the debris ' implications , but also that nasa got it wrong again .
verity worthington , bewdley , worcestershire hundreds of years ago people were afraid that they could sail off the edges of the earth .
thank heavens there were brave sailors then willing to push the limits of courage and technology , and thank heavens we still have them today .
i 'm also grateful that there are still those willing to fund such expeditions .
rob g. , kansas city , usa the disaster 2 years ago , and these recent problems with the shuttle show that nasa really need to get on with developing the next generation of re-useable shuttles .
technology has moved on so much in the nearly 30 years since it was developed with computer technology and new lightweight materials .
if they do n't , then the private space firms will take over , while nasa keeps flogging a dead horse .
tane piper , edinburgh , uk we are all with you , looking forward for success .
god be with you .
no surrender no retreat .
martin madulu , moshi - tanzania i am more worried about the apparent loss of a tile than the foam .
if any of the tiles were damaged , the mission is in jeopardy .
after the columbia disaster , i read an article published in 1980 calling the shuttles ' death traps ' .
considering that we 've already lost half the fleet , i think it is high time nasa invested in a different , more robust technology .
istvan , detroit , usa the safety of the crew should be of utmost importance , not launch schedules ss , usa my family and i were vacationing in florida at the time of the launch .
we saw it speeding skyward from the car on our way back home .
i am an aerospace design engineer specializing in flight dynamics .
my concern really lies with the inadequacy with which nasa has dealt with the foam / tile problem .
the safety of the crew should be of utmost importance , not launch schedules .
ss , usa only those at nasa who have looked at the images of debris falling will have the best idea .
the crew 's safe return is just our concern but it 's their mission .
venkat maruthamuthu , urbana , il , usa why was this problem not resolved after columbia two years ago ?
it is very wrong to send yet more people up there without being absolutely sure that it 's safe .
perhaps space travel should wait until we have progressed far enough that we are not relying on tiles that can just fall off ?
catherine , cheshunt , herts great to see the shuttle soar again .
our future lies not on earth but out there somewhere .
no matter how you argue it , in the future this planet will die and so will all those life forms still on it .
if the human species is to survive , then it must do so elsewhere and this sort of technology is the first step towards that ultimate goal .
ian jordan , wokingham the foam formulation was changed in 1996 ... most of the foam issues started after this change bruce g , huntsville , usa this is not a trivial engineering problem as some have implied .
there are two types of foam : a lightweight foam covering the large areas of the tank and a dense ablator foam covering areas exposed to aerodynamic heating .
the foam is exposed to supersonic airflow at about 27000 km / h -lrb- 17000 mph -rrb- during launch .
there are shock cones coming from the orbiter , the connecting struts and solid boosters which impinge on the tank .
there is also a lot of vibration .
the foam formulation was changed in 1996 to comply with the montreal protocol and eliminate the freon propellant .
most of the foam issues started after this change and may or may not be associated with it .
the shuttle is due to be retired in 2010 and solving this problem is important for future spacecraft design .
bruce g , huntsville , usa why ca n't the return module be encased within the main take off rocket ?
this would prevent bits flying off from damaging it .
tony lee , telford we were on vacation in orlando , and had tickets for the astronaut hall of fame to watch the original scheduled lift-off on 13 july .
we had such a good view , but with about an hour or so to go , the launch was cancelled .
we were gutted to have missed such a spectacular sight !
we watched it on television back here in ireland , but felt we had a special bond with sts 114 - return to flight .
we just hope now for the safe return of the shuttle and its crew on 7 august .
good luck to them .
hutch family , ireland one day when someone is sipping cocktails on saturn 's lunar resort , whilst looking back at the earth and the distant sun , they 'll thank these brave people for risking their lives .
let 's keep our nerve , and not look back .
chris phillips , chelmsford , essex it is an inherent part of our nature to explore caroline , edinburgh , uk i used to work at one of the nasa centres -lrb- in maryland -rrb- and i hope that space exploration continues .
as a scientist it is an inherent part of our nature to explore , discover and find out about the unknown .
i was overjoyed to see the launch of discovery and hope , beyond all hope , that they make it safely home .
as nasa have said - " exploring space is not for the faint hearted ' - it 's a huge undertaking " .
the astronauts know that , we all know that .
these are very brave people and i wish them , and nasa , well with their endeavours .
caroline , edinburgh , uk watching this made me feel giddy .
now hopefully we can complete the iss and get on with the business of colonising space .
the spirit of adventure lives on with discovery and her crew .
david mills , ballymena , uk we were very privileged to be able to see discovery launch when it flew mission 105 and the impression it left us with was ' it was amazing to see ' .
we believe that the crew and the engineers will be able to work together and face the challenge of bringing back this magnificent ship .
instead of shrinking from the challenge we should rise up to it just as they did in 1970 for apollo 13 , it is only by stretching our knowledge such as in times of emergencies that we reach beyond our capabilities .
good luck and best wishes to the crew and engineers .
julie and robert , manchester , england i would like to see the shuttle retired and replaced with a newer fleet scott , edinburgh congratulations to nasa on another successful launch .
however , i would like to see the shuttle retired and replaced with a newer and more capable fleet of vehicles .
not only will it be safer and hugely beneficial to space exploration , the project would provide thousands of jobs , contracts to companies and benefit the global economy .
scott , edinburgh people seem to forget that manned space travel is still very dangerous and those brave astronauts know the risks .
foam has been falling off fuel tanks for nearly 25 years now .
perhaps money should now be invested in developing better glue and a more efficient reusable manned space travel system .
john ellis , nottingham statistically , if commercial flights carried the same risks as spaceflight , there would be about 500 airliner crashes per day .
one therefore has to applaud the courage and determination of those people who accept this degree of risk in pursuit of our quest for knowledge .
we are an inquisitive species , in this case pushing the boundaries of what is possible .
i wish those seven brave souls a safe return .
bob , cheshire i 've been following the ' space race ' since sputnik and the mercury missions , and i ca n't think of anything more exciting than a successful launch .
but why do n't we stop racing against each other and form stronger international collaborations to make space travel safer ?
j forman , los angeles , usa if nasa says the shuttle is safe to fly , it 's safe to fly james , los angeles , usa it amazes me how many observers believe they are more of an expert on shuttle safety and capability than the engineers at nasa .
the fact is , the men and women who work at nasa are at the top of their field .
if they say the shuttle is safe to fly , it 's safe to fly .
james , los angeles , usa it was a beautiful launch .
the space shuttle program has been remarkably successful despite the previous disaster .
nobody can engineer absolute perfection , but this was very close .
h neil , south texas , usa i am very concerned about the damaged tiles on discovery , especially in light of nasa 's apparent slowness in acknowledging that the take-off incident with columbia caused the disaster upon return .
there is an option for the crew of discovery - to wait on the space station for rescue .
how can we even contemplate risking their lives ?
if the problem is serious enough to ground the fleet , discovery too should be ' grounded ' immediately .
sharon , dallas , texas i once saw a presentation on how the challenger disaster came to happen and how it could have been prevented and it made my blood run cold .
suffice it to say , i have nothing but the most profound admiration for the courage of the crews of the shuttle .
i 'm not a religious man , but i just hope to god they all get back safely .
steve , chesham tragic as the columbia accident was , the astronauts died doing what they loved - exploring space , a privilege only the select few get to do .
they also died at the end of their trip so they got to enjoy being in space , unlike the challenger crew .
before the columbia accident , i would expect that the shuttles got through intact in much worse condition than discovery .
i am not that concerned , although i will follow the investigations with great interest .
ian , london it seems ridiculous that it is being jeopardised by something so simple chris , brazil the shuttle has been up and down into space about 50 times before the columbia incident .
i can not believe that bits of foam from the fuel tank did n't come off during these trips .
are n't nasa being a bit super cautious about this problem ?
ca n't they encase the fuel tank in some sort of wire mesh in order to prevent the foam from breaking off ?
in such a high tech programme , it seems ridiculous that it is being jeopardised by something so simple .
chris , brazil what exactly are they doing out there that they have not had the chance to do before ?
first of all get a new ship and then go somewhere else than the moon !
that impressed my grand father , it will take more to impress me !
mathieu , gatineau , canada bits of foam have probably been falling off the shuttle since the first launch , but it 's only since a piece of that debris caused the destruction of columbia two years ago that anyone has noticed !
only now we have cameras watching every single part of the craft do we see what may well have been happening all along .
carry on as normal .
simon , peterborough , uk i remember watching the first ever shuttle flight as a kid .
i watched the launch the other day and got the exact same feelings of awe and excitement .
the shuttle launch is a wake up call to everyone .
sure the world has problems right now but despite those problems , look what we 're capable of !
my message to nasa , the esa and all the other agencies ?
keep going people .
take us there !
andrew k jones , wrexham , uk i watched the launch live on the internet and was overwhelmed .
we wo n't know of the mission 's success until 7 aug , but what surprises me is the us way of making everything big and the huge overhead costs .
it 's all show and little substance .
after having spent $ 1 billion and 2.5 years on the debris falling cause , they are back to square one and the shuttles are grounded again !
on the other hand the russians are making safe manned space missions with pinpoint accuracy every 3-6 months at a fraction of the cost .
rakesh , london uk without space exploration we would not have computers , hi-technology materials etc jim kirk , basildon i read once that spending on cosmetics in the usa dwarfs the nasa budget .
let 's get things in perspective .
without space exploration we would not have computers , hi-technology materials etc , all of which were a by-product .
if more is learned about our planet and its self-destructive population on each mission then we should keep it going .
come home safe guys !
jim kirk , basildon does anyone know why debris falls off a multi-million dollar spacecraft ?
ca n't some sort of outer layer be put around the fuel tank insulation to stop it disintegrating ?
i 'm not an engineer - i need someone else to explain it !
robert , sussex rather than risking the crew and the shuttle , if it is damaged , why do n't they leave it up there as service vehicle and bring the crew back in another shuttle at a later date ?
if nasa wants to survive they need to start making people believe in them again .
good luck discovery !
paul , london the space shuttle was under funded during its design and construction and the compromises mean it will never achieve its true potential .
the sooner it can be replaced with something newer and simpler the better .
david patrick , reading trying to make space exploration 100 % safe is just nonsense .
duncan , nottingham my heart sank when i heard the news that tiles had once again fallen off the space shuttle roger campbell , england my heart sank when i heard the news that tiles had once again fallen off the space shuttle .
if the cause of the tiles falling off is simply the vibration and air flow , then i wonder what will be the effect of the searing heat of re-entry .
roger campbell , england having watched the space shuttle launch on tv , it is good to see such a majestic craft finally back to what she was meant to do .
well done nasa for getting the space shuttle flying .
james , nottingham no-one made that big a deal when tiles were missing from the oms pods after columbia 's maiden flight in 1981 .
when designing this vehicle they must have made a risk assessment to determine safety parameters , and unfortunately the loss of columbia has made them refine these parameters further .
tim parker , edinburgh we watched the launch from our beach , about 90 miles away .
it was spectacular .
there are many more cameras watching the exterior shuttle craft than ever before which have alerted to the problems .
the engineers working for nasa are tireless and will get the current crew back safely one way or another .
the space programme will continue .
the only unknown is manned flights .
the mars rovers are still sending pictures and information long past when they were suppose to .
nasa will continue on and i believe has more government funding this year , or is due for an increase .
private companies are currently working on safe space travel for human passengers in the us and abroad i believe .
joan york , daytona beach , florida usa nasa 's team on the ground and the astronauts in the space are doing a great job for the mankind syed mateen , karachi , pakistan i have witnessed the launching of space shuttle discovery on television screen .
nasa 's team on the ground and the astronauts in the space are doing a great job for the mankind , as their experiences in the space will benefit the entire world .
i pray for the safe return of the astronauts and happy landing of the space shuttle .
as a human being , i am equally concerned about the debris which has fallen at the time of its blast , but hope that the space shuttle will not face the same problem as it did in the past .
the safe return of discovery will boost the moral of nasa 's team , who had worked day and night to make the space shuttle 's mission possible .
syed mateen , karachi , pakistan any country with ambitions to have manned missions to space would be more than happy to have a craft as good as the space shuttle .
if there is a cheaper way to break away from earth than i am all for it but i am not sure how much safer it will be .
exploration has always been a dangerous business .
erik , ft .
collins , u.s.a. manned space flight is a dangerous and expensive anachronism .
look at the success of hubble , the mars rovers and the cassini / huygens mission .
you can do 10 times as much real science for half the cost and no risk to life by concentrating on unmanned space exploration .
and tell me , were n't the pictures of titan far more exciting than anything the crew of the shuttle are likely to get up to ?
max , abu dhabi , uae i read some of the comments here with disbelief .
yes , we all know that there are problems in some areas of the world , it does n't however mean that everything has to stop because of that .
i can think of a lot more things which are more of a waste than space exploration .
i 'll bet half the people complaining about nasa being wasteful drive gas guzzlers and do n't bother to recycle .
the shuttle mission is vital to all areas of science and i 'm glad it is flying again .
the space shuttle is not an old machine ; discovery has only flown 30 times before .
most commercial airlines fly that often in a week !
dave , slough , uk many congratulations to nasa .
as a teacher i teach children who are fascinated by space .
it is good that the space missions continue .
it allows children to hope and dream that they might reach the stars themselves , one day !
michelle , birmingham we all know that it costs millions of dollars to support the space program .
one could argue that money could be better spent elsewhere .
the fact is we as human beings need to understand in order to learn new technologies and space exploration is just one of many things that need to be understood and conquered .
there will always be many arguments for and against the space program .
all i can say right now is well done to nasa and my best wishes for a truly successful return to space flight for discovery .
andrew howlett , cape town , south africa good luck and a safe landings to the crew of the discovery .
there are some here that would have the usa quit funding the space program until all the worlds ' problems are solved .
will you tell your children to wait for that day before pursuing their dreams ?
michael rosenbaum , san francisco , usa a plane crash or 9/11 does not stop air travel , so why should the columbia 2003 disaster stop space exploration ?
i 'm sure discovery will make it back safe and the astronauts will be given a well-deserved pat on the back .
jack , london / memphis the shuttle might be old but it still works , and has done the world a huge service towards on earth and in space exploration .
those who complain are clearly members of the flat earth society , and yet i bet they use technology every day ?
someone has to push the envelope .
go nasa go !
phil w , uk good launch .
let 's just hope she comes back in one piece .
ricardo , brazil the shuttles are aged dinosaurs that need to be " moth balled " before more lives are lost due to fragmenting styrofoam .
perhaps we should all consider shifting funding away from nasa and put it towards alternative fuel sources .
it would be revenue better spent .
kurt stuchell , cambridge , usa scuttle the shuttle gordon , auckland nz scuttle the shuttle !
obsolete equipment supplying a pointless lab .
much fanfare about increasing aid to africa by $ 25b but us military budget $ 400b makes you ill !
gordon , auckland nz i can not stand the mentality of myopic people who would rather we abandon the natural impulse to explore our surroundings , and instead focus on futile efforts to tackle every mundane earthbound problem .
surely , the sight of the shuttle blasting off into orbit is the most poignant statement of mankind 's destiny .
kevin , charlotte , north carolina , usa with so much bad news in the media : terrorism , war , poverty ... it 's wonderful to see what we as human beings can achieve , when we put our minds to something positive .
we have the potential to achieve great things .
the crew of this shuttle mission are from different countries , cultures and backgrounds ; proof that if we work together , we can produce something that makes us all proud .
charlie , newcastle , uk to all those who claim the space programme has helped advance medicine and technology . think how much further along in those fields we could be if all the money wasted at nasa went into development . let alone feeding the poor .
shameful waste of resources .
i do n't want my tax dollar to be spent this way .
p. o 'donnell , rotorua , n.z. there are always small-minded people who are terrified of exploration digby knight , henley-on-thames , uk there are always small-minded people who are terrified of exploration .
if we had their way , we 'd still be living in trees afraid of the dangerous savannah !
thankfully we 've always had a few who have done their best to pioneer new territories and worlds .
digby knight , henley-on-thames , uk i would argue that nasa is somewhat of an anachronism .
the " glory days " of the space race with russia are over .
instead , space exploration should be run by the national science foundation .
there , private and public money can be better organized to fund missions .
the nsf already runs most of the science stations here on earth .
why should space be any different ?
greg , alexandria , va space exploration * is * a waste of money .
had the billions been invested directly in more down-to-earth technologies , we would have seen the same spin-offs in medicine , it , and transport .
anonymous i ca n't believe the childish reactions to space exploration from folks like mike and anon , uk .
grow up , guys .
space exploration represents humanity at its most amazing .
you 're obviously just bitter because the us is leading the way .
typical .
shawn , washington , dc , usa exploration , of all kinds , has always helped man push the boundaries of technology .
the space programme is no different .
for this reason alone it is invaluable .
jason , detroit , usa despite all the delays and expert checks , something still fell off it on take off dan , yateley , uk looking at the shuttle i am always reminded of those creaking old 50 's and 60 's airliners you still see rattling around developing countries .
good in their day , but now so ropey and tired that they just scream " death trap " .
it says it all about the shuttle that despite all the delays and expert checks , something still fell off it on take off .
it 's high time this heap was scrapped , and a replacement worthy of the 21st century was introduced in its place .
dan , yateley , uk so the new ufos are unidentified falling objects ?
phil jones , frangy , france if you watch the film of the launch the piece of debris that falls off after the booster rocket drops off does not come from the shuttle it comes from the giant fuel tank , which is ' disposable ' anyway .
john nichols , brackley , nnorthants , uk how would brits feel if americans were talking about how britain should spend its money ?
michelle , raleigh , nc i think that nasa is still too hurried in launching the shuttle when the debris problem still exists .
maybe they should solve out the problem wholly before doing any thing else .
but the fact still shows that nasa has succeeded in launching the shuttle into space .
maybe that 's an incredible luck , although we still do n't know about the return of it .
but i believe it will succeed , too .
god 's will give luck to the crew .
nguyen hoang giang , hanoi , vietnam i just pray she makes it back down ok seun , london uk it was an excellent feeling seeing discovery go like that yesterday .
i am really happy for nasa and i just pray she makes it back down ok , that will be the icing on the cake .
seun , london uk oh dear !
the usa are off again trying to show how they can spend billions on space exploration , meanwhile trying to flex its muscles all around the world causing chaos- unbelievable !
mike , uk mankind is not content with polluting the earth !
it now wants to pollute space as well !
how sad !
millions starve while the usa burns dollars - what for ?
it truly is a sick world we live in these days !
anon , uk to anon , uk - the fuel is clean and non polluting - just water produced .
and as for waste of money - tell me about the dome and the london olympics .
longer term , i know what is more valuable !
george , chelmsford i 'm so glad to see the space programme resume shuttle launches .
space research is costly , but it 's like buying a lottery ticket - you never know what you 're going to get back from it , but once you go out there , there 's a chance you might win big .
and we already have - people have cited the benefits that have come from the space programme .
here 's to more exploration outside our atmosphere !
tony , london , uk i felt privileged to have been in florida for the launch .
it went off on time and from what i gather from reports , was perfect .
it 's something to tell the grandkids one day .
marylyn , london space travel fires the imagination !
tim goodchild , surrey space travel fires the imagination !
to all those that criticise that the shuttle is old and the fact that its had two failures should perhaps think again the next time they board a 747 on route to their holiday destination .
tim goodchild , surrey absolutely fantastic pictures from discovery , especially when the external fuel tank was detached from the shuttle with the curvature of the earth in the background .
overall great launch , well done nasa .
paul , coventry , uk the american space programme is a great achievement and it is important that it continues .
the human race is capable of great things and it is not in our nature to keep still .
terry , crewe , cheshire my gosh !
the people saying the space program is a waste of money ? !
the commercial products used now as a result of nasa are staggering .
cat scans , dialysis machines , materials in your athletic shoes , water purification technology , cordless power tools , cool suits for firefighters , physical therapy equipment .
the list goes on .
the program is invaluable !
eric , usa i think its well worth the effort and money to sustain humans in space carl lennon , northampton , uk most of the people on here with negative comments do not realise how much space has done for humanity .
many medical experiments have been conducted in space which was the only place that it could be done .
the results of these experiments have saved thousands if not millions of lives .
i think its well worth the effort and money to sustain humans in space .
carl lennon , northampton , uk although america has proven itself to be the world 's best engineers , nasa is living on past glory .
many of its best scientists and engineers have left , it is no longer in the public limelight unless it has a disaster , and it is grossly underfunded .
america should reinvigorate the program with major new investment and ambitious new goals or shut it down .
as the eu space agency has recently learned , you ca n't explore space on the cheap .
this old technology and this antiquated worn out hardware needs to be retired along with the mediocre management which has taken over .
mark , usa what a novel way to distract your nation from the real problems at home and abroad .
the cost does n't matter since the nation is paying the bill .
ed , canada there are those who say space exploration is a waste of money .
on the contrary , space travel forces society to stretch and reach further in order to solve highly complex problems associated with putting man into space .
the solutions to these problems are broad and serve mankind in many ways .
the space program enables us to move forward faster than we otherwise would .
without such large goals our advancement slows and we become lazy .
david , philadelphia , usa come on people , of course sending people into space is dangerous and expensive .
that does n't mean we should n't do it though .
even if space exploration did not lead to technical advances and practical application , it would still be worth it .
why ?
because it 's cool .
we put a man on the moon , that 's pretty impressive considering just prior to wwi a man could only travel as far as a horse could take him .
stu , st paul , usa the view from the fuel tank at over 14000mph was fantastic !
rod aries , glasgow the view from the fuel tank at over 14000mph was fantastic !
why are n't other space agencies doing this for the public ?
engage us !
rod aries , glasgow every time i see a rocket launch i think that newton made it possible ; his equations are still used to calculate the orbit .
how many other things in use today were invented over 300 years ago ?
vic , uk a sense of pride mixed with concern .
i live near the johnson space center and have relatives that have worked in the program as far back as gemini and apollo .
the space program is much more than a news story to us .
to those who think the space program is a waste of money : there is so much innovation and research that goes on behind the scenes that you 'd change your opinion if you took the time to look at what nasa has accomplished over the years and continues to accomplish today .
paul , houston , tx well , i 'm relieved it 's up there .
but they still seem to have this gung-ho attitude to safety .
i could n't believe that after killing two crews they are still happy to launch with a known serious fault .
chris hann , bay area , ca , usa congratulations to nasa on a successful launch .
i 'm glad to see that some nations still recognise the value of dreaming and aspiring to do great things and inspire their young people .
the money spent of spaceflight is miniscule compared to the many benefits .
it 's sad here in the uk that people are so ignorant and short-sighted with regards to space exploration that we ca n't see the good that can from it - and then we wonder the younger generations are n't interested in science , medicine and technology .
victor , birmingham , england this launch showed the world what can be accomplished with great teamwork , ambition and determination d soni , nuneaton , uk i watched the launch and was overcome with pride .
all the people involved in this great feat have overcome extreme obstacles .
this launch showed the world what can be accomplished with great teamwork , ambition and determination .
congratulations discovery !
d soni , nuneaton , uk mankind needs a vision .
interplanetary travel is necessary to achieve that end .
stuart haines , calgary , alberta , canada it 's time to junk the space shuttle and perhaps " rethink " this whole business of manned space flight for the time being .
think about it , other than as a showy display of national pride , what benefits do any nations get at this time from sending humans into space ?
perhaps in the future when we have real goals and reliable " safe " transportation we can start wasting our time and money with such " propaganda flights " , but now is n't the time and place for such foolishness .
charlie , niagara falls new york people always complain that space programs are too expensive , but do people appreciate how much safer the planet is with them ?
we can monitor dangerous weather , asteroids , and send tv , radio , and telephone signals via satellites .
space programs really have helped the planet excel in a positive way , and i 'm glad the discovery is finally continuing what has already been a remarkable feat of engineering .
tim hunt -lrb- 16 -rrb- , plymouth , england in these days darkened by the spectre of global terrorism , we seek hope and strength in many places .
the fog of war and the wind that whispers the question of " why are we fighting in the middle east ? ' diminish our confidence in our government .
today 's launch of the shuttle discovery renews our hope and faith in our abilities to overcome tragedy and defy adversity .
we owe the entire nasa family a debt of gratitude for restoring our faith in the human spirit .
paul telfer , franceville , gabon we need a new way of going to the stars clive , dartford , uk i wish the crew well on the mission , but the shuttle is old and just like any aircraft , it has its life expectancy and this bird has reached it .
we need a new way of going to the stars and to ditch the big firework approach to it .
clive , dartford , uk sure , okay .
maybe the shuttle programme is old .
maybe it should be scrapped for something better .
but , it is all we have at the moment .
and to all of you here who keep telling us to get rid of it , i have n't heard one of you say anything about putting up any money with us to fund a new programme .
jon , atlanta , usa what nasa needs is a real life scotty character to sort these technical issues out .
paul collier , london , uk the truth is that the shuttle concept has proved to be too expensive and technically complex to be the way forward in space .
i am pro-space exploration but the shuttle has slowed this to a crawl , and all the best work has been done by probes boosted by rockets e.g. mars landers , titan probes etc .
andy , uk " space is expensive ! " cry the critics .
i wish they would angle their criticism at a truly scandalous target .
the entire space programme to date has cost less than what the world spends on arms every year .
i know which i think is better value for money .
bernard o. quinn , barcelona , catalonia the exploration of space will continue with us or without us scott westwood , port orchard , wa , usa the shuttle is expensive , outdated and despite nasa 's assurances , its safety is still uncertain ; but it 's the only game in town .
the exploration of space will continue with us or without us ; to sit on the sidelines and watch others go up would be unthinkable for an america that prides itself on being a superpower .
scott westwood , port orchard , wa , usa space exploration is essential for the future of all humans .
flying over the atlantic was at first a risky endeavour and now it is done by millions every year without a thought for the early pioneers and the planes that never arrived .
colin , croydon , uk i do not understand all these people saying that america should scrap the shuttle , and spend it on ' the world ' .
the us is already the single largest contributor of foreign aid .
the us space program has helped everyday life for billions of people around the world , and churned out invention after invention for the world .
bill zimmer , seattle , wa congratulations to all those involved in discovery 's return to space !
to all the naysayers , next time you are browsing the internet on your pc , take a moment to find out what drove the development of semiconductors that power your pc .
yes , the space exploration that you think is a waste of money !
roger , london tears came to my eyes and i held my breath colleen , orlando , fl usa we were in the parking lot facing east , waiting and whispering to each other .
the first person to see the shuttle clearing the trees threw up their hand to point it out and some of the men started yelling , " go , baby , go ! " and cheering .
tears came to my eyes and i held my breath .
the space program has done so much to improve our lives in the fields of health and science , they further our knowledge of our environment and how our magnificent planet works .
colleen , orlando , fl usa go discovery !
the future of humanity is in space .
as an american living abroad , the lift-off of discovery is the first event that makes me proud to be american since leaving my country .
i hope that this success will lead to the completion of the iss and the continued exploration of space .
daniel valenti , canberra , australia people forget that we belong to this planet earth , in that our physical bodies are perfectly adapted to survive only on the earth .
we could never survive on other planets without extensive artificial aids .
as many have already pointed out , there are many , many more pressing needs requiring resolution and funds should be redirected where they are most needed for our survival on our home planet .
yvonne , doncaster whatever the administration in the us , it 's only nasa that keeps public morale up and at same time keeps the defence lobby in good humor .

the crew on board the space shuttle have conducted inspections of discovery 's belly and repairs to the shuttle have also been carried out .
stephen robinson has begun a unique spacewalk , going under the orbiter 's belly to remove two ceramic strips sticking out between heatshield tiles .
nasa engineers are concerned the strips would cause part of discovery to overheat as it re-enters the earth 's atmosphere .
discovery had been due to return to earth on 7 august , but nasa has decided to extend the mission by an extra day .
what do you think of the mission so far ?
how do you feel about the mission being extended ?
what do you think about the repairs ?

this debate is now closed .
read a selection of your comments below .
click here to read a second page of your comments the following comments reflect the balance of opinion we have received so far : the money that is spent by the american government on space exploration could be much better spent on healthcare and education .
this would be much more beneficial to the american people than discovery 's mission .
carolynne burkholder , vancouver , british columbia i can not believe that the crew had to cobble together a hacksaw norman west , truro , cornwall i can not believe that the crew had to cobble together a hacksaw .
a small box of tools from any diy shop would have done the job .
also removing a gap filler between the tiles exposes a gap .
surely the wind can get in and potentially lift a tile causing a fatal problem .
norman west , truro , cornwall whilst i can see that advances may be made through this work , i saw two items on the news last night - one about children dying because they have n't got a few quid , the other about spending millions on keeping the shuttles going in and out of space .
priority check please .
mark , didcot , england space travel is dangerous , pioneers are going to die , but it is worthwhile .
what is needed now are new spaceships to let us travel between planets .
at the moment all our eggs are in one basket , we need to find other homes on other worlds .
we have made this one nearly uninhabitable .
i would go into space whatever the risk .
ruth , walsall maybe if all the countries stopped being so petty and pooled their resources , we 'd have superior technology and fewer incidents like this .
we do n't need to race against each other anymore to try and prove who 's superior ; instead we should look to a future of co-operation .
gaz , cardiff , uk i will never understand why we waste so much money on primitive space stations john gearing , st. helens , uk i will never understand why we waste so much money on primitive space stations and shuttles which clearly have no function for the human race at this time .
i do n't know why we do n't get all our experts and fund them in coming up with unmanned technologies and technology in shuttles that could take us to planets not to a tin can in the sky which is over expensive and serves no function to the mass population .
john gearing , st. helens , uk fascinating a brit would ask the question why the us is sending people into space .
as the brit , george mallory said in 1924 , " because its there " .
mt everest killed mallory and we remember him for his quest .
in a similar quest , the us will continue to go into space - because its there .
john b , windermere , florida do some of these contributors have no soul ?
what could be more magnificent than seeing human beings taking risks to explore the unknown ; triumphing over the problems they meet along the way ; opening up new horizons for the rest of us ?
yes let 's invest in a new space transportation system , and more manned flights , and unmanned probes and a bigger , better space station .
but to claim that stopping the current flights is sensible shows no faith in the species at all .
stop looking down at the ground and start looking up at the stars .
john r smith , uk please , armchair scientists , let the experts at nasa do their job making the risk calculations .
they 've got the know-how and the tools to make the decisions .
not you or me .
joe , usa this is the most ridiculous expenditure of precious funds in a time of great national travail .
nasa is an anachronism , a patronistic pet rock that has no justification whatsoever , especially in the current environment in which civilized societies are fighting for their mere existence .
the irresponsibility in launching this mission in the face of known deficiencies is appalling .
c. a. la varre , newport , ri usa the media paints such a doom and gloom picture of what is happening above us phil , hampshire , uk why-oh-why does the media take such a negative view to what the men and women on sts114 are doing .
the media paints such a doom and gloom picture of what is happening above us .
we as a united world should watch and praise these people who are up there performing the most fantastic things known to mankind .
yes there is a difficult time coming on returning to earth but the crew at this time seem very positive about it .
may i suggest that you all watch nasa tv on the web for real live happenings .
phil , hampshire , uk nasa is undergoing drastic changes .
i think the us should pause and take stock of what 's happening to their space missions .
give it a break , sort out problems and return 10years later .
i wonder how the us ever landed man on the moon ?
did they really ?
i wonder !
errol , dubai , uae space flight is still in its infancy .
so the fact that an astronaut was able to make a repair to the shuttle in space is a great triumph .
nasa should look on this feat in a positive light , not a negative one .
we know in the days of sailing ships as they travelled the globe to discover new lands , there were many times when sailors had to climb up masts in storms to make repairs , so is repairing space craft in flight any different ?
leon aarons , petach israel another piece of space theatre , justifying manned flight .
unmanned craft can put payloads into orbit much more cheaply , as well as exploring other planets .
martin , dubai , uae i 've just seen a picture of the tool , held together with strong tape that the astronauts used .
it 's great to imagine that a billion-dollar aircraft can be saved by a bit of strong tape and some elbow grease !
it 's that sort of thinking that 's saved astronauts in the past .
good luck to them , hope humans carry on going into space for many more years .
dave , manchester , uk this spacewalk and repair demonstrates two things .
firstly , the courage and initiative of the astronauts , secondly , the importance of retiring the ageing shuttle fleet and building a modern spacecraft .
electronics and materials technology have advanced tremendously in the past 30 years , but the shuttle is still using outdated technology .
gordon mcstraun , uk so , the offending piece if gap filler from between a couple of heat shields .
i 'm no nasa expert , but does n't this mean that the is now a gap between these tiles ?
michael , bucks , uk the astronauts are all volunteers , they know the risks involved , and that is why i praise and thank them kirsty , cambridge , uk i think it is fantastic that discovery has launched and its mission is going well .
a lesson has been learnt from colombia , and indeed , challenger .
the astronauts are all volunteers , they know the risks involved , and that is why i praise and thank them .
they are incredible people .
kirsty , cambridge , uk so what if the filler problem has to be fixed with a jerry-rigged hacksaw ?
this type of ingenuity has been saving lives since the age of tall ships and can only reflect well on the tenacity of the nasa engineers and astronauts .
remember when the progress hit mir ?
apollo 13 ?
we need the experience of these problems to give us the know-how to survive in space and give us the confidence in our ability to solve problems on longer , bolder voyages .
tim parker , edinburgh , scotland i work with remote operated vehicles in the oil and gas industry .
i am amazed that the crew of the discovery need to cobble together a makeshift hacksaw to carry out a job on the tiles .
the shuttles are old and things will go wrong so you would expect a decent tool kit to be onboard .
james , paderne , portugal why are the americans still sending people into space ?
if they want to explore they should be thinking of unmanned flights with intelligent technology which can spend decades in space .
this should help the ozone layer repair itself .
more is needed to be done to explore and catalogue this planet and its systems , this will be of more benefit to mankind and our home than space travel .
haz , nottingham , uk is going up in the shuttle much more dangerous than sailing unknown oceans a few hundred years ago in wooden ships ?
thank goodness that throughout history not everyone has wanted to sit at home in comfort in their own small world .
simon , manchester , uk with so many comings and goings to and from iss , would it not be sensible for just the bare minimum of crew to return in this shuttle and send up a half-empty shuttle to collect the rest of them ?
why take unnecessary risks ?
fraser irving , sheffield , uk until now , the shuttle missions have been routine , like taking a walk in the park .
but the reality of danger with the loss of two shuttles has almost brought the space program to its knees .
should it continue ?
of course it must go on because too much is at stake .
closing the space station , and not looking into space is the worst we can do .
life on earth is becoming dangerous .
we must look to the stars if humanity is to survive .
walter , chapel hill , nc i think - and hope - this flight is one of the safest ever .
my guess is the problems have appeared simply because they have been looking for them far more carefully than before .
however , there 's no doubt a replacement spacecraft is needed .
the private " space ship one " has a slow re-entry , avoiding thermal problems .
is this possible from orbit ?
and a separate , unmanned cargo vehicle seems a " no-brainer " .
simon , bristol it must be frightening for the astronauts but the space programme must prevail anya , london pioneers always take risks so that everyone else can eventually follow .
it must be frightening for the astronauts but the space programme must prevail .
updated technology is definitely needed .
unmanned missions are a good idea , but ultimately there is no substitute for human actions and reactions .
anya , london interesting to note that the two shuttle losses have not been due to design or engineering flaws in the shuttle themselves , but rather the propulsion system .
for 30 year old vehicles , i think the shuttles are doing pretty well , and i am sure they will continue for a long time .
matt , bristol space exploration is dangerous and the crew knows this better than any of us - and they still volunteered for it .
my view is that we need to continue to explore space and the shuttle repair should be seen as an experience that needs to be faced at some time .
let 's not be weak about this .
george , chelmsford what nasa has done is simply awesome .
nasa is the adventurer of our era , looking at and investigating things that are far bigger than us .
i say ground the space shuttles , but do not skimp on quickly building bigger , better , and safer spacecraft to replace them .
sk , ithaca , ny space technology is too integrated in our daily lives now peter byrd , worcester the few people who mock space projects should not use anything connected with space technology as a protest !
i bet hardly anyone would manage it or really want to .
space technology is too integrated in our daily lives now ; we all enjoy the advantages we get from it .
nasa tv via the net alone shows me how wonderful space is .
peter byrd , worcester i have just returned from florida where i was privileged enough to witness the breathtaking launch first hand .
it seems as though there are increasing difficulties using these shuttles .
are the lives of 7 astronauts each time it takes off a risk that is worth taking ?
matt , london given the loss of columbia and the uncertainty of this mission , nasa should scrap the shuttle programme .
luck prevented previous disasters and it would appear nasa 's luck has run out .
what makes them feel confident that they can repair in space what they failed to repair in two years on the ground ?
my thoughts are with the families of those on the iss .
phil , bracknell , uk the problems with discovery must have been encountered with all the previous shuttle flights .
it appears that each time it took off , it was russian roulette as to whether it would return safely .
this program should be abandoned until a new and safer means of transporting the shuttle into space can be developed .
chris , brazil will the resulting depression between the tiles create a possibility of a chink in the armour ?
k chowksey , bangalore , india even if the pieces sticking out are pulled or hacked , will the resulting depression between the tiles create a possibility of a chink in the armour ?
even a depression can alter the aerodynamic behaviour -lrb- as in golf balls -rrb- .
this will create uneven heat distribution .
k chowksey , bangalore , india from the idealists point of view we really should not be thinking about costs here .
space exploration is vital , not only to our technological development as a species , but also in terms of our wider understanding of the universe .
the whole nasa infrastructure is quite frankly awesome .
every endeavour has its risks and we 've seen the tragic consequences of those risks with the previous accidents .
chris , bracknell we need to explore space ; when you go to hospital and have a cat scan or an mri , that technology has come from the space program .
there is nothing wrong with the shuttle - the problem is with the way it is maintained .
they need to do better , i do n't know why do n't they paint it again , and seal the foam .
carol , pa , usa the saddest thing for me about this mission is that the next time the iss is visible from england on august 11th , the shuttle will have already left .
hopefully we 'll get to see the shuttle during the next mission .
after the moon , the iss is the brightest object in the night sky .
john airey , peterborough i looked at the images of the underside of the shuttle and thought that it looked like really bad bathroom tiling rob , spain major advances need to be made to the whole concept of effective re-entry heat-shield technology .
even before lift-off , i looked at the images of the underside of the shuttle and thought that it looked like really bad bathroom tiling .
initially , i expected it to be a smooth , seamless surface , but it was a patchwork of light and dark areas with patches that looked more raised than others .
i assume that tiles are the best option at the moment , but in future this issue needs to be solved completely .
rob , spain if nasa has decided to just rip out the relatively small strips protruding from between the heat shield tiles , then why ca n't they ask astronaut steve robinson to take his experimental repair kit out with him and fill the gaps with the mastic gum that they used to ' fix ' the tiles in their earlier experiments ?
paul greer , gothenburg , sweden i worked as an engineer on skylab in the 70s and i consider this nasa debacle a disgrace .
unknown risk is one thing , but gambling with lives on known problems with solutions is unacceptable .
i say : bring some crew home in russian capsule , leave the rest of the crew up there , fix the foam on atlantis -lrb- and everything else possible -rrb- and then send a rescue mission .
then ground the antiques and use modern technology to build new spacecraft .
rich dusek , orchard lake , mi , us bruce from huntsville says it 's not a trivial engineering problem and he 's probably right .
but that does n't alter the documented fact that nasa has sent people into space against the advice of contractors who have told them that certain aspects are n't safe .
if shuttles are prone to bits falling off then they should n't be flying .
david , chelmsford uk nasa do n't build all the parts and therefore an outside company may be partly responsible james , uk why do people expect space travel to be perfectly safe ?
look at any picture of launch and remember the orange tank is full of fuel and both white rockets once started ca n't be stopped .
man in space is an essential part of our future .
the earth can not sustain us forever particularly its natural resources .
i also think people should recognise that nasa do n't build all the parts and therefore an outside company may be partly responsible .
james , uk the problems with the space transportation system are a classic example of what happens when whole-life costs are not taken into account during early design phases of the system .
congress chose to buy shuttle on the cheap , opting for solid fuel boosters and a disposable fuel tank instead of spending extra money upfront to design a fully-reusable fly-back first stage to take the orbiter into space .
the result has been far higher operating costs and , tragically , the loss of fourteen astronauts .
will it be too much to hope that senior agency managers and politicians will learn these lessons in defining our future access to space ?
in europe as well as the usa .
phil , bath , uk so far this particular mission has been very worrying for relatives of the discovery crew .
any venture into space is a risk , but this one seems to have gone ahead knowing this risk factor was much higher than usual .
why are these missions so important ?
the risk factor is too great to risk innocent lives .
stop them now .
jose a holmes , loughborough , england i wish the crew a safe return but am sorry to see resources wasted on a manned flight with little real value for essentially political and pr reasons while much more scientifically valuable unmanned work is scaled back to pay for it .
this is all about the advancement of the usa , not science .
julian , london , uk the debris issue has been present in the shuttle programme from day one .
the tiles themselves are so fragile you can break them with one hand .
the space shuttle is a wonderful vehicle , but sadly owing to it 's bizarre design , is inherently dangerous and needs to be replaced soon .
as richard feynman said after the challenger disaster , " for a successful technology , reality must take precedence over public relations , for nature can not be fooled . "
chris dyer , bristol , england the immediate future of the space program will be best served by robot missions dr malcolm fairbairn , uk / sweden i , like most people connected with astrophysics , think that the immediate future of the space program will be best served by robot missions for at least the next twenty years .
it 's not taking a step backwards ; it 's about developing and testing new technologies which will eventually be applied to human spaceflight .
for the same amount of money you get much more science done with robotic missions because you do n't have to worry about the fragile humans .
dr malcolm fairbairn , uk / sweden as an aerospace engineer , in this particular instance i am not worried about discovery .
all indications are that the debris did no damage .
long term , though , it could be a problem .
the space shuttle has never fulfilled the promises that were made for it .
it is an expensive vehicle of very limited utility .
it consumes resources which could be better used elsewhere in the us space program .
andrew ogilvie , modesto , california , usa robert heinlein said it : " the earth is too small and fragile a basket for humanity to keep all its eggs in . "
the only safe place to be when disaster comes -lrb- an asteroid for example -rrb- is somewhere else .
well done , discovery .
keep it up .
john fielder , workington , uk there are a lot of negative comments on here by people who really have not done their research .
there are so many inventions that have come to be due to space travel most are indirect , technology passed to the public after it has been created to aid nasa and the like in various projects .
adam ransom , birmingham space flight is one of the things that most excites me jehuda arieh veenman , haifa , israel space flight is one of the things that most excites me .
it breaks my heart that foam broke off the insulation again .
apparently , the design has a basic flaw ; the vulnerable heat shield is exposed to a bombardment of debris falling of during take off .
in the more old fashioned designs , the heat shields were protected during take off .
jehuda arieh veenman , haifa , israel it seems to me that the logical fix for the launch system would be to mount the shuttle higher relative to the fuel tank .
the coldness of the fuel is always going to be a problem in causing freezing of water and air in and around the foam insulation .
since that is the nature of the beast , get the shuttle out of harms way above the possible falling debris nigel dandridge-perry , los angeles ca , usa good luck discovery , i look forward to seeing a safe flight back to earth .
mark , dorset there is no progress with manned missions .
it 's more of the same .
while unmanned missions are discovering lakes of water on mars , landing on distant moons and exploring planets , the manned missions are trying to work out how to stop foam falling off the fuel tank .
leave floating around in orbit to the chinese and get exploring .
matt , amsterdam , the netherlands -lrb- ex .
uk -rrb- the shuttle programme shows the greatness the human race can achieve when we focus d ward , portsmouth those who fly orbiters know the risks and accept the challenge .
the shuttle programme shows the greatness the human race can achieve when we focus .
a commitment should be made to give it whatever financial support it needs to continue .
nasa tv shows discovery 's latest mission is gripping .
we owe it to those astronauts who have lost their lives in space exploration , to carry on the work that they could n't finish .
d ward , portsmouth i have become addicted to nasa tv over the last few days , and find myself staring into space , thinking of discovery up there somewhere ... looking back on our little planet from a distance .
i am surely concerned about the debris ; remember nasa did not think this would be a problem for the ill-fated columbia crew either .
they have spent two years and thousands of dollars on this problem - so yes , i think we should be concerned , not only about the debris ' implications , but also that nasa got it wrong again .
verity worthington , bewdley , worcestershire hundreds of years ago people were afraid that they could sail off the edges of the earth .
thank heavens there were brave sailors then willing to push the limits of courage and technology , and thank heavens we still have them today .
i 'm also grateful that there are still those willing to fund such expeditions .
rob g. , kansas city , usa the disaster 2 years ago , and these recent problems with the shuttle show that nasa really need to get on with developing the next generation of re-useable shuttles .
technology has moved on so much in the nearly 30 years since it was developed with computer technology and new lightweight materials .
if they do n't , then the private space firms will take over , while nasa keeps flogging a dead horse .
tane piper , edinburgh , uk we are all with you , looking forward for success .
god be with you .
no surrender no retreat .
martin madulu , moshi - tanzania i am more worried about the apparent loss of a tile than the foam .
if any of the tiles were damaged , the mission is in jeopardy .
after the columbia disaster , i read an article published in 1980 calling the shuttles ' death traps ' .
considering that we 've already lost half the fleet , i think it is high time nasa invested in a different , more robust technology .
istvan , detroit , usa the safety of the crew should be of utmost importance , not launch schedules ss , usa my family and i were vacationing in florida at the time of the launch .
we saw it speeding skyward from the car on our way back home .
i am an aerospace design engineer specializing in flight dynamics .
my concern really lies with the inadequacy with which nasa has dealt with the foam / tile problem .
the safety of the crew should be of utmost importance , not launch schedules .
ss , usa only those at nasa who have looked at the images of debris falling will have the best idea .
the crew 's safe return is just our concern but it 's their mission .
venkat maruthamuthu , urbana , il , usa why was this problem not resolved after columbia two years ago ?
it is very wrong to send yet more people up there without being absolutely sure that it 's safe .
perhaps space travel should wait until we have progressed far enough that we are not relying on tiles that can just fall off ?
catherine , cheshunt , herts great to see the shuttle soar again .
our future lies not on earth but out there somewhere .
no matter how you argue it , in the future this planet will die and so will all those life forms still on it .
if the human species is to survive , then it must do so elsewhere and this sort of technology is the first step towards that ultimate goal .
ian jordan , wokingham the foam formulation was changed in 1996 ... most of the foam issues started after this change bruce g , huntsville , usa this is not a trivial engineering problem as some have implied .
there are two types of foam : a lightweight foam covering the large areas of the tank and a dense ablator foam covering areas exposed to aerodynamic heating .
the foam is exposed to supersonic airflow at about 27000 km / h -lrb- 17000 mph -rrb- during launch .
there are shock cones coming from the orbiter , the connecting struts and solid boosters which impinge on the tank .
there is also a lot of vibration .
the foam formulation was changed in 1996 to comply with the montreal protocol and eliminate the freon propellant .
most of the foam issues started after this change and may or may not be associated with it .
the shuttle is due to be retired in 2010 and solving this problem is important for future spacecraft design .
bruce g , huntsville , usa why ca n't the return module be encased within the main take off rocket ?
this would prevent bits flying off from damaging it .
tony lee , telford we were on vacation in orlando , and had tickets for the astronaut hall of fame to watch the original scheduled lift-off on 13 july .
we had such a good view , but with about an hour or so to go , the launch was cancelled .
we were gutted to have missed such a spectacular sight !
we watched it on television back here in ireland , but felt we had a special bond with sts 114 - return to flight .
we just hope now for the safe return of the shuttle and its crew on 7 august .
good luck to them .
hutch family , ireland one day when someone is sipping cocktails on saturn 's lunar resort , whilst looking back at the earth and the distant sun , they 'll thank these brave people for risking their lives .
let 's keep our nerve , and not look back .
chris phillips , chelmsford , essex it is an inherent part of our nature to explore caroline , edinburgh , uk i used to work at one of the nasa centres -lrb- in maryland -rrb- and i hope that space exploration continues .
as a scientist it is an inherent part of our nature to explore , discover and find out about the unknown .
i was overjoyed to see the launch of discovery and hope , beyond all hope , that they make it safely home .
as nasa have said - " exploring space is not for the faint hearted ' - it 's a huge undertaking " .
the astronauts know that , we all know that .
these are very brave people and i wish them , and nasa , well with their endeavours .
caroline , edinburgh , uk watching this made me feel giddy .
now hopefully we can complete the iss and get on with the business of colonising space .
the spirit of adventure lives on with discovery and her crew .
david mills , ballymena , uk we were very privileged to be able to see discovery launch when it flew mission 105 and the impression it left us with was ' it was amazing to see ' .
we believe that the crew and the engineers will be able to work together and face the challenge of bringing back this magnificent ship .
instead of shrinking from the challenge we should rise up to it just as they did in 1970 for apollo 13 , it is only by stretching our knowledge such as in times of emergencies that we reach beyond our capabilities .
good luck and best wishes to the crew and engineers .
julie and robert , manchester , england i would like to see the shuttle retired and replaced with a newer fleet scott , edinburgh congratulations to nasa on another successful launch .
however , i would like to see the shuttle retired and replaced with a newer and more capable fleet of vehicles .
not only will it be safer and hugely beneficial to space exploration , the project would provide thousands of jobs , contracts to companies and benefit the global economy .
scott , edinburgh people seem to forget that manned space travel is still very dangerous and those brave astronauts know the risks .
foam has been falling off fuel tanks for nearly 25 years now .
perhaps money should now be invested in developing better glue and a more efficient reusable manned space travel system .
john ellis , nottingham statistically , if commercial flights carried the same risks as spaceflight , there would be about 500 airliner crashes per day .
one therefore has to applaud the courage and determination of those people who accept this degree of risk in pursuit of our quest for knowledge .
we are an inquisitive species , in this case pushing the boundaries of what is possible .
i wish those seven brave souls a safe return .
bob , cheshire i 've been following the ' space race ' since sputnik and the mercury missions , and i ca n't think of anything more exciting than a successful launch .
but why do n't we stop racing against each other and form stronger international collaborations to make space travel safer ?
j forman , los angeles , usa if nasa says the shuttle is safe to fly , it 's safe to fly james , los angeles , usa it amazes me how many observers believe they are more of an expert on shuttle safety and capability than the engineers at nasa .
the fact is , the men and women who work at nasa are at the top of their field .
if they say the shuttle is safe to fly , it 's safe to fly .
james , los angeles , usa it was a beautiful launch .
the space shuttle program has been remarkably successful despite the previous disaster .
nobody can engineer absolute perfection , but this was very close .
h neil , south texas , usa i am very concerned about the damaged tiles on discovery , especially in light of nasa 's apparent slowness in acknowledging that the take-off incident with columbia caused the disaster upon return .
there is an option for the crew of discovery - to wait on the space station for rescue .
how can we even contemplate risking their lives ?
if the problem is serious enough to ground the fleet , discovery too should be ' grounded ' immediately .
sharon , dallas , texas i once saw a presentation on how the challenger disaster came to happen and how it could have been prevented and it made my blood run cold .
suffice it to say , i have nothing but the most profound admiration for the courage of the crews of the shuttle .
i 'm not a religious man , but i just hope to god they all get back safely .
steve , chesham tragic as the columbia accident was , the astronauts died doing what they loved - exploring space , a privilege only the select few get to do .
they also died at the end of their trip so they got to enjoy being in space , unlike the challenger crew .
before the columbia accident , i would expect that the shuttles got through intact in much worse condition than discovery .
i am not that concerned , although i will follow the investigations with great interest .
ian , london it seems ridiculous that it is being jeopardised by something so simple chris , brazil the shuttle has been up and down into space about 50 times before the columbia incident .
i can not believe that bits of foam from the fuel tank did n't come off during these trips .
are n't nasa being a bit super cautious about this problem ?
ca n't they encase the fuel tank in some sort of wire mesh in order to prevent the foam from breaking off ?
in such a high tech programme , it seems ridiculous that it is being jeopardised by something so simple .
chris , brazil what exactly are they doing out there that they have not had the chance to do before ?
first of all get a new ship and then go somewhere else than the moon !
that impressed my grand father , it will take more to impress me !
mathieu , gatineau , canada bits of foam have probably been falling off the shuttle since the first launch , but it 's only since a piece of that debris caused the destruction of columbia two years ago that anyone has noticed !
only now we have cameras watching every single part of the craft do we see what may well have been happening all along .
carry on as normal .
simon , peterborough , uk i remember watching the first ever shuttle flight as a kid .
i watched the launch the other day and got the exact same feelings of awe and excitement .
the shuttle launch is a wake up call to everyone .
sure the world has problems right now but despite those problems , look what we 're capable of !
my message to nasa , the esa and all the other agencies ?
keep going people .
take us there !
andrew k jones , wrexham , uk i watched the launch live on the internet and was overwhelmed .
we wo n't know of the mission 's success until 7 aug , but what surprises me is the us way of making everything big and the huge overhead costs .
it 's all show and little substance .
after having spent $ 1 billion and 2.5 years on the debris falling cause , they are back to square one and the shuttles are grounded again !
on the other hand the russians are making safe manned space missions with pinpoint accuracy every 3-6 months at a fraction of the cost .
rakesh , london uk without space exploration we would not have computers , hi-technology materials etc jim kirk , basildon i read once that spending on cosmetics in the usa dwarfs the nasa budget .
let 's get things in perspective .
without space exploration we would not have computers , hi-technology materials etc , all of which were a by-product .
if more is learned about our planet and its self-destructive population on each mission then we should keep it going .
come home safe guys !
jim kirk , basildon does anyone know why debris falls off a multi-million dollar spacecraft ?
ca n't some sort of outer layer be put around the fuel tank insulation to stop it disintegrating ?
i 'm not an engineer - i need someone else to explain it !
robert , sussex rather than risking the crew and the shuttle , if it is damaged , why do n't they leave it up there as service vehicle and bring the crew back in another shuttle at a later date ?
if nasa wants to survive they need to start making people believe in them again .
good luck discovery !
paul , london the space shuttle was under funded during its design and construction and the compromises mean it will never achieve its true potential .
the sooner it can be replaced with something newer and simpler the better .
david patrick , reading trying to make space exploration 100 % safe is just nonsense .
duncan , nottingham my heart sank when i heard the news that tiles had once again fallen off the space shuttle roger campbell , england my heart sank when i heard the news that tiles had once again fallen off the space shuttle .
if the cause of the tiles falling off is simply the vibration and air flow , then i wonder what will be the effect of the searing heat of re-entry .
roger campbell , england having watched the space shuttle launch on tv , it is good to see such a majestic craft finally back to what she was meant to do .
well done nasa for getting the space shuttle flying .
james , nottingham no-one made that big a deal when tiles were missing from the oms pods after columbia 's maiden flight in 1981 .
when designing this vehicle they must have made a risk assessment to determine safety parameters , and unfortunately the loss of columbia has made them refine these parameters further .
tim parker , edinburgh we watched the launch from our beach , about 90 miles away .
it was spectacular .
there are many more cameras watching the exterior shuttle craft than ever before which have alerted to the problems .
the engineers working for nasa are tireless and will get the current crew back safely one way or another .
the space programme will continue .
the only unknown is manned flights .
the mars rovers are still sending pictures and information long past when they were suppose to .
nasa will continue on and i believe has more government funding this year , or is due for an increase .
private companies are currently working on safe space travel for human passengers in the us and abroad i believe .
joan york , daytona beach , florida usa nasa 's team on the ground and the astronauts in the space are doing a great job for the mankind syed mateen , karachi , pakistan i have witnessed the launching of space shuttle discovery on television screen .
nasa 's team on the ground and the astronauts in the space are doing a great job for the mankind , as their experiences in the space will benefit the entire world .
i pray for the safe return of the astronauts and happy landing of the space shuttle .
as a human being , i am equally concerned about the debris which has fallen at the time of its blast , but hope that the space shuttle will not face the same problem as it did in the past .
the safe return of discovery will boost the moral of nasa 's team , who had worked day and night to make the space shuttle 's mission possible .
syed mateen , karachi , pakistan any country with ambitions to have manned missions to space would be more than happy to have a craft as good as the space shuttle .
if there is a cheaper way to break away from earth than i am all for it but i am not sure how much safer it will be .
exploration has always been a dangerous business .
erik , ft .
collins , u.s.a. manned space flight is a dangerous and expensive anachronism .
look at the success of hubble , the mars rovers and the cassini / huygens mission .
you can do 10 times as much real science for half the cost and no risk to life by concentrating on unmanned space exploration .
and tell me , were n't the pictures of titan far more exciting than anything the crew of the shuttle are likely to get up to ?
max , abu dhabi , uae i read some of the comments here with disbelief .
yes , we all know that there are problems in some areas of the world , it does n't however mean that everything has to stop because of that .
i can think of a lot more things which are more of a waste than space exploration .
i 'll bet half the people complaining about nasa being wasteful drive gas guzzlers and do n't bother to recycle .
the shuttle mission is vital to all areas of science and i 'm glad it is flying again .
the space shuttle is not an old machine ; discovery has only flown 30 times before .
most commercial airlines fly that often in a week !
dave , slough , uk many congratulations to nasa .
as a teacher i teach children who are fascinated by space .
it is good that the space missions continue .
it allows children to hope and dream that they might reach the stars themselves , one day !
michelle , birmingham we all know that it costs millions of dollars to support the space program .
one could argue that money could be better spent elsewhere .
the fact is we as human beings need to understand in order to learn new technologies and space exploration is just one of many things that need to be understood and conquered .
there will always be many arguments for and against the space program .
all i can say right now is well done to nasa and my best wishes for a truly successful return to space flight for discovery .
andrew howlett , cape town , south africa good luck and a safe landings to the crew of the discovery .
there are some here that would have the usa quit funding the space program until all the worlds ' problems are solved .
will you tell your children to wait for that day before pursuing their dreams ?
michael rosenbaum , san francisco , usa a plane crash or 9/11 does not stop air travel , so why should the columbia 2003 disaster stop space exploration ?
i 'm sure discovery will make it back safe and the astronauts will be given a well-deserved pat on the back .
jack , london / memphis the shuttle might be old but it still works , and has done the world a huge service towards on earth and in space exploration .
those who complain are clearly members of the flat earth society , and yet i bet they use technology every day ?
someone has to push the envelope .
go nasa go !
phil w , uk good launch .
let 's just hope she comes back in one piece .
ricardo , brazil the shuttles are aged dinosaurs that need to be " moth balled " before more lives are lost due to fragmenting styrofoam .
perhaps we should all consider shifting funding away from nasa and put it towards alternative fuel sources .
it would be revenue better spent .
kurt stuchell , cambridge , usa scuttle the shuttle gordon , auckland nz scuttle the shuttle !
obsolete equipment supplying a pointless lab .
much fanfare about increasing aid to africa by $ 25b but us military budget $ 400b makes you ill !
gordon , auckland nz i can not stand the mentality of myopic people who would rather we abandon the natural impulse to explore our surroundings , and instead focus on futile efforts to tackle every mundane earthbound problem .
surely , the sight of the shuttle blasting off into orbit is the most poignant statement of mankind 's destiny .
kevin , charlotte , north carolina , usa with so much bad news in the media : terrorism , war , poverty ... it 's wonderful to see what we as human beings can achieve , when we put our minds to something positive .
we have the potential to achieve great things .
the crew of this shuttle mission are from different countries , cultures and backgrounds ; proof that if we work together , we can produce something that makes us all proud .
charlie , newcastle , uk to all those who claim the space programme has helped advance medicine and technology . think how much further along in those fields we could be if all the money wasted at nasa went into development . let alone feeding the poor .
shameful waste of resources .
i do n't want my tax dollar to be spent this way .
p. o 'donnell , rotorua , n.z. there are always small-minded people who are terrified of exploration digby knight , henley-on-thames , uk there are always small-minded people who are terrified of exploration .
if we had their way , we 'd still be living in trees afraid of the dangerous savannah !
thankfully we 've always had a few who have done their best to pioneer new territories and worlds .
digby knight , henley-on-thames , uk i would argue that nasa is somewhat of an anachronism .
the " glory days " of the space race with russia are over .
instead , space exploration should be run by the national science foundation .
there , private and public money can be better organized to fund missions .
the nsf already runs most of the science stations here on earth .
why should space be any different ?
greg , alexandria , va space exploration * is * a waste of money .
had the billions been invested directly in more down-to-earth technologies , we would have seen the same spin-offs in medicine , it , and transport .
anonymous i ca n't believe the childish reactions to space exploration from folks like mike and anon , uk .
grow up , guys .
space exploration represents humanity at its most amazing .
you 're obviously just bitter because the us is leading the way .
typical .
shawn , washington , dc , usa exploration , of all kinds , has always helped man push the boundaries of technology .
the space programme is no different .
for this reason alone it is invaluable .
jason , detroit , usa despite all the delays and expert checks , something still fell off it on take off dan , yateley , uk looking at the shuttle i am always reminded of those creaking old 50 's and 60 's airliners you still see rattling around developing countries .
good in their day , but now so ropey and tired that they just scream " death trap " .
it says it all about the shuttle that despite all the delays and expert checks , something still fell off it on take off .
it 's high time this heap was scrapped , and a replacement worthy of the 21st century was introduced in its place .
dan , yateley , uk so the new ufos are unidentified falling objects ?
phil jones , frangy , france if you watch the film of the launch the piece of debris that falls off after the booster rocket drops off does not come from the shuttle it comes from the giant fuel tank , which is ' disposable ' anyway .
john nichols , brackley , nnorthants , uk how would brits feel if americans were talking about how britain should spend its money ?
michelle , raleigh , nc i think that nasa is still too hurried in launching the shuttle when the debris problem still exists .
maybe they should solve out the problem wholly before doing any thing else .
but the fact still shows that nasa has succeeded in launching the shuttle into space .
maybe that 's an incredible luck , although we still do n't know about the return of it .
but i believe it will succeed , too .
god 's will give luck to the crew .
nguyen hoang giang , hanoi , vietnam i just pray she makes it back down ok seun , london uk it was an excellent feeling seeing discovery go like that yesterday .
i am really happy for nasa and i just pray she makes it back down ok , that will be the icing on the cake .
seun , london uk oh dear !
the usa are off again trying to show how they can spend billions on space exploration , meanwhile trying to flex its muscles all around the world causing chaos- unbelievable !
mike , uk mankind is not content with polluting the earth !
it now wants to pollute space as well !
how sad !
millions starve while the usa burns dollars - what for ?
it truly is a sick world we live in these days !
anon , uk to anon , uk - the fuel is clean and non polluting - just water produced .
and as for waste of money - tell me about the dome and the london olympics .
longer term , i know what is more valuable !
george , chelmsford i 'm so glad to see the space programme resume shuttle launches .
space research is costly , but it 's like buying a lottery ticket - you never know what you 're going to get back from it , but once you go out there , there 's a chance you might win big .
and we already have - people have cited the benefits that have come from the space programme .
here 's to more exploration outside our atmosphere !
tony , london , uk i felt privileged to have been in florida for the launch .
it went off on time and from what i gather from reports , was perfect .
it 's something to tell the grandkids one day .
marylyn , london space travel fires the imagination !
tim goodchild , surrey space travel fires the imagination !
to all those that criticise that the shuttle is old and the fact that its had two failures should perhaps think again the next time they board a 747 on route to their holiday destination .
tim goodchild , surrey absolutely fantastic pictures from discovery , especially when the external fuel tank was detached from the shuttle with the curvature of the earth in the background .
overall great launch , well done nasa .
paul , coventry , uk the american space programme is a great achievement and it is important that it continues .
the human race is capable of great things and it is not in our nature to keep still .
terry , crewe , cheshire my gosh !
the people saying the space program is a waste of money ? !
the commercial products used now as a result of nasa are staggering .
cat scans , dialysis machines , materials in your athletic shoes , water purification technology , cordless power tools , cool suits for firefighters , physical therapy equipment .
the list goes on .
the program is invaluable !
eric , usa i think its well worth the effort and money to sustain humans in space carl lennon , northampton , uk most of the people on here with negative comments do not realise how much space has done for humanity .
many medical experiments have been conducted in space which was the only place that it could be done .
the results of these experiments have saved thousands if not millions of lives .
i think its well worth the effort and money to sustain humans in space .
carl lennon , northampton , uk although america has proven itself to be the world 's best engineers , nasa is living on past glory .
many of its best scientists and engineers have left , it is no longer in the public limelight unless it has a disaster , and it is grossly underfunded .
america should reinvigorate the program with major new investment and ambitious new goals or shut it down .
as the eu space agency has recently learned , you ca n't explore space on the cheap .
this old technology and this antiquated worn out hardware needs to be retired along with the mediocre management which has taken over .
mark , usa what a novel way to distract your nation from the real problems at home and abroad .
the cost does n't matter since the nation is paying the bill .
ed , canada there are those who say space exploration is a waste of money .
on the contrary , space travel forces society to stretch and reach further in order to solve highly complex problems associated with putting man into space .
the solutions to these problems are broad and serve mankind in many ways .
the space program enables us to move forward faster than we otherwise would .
without such large goals our advancement slows and we become lazy .
david , philadelphia , usa come on people , of course sending people into space is dangerous and expensive .
that does n't mean we should n't do it though .
even if space exploration did not lead to technical advances and practical application , it would still be worth it .
why ?
because it 's cool .
we put a man on the moon , that 's pretty impressive considering just prior to wwi a man could only travel as far as a horse could take him .
stu , st paul , usa the view from the fuel tank at over 14000mph was fantastic !
rod aries , glasgow the view from the fuel tank at over 14000mph was fantastic !
why are n't other space agencies doing this for the public ?
engage us !
rod aries , glasgow every time i see a rocket launch i think that newton made it possible ; his equations are still used to calculate the orbit .
how many other things in use today were invented over 300 years ago ?
vic , uk a sense of pride mixed with concern .
i live near the johnson space center and have relatives that have worked in the program as far back as gemini and apollo .
the space program is much more than a news story to us .
to those who think the space program is a waste of money : there is so much innovation and research that goes on behind the scenes that you 'd change your opinion if you took the time to look at what nasa has accomplished over the years and continues to accomplish today .
paul , houston , tx well , i 'm relieved it 's up there .
but they still seem to have this gung-ho attitude to safety .
i could n't believe that after killing two crews they are still happy to launch with a known serious fault .
chris hann , bay area , ca , usa congratulations to nasa on a successful launch .
i 'm glad to see that some nations still recognise the value of dreaming and aspiring to do great things and inspire their young people .
the money spent of spaceflight is miniscule compared to the many benefits .
it 's sad here in the uk that people are so ignorant and short-sighted with regards to space exploration that we ca n't see the good that can from it - and then we wonder the younger generations are n't interested in science , medicine and technology .
victor , birmingham , england this launch showed the world what can be accomplished with great teamwork , ambition and determination d soni , nuneaton , uk i watched the launch and was overcome with pride .
all the people involved in this great feat have overcome extreme obstacles .
this launch showed the world what can be accomplished with great teamwork , ambition and determination .
congratulations discovery !
d soni , nuneaton , uk mankind needs a vision .
interplanetary travel is necessary to achieve that end .
stuart haines , calgary , alberta , canada it 's time to junk the space shuttle and perhaps " rethink " this whole business of manned space flight for the time being .
think about it , other than as a showy display of national pride , what benefits do any nations get at this time from sending humans into space ?
perhaps in the future when we have real goals and reliable " safe " transportation we can start wasting our time and money with such " propaganda flights " , but now is n't the time and place for such foolishness .
charlie , niagara falls new york people always complain that space programs are too expensive , but do people appreciate how much safer the planet is with them ?
we can monitor dangerous weather , asteroids , and send tv , radio , and telephone signals via satellites .
space programs really have helped the planet excel in a positive way , and i 'm glad the discovery is finally continuing what has already been a remarkable feat of engineering .
tim hunt -lrb- 16 -rrb- , plymouth , england in these days darkened by the spectre of global terrorism , we seek hope and strength in many places .
the fog of war and the wind that whispers the question of " why are we fighting in the middle east ? ' diminish our confidence in our government .
today 's launch of the shuttle discovery renews our hope and faith in our abilities to overcome tragedy and defy adversity .
we owe the entire nasa family a debt of gratitude for restoring our faith in the human spirit .
paul telfer , franceville , gabon we need a new way of going to the stars clive , dartford , uk i wish the crew well on the mission , but the shuttle is old and just like any aircraft , it has its life expectancy and this bird has reached it .
we need a new way of going to the stars and to ditch the big firework approach to it .
clive , dartford , uk sure , okay .
maybe the shuttle programme is old .
maybe it should be scrapped for something better .
but , it is all we have at the moment .
and to all of you here who keep telling us to get rid of it , i have n't heard one of you say anything about putting up any money with us to fund a new programme .
jon , atlanta , usa what nasa needs is a real life scotty character to sort these technical issues out .
paul collier , london , uk the truth is that the shuttle concept has proved to be too expensive and technically complex to be the way forward in space .
i am pro-space exploration but the shuttle has slowed this to a crawl , and all the best work has been done by probes boosted by rockets e.g. mars landers , titan probes etc .
andy , uk " space is expensive ! " cry the critics .
i wish they would angle their criticism at a truly scandalous target .
the entire space programme to date has cost less than what the world spends on arms every year .
i know which i think is better value for money .
bernard o. quinn , barcelona , catalonia the exploration of space will continue with us or without us scott westwood , port orchard , wa , usa the shuttle is expensive , outdated and despite nasa 's assurances , its safety is still uncertain ; but it 's the only game in town .
the exploration of space will continue with us or without us ; to sit on the sidelines and watch others go up would be unthinkable for an america that prides itself on being a superpower .
scott westwood , port orchard , wa , usa space exploration is essential for the future of all humans .
flying over the atlantic was at first a risky endeavour and now it is done by millions every year without a thought for the early pioneers and the planes that never arrived .
colin , croydon , uk i do not understand all these people saying that america should scrap the shuttle , and spend it on ' the world ' .
the us is already the single largest contributor of foreign aid .
the us space program has helped everyday life for billions of people around the world , and churned out invention after invention for the world .
bill zimmer , seattle , wa congratulations to all those involved in discovery 's return to space !
to all the naysayers , next time you are browsing the internet on your pc , take a moment to find out what drove the development of semiconductors that power your pc .
yes , the space exploration that you think is a waste of money !
roger , london tears came to my eyes and i held my breath colleen , orlando , fl usa we were in the parking lot facing east , waiting and whispering to each other .
the first person to see the shuttle clearing the trees threw up their hand to point it out and some of the men started yelling , " go , baby , go ! " and cheering .
tears came to my eyes and i held my breath .
the space program has done so much to improve our lives in the fields of health and science , they further our knowledge of our environment and how our magnificent planet works .
colleen , orlando , fl usa go discovery !
the future of humanity is in space .
as an american living abroad , the lift-off of discovery is the first event that makes me proud to be american since leaving my country .
i hope that this success will lead to the completion of the iss and the continued exploration of space .
daniel valenti , canberra , australia people forget that we belong to this planet earth , in that our physical bodies are perfectly adapted to survive only on the earth .
we could never survive on other planets without extensive artificial aids .
as many have already pointed out , there are many , many more pressing needs requiring resolution and funds should be redirected where they are most needed for our survival on our home planet .

the crew on board the space shuttle have conducted inspections of discovery 's belly and repairs to the shuttle have also been carried out .
stephen robinson has begun a unique spacewalk , going under the orbiter 's belly to remove two ceramic strips sticking out between heatshield tiles .
nasa engineers are concerned the strips would cause part of discovery to overheat as it re-enters the earth 's atmosphere .
discovery had been due to return to earth on 7 august , but nasa has decided to extend the mission by an extra day .
what do you think of the mission so far ?
how do you feel about the mission being extended ?
what do you think about the repairs ?

this debate is now closed .
read a selection of your comments below .
click here to read a second page of your comments the following comments reflect the balance of opinion we have received so far : the money that is spent by the american government on space exploration could be much better spent on healthcare and education .
this would be much more beneficial to the american people than discovery 's mission .
carolynne burkholder , vancouver , british columbia i can not believe that the crew had to cobble together a hacksaw norman west , truro , cornwall i can not believe that the crew had to cobble together a hacksaw .
a small box of tools from any diy shop would have done the job .
also removing a gap filler between the tiles exposes a gap .
surely the wind can get in and potentially lift a tile causing a fatal problem .
norman west , truro , cornwall whilst i can see that advances may be made through this work , i saw two items on the news last night - one about children dying because they have n't got a few quid , the other about spending millions on keeping the shuttles going in and out of space .
priority check please .
mark , didcot , england space travel is dangerous , pioneers are going to die , but it is worthwhile .
what is needed now are new spaceships to let us travel between planets .
at the moment all our eggs are in one basket , we need to find other homes on other worlds .
we have made this one nearly uninhabitable .
i would go into space whatever the risk .
ruth , walsall maybe if all the countries stopped being so petty and pooled their resources , we 'd have superior technology and fewer incidents like this .
we do n't need to race against each other anymore to try and prove who 's superior ; instead we should look to a future of co-operation .
gaz , cardiff , uk i will never understand why we waste so much money on primitive space stations john gearing , st. helens , uk i will never understand why we waste so much money on primitive space stations and shuttles which clearly have no function for the human race at this time .
i do n't know why we do n't get all our experts and fund them in coming up with unmanned technologies and technology in shuttles that could take us to planets not to a tin can in the sky which is over expensive and serves no function to the mass population .
john gearing , st. helens , uk fascinating a brit would ask the question why the us is sending people into space .
as the brit , george mallory said in 1924 , " because its there " .
mt everest killed mallory and we remember him for his quest .
in a similar quest , the us will continue to go into space - because its there .
john b , windermere , florida do some of these contributors have no soul ?
what could be more magnificent than seeing human beings taking risks to explore the unknown ; triumphing over the problems they meet along the way ; opening up new horizons for the rest of us ?
yes let 's invest in a new space transportation system , and more manned flights , and unmanned probes and a bigger , better space station .
but to claim that stopping the current flights is sensible shows no faith in the species at all .
stop looking down at the ground and start looking up at the stars .
john r smith , uk please , armchair scientists , let the experts at nasa do their job making the risk calculations .
they 've got the know-how and the tools to make the decisions .
not you or me .
joe , usa this is the most ridiculous expenditure of precious funds in a time of great national travail .
nasa is an anachronism , a patronistic pet rock that has no justification whatsoever , especially in the current environment in which civilized societies are fighting for their mere existence .
the irresponsibility in launching this mission in the face of known deficiencies is appalling .
c. a. la varre , newport , ri usa the media paints such a doom and gloom picture of what is happening above us phil , hampshire , uk why-oh-why does the media take such a negative view to what the men and women on sts114 are doing .
the media paints such a doom and gloom picture of what is happening above us .
we as a united world should watch and praise these people who are up there performing the most fantastic things known to mankind .
yes there is a difficult time coming on returning to earth but the crew at this time seem very positive about it .
may i suggest that you all watch nasa tv on the web for real live happenings .
phil , hampshire , uk nasa is undergoing drastic changes .
i think the us should pause and take stock of what 's happening to their space missions .
give it a break , sort out problems and return 10years later .
i wonder how the us ever landed man on the moon ?
did they really ?
i wonder !
errol , dubai , uae space flight is still in its infancy .
so the fact that an astronaut was able to make a repair to the shuttle in space is a great triumph .
nasa should look on this feat in a positive light , not a negative one .
we know in the days of sailing ships as they travelled the globe to discover new lands , there were many times when sailors had to climb up masts in storms to make repairs , so is repairing space craft in flight any different ?
leon aarons , petach israel another piece of space theatre , justifying manned flight .
unmanned craft can put payloads into orbit much more cheaply , as well as exploring other planets .
martin , dubai , uae i 've just seen a picture of the tool , held together with strong tape that the astronauts used .
it 's great to imagine that a billion-dollar aircraft can be saved by a bit of strong tape and some elbow grease !
it 's that sort of thinking that 's saved astronauts in the past .
good luck to them , hope humans carry on going into space for many more years .
dave , manchester , uk this spacewalk and repair demonstrates two things .
firstly , the courage and initiative of the astronauts , secondly , the importance of retiring the ageing shuttle fleet and building a modern spacecraft .
electronics and materials technology have advanced tremendously in the past 30 years , but the shuttle is still using outdated technology .
gordon mcstraun , uk so , the offending piece if gap filler from between a couple of heat shields .
i 'm no nasa expert , but does n't this mean that the is now a gap between these tiles ?
michael , bucks , uk the astronauts are all volunteers , they know the risks involved , and that is why i praise and thank them kirsty , cambridge , uk i think it is fantastic that discovery has launched and its mission is going well .
a lesson has been learnt from colombia , and indeed , challenger .
the astronauts are all volunteers , they know the risks involved , and that is why i praise and thank them .
they are incredible people .
kirsty , cambridge , uk so what if the filler problem has to be fixed with a jerry-rigged hacksaw ?
this type of ingenuity has been saving lives since the age of tall ships and can only reflect well on the tenacity of the nasa engineers and astronauts .
remember when the progress hit mir ?
apollo 13 ?
we need the experience of these problems to give us the know-how to survive in space and give us the confidence in our ability to solve problems on longer , bolder voyages .
tim parker , edinburgh , scotland i work with remote operated vehicles in the oil and gas industry .
i am amazed that the crew of the discovery need to cobble together a makeshift hacksaw to carry out a job on the tiles .
the shuttles are old and things will go wrong so you would expect a decent tool kit to be onboard .
james , paderne , portugal why are the americans still sending people into space ?
if they want to explore they should be thinking of unmanned flights with intelligent technology which can spend decades in space .
this should help the ozone layer repair itself .
more is needed to be done to explore and catalogue this planet and its systems , this will be of more benefit to mankind and our home than space travel .
haz , nottingham , uk is going up in the shuttle much more dangerous than sailing unknown oceans a few hundred years ago in wooden ships ?
thank goodness that throughout history not everyone has wanted to sit at home in comfort in their own small world .
simon , manchester , uk with so many comings and goings to and from iss , would it not be sensible for just the bare minimum of crew to return in this shuttle and send up a half-empty shuttle to collect the rest of them ?
why take unnecessary risks ?
fraser irving , sheffield , uk until now , the shuttle missions have been routine , like taking a walk in the park .
but the reality of danger with the loss of two shuttles has almost brought the space program to its knees .
should it continue ?
of course it must go on because too much is at stake .
closing the space station , and not looking into space is the worst we can do .
life on earth is becoming dangerous .
we must look to the stars if humanity is to survive .
walter , chapel hill , nc i think - and hope - this flight is one of the safest ever .
my guess is the problems have appeared simply because they have been looking for them far more carefully than before .
however , there 's no doubt a replacement spacecraft is needed .
the private " space ship one " has a slow re-entry , avoiding thermal problems .
is this possible from orbit ?
and a separate , unmanned cargo vehicle seems a " no-brainer " .
simon , bristol it must be frightening for the astronauts but the space programme must prevail anya , london pioneers always take risks so that everyone else can eventually follow .
it must be frightening for the astronauts but the space programme must prevail .
updated technology is definitely needed .
unmanned missions are a good idea , but ultimately there is no substitute for human actions and reactions .
anya , london interesting to note that the two shuttle losses have not been due to design or engineering flaws in the shuttle themselves , but rather the propulsion system .
for 30 year old vehicles , i think the shuttles are doing pretty well , and i am sure they will continue for a long time .
matt , bristol space exploration is dangerous and the crew knows this better than any of us - and they still volunteered for it .
my view is that we need to continue to explore space and the shuttle repair should be seen as an experience that needs to be faced at some time .
let 's not be weak about this .
george , chelmsford what nasa has done is simply awesome .
nasa is the adventurer of our era , looking at and investigating things that are far bigger than us .
i say ground the space shuttles , but do not skimp on quickly building bigger , better , and safer spacecraft to replace them .
sk , ithaca , ny space technology is too integrated in our daily lives now peter byrd , worcester the few people who mock space projects should not use anything connected with space technology as a protest !
i bet hardly anyone would manage it or really want to .
space technology is too integrated in our daily lives now ; we all enjoy the advantages we get from it .
nasa tv via the net alone shows me how wonderful space is .
peter byrd , worcester i have just returned from florida where i was privileged enough to witness the breathtaking launch first hand .
it seems as though there are increasing difficulties using these shuttles .
are the lives of 7 astronauts each time it takes off a risk that is worth taking ?
matt , london given the loss of columbia and the uncertainty of this mission , nasa should scrap the shuttle programme .
luck prevented previous disasters and it would appear nasa 's luck has run out .
what makes them feel confident that they can repair in space what they failed to repair in two years on the ground ?
my thoughts are with the families of those on the iss .
phil , bracknell , uk the problems with discovery must have been encountered with all the previous shuttle flights .
it appears that each time it took off , it was russian roulette as to whether it would return safely .
this program should be abandoned until a new and safer means of transporting the shuttle into space can be developed .
chris , brazil will the resulting depression between the tiles create a possibility of a chink in the armour ?
k chowksey , bangalore , india even if the pieces sticking out are pulled or hacked , will the resulting depression between the tiles create a possibility of a chink in the armour ?
even a depression can alter the aerodynamic behaviour -lrb- as in golf balls -rrb- .
this will create uneven heat distribution .
k chowksey , bangalore , india from the idealists point of view we really should not be thinking about costs here .
space exploration is vital , not only to our technological development as a species , but also in terms of our wider understanding of the universe .
the whole nasa infrastructure is quite frankly awesome .
every endeavour has its risks and we 've seen the tragic consequences of those risks with the previous accidents .
chris , bracknell we need to explore space ; when you go to hospital and have a cat scan or an mri , that technology has come from the space program .
there is nothing wrong with the shuttle - the problem is with the way it is maintained .
they need to do better , i do n't know why do n't they paint it again , and seal the foam .
carol , pa , usa the saddest thing for me about this mission is that the next time the iss is visible from england on august 11th , the shuttle will have already left .
hopefully we 'll get to see the shuttle during the next mission .
after the moon , the iss is the brightest object in the night sky .
john airey , peterborough i looked at the images of the underside of the shuttle and thought that it looked like really bad bathroom tiling rob , spain major advances need to be made to the whole concept of effective re-entry heat-shield technology .
even before lift-off , i looked at the images of the underside of the shuttle and thought that it looked like really bad bathroom tiling .
initially , i expected it to be a smooth , seamless surface , but it was a patchwork of light and dark areas with patches that looked more raised than others .
i assume that tiles are the best option at the moment , but in future this issue needs to be solved completely .
rob , spain if nasa has decided to just rip out the relatively small strips protruding from between the heat shield tiles , then why ca n't they ask astronaut steve robinson to take his experimental repair kit out with him and fill the gaps with the mastic gum that they used to ' fix ' the tiles in their earlier experiments ?
paul greer , gothenburg , sweden i worked as an engineer on skylab in the 70s and i consider this nasa debacle a disgrace .
unknown risk is one thing , but gambling with lives on known problems with solutions is unacceptable .
i say : bring some crew home in russian capsule , leave the rest of the crew up there , fix the foam on atlantis -lrb- and everything else possible -rrb- and then send a rescue mission .
then ground the antiques and use modern technology to build new spacecraft .
rich dusek , orchard lake , mi , us bruce from huntsville says it 's not a trivial engineering problem and he 's probably right .
but that does n't alter the documented fact that nasa has sent people into space against the advice of contractors who have told them that certain aspects are n't safe .
if shuttles are prone to bits falling off then they should n't be flying .
david , chelmsford uk nasa do n't build all the parts and therefore an outside company may be partly responsible james , uk why do people expect space travel to be perfectly safe ?
look at any picture of launch and remember the orange tank is full of fuel and both white rockets once started ca n't be stopped .
man in space is an essential part of our future .
the earth can not sustain us forever particularly its natural resources .
i also think people should recognise that nasa do n't build all the parts and therefore an outside company may be partly responsible .
james , uk the problems with the space transportation system are a classic example of what happens when whole-life costs are not taken into account during early design phases of the system .
congress chose to buy shuttle on the cheap , opting for solid fuel boosters and a disposable fuel tank instead of spending extra money upfront to design a fully-reusable fly-back first stage to take the orbiter into space .
the result has been far higher operating costs and , tragically , the loss of fourteen astronauts .
will it be too much to hope that senior agency managers and politicians will learn these lessons in defining our future access to space ?
in europe as well as the usa .
phil , bath , uk so far this particular mission has been very worrying for relatives of the discovery crew .
any venture into space is a risk , but this one seems to have gone ahead knowing this risk factor was much higher than usual .
why are these missions so important ?
the risk factor is too great to risk innocent lives .
stop them now .
jose a holmes , loughborough , england i wish the crew a safe return but am sorry to see resources wasted on a manned flight with little real value for essentially political and pr reasons while much more scientifically valuable unmanned work is scaled back to pay for it .
this is all about the advancement of the usa , not science .
julian , london , uk the debris issue has been present in the shuttle programme from day one .
the tiles themselves are so fragile you can break them with one hand .
the space shuttle is a wonderful vehicle , but sadly owing to it 's bizarre design , is inherently dangerous and needs to be replaced soon .
as richard feynman said after the challenger disaster , " for a successful technology , reality must take precedence over public relations , for nature can not be fooled . "
chris dyer , bristol , england the immediate future of the space program will be best served by robot missions dr malcolm fairbairn , uk / sweden i , like most people connected with astrophysics , think that the immediate future of the space program will be best served by robot missions for at least the next twenty years .
it 's not taking a step backwards ; it 's about developing and testing new technologies which will eventually be applied to human spaceflight .
for the same amount of money you get much more science done with robotic missions because you do n't have to worry about the fragile humans .
dr malcolm fairbairn , uk / sweden as an aerospace engineer , in this particular instance i am not worried about discovery .
all indications are that the debris did no damage .
long term , though , it could be a problem .
the space shuttle has never fulfilled the promises that were made for it .
it is an expensive vehicle of very limited utility .
it consumes resources which could be better used elsewhere in the us space program .
andrew ogilvie , modesto , california , usa robert heinlein said it : " the earth is too small and fragile a basket for humanity to keep all its eggs in . "
the only safe place to be when disaster comes -lrb- an asteroid for example -rrb- is somewhere else .
well done , discovery .
keep it up .
john fielder , workington , uk there are a lot of negative comments on here by people who really have not done their research .
there are so many inventions that have come to be due to space travel most are indirect , technology passed to the public after it has been created to aid nasa and the like in various projects .
adam ransom , birmingham space flight is one of the things that most excites me jehuda arieh veenman , haifa , israel space flight is one of the things that most excites me .
it breaks my heart that foam broke off the insulation again .
apparently , the design has a basic flaw ; the vulnerable heat shield is exposed to a bombardment of debris falling of during take off .
in the more old fashioned designs , the heat shields were protected during take off .
jehuda arieh veenman , haifa , israel it seems to me that the logical fix for the launch system would be to mount the shuttle higher relative to the fuel tank .
the coldness of the fuel is always going to be a problem in causing freezing of water and air in and around the foam insulation .
since that is the nature of the beast , get the shuttle out of harms way above the possible falling debris nigel dandridge-perry , los angeles ca , usa good luck discovery , i look forward to seeing a safe flight back to earth .
mark , dorset there is no progress with manned missions .
it 's more of the same .
while unmanned missions are discovering lakes of water on mars , landing on distant moons and exploring planets , the manned missions are trying to work out how to stop foam falling off the fuel tank .
leave floating around in orbit to the chinese and get exploring .

the shuttle programme shows the greatness the human race can achieve when we focus .
a commitment should be made to give it whatever financial support it needs to continue .
nasa tv shows discovery 's latest mission is gripping .
we owe it to those astronauts who have lost their lives in space exploration , to carry on the work that they could n't finish .
d ward , portsmouth i have become addicted to nasa tv over the last few days , and find myself staring into space , thinking of discovery up there somewhere ... looking back on our little planet from a distance .
i am surely concerned about the debris ; remember nasa did not think this would be a problem for the ill-fated columbia crew either .
they have spent two years and thousands of dollars on this problem - so yes , i think we should be concerned , not only about the debris ' implications , but also that nasa got it wrong again .
verity worthington , bewdley , worcestershire hundreds of years ago people were afraid that they could sail off the edges of the earth .
thank heavens there were brave sailors then willing to push the limits of courage and technology , and thank heavens we still have them today .
i 'm also grateful that there are still those willing to fund such expeditions .
rob g. , kansas city , usa the disaster 2 years ago , and these recent problems with the shuttle show that nasa really need to get on with developing the next generation of re-useable shuttles .
technology has moved on so much in the nearly 30 years since it was developed with computer technology and new lightweight materials .
if they do n't , then the private space firms will take over , while nasa keeps flogging a dead horse .
tane piper , edinburgh , uk we are all with you , looking forward for success .
god be with you .
no surrender no retreat .
martin madulu , moshi - tanzania i am more worried about the apparent loss of a tile than the foam .
if any of the tiles were damaged , the mission is in jeopardy .
after the columbia disaster , i read an article published in 1980 calling the shuttles ' death traps ' .
considering that we 've already lost half the fleet , i think it is high time nasa invested in a different , more robust technology .
istvan , detroit , usa the safety of the crew should be of utmost importance , not launch schedules ss , usa my family and i were vacationing in florida at the time of the launch .
we saw it speeding skyward from the car on our way back home .
i am an aerospace design engineer specializing in flight dynamics .
my concern really lies with the inadequacy with which nasa has dealt with the foam / tile problem .
the safety of the crew should be of utmost importance , not launch schedules .
ss , usa only those at nasa who have looked at the images of debris falling will have the best idea .
the crew 's safe return is just our concern but it 's their mission .
venkat maruthamuthu , urbana , il , usa why was this problem not resolved after columbia two years ago ?
it is very wrong to send yet more people up there without being absolutely sure that it 's safe .
perhaps space travel should wait until we have progressed far enough that we are not relying on tiles that can just fall off ?
catherine , cheshunt , herts great to see the shuttle soar again .
our future lies not on earth but out there somewhere .
no matter how you argue it , in the future this planet will die and so will all those life forms still on it .
if the human species is to survive , then it must do so elsewhere and this sort of technology is the first step towards that ultimate goal .
ian jordan , wokingham the foam formulation was changed in 1996 ... most of the foam issues started after this change bruce g , huntsville , usa this is not a trivial engineering problem as some have implied .
there are two types of foam : a lightweight foam covering the large areas of the tank and a dense ablator foam covering areas exposed to aerodynamic heating .
the foam is exposed to supersonic airflow at about 27000 km / h -lrb- 17000 mph -rrb- during launch .
there are shock cones coming from the orbiter , the connecting struts and solid boosters which impinge on the tank .
there is also a lot of vibration .
the foam formulation was changed in 1996 to comply with the montreal protocol and eliminate the freon propellant .
most of the foam issues started after this change and may or may not be associated with it .
the shuttle is due to be retired in 2010 and solving this problem is important for future spacecraft design .
bruce g , huntsville , usa why ca n't the return module be encased within the main take off rocket ?
this would prevent bits flying off from damaging it .
tony lee , telford we were on vacation in orlando , and had tickets for the astronaut hall of fame to watch the original scheduled lift-off on 13 july .
we had such a good view , but with about an hour or so to go , the launch was cancelled .
we were gutted to have missed such a spectacular sight !
we watched it on television back here in ireland , but felt we had a special bond with sts 114 - return to flight .
we just hope now for the safe return of the shuttle and its crew on 7 august .
good luck to them .
hutch family , ireland one day when someone is sipping cocktails on saturn 's lunar resort , whilst looking back at the earth and the distant sun , they 'll thank these brave people for risking their lives .
let 's keep our nerve , and not look back .
chris phillips , chelmsford , essex it is an inherent part of our nature to explore caroline , edinburgh , uk i used to work at one of the nasa centres -lrb- in maryland -rrb- and i hope that space exploration continues .
as a scientist it is an inherent part of our nature to explore , discover and find out about the unknown .
i was overjoyed to see the launch of discovery and hope , beyond all hope , that they make it safely home .
as nasa have said - " exploring space is not for the faint hearted ' - it 's a huge undertaking " .
the astronauts know that , we all know that .
these are very brave people and i wish them , and nasa , well with their endeavours .
caroline , edinburgh , uk watching this made me feel giddy .
now hopefully we can complete the iss and get on with the business of colonising space .
the spirit of adventure lives on with discovery and her crew .
david mills , ballymena , uk we were very privileged to be able to see discovery launch when it flew mission 105 and the impression it left us with was ' it was amazing to see ' .
we believe that the crew and the engineers will be able to work together and face the challenge of bringing back this magnificent ship .
instead of shrinking from the challenge we should rise up to it just as they did in 1970 for apollo 13 , it is only by stretching our knowledge such as in times of emergencies that we reach beyond our capabilities .
good luck and best wishes to the crew and engineers .
julie and robert , manchester , england i would like to see the shuttle retired and replaced with a newer fleet scott , edinburgh congratulations to nasa on another successful launch .
however , i would like to see the shuttle retired and replaced with a newer and more capable fleet of vehicles .
not only will it be safer and hugely beneficial to space exploration , the project would provide thousands of jobs , contracts to companies and benefit the global economy .
scott , edinburgh people seem to forget that manned space travel is still very dangerous and those brave astronauts know the risks .
foam has been falling off fuel tanks for nearly 25 years now .
perhaps money should now be invested in developing better glue and a more efficient reusable manned space travel system .
john ellis , nottingham statistically , if commercial flights carried the same risks as spaceflight , there would be about 500 airliner crashes per day .
one therefore has to applaud the courage and determination of those people who accept this degree of risk in pursuit of our quest for knowledge .
we are an inquisitive species , in this case pushing the boundaries of what is possible .
i wish those seven brave souls a safe return .
bob , cheshire i 've been following the ' space race ' since sputnik and the mercury missions , and i ca n't think of anything more exciting than a successful launch .
but why do n't we stop racing against each other and form stronger international collaborations to make space travel safer ?
j forman , los angeles , usa if nasa says the shuttle is safe to fly , it 's safe to fly james , los angeles , usa it amazes me how many observers believe they are more of an expert on shuttle safety and capability than the engineers at nasa .
the fact is , the men and women who work at nasa are at the top of their field .
if they say the shuttle is safe to fly , it 's safe to fly .
james , los angeles , usa it was a beautiful launch .
the space shuttle program has been remarkably successful despite the previous disaster .
nobody can engineer absolute perfection , but this was very close .
h neil , south texas , usa i am very concerned about the damaged tiles on discovery , especially in light of nasa 's apparent slowness in acknowledging that the take-off incident with columbia caused the disaster upon return .
there is an option for the crew of discovery - to wait on the space station for rescue .
how can we even contemplate risking their lives ?
if the problem is serious enough to ground the fleet , discovery too should be ' grounded ' immediately .
sharon , dallas , texas i once saw a presentation on how the challenger disaster came to happen and how it could have been prevented and it made my blood run cold .
suffice it to say , i have nothing but the most profound admiration for the courage of the crews of the shuttle .
i 'm not a religious man , but i just hope to god they all get back safely .
steve , chesham tragic as the columbia accident was , the astronauts died doing what they loved - exploring space , a privilege only the select few get to do .
they also died at the end of their trip so they got to enjoy being in space , unlike the challenger crew .
before the columbia accident , i would expect that the shuttles got through intact in much worse condition than discovery .
i am not that concerned , although i will follow the investigations with great interest .
ian , london it seems ridiculous that it is being jeopardised by something so simple chris , brazil the shuttle has been up and down into space about 50 times before the columbia incident .
i can not believe that bits of foam from the fuel tank did n't come off during these trips .
are n't nasa being a bit super cautious about this problem ?
ca n't they encase the fuel tank in some sort of wire mesh in order to prevent the foam from breaking off ?
in such a high tech programme , it seems ridiculous that it is being jeopardised by something so simple .
chris , brazil what exactly are they doing out there that they have not had the chance to do before ?
first of all get a new ship and then go somewhere else than the moon !
that impressed my grand father , it will take more to impress me !
mathieu , gatineau , canada bits of foam have probably been falling off the shuttle since the first launch , but it 's only since a piece of that debris caused the destruction of columbia two years ago that anyone has noticed !
only now we have cameras watching every single part of the craft do we see what may well have been happening all along .
carry on as normal .
simon , peterborough , uk i remember watching the first ever shuttle flight as a kid .
i watched the launch the other day and got the exact same feelings of awe and excitement .
the shuttle launch is a wake up call to everyone .
sure the world has problems right now but despite those problems , look what we 're capable of !
my message to nasa , the esa and all the other agencies ?
keep going people .
take us there !
andrew k jones , wrexham , uk i watched the launch live on the internet and was overwhelmed .
we wo n't know of the mission 's success until 7 aug , but what surprises me is the us way of making everything b

the crew on board the space shuttle have conducted inspections of discovery 's belly and repairs to the shuttle have also been carried out .
stephen robinson has begun a unique spacewalk , going under the orbiter 's belly to remove two ceramic strips sticking out between heatshield tiles .
nasa engineers are concerned the strips would cause part of discovery to overheat as it re-enters the earth 's atmosphere .
discovery had been due to return to earth on 7 august , but nasa has decided to extend the mission by an extra day .
what do you think of the mission so far ?
how do you feel about the mission being extended ?
what do you think about the repairs ?

read a selection of your comments below .
click here to read a second page of your comments the following comments reflect the balance of opinion we have received so far : the money that is spent by the american government on space exploration could be much better spent on healthcare and education .
this would be much more beneficial to the american people than discovery 's mission .
carolynne burkholder , vancouver , british columbia i can not believe that the crew had to cobble together a hacksaw norman west , truro , cornwall i can not believe that the crew had to cobble together a hacksaw .
a small box of tools from any diy shop would have done the job .
also removing a gap filler between the tiles exposes a gap .
surely the wind can get in and potentially lift a tile causing a fatal problem .
norman west , truro , cornwall whilst i can see that advances may be made through this work , i saw two items on the news last night - one about children dying because they have n't got a few quid , the other about spending millions on keeping the shuttles going in and out of space .
priority check please .
mark , didcot , england space travel is dangerous , pioneers are going to die , but it is worthwhile .
what is needed now are new spaceships to let us travel between planets .
at the moment all our eggs are in one basket , we need to find other homes on other worlds .
we have made this one nearly uninhabitable .
i would go into space whatever the risk .
ruth , walsall maybe if all the countries stopped being so petty and pooled their resources , we 'd have superior technology and fewer incidents like this .
we do n't need to race against each other anymore to try and prove who 's superior ; instead we should look to a future of co-operation .
gaz , cardiff , uk i will never understand why we waste so much money on primitive space stations john gearing , st. helens , uk i will never understand why we waste so much money on primitive space stations and shuttles which clearly have no function for the human race at this time .
i do n't know why we do n't get all our experts and fund them in coming up with unmanned technologies and technology in shuttles that could take us to planets not to a tin can in the sky which is over expensive and serves no function to the mass population .
john gearing , st. helens , uk fascinating a brit would ask the question why the us is sending people into space .
as the brit , george mallory said in 1924 , " because its there " .
mt everest killed mallory and we remember him for his quest .
in a similar quest , the us will continue to go into space - because its there .
john b , windermere , florida do some of these contributors have no soul ?
what could be more magnificent than seeing human beings taking risks to explore the unknown ; triumphing over the problems they meet along the way ; opening up new horizons for the rest of us ?
yes let 's invest in a new space transportation system , and more manned flights , and unmanned probes and a bigger , better space station .
but to claim that stopping the current flights is sensible shows no faith in the species at all .
stop looking down at the ground and start looking up at the stars .
john r smith , uk please , armchair scientists , let the experts at nasa do their job making the risk calculations .
they 've got the know-how and the tools to make the decisions .
not you or me .
joe , usa this is the most ridiculous expenditure of precious funds in a time of great national travail .
nasa is an anachronism , a patronistic pet rock that has no justification whatsoever , especially in the current environment in which civilized societies are fighting for their mere existence .
the irresponsibility in launching this mission in the face of known deficiencies is appalling .
c. a. la varre , newport , ri usa the media paints such a doom and gloom picture of what is happening above us phil , hampshire , uk why-oh-why does the media take such a negative view to what the men and women on sts114 are doing .
the media paints such a doom and gloom picture of what is happening above us .
we as a united world should watch and praise these people who are up there performing the most fantastic things known to mankind .
yes there is a difficult time coming on returning to earth but the crew at this time seem very positive about it .
may i suggest that you all watch nasa tv on the web for real live happenings .
phil , hampshire , uk nasa is undergoing drastic changes .
i think the us should pause and take stock of what 's happening to their space missions .
give it a break , sort out problems and return 10years later .
i wonder how the us ever landed man on the moon ?
did they really ?
i wonder !
errol , dubai , uae space flight is still in its infancy .
so the fact that an astronaut was able to make a repair to the shuttle in space is a great triumph .
nasa should look on this feat in a positive light , not a negative one .
we know in the days of sailing ships as they travelled the globe to discover new lands , there were many times when sailors had to climb up masts in storms to make repairs , so is repairing space craft in flight any different ?
leon aarons , petach israel another piece of space theatre , justifying manned flight .
unmanned craft can put payloads into orbit much more cheaply , as well as exploring other planets .
martin , dubai , uae i 've just seen a picture of the tool , held together with strong tape that the astronauts used .
it 's great to imagine that a billion-dollar aircraft can be saved by a bit of strong tape and some elbow grease !
it 's that sort of thinking that 's saved astronauts in the past .
good luck to them , hope humans carry on going into space for many more years .
dave , manchester , uk this spacewalk and repair demonstrates two things .
firstly , the courage and initiative of the astronauts , secondly , the importance of retiring the ageing shuttle fleet and building a modern spacecraft .
electronics and materials technology have advanced tremendously in the past 30 years , but the shuttle is still using outdated technology .
gordon mcstraun , uk so , the offending piece if gap filler from between a couple of heat shields .
i 'm no nasa expert , but does n't this mean that the is now a gap between these tiles ?
michael , bucks , uk the astronauts are all volunteers , they know the risks involved , and that is why i praise and thank them kirsty , cambridge , uk i think it is fantastic that discovery has launched and its mission is going well .
a lesson has been learnt from colombia , and indeed , challenger .
the astronauts are all volunteers , they know the risks involved , and that is why i praise and thank them .
they are incredible people .
kirsty , cambridge , uk so what if the filler problem has to be fixed with a jerry-rigged hacksaw ?
this type of ingenuity has been saving lives since the age of tall ships and can only reflect well on the tenacity of the nasa engineers and astronauts .
remember when the progress hit mir ?
apollo 13 ?
we need the experience of these problems to give us the know-how to survive in space and give us the confidence in our ability to solve problems on longer , bolder voyages .
tim parker , edinburgh , scotland i work with remote operated vehicles in the oil and gas industry .
i am amazed that the crew of the discovery need to cobble together a makeshift hacksaw to carry out a job on the tiles .
the shuttles are old and things will go wrong so you would expect a decent tool kit to be onboard .
james , paderne , portugal why are the americans still sending people into space ?
if they want to explore they should be thinking of unmanned flights with intelligent technology which can spend decades in space .
this should help the ozone layer repair itself .
more is needed to be done to explore and catalogue this planet and its systems , this will be of more benefit to mankind and our home than space travel .
haz , nottingham , uk is going up in the shuttle much more dangerous than sailing unknown oceans a few hundred years ago in wooden ships ?
thank goodness that throughout history not everyone has wanted to sit at home in comfort in their own small world .
simon , manchester , uk with so many comings and goings to and from iss , would it not be sensible for just the bare minimum of crew to return in this shuttle and send up a half-empty shuttle to collect the rest of them ?
why take unnecessary risks ?
fraser irving , sheffield , uk until now , the shuttle missions have been routine , like taking a walk in the park .
but the reality of danger with the loss of two shuttles has almost brought the space program to its knees .
should it continue ?
of course it must go on because too much is at stake .
closing the space station , and not looking into space is the worst we can do .
life on earth is becoming dangerous .
we must look to the stars if humanity is to survive .
walter , chapel hill , nc i think - and hope - this flight is one of the safest ever .
my guess is the problems have appeared simply because they have been looking for them far more carefully than before .
however , there 's no doubt a replacement spacecraft is needed .
the private " space ship one " has a slow re-entry , avoiding thermal problems .
is this possible from orbit ?
and a separate , unmanned cargo vehicle seems a " no-brainer " .
simon , bristol it must be frightening for the astronauts but the space programme must prevail anya , london pioneers always take risks so that everyone else can eventually follow .
it must be frightening for the astronauts but the space programme must prevail .
updated technology is definitely needed .
unmanned missions are a good idea , but ultimately there is no substitute for human actions and reactions .
anya , london interesting to note that the two shuttle losses have not been due to design or engineering flaws in the shuttle themselves , but rather the propulsion system .
for 30 year old vehicles , i think the shuttles are doing pretty well , and i am sure they will continue for a long time .
matt , bristol space exploration is dangerous and the crew knows this better than any of us - and they still volunteered for it .
my view is that we need to continue to explore space and the shuttle repair should be seen as an experience that needs to be faced at some time .
let 's not be weak about this .
george , chelmsford what nasa has done is simply awesome .
nasa is the adventurer of our era , looking at and investigating things that are far bigger than us .
i say ground the space shuttles , but do not skimp on quickly building bigger , better , and safer spacecraft to replace them .
sk , ithaca , ny space technology is too integrated in our daily lives now peter byrd , worcester the few people who mock space projects should not use anything connected with space technology as a protest !
i bet hardly anyone would manage it or really want to .
space technology is too integrated in our daily lives now ; we all enjoy the advantages we get from it .
nasa tv via the net alone shows me how wonderful space is .
peter byrd , worcester i have just returned from florida where i was privileged enough to witness the breathtaking launch first hand .
it seems as though there are increasing difficulties using these shuttles .
are the lives of 7 astronauts each time it takes off a risk that is worth taking ?
matt , london given the loss of columbia and the uncertainty of this mission , nasa should scrap the shuttle programme .
luck prevented previous disasters and it would appear nasa 's luck has run out .
what makes them feel confident that they can repair in space what they failed to repair in two years on the ground ?
my thoughts are with the families of those on the iss .
phil , bracknell , uk the problems with discovery must have been encountered with all the previous shuttle flights .
it appears that each time it took off , it was russian roulette as to whether it would return safely .
this program should be abandoned until a new and safer means of transporting the shuttle into space can be developed .
chris , brazil will the resulting depression between the tiles create a possibility of a chink in the armour ?
k chowksey , bangalore , india even if the pieces sticking out are pulled or hacked , will the resulting depression between the tiles create a possibility of a chink in the armour ?
even a depression can alter the aerodynamic behaviour -lrb- as in golf balls -rrb- .
this will create uneven heat distribution .
k chowksey , bangalore , india from the idealists point of view we really should not be thinking about costs here .
space exploration is vital , not only to our technological development as a species , but also in terms of our wider understanding of the universe .
the whole nasa infrastructure is quite frankly awesome .
every endeavour has its risks and we 've seen the tragic consequences of those risks with the previous accidents .
chris , bracknell we need to explore space ; when you go to hospital and have a cat scan or an mri , that technology has come from the space program .
there is nothing wrong with the shuttle - the problem is with the way it is maintained .
they need to do better , i do n't know why do n't they paint it again , and seal the foam .
carol , pa , usa the saddest thing for me about this mission is that the next time the iss is visible from england on august 11th , the shuttle will have already left .
hopefully we 'll get to see the shuttle during the next mission .
after the moon , the iss is the brightest object in the night sky .
john airey , peterborough i looked at the images of the underside of the shuttle and thought that it looked like really bad bathroom tiling rob , spain major advances need to be made to the whole concept of effective re-entry heat-shield technology .
even before lift-off , i looked at the images of the underside of the shuttle and thought that it looked like really bad bathroom tiling .
initially , i expected it to be a smooth , seamless surface , but it was a patchwork of light and dark areas with patches that looked more raised than others .
i assume that tiles are the best option at the moment , but in future this issue needs to be solved completely .
rob , spain if nasa has decided to just rip out the relatively small strips protruding from between the heat shield tiles , then why ca n't they ask astronaut steve robinson to take his experimental repair kit out with him and fill the gaps with the mastic gum that they used to ' fix ' the tiles in their earlier experiments ?
paul greer , gothenburg , sweden i worked as an engineer on skylab in the 70s and i consider this nasa debacle a disgrace .
unknown risk is one thing , but gambling with lives on known problems with solutions is unacceptable .
i say : bring some crew home in russian capsule , leave the rest of the crew up there , fix the foam on atlantis -lrb- and everything else possible -rrb- and then send a rescue mission .
then ground the antiques and use modern technology to build new spacecraft .
rich dusek , orchard lake , mi , us bruce from huntsville says it 's not a trivial engineering problem and he 's probably right .
but that does n't alter the documented fact that nasa has sent people into space against the advice of contractors who have told them that certain aspects are n't safe .
if shuttles are prone to bits falling off then they should n't be flying .
david , chelmsford uk nasa do n't build all the parts and therefore an outside company may be partly responsible james , uk why do people expect space travel to be perfectly safe ?
look at any picture of launch and remember the orange tank is full of fuel and both white rockets once started ca n't be stopped .
man in space is an essential part of our future .
the earth can not sustain us forever particularly its natural resources .
i also think people should recognise that nasa do n't build all the parts and therefore an outside company may be partly responsible .
james , uk the problems with the space transportation system are a classic example of what happens when whole-life costs are not taken into account during early design phases of the system .
congress chose to buy shuttle on the cheap , opting for solid fuel boosters and a disposable fuel tank instead of spending extra money upfront to design a fully-reusable fly-back first stage to take the orbiter into space .
the result has been far higher operating costs and , tragically , the loss of fourteen astronauts .
will it be too much to hope that senior agency managers and politicians will learn these lessons in defining our future access to space ?
in europe as well as the usa .
phil , bath , uk so far this particular mission has been very worrying for relatives of the discovery crew .
any venture into space is a risk , but this one seems to have gone ahead knowing this risk factor was much higher than usual .
why are these missions so important ?
the risk factor is too great to risk innocent lives .
stop them now .
jose a holmes , loughborough , england i wish the crew a safe return but am sorry to see resources wasted on a manned flight with little real value for essentially political and pr reasons while much more scientifically valuable unmanned work is scaled back to pay for it .
this is all about the advancement of the usa , not science .
julian , london , uk the debris issue has been present in the shuttle programme from day one .
the tiles themselves are so fragile you can break them with one hand .
the space shuttle is a wonderful vehicle , but sadly owing to it 's bizarre design , is inherently dangerous and needs to be replaced soon .
as richard feynman said after the challenger disaster , " for a successful technology , reality must take precedence over public relations , for nature can not be fooled . "
chris dyer , bristol , england the immediate future of the space program will be best served by robot missions dr malcolm fairbairn , uk / sweden i , like most people connected with astrophysics , think that the immediate future of the space program will be best served by robot missions for at least the next twenty years .
it 's not taking a step backwards ; it 's about developing and testing new technologies which will eventually be applied to human spaceflight .
for the same amount of money you get much more science done with robotic missions because you do n't have to worry about the fragile humans .
dr malcolm fairbairn , uk / sweden as an aerospace engineer , in this particular instance i am not worried about discovery .
all indications are that the debris did no damage .
long term , though , it could be a problem .
the space shuttle has never fulfilled the promises that were made for it .
it is an expensive vehicle of very limited utility .
it consumes resources which could be better used elsewhere in the us space program .
andrew ogilvie , modesto , california , usa robert heinlein said it : " the earth is too small and fragile a basket for humanity to keep all its eggs in . "
the only safe place to be when disaster comes -lrb- an asteroid for example -rrb- is somewhere else .
well done , discovery .
keep it up .
john fielder , workington , uk there are a lot of negative comments on here by people who really have not done their research .
there are so many inventions that have come to be due to space travel most are indirect , technology passed to the public after it has been created to aid nasa and the like in various projects .
adam ransom , birmingham space flight is one of the things that most excites me jehuda arieh veenman , haifa , israel space flight is one of the things that most excites me .
it breaks my heart that foam broke off the insulation again .
apparently , the design has a basic flaw ; the vulnerable heat shield is exposed to a bombardment of debris falling of during take off .
in the more old fashioned designs , the heat shields were protected during take off .
jehuda arieh veenman , haifa , israel it seems to me that the logical fix for the launch system would be to mount the shuttle higher relative to the fuel tank .
the coldness of the fuel is always going to be a problem in causing freezing of water and air in and around the foam insulation .
since that is the nature of the beast , get the shuttle out of harms way above the possible falling debris nigel dandridge-perry , los angeles ca , usa good luck discovery , i look forward to seeing a safe flight back to earth .
mark , dorset there is no progress with manned missions .
it 's more of the same .
while unmanned missions are discovering lakes of water on mars , landing on distant moons and exploring planets , the manned missions are trying to work out how to stop foam falling off the fuel tank .
leave floating around in orbit to the chinese and get exploring .
matt , amsterdam , the netherlands -lrb- ex .
uk -rrb- the shuttle programme shows the greatness the human race can achieve when we focus d ward , portsmouth those who fly orbiters know the risks and accept the challenge .
the shuttle programme shows the greatness the human race can achieve when we focus .
a commitment should be made to give it whatever financial support it needs to continue .
nasa tv shows discovery 's latest mission is gripping .
we owe it to those astronauts who have lost their lives in space exploration , to carry on the work that they could n't finish .
d ward , portsmouth i have become addicted to nasa tv over the last few days , and find myself staring into space , thinking of discovery up there somewhere ... looking back on our little planet from a distance .
i am surely concerned about the debris ; remember nasa did not think this would be a problem for the ill-fated columbia crew either .
they have spent two years and thousands of dollars on this problem - so yes , i think we should be concerned , not only about the debris ' implications , but also that nasa got it wrong again .
verity worthington , bewdley , worcestershire hundreds of years ago people were afraid that they could sail off the edges of the earth .
thank heavens there were brave sailors then willing to push the limits of courage and technology , and thank heavens we still have them today .
i 'm also grateful that there are still those willing to fund such expeditions .
rob g. , kansas city , usa the disaster 2 years ago , and these recent problems with the shuttle show that nasa really need to get on with developing the next generation of re-useable shuttles .
technology has moved on so much in the nearly 30 years since it was developed with computer technology and new lightweight materials .
if they do n't , then the private space firms will take over , while nasa keeps flogging a dead horse .
tane piper , edinburgh , uk we are all with you , looking forward for success .
god be with you .
no surrender no retreat .
martin madulu , moshi - tanzania i am more worried about the apparent loss of a tile than the foam .
if any of the tiles were damaged , the mission is in jeopardy .
after the columbia disaster , i read an article published in 1980 calling the shuttles ' death traps ' .
considering that we 've already lost half the fleet , i think it is high time nasa invested in a different , more robust technology .
istvan , detroit , usa the safety of the crew should be of utmost importance , not launch schedules ss , usa my family and i were vacationing in florida at the time of the launch .
we saw it speeding skyward from the car on our way back home .
i am an aerospace design engineer specializing in flight dynamics .
my concern really lies with the inadequacy with which nasa has dealt with the foam / tile problem .
the safety of the crew should be of utmost importance , not launch schedules .
ss , usa only those at nasa who have looked at the images of debris falling will have the best idea .
the crew 's safe return is just our concern but it 's their mission .
venkat maruthamuthu , urbana , il , usa why was this problem not resolved after columbia two years ago ?
it is very wrong to send yet more people up there without being absolutely sure that it 's safe .
perhaps space travel should wait until we have progressed far enough that we are not relying on tiles that can just fall off ?
catherine , cheshunt , herts great to see the shuttle soar again .
our future lies not on earth but out there somewhere .
no matter how you argue it , in the future this planet will die and so will all those life forms still on it .
if the human species is to survive , then it must do so elsewhere and this sort of technology is the first step towards that ultimate goal .
ian jordan , wokingham the foam formulation was changed in 1996 ... most of the foam issues started after this change bruce g , huntsville , usa this is not a trivial engineering problem as some have implied .
there are two types of foam : a lightweight foam covering the large areas of the tank and a dense ablator foam covering areas exposed to aerodynamic heating .
the foam is exposed to supersonic airflow at about 27000 km / h -lrb- 17000 mph -rrb- during launch .
there are shock cones coming from the orbiter , the connecting struts and solid boosters which impinge on the tank .
there is also a lot of vibration .
the foam formulation was changed in 1996 to comply with the montreal protocol and eliminate the freon propellant .
most of the foam issues started after this change and may or may not be associated with it .
the shuttle is due to be retired in 2010 and solving this problem is important for future spacecraft design .
bruce g , huntsville , usa why ca n't the return module be encased within the main take off rocket ?
this would prevent bits flying off from damaging it .
tony lee , telford we were on vacation in orlando , and had tickets for the astronaut hall of fame to watch the original scheduled lift-off on 13 july .
we had such a good view , but with about an hour or so to go , the launch was cancelled .
we were gutted to have missed such a spectacular sight !
we watched it on television back here in ireland , but felt we had a special bond with sts 114 - return to flight .
we just hope now for the safe return of the shuttle and its crew on 7 august .
good luck to them .
hutch family , ireland one day when someone is sipping cocktails on saturn 's lunar resort , whilst looking back at the earth and the distant sun , they 'll thank these brave people for risking their lives .
let 's keep our nerve , and not look back .
chris phillips , chelmsford , essex it is an inherent part of our nature to explore caroline , edinburgh , uk i used to work at one of the nasa centres -lrb- in maryland -rrb- and i hope that space exploration continues .
as a scientist it is an inherent part of our nature to explore , discover and find out about the unknown .
i was overjoyed to see the launch of discovery and hope , beyond all hope , that they make it safely home .
as nasa have said - " exploring space is not for the faint hearted ' - it 's a huge undertaking " .
the astronauts know that , we all know that .
these are very brave people and i wish them , and nasa , well with their endeavours .
caroline , edinburgh , uk watching this made me feel giddy .
now hopefully we can complete the iss and get on with the business of colonising space .
the spirit of adventure lives on with discovery and her crew .
david mills , ballymena , uk we were very privileged to be able to see discovery launch when it flew mission 105 and the impression it left us with was ' it was amazing to see ' .
we believe that the crew and the engineers will be able to work together and face the challenge of bringing back this magnificent ship .
instead of shrinking from the challenge we should rise up to it just as they did in 1970 for apollo 13 , it is only by stretching our knowledge such as in times of emergencies that we reach beyond our capabilities .
good luck and best wishes to the crew and engineers .
julie and robert , manchester , england i would like to see the shuttle retired and replaced with a newer fleet scott , edinburgh congratulations to nasa on another successful launch .
however , i would like to see the shuttle retired and replaced with a newer and more capable fleet of vehicles .
not only will it be safer and hugely beneficial to space exploration , the project would provide thousands of jobs , contracts to companies and benefit the global economy .
scott , edinburgh people seem to forget that manned space travel is still very dangerous and those brave astronauts know the risks .
foam has been falling off fuel tanks for nearly 25 years now .
perhaps money should now be invested in developing better glue and a more efficient reusable manned space travel system .
john ellis , nottingham statistically , if commercial flights carried the same risks as spaceflight , there would be about 500 airliner crashes per day .
one therefore has to applaud the courage and determination of those people who accept this degree of risk in pursuit of our quest for knowledge .
we are an inquisitive species , in this case pushing the boundaries of what is possible .
i wish those seven brave souls a safe return .
bob , cheshire i 've been following the ' space race ' since sputnik and the mercury missions , and i ca n't think of anything more exciting than a successful launch .
but why do n't we stop racing against each other and form stronger international collaborations to make space travel safer ?
j forman , los angeles , usa if nasa says the shuttle is safe to fly , it 's safe to fly james , los angeles , usa it amazes me how many observers believe they are more of an expert on shuttle safety and capability than the engineers at nasa .
the fact is , the men and women who work at nasa are at the top of their field .
if they say the shuttle is safe to fly , it 's safe to fly .
james , los angeles , usa it was a beautiful launch .
the space shuttle program has been remarkably successful despite the previous disaster .
nobody can engineer absolute perfection , but this was very close .
h neil , south texas , usa i am very concerned about the damaged tiles on discovery , especially in light of nasa 's apparent slowness in acknowledging that the take-off incident with columbia caused the disaster upon return .
there is an option for the crew of discovery - to wait on the space station for rescue .
how can we even contemplate risking their lives ?
if the problem is serious enough to ground the fleet , discovery too should be ' grounded ' immediately .
sharon , dallas , texas i once saw a presentation on how the challenger disaster came to happen and how it could have been prevented and it made my blood run cold .
suffice it to say , i have nothing but the most profound admiration for the courage of the crews of the shuttle .
i 'm not a religious man , but i just hope to god they all get back safely .
steve , chesham tragic as the columbia accident was , the astronauts died doing what they loved - exploring space , a privilege only the select few get to do .
they also died at the end of their trip so they got to enjoy being in space , unlike the challenger crew .
before the columbia accident , i would expect that the shuttles got through intact in much worse condition than discovery .
i am not that concerned , although i will follow the investigations with great interest .
ian , london it seems ridiculous that it is being jeopardised by something so simple chris , brazil the shuttle has been up and down into space about 50 times before the columbia incident .
i can not believe that bits of foam from the fuel tank did n't come off during these trips .
are n't nasa being a bit super cautious about this problem ?
ca n't they encase the fuel tank in some sort of wire mesh in order to prevent the foam from breaking off ?
in such a high tech programme , it seems ridiculous that it is being jeopardised by something so simple .
chris , brazil what exactly are they doing out there that they have not had the chance to do before ?
first of all get a new ship and then go somewhere else than the moon !
that impressed my grand father , it will take more to impress me !
mathieu , gatineau , canada bits of foam have probably been falling off the shuttle since the first launch , but it 's only since a piece of that debris caused the destruction of columbia two years ago that anyone has noticed !
only now we have cameras watching every single part of the craft do we see what may well have been happening all along .
carry on as normal .
simon , peterborough , uk i remember watching the first ever shuttle flight as a kid .
i watched the launch the other day and got the exact same feelings of awe and excitement .
the shuttle launch is a wake up call to everyone .
sure the world has problems right now but despite those problems , look what we 're capable of !
my message to nasa , the esa and all the other agencies ?
keep going people .
take us there !
andrew k jones , wrexham , uk i watched the launch live on the internet and was overwhelmed .
we wo n't know of the mission 's success until 7 aug , but what surprises me is the us way of making everything big and the huge overhead costs .
it 's all show and little substance .
after having spent $ 1 billion and 2.5 years on the debris falling cause , they are back to square one and the shuttles are grounded again !
on the other hand the russians are making safe manned space missions with pinpoint accuracy every 3-6 months at a fraction of the cost .
rakesh , london uk without space exploration we would not have computers , hi-technology materials etc jim kirk , basildon i read once that spending on cosmetics in the usa dwarfs the nasa budget .
let 's get things in perspective .
without space exploration we would not have computers , hi-technology materials etc , all of which were a by-product .
if more is learned about our planet and its self-destructive population on each mission then we should keep it going .
come home safe guys !
jim kirk , basildon does anyone know why debris falls off a multi-million dollar spacecraft ?
ca n't some sort of outer layer be put around the fuel tank insulation to stop it disintegrating ?
i 'm not an engineer - i need someone else to explain it !
robert , sussex rather than risking the crew and the shuttle , if it is damaged , why do n't they leave it up there as service vehicle and bring the crew back in another shuttle at a later date ?
if nasa wants to survive they need to start making people believe in them again .
good luck discovery !
paul , london the space shuttle was under funded during its design and construction and the compromises mean it will never achieve its true potential .
the sooner it can be replaced with something newer and simpler the better .
david patrick , reading trying to make space exploration 100 % safe is just nonsense .
duncan , nottingham my heart sank when i heard the news that tiles had once again fallen off the space shuttle roger campbell , england my heart sank when i heard the news that tiles had once again fallen off the space shuttle .
if the cause of the tiles falling off is simply the vibration and air flow , then i wonder what will be the effect of the searing heat of re-entry .
roger campbell , england having watched the space shuttle launch on tv , it is good to see such a majestic craft finally back to what she was meant to do .
well done nasa for getting the space shuttle flying .
james , nottingham no-one made that big a deal when tiles were missing from the oms pods after columbia 's maiden flight in 1981 .
when designing this vehicle they must have made a risk assessment to determine safety parameters , and unfortunately the loss of columbia has made them refine these parameters further .
tim parker , edinburgh we watched the launch from our beach , about 90 miles away .
it was spectacular .
there are many more cameras watching the exterior shuttle craft than ever before which have alerted to the problems .
the engineers working for nasa are tireless and will get the current crew back safely one way or another .
the space programme will continue .
the only unknown is manned flights .
the mars rovers are still sending pictures and information long past when they were suppose to .
nasa will continue on and i believe has more government funding this year , or is due for an increase .
private companies are currently working on safe space travel for human passengers in the us and abroad i believe .
joan york , daytona beach , florida usa nasa 's team on the ground and the astronauts in the space are doing a great job for the mankind syed mateen , karachi , pakistan i have witnessed the launching of space shuttle discovery on television screen .
nasa 's team on the ground and the astronauts in the space are doing a great job for the mankind , as their experiences in the space will benefit the entire world .
i pray for the safe return of the astronauts and happy landing of the space shuttle .
as a human being , i am equally concerned about the debris which has fallen at the time of its blast , but hope that the space shuttle will not face the same problem as it did in the past .
the safe return of discovery will boost the moral of nasa 's team , who had worked day and night to make the space shuttle 's mission possible .
syed mateen , karachi , pakistan any country with ambitions to have manned missions to space would be more than happy to have a craft as good as the space shuttle .
if there is a cheaper way to break away from earth than i am all for it but i am not sure how much safer it will be .
exploration has always been a dangerous business .
erik , ft .
collins , u.s.a. manned space flight is a dangerous and expensive anachronism .
look at the success of hubble , the mars rovers and the cassini / huygens mission .
you can do 10 times as much real science for half the cost and no risk to life by concentrating on unmanned space exploration .
and tell me , were n't the pictures of titan far more exciting than anything the crew of the shuttle are likely to get up to ?
max , abu dhabi , uae i read some of the comments here with disbelief .
yes , we all know that there are problems in some areas of the world , it does n't however mean that everything has to stop because of that .
i can think of a lot more things which are more of a waste than space exploration .
i 'll bet half the people complaining about nasa being wasteful drive gas guzzlers and do n't bother to recycle .
the shuttle mission is vital to all areas of science and i 'm glad it is flying again .
the space shuttle is not an old machine ; discovery has only flown 30 times before .
most commercial airlines fly that often in a week !
dave , slough , uk many congratulations to nasa .
as a teacher i teach children who are fascinated by space .
it is good that the space missions continue .
it allows children to hope and dream that they might reach the stars themselves , one day !
michelle , birmingham we all know that it costs millions of dollars to support the space program .
one could argue that money could be better spent elsewhere .
the fact is we as human beings need to understand in order to learn new technologies and space exploration is just one of many things that need to be understood and conquered .
there will always be many arguments for and against the space program .
all i can say right now is well done to nasa and my best wishes for a truly successful return to space flight for discovery .
andrew howlett , cape town , south africa good luck and a safe landings to the crew of the discovery .
there are some here that would have the usa quit funding the space program until all the worlds ' problems are solved .
will you tell your children to wait for that day before pursuing their dreams ?
michael rosenbaum , san francisco , usa a plane crash or 9/11 does not stop air travel , so why should the columbia 2003 disaster stop space exploration ?
i 'm sure discovery will make it back safe and the astronauts will be given a well-deserved pat on the back .
jack , london / memphis the shuttle might be old but it still works , and has done the world a huge service towards on earth and in space exploration .
those who complain are clearly members of the flat earth society , and yet i bet they use technology every day ?
someone has to push the envelope .
go nasa go !
phil w , uk good launch .
let 's just hope she comes back in one piece .
ricardo , brazil the shuttles are aged dinosaurs that need to be " moth balled " before more lives are lost due to fragmenting styrofoam .
perhaps we should all consider shifting funding away from nasa and put it towards alternative fuel sources .
it would be revenue better spent .
kurt stuchell , cambridge , usa scuttle the shuttle gordon , auckland nz scuttle the shuttle !
obsolete equipment supplying a pointless lab .
much fanfare about increasing aid to africa by $ 25b but us military budget $ 400b makes you ill !
gordon , auckland nz i can not stand the mentality of myopic people who would rather we abandon the natural impulse to explore our surroundings , and instead focus on futile efforts to tackle every mundane earthbound problem .
surely , the sight of the shuttle blasting off into orbit is the most poignant statement of mankind 's destiny .
kevin , charlotte , north carolina , usa with so much bad news in the media : terrorism , war , poverty ... it 's wonderful to see what we as human beings can achieve , when we put our minds to something positive .
we have the potential to achieve great things .
the crew of this shuttle mission are from different countries , cultures and backgrounds ; proof that if we work together , we can produce something that makes us all proud .
charlie , newcastle , uk to all those who claim the space programme has helped advance medicine and technology . think how much further along in those fields we could be if all the money wasted at nasa went into development . let alone feeding the poor .
shameful waste of resources .
i do n't want my tax dollar to be spent this way .
p. o 'donnell , rotorua , n.z. there are always small-minded people who are terrified of exploration digby knight , henley-on-thames , uk there are always small-minded people who are terrified of exploration .
if we had their way , we 'd still be living in trees afraid of the dangerous savannah !
thankfully we 've always had a few who have done their best to pioneer new territories and worlds .
digby knight , henley-on-thames , uk i would argue that nasa is somewhat of an anachronism .
the " glory days " of the space race with russia are over .
instead , space exploration should be run by the national science foundation .
there , private and public money can be better organized to fund missions .
the nsf already runs most of the science stations here on earth .
why should space be any different ?
greg , alexandria , va space exploration * is * a waste of money .
had the billions been invested directly in more down-to-earth technologies , we would have seen the same spin-offs in medicine , it , and transport .
anonymous i ca n't believe the childish reactions to space exploration from folks like mike and anon , uk .
grow up , guys .
space exploration represents humanity at its most amazing .
you 're obviously just bitter because the us is leading the way .
typical .
shawn , washington , dc , usa exploration , of all kinds , has always helped man push the boundaries of technology .
the space programme is no different .
for this reason alone it is invaluable .
jason , detroit , usa despite all the delays and expert checks , something still fell off it on take off dan , yateley , uk looking at the shuttle i am always reminded of those creaking old 50 's and 60 's airliners you still see rattling around developing countries .
good in their day , but now so ropey and tired that they just scream " death trap " .
it says it all about the shuttle that despite all the delays and expert checks , something still fell off it on take off .
it 's high time this heap was scrapped , and a replacement worthy of the 21st century was introduced in its place .
dan , yateley , uk so the new ufos are unidentified falling objects ?
phil jones , frangy , france if you watch the film of the launch the piece of debris that falls off after the booster rocket drops off does not come from the shuttle it comes from the giant fuel tank , which is ' disposable ' anyway .
john nichols , brackley , nnorthants , uk how would brits feel if americans were talking about how britain should spend its money ?
michelle , raleigh , nc i think that nasa is still too hurried in launching the shuttle when the debris problem still exists .
maybe they should solve out the problem wholly before doing any thing else .
but the fact still shows that nasa has succeeded in launching the shuttle into space .
maybe that 's an incredible luck , although we still do n't know about the return of it .
but i believe it will succeed , too .
god 's will give luck to the crew .
nguyen hoang giang , hanoi , vietnam i just pray she makes it back down ok seun , london uk it was an excellent feeling seeing discovery go like that yesterday .
i am really happy for nasa and i just pray she makes it back down ok , that will be the icing on the cake .
seun , london uk oh dear !
the usa are off again trying to show how they can spend billions on space exploration , meanwhile trying to flex its muscles all around the world causing chaos- unbelievable !
mike , uk mankind is not content with polluting the earth !
it now wants to pollute space as well !
how sad !
millions starve while the usa burns dollars - what for ?
it truly is a sick world we live in these days !
anon , uk to anon , uk - the fuel is clean and non polluting - just water produced .
and as for waste of money - tell me about the dome and the london olympics .
longer term , i know what is more valuable !
george , chelmsford i 'm so glad to see the space programme resume shuttle launches .
space research is costly , but it 's like buying a lottery ticket - you never know what you 're going to get back from it , but once you go out there , there 's a chance you might win big .
and we already have - people have cited the benefits that have come from the space programme .
here 's to more exploration outside our atmosphere !
tony , london , uk i felt privileged to have been in florida for the launch .
it went off on time and from what i gather from reports , was perfect .
it 's something to tell the grandkids one day .
marylyn , london space travel fires the imagination !
tim goodchild , surrey space travel fires the imagination !
to all those that criticise that the shuttle is old and the fact that its had two failures should perhaps think again the next time they board a 747 on route to their holiday destination .
tim goodchild , surrey absolutely fantastic pictures from discovery , especially when the external fuel tank was detached from the shuttle with the curvature of the earth in the background .
overall great launch , well done nasa .
paul , coventry , uk the american space programme is a great achievement and it is important that it continues .
the human race is capable of great things and it is not in our nature to keep still .
terry , crewe , cheshire my gosh !
the people saying the space program is a waste of money ? !
the commercial products used now as a result of nasa are staggering .
cat scans , dialysis machines , materials in your athletic shoes , water purification technology , cordless power tools , cool suits for firefighters , physical therapy equipment .
the list goes on .
the program is invaluable !
eric , usa i think its well worth the effort and money to sustain humans in space carl lennon , northampton , uk most of the people on here with negative comments do not realise how much space has done for humanity .
many medical experiments have been conducted in space which was the only place that it could be done .
the results of these experiments have saved thousands if not millions of lives .
i think its well worth the effort and money to sustain humans in space .
carl lennon , northampton , uk although america has proven itself to be the world 's best engineers , nasa is living on past glory .
many of its best scientists and engineers have left , it is no longer in the public limelight unless it has a disaster , and it is grossly underfunded .
america should reinvigorate the program with major new investment and ambitious new goals or shut it down .
as the eu space agency has recently learned , you ca n't explore space on the cheap .
this old technology and this antiquated worn out hardware needs to be retired along with the mediocre management which has taken over .
mark , usa what a novel way to distract your nation from the real problems at home and abroad .
the cost does n't matter since the nation is paying the bill .
ed , canada there are those who say space exploration is a waste of money .
on the contrary , space travel forces society to stretch and reach further in order to solve highly complex problems associated with putting man into space .
the solutions to these problems are broad and serve mankind in many ways .
the space program enables us to move forward faster than we otherwise would .
without such large goals our advancement slows and we become lazy .
david , philadelphia , usa come on people , of course sending people into space is dangerous and expensive .
that does n't mean we should n't do it though .
even if space exploration did not lead to technical advances and practical application , it would still be worth it .
why ?
because it 's cool .
we put a man on the moon , that 's pretty impressive considering just prior to wwi a man could only travel as far as a horse could take him .
stu , st paul , usa the view from the fuel tank at over 14000mph was fantastic !
rod aries , glasgow the view from the fuel tank at over 14000mph was fantastic !
why are n't other space agencies doing this for the public ?
engage us !
rod aries , glasgow every time i see a rocket launch i think that newton made it possible ; his equations are still used to calculate the orbit .
how many other things in use today were invented over 300 years ago ?
vic , uk a sense of pride mixed with concern .
i live near the johnson space center and have relatives that have worked in the program as far back as gemini and apollo .
the space program is much more than a news story to us .
to those who think the space program is a waste of money : there is so much innovation and research that goes on behind the scenes that you 'd change your opinion if you took the time to look at what nasa has accomplished over the years and continues to accomplish today .
paul , houston , tx well , i 'm relieved it 's up there .
but they still seem to have this gung-ho attitude to safety .
i could n't believe that after killing two crews they are still happy to launch with a known serious fault .
chris hann , bay area , ca , usa congratulations to nasa on a successful launch .
i 'm glad to see that some nations still recognise the value of dreaming and aspiring to do great things and inspire their young people .
the money spent of spaceflight is miniscule compared to the many benefits .
it 's sad here in the uk that people are so ignorant and short-sighted with regards to space exploration that we ca n't see the good that can from it - and then we wonder the younger generations are n't interested in science , medicine and technology .
victor , birmingham , england this launch showed the world what can be accomplished with great teamwork , ambition and determination d soni , nuneaton , uk i watched the launch and was overcome with pride .
all the people involved in this great feat have overcome extreme obstacles .
this launch showed the world what can be accomplished with great teamwork , ambition and determination .
congratulations discovery !
d soni , nuneaton , uk mankind needs a vision .
interplanetary travel is necessary to achieve that end .
stuart haines , calgary , alberta , canada it 's time to junk the space shuttle and perhaps " rethink " this whole business of manned space flight for the time being .
think about it , other than as a showy display of national pride , what benefits do any nations get at this time from sending humans into space ?
perhaps in the future when we have real goals and reliable " safe " transportation we can start wasting our time and money with such " propaganda flights " , but now is n't the time and place for such foolishness .
charlie , niagara falls new york people always complain that space programs are too expensive , but do people appreciate how much safer the planet is with them ?
we can monitor dangerous weather , asteroids , and send tv , radio , and telephone signals via satellites .
space programs really have helped the planet excel in a positive way , and i 'm glad the discovery is finally continuing what has already been a remarkable feat of engineering .
tim hunt -lrb- 16 -rrb- , plymouth , england in these days darkened by the spectre of global terrorism , we seek hope and strength in many places .
the fog of war and the wind that whispers the question of " why are we fighting in the middle east ? ' diminish our confidence in our government .
today 's launch of the shuttle discovery renews our hope and faith in our abilities to overcome tragedy and defy adversity .
we owe the entire nasa family a debt of gratitude for restoring our faith in the human spirit .
paul telfer , franceville , gabon we need a new way of going to the stars clive , dartford , uk i wish the crew well on the mission , but the shuttle is old and just like any aircraft , it has its life expectancy and this bird has reached it .
we need a new way of going to the stars and to ditch the big firework approach to it .
clive , dartford , uk sure , okay .
maybe the shuttle programme is old .
maybe it should be scrapped for something better .
but , it is all we have at the moment .
and to all of you here who keep telling us to get rid of it , i have n't heard one of you say anything about putting up any money with us to fund a new programme .
jon , atlanta , usa what nasa needs is a real life scotty character to sort these technical issues out .
paul collier , london , uk the truth is that the shuttle concept has proved to be too expensive and technically complex to be the way forward in space .
i am pro-space exploration but the shuttle has slowed this to a crawl , and all the best work has been done by probes boosted by rockets e.g. mars landers , titan probes etc .
andy , uk " space is expensive ! " cry the critics .
i wish they would angle their criticism at a truly scandalous target .
the entire space programme to date has cost less than what the world spends on arms every year .
i know which i think is better value for money .
bernard o. quinn , barcelona , catalonia the exploration of space will continue with us or without us scott westwood , port orchard , wa , usa the shuttle is expensive , outdated and despite nasa 's assurances , its safety is still uncertain ; but it 's the only game in town .
the exploration of space will continue with us or without us ; to sit on the sidelines and watch others go up would be unthinkable for an america that prides itself on being a superpower .
scott westwood , port orchard , wa , usa space exploration is essential for the future of all humans .
flying over the atlantic was at first a risky endeavour and now it is done by millions every year without a thought for the early pioneers and the planes that never arrived .
colin , croydon , uk i do not understand all these people saying that america should scrap the shuttle , and spend it on ' the world ' .
the us is already the single largest contributor of foreign aid .
the us space program has helped everyday life for billions of people around the world , and churned out invention after invention for the world .
bill zimmer , seattle , wa congratulations to all those involved in discovery 's return to space !
to all the naysayers , next time you are browsing the internet on your pc , take a moment to find out what drove the development of semiconductors that power your pc .
yes , the space exploration that you think is a waste of money !
roger , london tears came to my eyes and i held my breath colleen , orlando , fl usa we were in the parking lot facing east , waiting and whispering to each other .
the first person to see the shuttle clearing the trees threw up their hand to point it out and some of the men started yelling , " go , baby , go ! " and cheering .
tears came to my eyes and i held my breath .
the space program has done so much to improve our lives in the fields of health and science , they further our knowledge of our environment and how our magnificent planet works .
colleen , orlando , fl usa go discovery !
the future of humanity is in space .
as an american living abroad , the lift-off of discovery is the first event that makes me proud to be american since leaving my country .
i hope that this success will lead to the completion of the iss and the continued exploration of space .
daniel valenti , canberra , australia people forget that we belong to this planet earth , in that our physical bodies are perfectly adapted to survive only on the earth .
we could never survive on other planets without extensive artificial aids .
as many have already pointed out , there are many , many more pressing needs requiring resolution and funds should be redirected where they are most needed for our survival on our home planet .
yvonne , doncaster whatever the administration in the us , it 's only nasa that keeps public morale up and at same time keeps the defence lobby in good humor .

the crew on board the space shuttle have conducted inspections of discovery 's belly and repairs to the shuttle have also been carried out .
stephen robinson has begun a unique spacewalk , going under the orbiter 's belly to remove two ceramic strips sticking out between heatshield tiles .
nasa engineers are concerned the strips would cause part of discovery to overheat as it re-enters the earth 's atmosphere .
discovery had been due to return to earth on 7 august , but nasa has decided to extend the mission by an extra day .
what do you think of the mission so far ?
how do you feel about the mission being extended ?
what do you think about the repairs ?

read a selection of your comments below .
click here to read a second page of your comments the following comments reflect the balance of opinion we have received so far : the money that is spent by the american government on space exploration could be much better spent on healthcare and education .
this would be much more beneficial to the american people than discovery 's mission .
carolynne burkholder , vancouver , british columbia i can not believe that the crew had to cobble together a hacksaw norman west , truro , cornwall i can not believe that the crew had to cobble together a hacksaw .
a small box of tools from any diy shop would have done the job .
also removing a gap filler between the tiles exposes a gap .
surely the wind can get in and potentially lift a tile causing a fatal problem .
norman west , truro , cornwall whilst i can see that advances may be made through this work , i saw two items on the news last night - one about children dying because they have n't got a few quid , the other about spending millions on keeping the shuttles going in and out of space .
priority check please .
mark , didcot , england space travel is dangerous , pioneers are going to die , but it is worthwhile .
what is needed now are new spaceships to let us travel between planets .
at the moment all our eggs are in one basket , we need to find other homes on other worlds .
we have made this one nearly uninhabitable .
i would go into space whatever the risk .
ruth , walsall maybe if all the countries stopped being so petty and pooled their resources , we 'd have superior technology and fewer incidents like this .
we do n't need to race against each other anymore to try and prove who 's superior ; instead we should look to a future of co-operation .
gaz , cardiff , uk i will never understand why we waste so much money on primitive space stations john gearing , st. helens , uk i will never understand why we waste so much money on primitive space stations and shuttles which clearly have no function for the human race at this time .
i do n't know why we do n't get all our experts and fund them in coming up with unmanned technologies and technology in shuttles that could take us to planets not to a tin can in the sky which is over expensive and serves no function to the mass population .
john gearing , st. helens , uk fascinating a brit would ask the question why the us is sending people into space .
as the brit , george mallory said in 1924 , " because its there " .
mt everest killed mallory and we remember him for his quest .
in a similar quest , the us will continue to go into space - because its there .
john b , windermere , florida do some of these contributors have no soul ?
what could be more magnificent than seeing human beings taking risks to explore the unknown ; triumphing over the problems they meet along the way ; opening up new horizons for the rest of us ?
yes let 's invest in a new space transportation system , and more manned flights , and unmanned probes and a bigger , better space station .
but to claim that stopping the current flights is sensible shows no faith in the species at all .
stop looking down at the ground and start looking up at the stars .
john r smith , uk please , armchair scientists , let the experts at nasa do their job making the risk calculations .
they 've got the know-how and the tools to make the decisions .
not you or me .
joe , usa this is the most ridiculous expenditure of precious funds in a time of great national travail .
nasa is an anachronism , a patronistic pet rock that has no justification whatsoever , especially in the current environment in which civilized societies are fighting for their mere existence .
the irresponsibility in launching this mission in the face of known deficiencies is appalling .
c. a. la varre , newport , ri usa the media paints such a doom and gloom picture of what is happening above us phil , hampshire , uk why-oh-why does the media take such a negative view to what the men and women on sts114 are doing .
the media paints such a doom and gloom picture of what is happening above us .
we as a united world should watch and praise these people who are up there performing the most fantastic things known to mankind .
yes there is a difficult time coming on returning to earth but the crew at this time seem very positive about it .
may i suggest that you all watch nasa tv on the web for real live happenings .
phil , hampshire , uk nasa is undergoing drastic changes .
i think the us should pause and take stock of what 's happening to their space missions .
give it a break , sort out problems and return 10years later .
i wonder how the us ever landed man on the moon ?
did they really ?
i wonder !
errol , dubai , uae space flight is still in its infancy .
so the fact that an astronaut was able to make a repair to the shuttle in space is a great triumph .
nasa should look on this feat in a positive light , not a negative one .
we know in the days of sailing ships as they travelled the globe to discover new lands , there were many times when sailors had to climb up masts in storms to make repairs , so is repairing space craft in flight any different ?
leon aarons , petach israel another piece of space theatre , justifying manned flight .
unmanned craft can put payloads into orbit much more cheaply , as well as exploring other planets .
martin , dubai , uae i 've just seen a picture of the tool , held together with strong tape that the astronauts used .
it 's great to imagine that a billion-dollar aircraft can be saved by a bit of strong tape and some elbow grease !
it 's that sort of thinking that 's saved astronauts in the past .
good luck to them , hope humans carry on going into space for many more years .
dave , manchester , uk this spacewalk and repair demonstrates two things .
firstly , the courage and initiative of the astronauts , secondly , the importance of retiring the ageing shuttle fleet and building a modern spacecraft .
electronics and materials technology have advanced tremendously in the past 30 years , but the shuttle is still using outdated technology .
gordon mcstraun , uk so , the offending piece if gap filler from between a couple of heat shields .
i 'm no nasa expert , but does n't this mean that the is now a gap between these tiles ?
michael , bucks , uk the astronauts are all volunteers , they know the risks involved , and that is why i praise and thank them kirsty , cambridge , uk i think it is fantastic that discovery has launched and its mission is going well .
a lesson has been learnt from colombia , and indeed , challenger .
the astronauts are all volunteers , they know the risks involved , and that is why i praise and thank them .
they are incredible people .
kirsty , cambridge , uk so what if the filler problem has to be fixed with a jerry-rigged hacksaw ?
this type of ingenuity has been saving lives since the age of tall ships and can only reflect well on the tenacity of the nasa engineers and astronauts .
remember when the progress hit mir ?
apollo 13 ?
we need the experience of these problems to give us the know-how to survive in space and give us the confidence in our ability to solve problems on longer , bolder voyages .
tim parker , edinburgh , scotland i work with remote operated vehicles in the oil and gas industry .
i am amazed that the crew of the discovery need to cobble together a makeshift hacksaw to carry out a job on the tiles .
the shuttles are old and things will go wrong so you would expect a decent tool kit to be onboard .
james , paderne , portugal why are the americans still sending people into space ?
if they want to explore they should be thinking of unmanned flights with intelligent technology which can spend decades in space .
this should help the ozone layer repair itself .
more is needed to be done to explore and catalogue this planet and its systems , this will be of more benefit to mankind and our home than space travel .
haz , nottingham , uk is going up in the shuttle much more dangerous than sailing unknown oceans a few hundred years ago in wooden ships ?
thank goodness that throughout history not everyone has wanted to sit at home in comfort in their own small world .
simon , manchester , uk with so many comings and goings to and from iss , would it not be sensible for just the bare minimum of crew to return in this shuttle and send up a half-empty shuttle to collect the rest of them ?
why take unnecessary risks ?
fraser irving , sheffield , uk until now , the shuttle missions have been routine , like taking a walk in the park .
but the reality of danger with the loss of two shuttles has almost brought the space program to its knees .
should it continue ?
of course it must go on because too much is at stake .
closing the space station , and not looking into space is the worst we can do .
life on earth is becoming dangerous .
we must look to the stars if humanity is to survive .
walter , chapel hill , nc i think - and hope - this flight is one of the safest ever .
my guess is the problems have appeared simply because they have been looking for them far more carefully than before .
however , there 's no doubt a replacement spacecraft is needed .
the private " space ship one " has a slow re-entry , avoiding thermal problems .
is this possible from orbit ?
and a separate , unmanned cargo vehicle seems a " no-brainer " .
simon , bristol it must be frightening for the astronauts but the space programme must prevail anya , london pioneers always take risks so that everyone else can eventually follow .
it must be frightening for the astronauts but the space programme must prevail .
updated technology is definitely needed .
unmanned missions are a good idea , but ultimately there is no substitute for human actions and reactions .
anya , london interesting to note that the two shuttle losses have not been due to design or engineering flaws in the shuttle themselves , but rather the propulsion system .
for 30 year old vehicles , i think the shuttles are doing pretty well , and i am sure they will continue for a long time .
matt , bristol space exploration is dangerous and the crew knows this better than any of us - and they still volunteered for it .
my view is that we need to continue to explore space and the shuttle repair should be seen as an experience that needs to be faced at some time .
let 's not be weak about this .
george , chelmsford what nasa has done is simply awesome .
nasa is the adventurer of our era , looking at and investigating things that are far bigger than us .
i say ground the space shuttles , but do not skimp on quickly building bigger , better , and safer spacecraft to replace them .
sk , ithaca , ny space technology is too integrated in our daily lives now peter byrd , worcester the few people who mock space projects should not use anything connected with space technology as a protest !
i bet hardly anyone would manage it or really want to .
space technology is too integrated in our daily lives now ; we all enjoy the advantages we get from it .
nasa tv via the net alone shows me how wonderful space is .
peter byrd , worcester i have just returned from florida where i was privileged enough to witness the breathtaking launch first hand .
it seems as though there are increasing difficulties using these shuttles .
are the lives of 7 astronauts each time it takes off a risk that is worth taking ?
matt , london given the loss of columbia and the uncertainty of this mission , nasa should scrap the shuttle programme .
luck prevented previous disasters and it would appear nasa 's luck has run out .
what makes them feel confident that they can repair in space what they failed to repair in two years on the ground ?
my thoughts are with the families of those on the iss .
phil , bracknell , uk the problems with discovery must have been encountered with all the previous shuttle flights .
it appears that each time it took off , it was russian roulette as to whether it would return safely .
this program should be abandoned until a new and safer means of transporting the shuttle into space can be developed .
chris , brazil will the resulting depression between the tiles create a possibility of a chink in the armour ?
k chowksey , bangalore , india even if the pieces sticking out are pulled or hacked , will the resulting depression between the tiles create a possibility of a chink in the armour ?
even a depression can alter the aerodynamic behaviour -lrb- as in golf balls -rrb- .
this will create uneven heat distribution .
k chowksey , bangalore , india from the idealists point of view we really should not be thinking about costs here .
space exploration is vital , not only to our technological development as a species , but also in terms of our wider understanding of the universe .
the whole nasa infrastructure is quite frankly awesome .
every endeavour has its risks and we 've seen the tragic consequences of those risks with the previous accidents .
chris , bracknell we need to explore space ; when you go to hospital and have a cat scan or an mri , that technology has come from the space program .
there is nothing wrong with the shuttle - the problem is with the way it is maintained .
they need to do better , i do n't know why do n't they paint it again , and seal the foam .
carol , pa , usa the saddest thing for me about this mission is that the next time the iss is visible from england on august 11th , the shuttle will have already left .
hopefully we 'll get to see the shuttle during the next mission .
after the moon , the iss is the brightest object in the night sky .
john airey , peterborough i looked at the images of the underside of the shuttle and thought that it looked like really bad bathroom tiling rob , spain major advances need to be made to the whole concept of effective re-entry heat-shield technology .
even before lift-off , i looked at the images of the underside of the shuttle and thought that it looked like really bad bathroom tiling .
initially , i expected it to be a smooth , seamless surface , but it was a patchwork of light and dark areas with patches that looked more raised than others .
i assume that tiles are the best option at the moment , but in future this issue needs to be solved completely .
rob , spain if nasa has decided to just rip out the relatively small strips protruding from between the heat shield tiles , then why ca n't they ask astronaut steve robinson to take his experimental repair kit out with him and fill the gaps with the mastic gum that they used to ' fix ' the tiles in their earlier experiments ?
paul greer , gothenburg , sweden i worked as an engineer on skylab in the 70s and i consider this nasa debacle a disgrace .
unknown risk is one thing , but gambling with lives on known problems with solutions is unacceptable .
i say : bring some crew home in russian capsule , leave the rest of the crew up there , fix the foam on atlantis -lrb- and everything else possible -rrb- and then send a rescue mission .
then ground the antiques and use modern technology to build new spacecraft .
rich dusek , orchard lake , mi , us bruce from huntsville says it 's not a trivial engineering problem and he 's probably right .
but that does n't alter the documented fact that nasa has sent people into space against the advice of contractors who have told them that certain aspects are n't safe .
if shuttles are prone to bits falling off then they should n't be flying .
david , chelmsford uk nasa do n't build all the parts and therefore an outside company may be partly responsible james , uk why do people expect space travel to be perfectly safe ?
look at any picture of launch and remember the orange tank is full of fuel and both white rockets once started ca n't be stopped .
man in space is an essential part of our future .
the earth can not sustain us forever particularly its natural resources .
i also think people should recognise that nasa do n't build all the parts and therefore an outside company may be partly responsible .
james , uk the problems with the space transportation system are a classic example of what happens when whole-life costs are not taken into account during early design phases of the system .
congress chose to buy shuttle on the cheap , opting for solid fuel boosters and a disposable fuel tank instead of spending extra money upfront to design a fully-reusable fly-back first stage to take the orbiter into space .
the result has been far higher operating costs and , tragically , the loss of fourteen astronauts .
will it be too much to hope that senior agency managers and politicians will learn these lessons in defining our future access to space ?
in europe as well as the usa .
phil , bath , uk so far this particular mission has been very worrying for relatives of the discovery crew .
any venture into space is a risk , but this one seems to have gone ahead knowing this risk factor was much higher than usual .
why are these missions so important ?
the risk factor is too great to risk innocent lives .
stop them now .
jose a holmes , loughborough , england i wish the crew a safe return but am sorry to see resources wasted on a manned flight with little real value for essentially political and pr reasons while much more scientifically valuable unmanned work is scaled back to pay for it .
this is all about the advancement of the usa , not science .
julian , london , uk the debris issue has been present in the shuttle programme from day one .
the tiles themselves are so fragile you can break them with one hand .
the space shuttle is a wonderful vehicle , but sadly owing to it 's bizarre design , is inherently dangerous and needs to be replaced soon .
as richard feynman said after the challenger disaster , " for a successful technology , reality must take precedence over public relations , for nature can not be fooled . "
chris dyer , bristol , england the immediate future of the space program will be best served by robot missions dr malcolm fairbairn , uk / sweden i , like most people connected with astrophysics , think that the immediate future of the space program will be best served by robot missions for at least the next twenty years .
it 's not taking a step backwards ; it 's about developing and testing new technologies which will eventually be applied to human spaceflight .
for the same amount of money you get much more science done with robotic missions because you do n't have to worry about the fragile humans .
dr malcolm fairbairn , uk / sweden as an aerospace engineer , in this particular instance i am not worried about discovery .
all indications are that the debris did no damage .
long term , though , it could be a problem .
the space shuttle has never fulfilled the promises that were made for it .
it is an expensive vehicle of very limited utility .
it consumes resources which could be better used elsewhere in the us space program .
andrew ogilvie , modesto , california , usa robert heinlein said it : " the earth is too small and fragile a basket for humanity to keep all its eggs in . "
the only safe place to be when disaster comes -lrb- an asteroid for example -rrb- is somewhere else .
well done , discovery .
keep it up .
john fielder , workington , uk there are a lot of negative comments on here by people who really have not done their research .
there are so many inventions that have come to be due to space travel most are indirect , technology passed to the public after it has been created to aid nasa and the like in various projects .
adam ransom , birmingham space flight is one of the things that most excites me jehuda arieh veenman , haifa , israel space flight is one of the things that most excites me .
it breaks my heart that foam broke off the insulation again .
apparently , the design has a basic flaw ; the vulnerable heat shield is exposed to a bombardment of debris falling of during take off .
in the more old fashioned designs , the heat shields were protected during take off .
jehuda arieh veenman , haifa , israel it seems to me that the logical fix for the launch system would be to mount the shuttle higher relative to the fuel tank .
the coldness of the fuel is always going to be a problem in causing freezing of water and air in and around the foam insulation .
since that is the nature of the beast , get the shuttle out of harms way above the possible falling debris nigel dandridge-perry , los angeles ca , usa good luck discovery , i look forward to seeing a safe flight back to earth .
mark , dorset there is no progress with manned missions .
it 's more of the same .
while unmanned missions are discovering lakes of water on mars , landing on distant moons and exploring planets , the manned missions are trying to work out how to stop foam falling off the fuel tank .
leave floating around in orbit to the chinese and get exploring .
matt , amsterdam , the netherlands -lrb- ex .
uk -rrb- the shuttle programme shows the greatness the human race can achieve when we focus d ward , portsmouth those who fly orbiters know the risks and accept the challenge .
the shuttle programme shows the greatness the human race can achieve when we focus .
a commitment should be made to give it whatever financial support it needs to continue .
nasa tv shows discovery 's latest mission is gripping .
we owe it to those astronauts who have lost their lives in space exploration , to carry on the work that they could n't finish .
d ward , portsmouth i have become addicted to nasa tv over the last few days , and find myself staring into space , thinking of discovery up there somewhere ... looking back on our little planet from a distance .
i am surely concerned about the debris ; remember nasa did not think this would be a problem for the ill-fated columbia crew either .
they have spent two years and thousands of dollars on this problem - so yes , i think we should be concerned , not only about the debris ' implications , but also that nasa got it wrong again .
verity worthington , bewdley , worcestershire hundreds of years ago people were afraid that they could sail off the edges of the earth .
thank heavens there were brave sailors then willing to push the limits of courage and technology , and thank heavens we still have them today .
i 'm also grateful that there are still those willing to fund such expeditions .
rob g. , kansas city , usa the disaster 2 years ago , and these recent problems with the shuttle show that nasa really need to get on with developing the next generation of re-useable shuttles .
technology has moved on so much in the nearly 30 years since it was developed with computer technology and new lightweight materials .
if they do n't , then the private space firms will take over , while nasa keeps flogging a dead horse .
tane piper , edinburgh , uk we are all with you , looking forward for success .
god be with you .
no surrender no retreat .
martin madulu , moshi - tanzania i am more worried about the apparent loss of a tile than the foam .
if any of the tiles were damaged , the mission is in jeopardy .
after the columbia disaster , i read an article published in 1980 calling the shuttles ' death traps ' .
considering that we 've already lost half the fleet , i think it is high time nasa invested in a different , more robust technology .
istvan , detroit , usa the safety of the crew should be of utmost importance , not launch schedules ss , usa my family and i were vacationing in florida at the time of the launch .
we saw it speeding skyward from the car on our way back home .
i am an aerospace design engineer specializing in flight dynamics .
my concern really lies with the inadequacy with which nasa has dealt with the foam / tile problem .
the safety of the crew should be of utmost importance , not launch schedules .
ss , usa only those at nasa who have looked at the images of debris falling will have the best idea .
the crew 's safe return is just our concern but it 's their mission .
venkat maruthamuthu , urbana , il , usa why was this problem not resolved after columbia two years ago ?
it is very wrong to send yet more people up there without being absolutely sure that it 's safe .
perhaps space travel should wait until we have progressed far enough that we are not relying on tiles that can just fall off ?
catherine , cheshunt , herts great to see the shuttle soar again .
our future lies not on earth but out there somewhere .
no matter how you argue it , in the future this planet will die and so will all those life forms still on it .
if the human species is to survive , then it must do so elsewhere and this sort of technology is the first step towards that ultimate goal .
ian jordan , wokingham the foam formulation was changed in 1996 ... most of the foam issues started after this change bruce g , huntsville , usa this is not a trivial engineering problem as some have implied .
there are two types of foam : a lightweight foam covering the large areas of the tank and a dense ablator foam covering areas exposed to aerodynamic heating .
the foam is exposed to supersonic airflow at about 27000 km / h -lrb- 17000 mph -rrb- during launch .
there are shock cones coming from the orbiter , the connecting struts and solid boosters which impinge on the tank .
there is also a lot of vibration .
the foam formulation was changed in 1996 to comply with the montreal protocol and eliminate the freon propellant .
most of the foam issues started after this change and may or may not be associated with it .
the shuttle is due to be retired in 2010 and solving this problem is important for future spacecraft design .
bruce g , huntsville , usa why ca n't the return module be encased within the main take off rocket ?
this would prevent bits flying off from damaging it .
tony lee , telford we were on vacation in orlando , and had tickets for the astronaut hall of fame to watch the original scheduled lift-off on 13 july .
we had such a good view , but with about an hour or so to go , the launch was cancelled .
we were gutted to have missed such a spectacular sight !
we watched it on television back here in ireland , but felt we had a special bond with sts 114 - return to flight .
we just hope now for the safe return of the shuttle and its crew on 7 august .
good luck to them .
hutch family , ireland one day when someone is sipping cocktails on saturn 's lunar resort , whilst looking back at the earth and the distant sun , they 'll thank these brave people for risking their lives .
let 's keep our nerve , and not look back .
chris phillips , chelmsford , essex it is an inherent part of our nature to explore caroline , edinburgh , uk i used to work at one of the nasa centres -lrb- in maryland -rrb- and i hope that space exploration continues .
as a scientist it is an inherent part of our nature to explore , discover and find out about the unknown .
i was overjoyed to see the launch of discovery and hope , beyond all hope , that they make it safely home .
as nasa have said - " exploring space is not for the faint hearted ' - it 's a huge undertaking " .
the astronauts know that , we all know that .
these are very brave people and i wish them , and nasa , well with their endeavours .
caroline , edinburgh , uk watching this made me feel giddy .
now hopefully we can complete the iss and get on with the business of colonising space .
the spirit of adventure lives on with discovery and her crew .
david mills , ballymena , uk we were very privileged to be able to see discovery launch when it flew mission 105 and the impression it left us with was ' it was amazing to see ' .
we believe that the crew and the engineers will be able to work together and face the challenge of bringing back this magnificent ship .
instead of shrinking from the challenge we should rise up to it just as they did in 1970 for apollo 13 , it is only by stretching our knowledge such as in times of emergencies that we reach beyond our capabilities .
good luck and best wishes to the crew and engineers .
julie and robert , manchester , england i would like to see the shuttle retired and replaced with a newer fleet scott , edinburgh congratulations to nasa on another successful launch .
however , i would like to see the shuttle retired and replaced with a newer and more capable fleet of vehicles .
not only will it be safer and hugely beneficial to space exploration , the project would provide thousands of jobs , contracts to companies and benefit the global economy .
scott , edinburgh people seem to forget that manned space travel is still very dangerous and those brave astronauts know the risks .
foam has been falling off fuel tanks for nearly 25 years now .
perhaps money should now be invested in developing better glue and a more efficient reusable manned space travel system .
john ellis , nottingham statistically , if commercial flights carried the same risks as spaceflight , there would be about 500 airliner crashes per day .
one therefore has to applaud the courage and determination of those people who accept this degree of risk in pursuit of our quest for knowledge .
we are an inquisitive species , in this case pushing the boundaries of what is possible .
i wish those seven brave souls a safe return .
bob , cheshire i 've been following the ' space race ' since sputnik and the mercury missions , and i ca n't think of anything more exciting than a successful launch .
but why do n't we stop racing against each other and form stronger international collaborations to make space travel safer ?
j forman , los angeles , usa if nasa says the shuttle is safe to fly , it 's safe to fly james , los angeles , usa it amazes me how many observers believe they are more of an expert on shuttle safety and capability than the engineers at nasa .
the fact is , the men and women who work at nasa are at the top of their field .
if they say the shuttle is safe to fly , it 's safe to fly .
james , los angeles , usa it was a beautiful launch .
the space shuttle program has been remarkably successful despite the previous disaster .
nobody can engineer absolute perfection , but this was very close .
h neil , south texas , usa i am very concerned about the damaged tiles on discovery , especially in light of nasa 's apparent slowness in acknowledging that the take-off incident with columbia caused the disaster upon return .
there is an option for the crew of discovery - to wait on the space station for rescue .
how can we even contemplate risking their lives ?
if the problem is serious enough to ground the fleet , discovery too should be ' grounded ' immediately .
sharon , dallas , texas i once saw a presentation on how the challenger disaster came to happen and how it could have been prevented and it made my blood run cold .
suffice it to say , i have nothing but the most profound admiration for the courage of the crews of the shuttle .
i 'm not a religious man , but i just hope to god they all get back safely .
steve , chesham tragic as the columbia accident was , the astronauts died doing what they loved - exploring space , a privilege only the select few get to do .
they also died at the end of their trip so they got to enjoy being in space , unlike the challenger crew .
before the columbia accident , i would expect that the shuttles got through intact in much worse condition than discovery .
i am not that concerned , although i will follow the investigations with great interest .
ian , london it seems ridiculous that it is being jeopardised by something so simple chris , brazil the shuttle has been up and down into space about 50 times before the columbia incident .
i can not believe that bits of foam from the fuel tank did n't come off during these trips .
are n't nasa being a bit super cautious about this problem ?
ca n't they encase the fuel tank in some sort of wire mesh in order to prevent the foam from breaking off ?
in such a high tech programme , it seems ridiculous that it is being jeopardised by something so simple .
chris , brazil what exactly are they doing out there that they have not had the chance to do before ?
first of all get a new ship and then go somewhere else than the moon !
that impressed my grand father , it will take more to impress me !
mathieu , gatineau , canada bits of foam have probably been falling off the shuttle since the first launch , but it 's only since a piece of that debris caused the destruction of columbia two years ago that anyone has noticed !
only now we have cameras watching every single part of the craft do we see what may well have been happening all along .
carry on as normal .
simon , peterborough , uk i remember watching the first ever shuttle flight as a kid .
i watched the launch the other day and got the exact same feelings of awe and excitement .
the shuttle launch is a wake up call to everyone .
sure the world has problems right now but despite those problems , look what we 're capable of !
my message to nasa , the esa and all the other agencies ?
keep going people .
take us there !
andrew k jones , wrexham , uk i watched the launch live on the internet and was overwhelmed .
we wo n't know of the mission 's success until 7 aug , but what surprises me is the us way of making everything big and the huge overhead costs .
it 's all show and little substance .
after having spent $ 1 billion and 2.5 years on the debris falling cause , they are back to square one and the shuttles are grounded again !
on the other hand the russians are making safe manned space missions with pinpoint accuracy every 3-6 months at a fraction of the cost .
rakesh , london uk without space exploration we would not have computers , hi-technology materials etc jim kirk , basildon i read once that spending on cosmetics in the usa dwarfs the nasa budget .
let 's get things in perspective .
without space exploration we would not have computers , hi-technology materials etc , all of which were a by-product .
if more is learned about our planet and its self-destructive population on each mission then we should keep it going .
come home safe guys !
jim kirk , basildon does anyone know why debris falls off a multi-million dollar spacecraft ?
ca n't some sort of outer layer be put around the fuel tank insulation to stop it disintegrating ?
i 'm not an engineer - i need someone else to explain it !
robert , sussex rather than risking the crew and the shuttle , if it is damaged , why do n't they leave it up there as service vehicle and bring the crew back in another shuttle at a later date ?
if nasa wants to survive they need to start making people believe in them again .
good luck discovery !
paul , london the space shuttle was under funded during its design and construction and the compromises mean it will never achieve its true potential .
the sooner it can be replaced with something newer and simpler the better .
david patrick , reading trying to make space exploration 100 % safe is just nonsense .
duncan , nottingham my heart sank when i heard the news that tiles had once again fallen off the space shuttle roger campbell , england my heart sank when i heard the news that tiles had once again fallen off the space shuttle .
if the cause of the tiles falling off is simply the vibration and air flow , then i wonder what will be the effect of the searing heat of re-entry .
roger campbell , england having watched the space shuttle launch on tv , it is good to see such a majestic craft finally back to what she was meant to do .
well done nasa for getting the space shuttle flying .
james , nottingham no-one made that big a deal when tiles were missing from the oms pods after columbia 's maiden flight in 1981 .
when designing this vehicle they must have made a risk assessment to determine safety parameters , and unfortunately the loss of columbia has made them refine these parameters further .
tim parker , edinburgh we watched the launch from our beach , about 90 miles away .
it was spectacular .
there are many more cameras watching the exterior shuttle craft than ever before which have alerted to the problems .
the engineers working for nasa are tireless and will get the current crew back safely one way or another .
the space programme will continue .
the only unknown is manned flights .
the mars rovers are still sending pictures and information long past when they were suppose to .
nasa will continue on and i believe has more government funding this year , or is due for an increase .
private companies are currently working on safe space travel for human passengers in the us and abroad i believe .
joan york , daytona beach , florida usa nasa 's team on the ground and the astronauts in the space are doing a great job for the mankind syed mateen , karachi , pakistan i have witnessed the launching of space shuttle discovery on television screen .
nasa 's team on the ground and the astronauts in the space are doing a great job for the mankind , as their experiences in the space will benefit the entire world .
i pray for the safe return of the astronauts and happy landing of the space shuttle .
as a human being , i am equally concerned about the debris which has fallen at the time of its blast , but hope that the space shuttle will not face the same problem as it did in the past .
the safe return of discovery will boost the moral of nasa 's team , who had worked day and night to make the space shuttle 's mission possible .
syed mateen , karachi , pakistan any country with ambitions to have manned missions to space would be more than happy to have a craft as good as the space shuttle .
if there is a cheaper way to break away from earth than i am all for it but i am not sure how much safer it will be .
exploration has always been a dangerous business .
erik , ft .
collins , u.s.a. manned space flight is a dangerous and expensive anachronism .
look at the success of hubble , the mars rovers and the cassini / huygens mission .
you can do 10 times as much real science for half the cost and no risk to life by concentrating on unmanned space exploration .
and tell me , were n't the pictures of titan far more exciting than anything the crew of the shuttle are likely to get up to ?
max , abu dhabi , uae i read some of the comments here with disbelief .
yes , we all know that there are problems in some areas of the world , it does n't however mean that everything has to stop because of that .
i can think of a lot more things which are more of a waste than space exploration .
i 'll bet half the people complaining about nasa being wasteful drive gas guzzlers and do n't bother to recycle .
the shuttle mission is vital to all areas of science and i 'm glad it is flying again .
the space shuttle is not an old machine ; discovery has only flown 30 times before .
most commercial airlines fly that often in a week !
dave , slough , uk many congratulations to nasa .
as a teacher i teach children who are fascinated by space .
it is good that the space missions continue .
it allows children to hope and dream that they might reach the stars themselves , one day !
michelle , birmingham we all know that it costs millions of dollars to support the space program .
one could argue that money could be better spent elsewhere .
the fact is we as human beings need to understand in order to learn new technologies and space exploration is just one of many things that need to be understood and conquered .
there will always be many arguments for and against the space program .
all i can say right now is well done to nasa and my best wishes for a truly successful return to space flight for discovery .
andrew howlett , cape town , south africa good luck and a safe landings to the crew of the discovery .
there are some here that would have the usa quit funding the space program until all the worlds ' problems are solved .
will you tell your children to wait for that day before pursuing their dreams ?
michael rosenbaum , san francisco , usa a plane crash or 9/11 does not stop air travel , so why should the columbia 2003 disaster stop space exploration ?
i 'm sure discovery will make it back safe and the astronauts will be given a well-deserved pat on the back .
jack , london / memphis the shuttle might be old but it still works , and has done the world a huge service towards on earth and in space exploration .
those who complain are clearly members of the flat earth society , and yet i bet they use technology every day ?
someone has to push the envelope .
go nasa go !
phil w , uk good launch .
let 's just hope she comes back in one piece .
ricardo , brazil the shuttles are aged dinosaurs that need to be " moth balled " before more lives are lost due to fragmenting styrofoam .
perhaps we should all consider shifting funding away from nasa and put it towards alternative fuel sources .
it would be revenue better spent .
kurt stuchell , cambridge , usa scuttle the shuttle gordon , auckland nz scuttle the shuttle !
obsolete equipment supplying a pointless lab .
much fanfare about increasing aid to africa by $ 25b but us military budget $ 400b makes you ill !
gordon , auckland nz i can not stand the mentality of myopic people who would rather we abandon the natural impulse to explore our surroundings , and instead focus on futile efforts to tackle every mundane earthbound problem .
surely , the sight of the shuttle blasting off into orbit is the most poignant statement of mankind 's destiny .
kevin , charlotte , north carolina , usa with so much bad news in the media : terrorism , war , poverty ... it 's wonderful to see what we as human beings can achieve , when we put our minds to something positive .
we have the potential to achieve great things .
the crew of this shuttle mission are from different countries , cultures and backgrounds ; proof that if we work together , we can produce something that makes us all proud .
charlie , newcastle , uk to all those who claim the space programme has helped advance medicine and technology . think how much further along in those fields we could be if all the money wasted at nasa went into development . let alone feeding the poor .
shameful waste of resources .
i do n't want my tax dollar to be spent this way .
p. o 'donnell , rotorua , n.z. there are always small-minded people who are terrified of exploration digby knight , henley-on-thames , uk there are always small-minded people who are terrified of exploration .
if we had their way , we 'd still be living in trees afraid of the dangerous savannah !
thankfully we 've always had a few who have done their best to pioneer new territories and worlds .
digby knight , henley-on-thames , uk i would argue that nasa is somewhat of an anachronism .
the " glory days " of the space race with russia are over .
instead , space exploration should be run by the national science foundation .
there , private and public money can be better organized to fund missions .
the nsf already runs most of the science stations here on earth .
why should space be any different ?
greg , alexandria , va space exploration * is * a waste of money .
had the billions been invested directly in more down-to-earth technologies , we would have seen the same spin-offs in medicine , it , and transport .
anonymous i ca n't believe the childish reactions to space exploration from folks like mike and anon , uk .
grow up , guys .
space exploration represents humanity at its most amazing .
you 're obviously just bitter because the us is leading the way .
typical .
shawn , washington , dc , usa exploration , of all kinds , has always helped man push the boundaries of technology .
the space programme is no different .
for this reason alone it is invaluable .
jason , detroit , usa despite all the delays and expert checks , something still fell off it on take off dan , yateley , uk looking at the shuttle i am always reminded of those creaking old 50 's and 60 's airliners you still see rattling around developing countries .
good in their day , but now so ropey and tired that they just scream " death trap " .
it says it all about the shuttle that despite all the delays and expert checks , something still fell off it on take off .
it 's high time this heap was scrapped , and a replacement worthy of the 21st century was introduced in its place .
dan , yateley , uk so the new ufos are unidentified falling objects ?
phil jones , frangy , france if you watch the film of the launch the piece of debris that falls off after the booster rocket drops off does not come from the shuttle it comes from the giant fuel tank , which is ' disposable ' anyway .
john nichols , brackley , nnorthants , uk how would brits feel if americans were talking about how britain should spend its money ?
michelle , raleigh , nc i think that nasa is still too hurried in launching the shuttle when the debris problem still exists .
maybe they should solve out the problem wholly before doing any thing else .
but the fact still shows that nasa has succeeded in launching the shuttle into space .
maybe that 's an incredible luck , although we still do n't know about the return of it .
but i believe it will succeed , too .
god 's will give luck to the crew .
nguyen hoang giang , hanoi , vietnam i just pray she makes it back down ok seun , london uk it was an excellent feeling seeing discovery go like that yesterday .
i am really happy for nasa and i just pray she makes it back down ok , that will be the icing on the cake .
seun , london uk oh dear !
the usa are off again trying to show how they can spend billions on space exploration , meanwhile trying to flex its muscles all around the world causing chaos- unbelievable !
mike , uk mankind is not content with polluting the earth !
it now wants to pollute space as well !
how sad !
millions starve while the usa burns dollars - what for ?
it truly is a sick world we live in these days !
anon , uk to anon , uk - the fuel is clean and non polluting - just water produced .
and as for waste of money - tell me about the dome and the london olympics .
longer term , i know what is more valuable !
george , chelmsford i 'm so glad to see the space programme resume shuttle launches .
space research is costly , but it 's like buying a lottery ticket - you never know what you 're going to get back from it , but once you go out there , there 's a chance you might win big .
and we already have - people have cited the benefits that have come from the space programme .
here 's to more exploration outside our atmosphere !
tony , london , uk i felt privileged to have been in florida for the launch .
it went off on time and from what i gather from reports , was perfect .
it 's something to tell the grandkids one day .
marylyn , london space travel fires the imagination !
tim goodchild , surrey space travel fires the imagination !
to all those that criticise that the shuttle is old and the fact that its had two failures should perhaps think again the next time they board a 747 on route to their holiday destination .
tim goodchild , surrey absolutely fantastic pictures from discovery , especially when the external fuel tank was detached from the shuttle with the curvature of the earth in the background .
overall great launch , well done nasa .
paul , coventry , uk the american space programme is a great achievement and it is important that it continues .
the human race is capable of great things and it is not in our nature to keep still .
terry , crewe , cheshire my gosh !
the people saying the space program is a waste of money ? !
the commercial products used now as a result of nasa are staggering .
cat scans , dialysis machines , materials in your athletic shoes , water purification technology , cordless power tools , cool suits for firefighters , physical therapy equipment .
the list goes on .
the program is invaluable !
eric , usa i think its well worth the effort and money to sustain humans in space carl lennon , northampton , uk most of the people on here with negative comments do not realise how much space has done for humanity .
many medical experiments have been conducted in space which was the only place that it could be done .
the results of these experiments have saved thousands if not millions of lives .
i think its well worth the effort and money to sustain humans in space .
carl lennon , northampton , uk although america has proven itself to be the world 's best engineers , nasa is living on past glory .
many of its best scientists and engineers have left , it is no longer in the public limelight unless it has a disaster , and it is grossly underfunded .
america should reinvigorate the program with major new investment and ambitious new goals or shut it down .
as the eu space agency has recently learned , you ca n't explore space on the cheap .
this old technology and this antiquated worn out hardware needs to be retired along with the mediocre management which has taken over .
mark , usa what a novel way to distract your nation from the real problems at home and abroad .
the cost does n't matter since the nation is paying the bill .
ed , canada there are those who say space exploration is a waste of money .
on the contrary , space travel forces society to stretch and reach further in order to solve highly complex problems associated with putting man into space .
the solutions to these problems are broad and serve mankind in many ways .
the space program enables us to move forward faster than we otherwise would .
without such large goals our advancement slows and we become lazy .
david , philadelphia , usa come on people , of course sending people into space is dangerous and expensive .
that does n't mean we should n't do it though .
even if space exploration did not lead to technical advances and practical application , it would still be worth it .
why ?
because it 's cool .
we put a man on the moon , that 's pretty impressive considering just prior to wwi a man could only travel as far as a horse could take him .
stu , st paul , usa the view from the fuel tank at over 14000mph was fantastic !
rod aries , glasgow the view from the fuel tank at over 14000mph was fantastic !
why are n't other space agencies doing this for the public ?
engage us !
rod aries , glasgow every time i see a rocket launch i think that newton made it possible ; his equations are still used to calculate the orbit .
how many other things in use today were invented over 300 years ago ?
vic , uk a sense of pride mixed with concern .
i live near the johnson space center and have relatives that have worked in the program as far back as gemini and apollo .
the space program is much more than a news story to us .
to those who think the space program is a waste of money : there is so much innovation and research that goes on behind the scenes that you 'd change your opinion if you took the time to look at what nasa has accomplished over the years and continues to accomplish today .
paul , houston , tx well , i 'm relieved it 's up there .
but they still seem to have this gung-ho attitude to safety .
i could n't believe that after killing two crews they are still happy to launch with a known serious fault .
chris hann , bay area , ca , usa congratulations to nasa on a successful launch .
i 'm glad to see that some nations still recognise the value of dreaming and aspiring to do great things and inspire their young people .
the money spent of spaceflight is miniscule compared to the many benefits .
it 's sad here in the uk that people are so ignorant and short-sighted with regards to space exploration that we ca n't see the good that can from it - and then we wonder the younger generations are n't interested in science , medicine and technology .
victor , birmingham , england this launch showed the world what can be accomplished with great teamwork , ambition and determination d soni , nuneaton , uk i watched the launch and was overcome with pride .
all the people involved in this great feat have overcome extreme obstacles .
this launch showed the world what can be accomplished with great teamwork , ambition and determination .
congratulations discovery !
d soni , nuneaton , uk mankind needs a vision .
interplanetary travel is necessary to achieve that end .
stuart haines , calgary , alberta , canada it 's time to junk the space shuttle and perhaps " rethink " this whole business of manned space flight for the time being .
think about it , other than as a showy display of national pride , what benefits do any nations get at this time from sending humans into space ?
perhaps in the future when we have real goals and reliable " safe " transportation we can start wasting our time and money with such " propaganda flights " , but now is n't the time and place for such foolishness .
charlie , niagara falls new york people always complain that space programs are too expensive , but do people appreciate how much safer the planet is with them ?
we can monitor dangerous weather , asteroids , and send tv , radio , and telephone signals via satellites .
space programs really have helped the planet excel in a positive way , and i 'm glad the discovery is finally continuing what has already been a remarkable feat of engineering .
tim hunt -lrb- 16 -rrb- , plymouth , england in these days darkened by the spectre of global terrorism , we seek hope and strength in many places .
the fog of war and the wind that whispers the question of " why are we fighting in the middle east ? ' diminish our confidence in our government .
today 's launch of the shuttle discovery renews our hope and faith in our abilities to overcome tragedy and defy adversity .
we owe the entire nasa family a debt of gratitude for restoring our faith in the human spirit .
paul telfer , franceville , gabon we need a new way of going to the stars clive , dartford , uk i wish the crew well on the mission , but the shuttle is old and just like any aircraft , it has its life expectancy and this bird has reached it .
we need a new way of going to the stars and to ditch the big firework approach to it .
clive , dartford , uk sure , okay .
maybe the shuttle programme is old .
maybe it should be scrapped for something better .
but , it is all we have at the moment .
and to all of you here who keep telling us to get rid of it , i have n't heard one of you say anything about putting up any money with us to fund a new programme .
jon , atlanta , usa what nasa needs is a real life scotty character to sort these technical issues out .
paul collier , london , uk the truth is that the shuttle concept has proved to be too expensive and technically complex to be the way forward in space .
i am pro-space exploration but the shuttle has slowed this to a crawl , and all the best work has been done by probes boosted by rockets e.g. mars landers , titan probes etc .
andy , uk " space is expensive ! " cry the critics .
i wish they would angle their criticism at a truly scandalous target .
the entire space programme to date has cost less than what the world spends on arms every year .
i know which i think is better value for money .
bernard o. quinn , barcelona , catalonia the exploration of space will continue with us or without us scott westwood , port orchard , wa , usa the shuttle is expensive , outdated and despite nasa 's assurances , its safety is still uncertain ; but it 's the only game in town .
the exploration of space will continue with us or without us ; to sit on the sidelines and watch others go up would be unthinkable for an america that prides itself on being a superpower .
scott westwood , port orchard , wa , usa space exploration is essential for the future of all humans .
flying over the atlantic was at first a risky endeavour and now it is done by millions every year without a thought for the early pioneers and the planes that never arrived .
colin , croydon , uk i do not understand all these people saying that america should scrap the shuttle , and spend it on ' the world ' .
the us is already the single largest contributor of foreign aid .
the us space program has helped everyday life for billions of people around the world , and churned out invention after invention for the world .
bill zimmer , seattle , wa congratulations to all those involved in discovery 's return to space !
to all the naysayers , next time you are browsing the internet on your pc , take a moment to find out what drove the development of semiconductors that power your pc .
yes , the space exploration that you think is a waste of money !
roger , london tears came to my eyes and i held my breath colleen , orlando , fl usa we were in the parking lot facing east , waiting and whispering to each other .
the first person to see the shuttle clearing the trees threw up their hand to point it out and some of the men started yelling , " go , baby , go ! " and cheering .
tears came to my eyes and i held my breath .
the space program has done so much to improve our lives in the fields of health and science , they further our knowledge of our environment and how our magnificent planet works .
colleen , orlando , fl usa go discovery !
the future of humanity is in space .
as an american living abroad , the lift-off of discovery is the first event that makes me proud to be american since leaving my country .
i hope that this success will lead to the completion of the iss and the continued exploration of space .
daniel valenti , canberra , australia people forget that we belong to this planet earth , in that our physical bodies are perfectly adapted to survive only on the earth .
we could never survive on other planets without extensive artificial aids .
as many have already pointed out , there are many , many more pressing needs requiring resolution and funds should be redirected where they are most needed for our survival on our home planet .

the crew on board the space shuttle have conducted inspections of discovery 's belly and repairs to the shuttle have also been carried out .
stephen robinson has begun a unique spacewalk , going under the orbiter 's belly to remove two ceramic strips sticking out between heatshield tiles .
nasa engineers are concerned the strips would cause part of discovery to overheat as it re-enters the earth 's atmosphere .
discovery had been due to return to earth on 7 august , but nasa has decided to extend the mission by an extra day .
what do you think of the mission so far ?
how do you feel about the mission being extended ?
what do you think about the repairs ?

this debate is now closed .
read a selection of your comments below .
click here to read a second page of your comments the following comments reflect the balance of opinion we have received so far : the money that is spent by the american government on space exploration could be much better spent on healthcare and education .
this would be much more beneficial to the american people than discovery 's mission .
carolynne burkholder , vancouver , british columbia i can not believe that the crew had to cobble together a hacksaw norman west , truro , cornwall i can not believe that the crew had to cobble together a hacksaw .
a small box of tools from any diy shop would have done the job .
also removing a gap filler between the tiles exposes a gap .
surely the wind can get in and potentially lift a tile causing a fatal problem .
norman west , truro , cornwall whilst i can see that advances may be made through this work , i saw two items on the news last night - one about children dying because they have n't got a few quid , the other about spending millions on keeping the shuttles going in and out of space .
priority check please .
mark , didcot , england space travel is dangerous , pioneers are going to die , but it is worthwhile .
what is needed now are new spaceships to let us travel between planets .
at the moment all our eggs are in one basket , we need to find other homes on other worlds .
we have made this one nearly uninhabitable .
i would go into space whatever the risk .
ruth , walsall maybe if all the countries stopped being so petty and pooled their resources , we 'd have superior technology and fewer incidents like this .
we do n't need to race against each other anymore to try and prove who 's superior ; instead we should look to a future of co-operation .
gaz , cardiff , uk i will never understand why we waste so much money on primitive space stations john gearing , st. helens , uk i will never understand why we waste so much money on primitive space stations and shuttles which clearly have no function for the human race at this time .
i do n't know why we do n't get all our experts and fund them in coming up with unmanned technologies and technology in shuttles that could take us to planets not to a tin can in the sky which is over expensive and serves no function to the mass population .
john gearing , st. helens , uk fascinating a brit would ask the question why the us is sending people into space .
as the brit , george mallory said in 1924 , " because its there " .
mt everest killed mallory and we remember him for his quest .
in a similar quest , the us will continue to go into space - because its there .
john b , windermere , florida do some of these contributors have no soul ?
what could be more magnificent than seeing human beings taking risks to explore the unknown ; triumphing over the problems they meet along the way ; opening up new horizons for the rest of us ?
yes let 's invest in a new space transportation system , and more manned flights , and unmanned probes and a bigger , better space station .
but to claim that stopping the current flights is sensible shows no faith in the species at all .
stop looking down at the ground and start looking up at the stars .
john r smith , uk please , armchair scientists , let the experts at nasa do their job making the risk calculations .
they 've got the know-how and the tools to make the decisions .
not you or me .
joe , usa this is the most ridiculous expenditure of precious funds in a time of great national travail .
nasa is an anachronism , a patronistic pet rock that has no justification whatsoever , especially in the current environment in which civilized societies are fighting for their mere existence .
the irresponsibility in launching this mission in the face of known deficiencies is appalling .
c. a. la varre , newport , ri usa the media paints such a doom and gloom picture of what is happening above us phil , hampshire , uk why-oh-why does the media take such a negative view to what the men and women on sts114 are doing .
the media paints such a doom and gloom picture of what is happening above us .
we as a united world should watch and praise these people who are up there performing the most fantastic things known to mankind .
yes there is a difficult time coming on returning to earth but the crew at this time seem very positive about it .
may i suggest that you all watch nasa tv on the web for real live happenings .
phil , hampshire , uk nasa is undergoing drastic changes .
i think the us should pause and take stock of what 's happening to their space missions .
give it a break , sort out problems and return 10years later .
i wonder how the us ever landed man on the moon ?
did they really ?
i wonder !
errol , dubai , uae space flight is still in its infancy .
so the fact that an astronaut was able to make a repair to the shuttle in space is a great triumph .
nasa should look on this feat in a positive light , not a negative one .
we know in the days of sailing ships as they travelled the globe to discover new lands , there were many times when sailors had to climb up masts in storms to make repairs , so is repairing space craft in flight any different ?
leon aarons , petach israel another piece of space theatre , justifying manned flight .
unmanned craft can put payloads into orbit much more cheaply , as well as exploring other planets .
martin , dubai , uae i 've just seen a picture of the tool , held together with strong tape that the astronauts used .
it 's great to imagine that a billion-dollar aircraft can be saved by a bit of strong tape and some elbow grease !
it 's that sort of thinking that 's saved astronauts in the past .
good luck to them , hope humans carry on going into space for many more years .
dave , manchester , uk this spacewalk and repair demonstrates two things .
firstly , the courage and initiative of the astronauts , secondly , the importance of retiring the ageing shuttle fleet and building a modern spacecraft .
electronics and materials technology have advanced tremendously in the past 30 years , but the shuttle is still using outdated technology .
gordon mcstraun , uk so , the offending piece if gap filler from between a couple of heat shields .
i 'm no nasa expert , but does n't this mean that the is now a gap between these tiles ?
michael , bucks , uk the astronauts are all volunteers , they know the risks involved , and that is why i praise and thank them kirsty , cambridge , uk i think it is fantastic that discovery has launched and its mission is going well .
a lesson has been learnt from colombia , and indeed , challenger .
the astronauts are all volunteers , they know the risks involved , and that is why i praise and thank them .
they are incredible people .
kirsty , cambridge , uk so what if the filler problem has to be fixed with a jerry-rigged hacksaw ?
this type of ingenuity has been saving lives since the age of tall ships and can only reflect well on the tenacity of the nasa engineers and astronauts .
remember when the progress hit mir ?
apollo 13 ?
we need the experience of these problems to give us the know-how to survive in space and give us the confidence in our ability to solve problems on longer , bolder voyages .
tim parker , edinburgh , scotland i work with remote operated vehicles in the oil and gas industry .
i am amazed that the crew of the discovery need to cobble together a makeshift hacksaw to carry out a job on the tiles .
the shuttles are old and things will go wrong so you would expect a decent tool kit to be onboard .
james , paderne , portugal why are the americans still sending people into space ?
if they want to explore they should be thinking of unmanned flights with intelligent technology which can spend decades in space .
this should help the ozone layer repair itself .
more is needed to be done to explore and catalogue this planet and its systems , this will be of more benefit to mankind and our home than space travel .
haz , nottingham , uk is going up in the shuttle much more dangerous than sailing unknown oceans a few hundred years ago in wooden ships ?
thank goodness that throughout history not everyone has wanted to sit at home in comfort in their own small world .
simon , manchester , uk with so many comings and goings to and from iss , would it not be sensible for just the bare minimum of crew to return in this shuttle and send up a half-empty shuttle to collect the rest of them ?
why take unnecessary risks ?
fraser irving , sheffield , uk until now , the shuttle missions have been routine , like taking a walk in the park .
but the reality of danger with the loss of two shuttles has almost brought the space program to its knees .
should it continue ?
of course it must go on because too much is at stake .
closing the space station , and not looking into space is the worst we can do .
life on earth is becoming dangerous .
we must look to the stars if humanity is to survive .
walter , chapel hill , nc i think - and hope - this flight is one of the safest ever .
my guess is the problems have appeared simply because they have been looking for them far more carefully than before .
however , there 's no doubt a replacement spacecraft is needed .
the private " space ship one " has a slow re-entry , avoiding thermal problems .
is this possible from orbit ?
and a separate , unmanned cargo vehicle seems a " no-brainer " .
simon , bristol it must be frightening for the astronauts but the space programme must prevail anya , london pioneers always take risks so that everyone else can eventually follow .
it must be frightening for the astronauts but the space programme must prevail .
updated technology is definitely needed .
unmanned missions are a good idea , but ultimately there is no substitute for human actions and reactions .
anya , london interesting to note that the two shuttle losses have not been due to design or engineering flaws in the shuttle themselves , but rather the propulsion system .
for 30 year old vehicles , i think the shuttles are doing pretty well , and i am sure they will continue for a long time .
matt , bristol space exploration is dangerous and the crew knows this better than any of us - and they still volunteered for it .
my view is that we need to continue to explore space and the shuttle repair should be seen as an experience that needs to be faced at some time .
let 's not be weak about this .
george , chelmsford what nasa has done is simply awesome .
nasa is the adventurer of our era , looking at and investigating things that are far bigger than us .
i say ground the space shuttles , but do not skimp on quickly building bigger , better , and safer spacecraft to replace them .
sk , ithaca , ny space technology is too integrated in our daily lives now peter byrd , worcester the few people who mock space projects should not use anything connected with space technology as a protest !
i bet hardly anyone would manage it or really want to .
space technology is too integrated in our daily lives now ; we all enjoy the advantages we get from it .
nasa tv via the net alone shows me how wonderful space is .
peter byrd , worcester i have just returned from florida where i was privileged enough to witness the breathtaking launch first hand .
it seems as though there are increasing difficulties using these shuttles .
are the lives of 7 astronauts each time it takes off a risk that is worth taking ?
matt , london given the loss of columbia and the uncertainty of this mission , nasa should scrap the shuttle programme .
luck prevented previous disasters and it would appear nasa 's luck has run out .
what makes them feel confident that they can repair in space what they failed to repair in two years on the ground ?
my thoughts are with the families of those on the iss .
phil , bracknell , uk the problems with discovery must have been encountered with all the previous shuttle flights .
it appears that each time it took off , it was russian roulette as to whether it would return safely .
this program should be abandoned until a new and safer means of transporting the shuttle into space can be developed .
chris , brazil will the resulting depression between the tiles create a possibility of a chink in the armour ?
k chowksey , bangalore , india even if the pieces sticking out are pulled or hacked , will the resulting depression between the tiles create a possibility of a chink in the armour ?
even a depression can alter the aerodynamic behaviour -lrb- as in golf balls -rrb- .
this will create uneven heat distribution .
k chowksey , bangalore , india from the idealists point of view we really should not be thinking about costs here .
space exploration is vital , not only to our technological development as a species , but also in terms of our wider understanding of the universe .
the whole nasa infrastructure is quite frankly awesome .
every endeavour has its risks and we 've seen the tragic consequences of those risks with the previous accidents .
chris , bracknell we need to explore space ; when you go to hospital and have a cat scan or an mri , that technology has come from the space program .
there is nothing wrong with the shuttle - the problem is with the way it is maintained .
they need to do better , i do n't know why do n't they paint it again , and seal the foam .
carol , pa , usa the saddest thing for me about this mission is that the next time the iss is visible from england on august 11th , the shuttle will have already left .
hopefully we 'll get to see the shuttle during the next mission .
after the moon , the iss is the brightest object in the night sky .
john airey , peterborough i looked at the images of the underside of the shuttle and thought that it looked like really bad bathroom tiling rob , spain major advances need to be made to the whole concept of effective re-entry heat-shield technology .
even before lift-off , i looked at the images of the underside of the shuttle and thought that it looked like really bad bathroom tiling .
initially , i expected it to be a smooth , seamless surface , but it was a patchwork of light and dark areas with patches that looked more raised than others .
i assume that tiles are the best option at the moment , but in future this issue needs to be solved completely .
rob , spain if nasa has decided to just rip out the relatively small strips protruding from between the heat shield tiles , then why ca n't they ask astronaut steve robinson to take his experimental repair kit out with him and fill the gaps with the mastic gum that they used to ' fix ' the tiles in their earlier experiments ?
paul greer , gothenburg , sweden i worked as an engineer on skylab in the 70s and i consider this nasa debacle a disgrace .
unknown risk is one thing , but gambling with lives on known problems with solutions is unacceptable .
i say : bring some crew home in russian capsule , leave the rest of the crew up there , fix the foam on atlantis -lrb- and everything else possible -rrb- and then send a rescue mission .
then ground the antiques and use modern technology to build new spacecraft .
rich dusek , orchard lake , mi , us bruce from huntsville says it 's not a trivial engineering problem and he 's probably right .
but that does n't alter the documented fact that nasa has sent people into space against the advice of contractors who have told them that certain aspects are n't safe .
if shuttles are prone to bits falling off then they should n't be flying .
david , chelmsford uk nasa do n't build all the parts and therefore an outside company may be partly responsible james , uk why do people expect space travel to be perfectly safe ?
look at any picture of launch and remember the orange tank is full of fuel and both white rockets once started ca n't be stopped .
man in space is an essential part of our future .
the earth can not sustain us forever particularly its natural resources .
i also think people should recognise that nasa do n't build all the parts and therefore an outside company may be partly responsible .
james , uk the problems with the space transportation system are a classic example of what happens when whole-life costs are not taken into account during early design phases of the system .
congress chose to buy shuttle on the cheap , opting for solid fuel boosters and a disposable fuel tank instead of spending extra money upfront to design a fully-reusable fly-back first stage to take the orbiter into space .
the result has been far higher operating costs and , tragically , the loss of fourteen astronauts .
will it be too much to hope that senior agency managers and politicians will learn these lessons in defining our future access to space ?
in europe as well as the usa .
phil , bath , uk so far this particular mission has been very worrying for relatives of the discovery crew .
any venture into space is a risk , but this one seems to have gone ahead knowing this risk factor was much higher than usual .
why are these missions so important ?
the risk factor is too great to risk innocent lives .
stop them now .
jose a holmes , loughborough , england i wish the crew a safe return but am sorry to see resources wasted on a manned flight with little real value for essentially political and pr reasons while much more scientifically valuable unmanned work is scaled back to pay for it .
this is all about the advancement of the usa , not science .
julian , london , uk the debris issue has been present in the shuttle programme from day one .
the tiles themselves are so fragile you can break them with one hand .
the space shuttle is a wonderful vehicle , but sadly owing to it 's bizarre design , is inherently dangerous and needs to be replaced soon .
as richard feynman said after the challenger disaster , " for a successful technology , reality must take precedence over public relations , for nature can not be fooled . "
chris dyer , bristol , england the immediate future of the space program will be best served by robot missions dr malcolm fairbairn , uk / sweden i , like most people connected with astrophysics , think that the immediate future of the space program will be best served by robot missions for at least the next twenty years .
it 's not taking a step backwards ; it 's about developing and testing new technologies which will eventually be applied to human spaceflight .
for the same amount of money you get much more science done with robotic missions because you do n't have to worry about the fragile humans .
dr malcolm fairbairn , uk / sweden as an aerospace engineer , in this particular instance i am not worried about discovery .
all indications are that the debris did no damage .
long term , though , it could be a problem .
the space shuttle has never fulfilled the promises that were made for it .
it is an expensive vehicle of very limited utility .
it consumes resources which could be better used elsewhere in the us space program .
andrew ogilvie , modesto , california , usa robert heinlein said it : " the earth is too small and fragile a basket for humanity to keep all its eggs in . "
the only safe place to be when disaster comes -lrb- an asteroid for example -rrb- is somewhere else .
well done , discovery .
keep it up .
john fielder , workington , uk there are a lot of negative comments on here by people who really have not done their research .
there are so many inventions that have come to be due to space travel most are indirect , technology passed to the public after it has been created to aid nasa and the like in various projects .
adam ransom , birmingham space flight is one of the things that most excites me jehuda arieh veenman , haifa , israel space flight is one of the things that most excites me .
it breaks my heart that foam broke off the insulation again .
apparently , the design has a basic flaw ; the vulnerable heat shield is exposed to a bombardment of debris falling of during take off .
in the more old fashioned designs , the heat shields were protected during take off .
jehuda arieh veenman , haifa , israel it seems to me that the logical fix for the launch system would be to mount the shuttle higher relative to the fuel tank .
the coldness of the fuel is always going to be a problem in causing freezing of water and air in and around the foam insulation .
since that is the nature of the beast , get the shuttle out of harms way above the possible falling debris nigel dandridge-perry , los angeles ca , usa good luck discovery , i look forward to seeing a safe flight back to earth .
mark , dorset there is no progress with manned missions .
it 's more of the same .
while unmanned missions are discovering lakes of water on mars , landing on distant moons and exploring planets , the manned missions are trying to work out how to stop foam falling off the fuel tank .
leave floating around in orbit to the chinese and get exploring .
matt , amsterdam , the netherlands -lrb- ex .
uk -rrb- the shuttle programme shows the greatness the human race can achieve when we focus d ward , portsmouth those who fly orbiters know the risks and accept the challenge .
the shuttle programme shows the greatness the human race can achieve when we focus .
a commitment should be made to give it whatever financial support it needs to continue .
nasa tv shows discovery 's latest mission is gripping .
we owe it to those astronauts who have lost their lives in space exploration , to carry on the work that they could n't finish .
d ward , portsmouth i have become addicted to nasa tv over the last few days , and find myself staring into space , thinking of discovery up there somewhere ... looking back on our little planet from a distance .
i am surely concerned about the debris ; remember nasa did not think this would be a problem for the ill-fated columbia crew either .
they have spent two years and thousands of dollars on this problem - so yes , i think we should be concerned , not only about the debris ' implications , but also that nasa got it wrong again .
verity worthington , bewdley , worcestershire hundreds of years ago people were afraid that they could sail off the edges of the earth .
thank heavens there were brave sailors then willing to push the limits of courage and technology , and thank heavens we still have them today .
i 'm also grateful that there are still those willing to fund such expeditions .
rob g. , kansas city , usa the disaster 2 years ago , and these recent problems with the shuttle show that nasa really need to get on with developing the next generation of re-useable shuttles .
technology has moved on so much in the nearly 30 years since it was developed with computer technology and new lightweight materials .
if they do n't , then the private space firms will take over , while nasa keeps flogging a dead horse .
tane piper , edinburgh , uk we are all with you , looking forward for success .
god be with you .
no surrender no retreat .
martin madulu , moshi - tanzania i am more worried about the apparent loss of a tile than the foam .
if any of the tiles were damaged , the mission is in jeopardy .
after the columbia disaster , i read an article published in 1980 calling the shuttles ' death traps ' .
considering that we 've already lost half the fleet , i think it is high time nasa invested in a different , more robust technology .
istvan , detroit , usa the safety of the crew should be of utmost importance , not launch schedules ss , usa my family and i were vacationing in florida at the time of the launch .
we saw it speeding skyward from the car on our way back home .
i am an aerospace design engineer specializing in flight dynamics .
my concern really lies with the inadequacy with which nasa has dealt with the foam / tile problem .
the safety of the crew should be of utmost importance , not launch schedules .
ss , usa only those at nasa who have looked at the images of debris falling will have the best idea .
the crew 's safe return is just our concern but it 's their mission .
venkat maruthamuthu , urbana , il , usa why was this problem not resolved after columbia two years ago ?
it is very wrong to send yet more people up there without being absolutely sure that it 's safe .
perhaps space travel should wait until we have progressed far enough that we are not relying on tiles that can just fall off ?
catherine , cheshunt , herts great to see the shuttle soar again .
our future lies not on earth but out there somewhere .
no matter how you argue it , in the future this planet will die and so will all those life forms still on it .
if the human species is to survive , then it must do so elsewhere and this sort of technology is the first step towards that ultimate goal .
ian jordan , wokingham the foam formulation was changed in 1996 ... most of the foam issues started after this change bruce g , huntsville , usa this is not a trivial engineering problem as some have implied .
there are two types of foam : a lightweight foam covering the large areas of the tank and a dense ablator foam covering areas exposed to aerodynamic heating .
the foam is exposed to supersonic airflow at about 27000 km / h -lrb- 17000 mph -rrb- during launch .
there are shock cones coming from the orbiter , the connecting struts and solid boosters which impinge on the tank .
there is also a lot of vibration .
the foam formulation was changed in 1996 to comply with the montreal protocol and eliminate the freon propellant .
most of the foam issues started after this change and may or may not be associated with it .
the shuttle is due to be retired in 2010 and solving this problem is important for future spacecraft design .
bruce g , huntsville , usa why ca n't the return module be encased within the main take off rocket ?
this would prevent bits flying off from damaging it .
tony lee , telford we were on vacation in orlando , and had tickets for the astronaut hall of fame to watch the original scheduled lift-off on 13 july .
we had such a good view , but with about an hour or so to go , the launch was cancelled .
we were gutted to have missed such a spectacular sight !
we watched it on television back here in ireland , but felt we had a special bond with sts 114 - return to flight .
we just hope now for the safe return of the shuttle and its crew on 7 august .
good luck to them .
hutch family , ireland one day when someone is sipping cocktails on saturn 's lunar resort , whilst looking back at the earth and the distant sun , they 'll thank these brave people for risking their lives .
let 's keep our nerve , and not look back .
chris phillips , chelmsford , essex it is an inherent part of our nature to explore caroline , edinburgh , uk i used to work at one of the nasa centres -lrb- in maryland -rrb- and i hope that space exploration continues .
as a scientist it is an inherent part of our nature to explore , discover and find out about the unknown .
i was overjoyed to see the launch of discovery and hope , beyond all hope , that they make it safely home .
as nasa have said - " exploring space is not for the faint hearted ' - it 's a huge undertaking " .
the astronauts know that , we all know that .
these are very brave people and i wish them , and nasa , well with their endeavours .
caroline , edinburgh , uk watching this made me feel giddy .
now hopefully we can complete the iss and get on with the business of colonising space .
the spirit of adventure lives on with discovery and her crew .
david mills , ballymena , uk we were very privileged to be able to see discovery launch when it flew mission 105 and the impression it left us with was ' it was amazing to see ' .
we believe that the crew and the engineers will be able to work together and face the challenge of bringing back this magnificent ship .
instead of shrinking from the challenge we should rise up to it just as they did in 1970 for apollo 13 , it is only by stretching our knowledge such as in times of emergencies that we reach beyond our capabilities .
good luck and best wishes to the crew and engineers .
julie and robert , manchester , england i would like to see the shuttle retired and replaced with a newer fleet scott , edinburgh congratulations to nasa on another successful launch .
however , i would like to see the shuttle retired and replaced with a newer and more capable fleet of vehicles .
not only will it be safer and hugely beneficial to space exploration , the project would provide thousands of jobs , contracts to companies and benefit the global economy .
scott , edinburgh people seem to forget that manned space travel is still very dangerous and those brave astronauts know the risks .
foam has been falling off fuel tanks for nearly 25 years now .
perhaps money should now be invested in developing better glue and a more efficient reusable manned space travel system .
john ellis , nottingham statistically , if commercial flights carried the same risks as spaceflight , there would be about 500 airliner crashes per day .
one therefore has to applaud the courage and determination of those people who accept this degree of risk in pursuit of our quest for knowledge .
we are an inquisitive species , in this case pushing the boundaries of what is possible .
i wish those seven brave souls a safe return .
bob , cheshire i 've been following the ' space race ' since sputnik and the mercury missions , and i ca n't think of anything more exciting than a successful launch .
but why do n't we stop racing against each other and form stronger international collaborations to make space travel safer ?
j forman , los angeles , usa if nasa says the shuttle is safe to fly , it 's safe to fly james , los angeles , usa it amazes me how many observers believe they are more of an expert on shuttle safety and capability than the engineers at nasa .
the fact is , the men and women who work at nasa are at the top of their field .
if they say the shuttle is safe to fly , it 's safe to fly .
james , los angeles , usa it was a beautiful launch .
the space shuttle program has been remarkably successful despite the previous disaster .
nobody can engineer absolute perfection , but this was very close .
h neil , south texas , usa i am very concerned about the damaged tiles on discovery , especially in light of nasa 's apparent slowness in acknowledging that the take-off incident with columbia caused the disaster upon return .
there is an option for the crew of discovery - to wait on the space station for rescue .
how can we even contemplate risking their lives ?
if the problem is serious enough to ground the fleet , discovery too should be ' grounded ' immediately .
sharon , dallas , texas i once saw a presentation on how the challenger disaster came to happen and how it could have been prevented and it made my blood run cold .
suffice it to say , i have nothing but the most profound admiration for the courage of the crews of the shuttle .
i 'm not a religious man , but i just hope to god they all get back safely .
steve , chesham tragic as the columbia accident was , the astronauts died doing what they loved - exploring space , a privilege only the select few get to do .
they also died at the end of their trip so they got to enjoy being in space , unlike the challenger crew .
before the columbia accident , i would expect that the shuttles got through intact in much worse condition than discovery .
i am not that concerned , although i will follow the investigations with great interest .
ian , london it seems ridiculous that it is being jeopardised by something so simple chris , brazil the shuttle has been up and down into space about 50 times before the columbia incident .
i can not believe that bits of foam from the fuel tank did n't come off during these trips .
are n't nasa being a bit super cautious about this problem ?
ca n't they encase the fuel tank in some sort of wire mesh in order to prevent the foam from breaking off ?
in such a high tech programme , it seems ridiculous that it is being jeopardised by something so simple .
chris , brazil what exactly are they doing out there that they have not had the chance to do before ?
first of all get a new ship and then go somewhere else than the moon !
that impressed my grand father , it will take more to impress me !
mathieu , gatineau , canada bits of foam have probably been falling off the shuttle since the first launch , but it 's only since a piece of that debris caused the destruction of columbia two years ago that anyone has noticed !
only now we have cameras watching every single part of the craft do we see what may well have been happening all along .
carry on as normal .
simon , peterborough , uk i remember watching the first ever shuttle flight as a kid .
i watched the launch the other day and got the exact same feelings of awe and excitement .
the shuttle launch is a wake up call to everyone .
sure the world has problems right now but despite those problems , look what we 're capable of !
my message to nasa , the esa and all the other agencies ?
keep going people .
take us there !
andrew k jones , wrexham , uk i watched the launch live on the internet and was overwhelmed .
we wo n't know of the mission 's success until 7 aug , but what surprises me is the us way of making everything big and the huge overhead costs .
it 's all show and little substance .
after having spent $ 1 billion and 2.5 years on the debris falling cause , they are back to square one and the shuttles are grounded again !
on the other hand the russians are making safe manned space missions with pinpoint accuracy every 3-6 months at a fraction of the cost .
rakesh , london uk without space exploration we would not have computers , hi-technology materials etc jim kirk , basildon i read once that spending on cosmetics in the usa dwarfs the nasa budget .
let 's get things in perspective .
without space exploration we would not have computers , hi-technology materials etc , all of which were a by-product .
if more is learned about our planet and its self-destructive population on each mission then we should keep it going .
come home safe guys !
jim kirk , basildon does anyone know why debris falls off a multi-million dollar spacecraft ?
ca n't some sort of outer layer be put around the fuel tank insulation to stop it disintegrating ?
i 'm not an engineer - i need someone else to explain it !
robert , sussex rather than risking the crew and the shuttle , if it is damaged , why do n't they leave it up there as service vehicle and bring the crew back in another shuttle at a later date ?
if nasa wants to survive they need to start making people believe in them again .
good luck discovery !
paul , london the space shuttle was under funded during its design and construction and the compromises mean it will never achieve its true potential .
the sooner it can be replaced with something newer and simpler the better .
david patrick , reading trying to make space exploration 100 % safe is just nonsense .
duncan , nottingham my heart sank when i heard the news that tiles had once again fallen off the space shuttle roger campbell , england my heart sank when i heard the news that tiles had once again fallen off the space shuttle .
if the cause of the tiles falling off is simply the vibration and air flow , then i wonder what will be the effect of the searing heat of re-entry .
roger campbell , england having watched the space shuttle launch on tv , it is good to see such a majestic craft finally back to what she was meant to do .
well done nasa for getting the space shuttle flying .
james , nottingham no-one made that big a deal when tiles were missing from the oms pods after columbia 's maiden flight in 1981 .
when designing this vehicle they must have made a risk assessment to determine safety parameters , and unfortunately the loss of columbia has made them refine these parameters further .
tim parker , edinburgh we watched the launch from our beach , about 90 miles away .
it was spectacular .
there are many more cameras watching the exterior shuttle craft than ever before which have alerted to the problems .
the engineers working for nasa are tireless and will get the current crew back safely one way or another .
the space programme will continue .
the only unknown is manned flights .
the mars rovers are still sending pictures and information long past when they were suppose to .
nasa will continue on and i believe has more government funding this year , or is due for an increase .
private companies are currently working on safe space travel for human passengers in the us and abroad i believe .
joan york , daytona beach , florida usa nasa 's team on the ground and the astronauts in the space are doing a great job for the mankind syed mateen , karachi , pakistan i have witnessed the launching of space shuttle discovery on television screen .
nasa 's team on the ground and the astronauts in the space are doing a great job for the mankind , as their experiences in the space will benefit the entire world .
i pray for the safe return of the astronauts and happy landing of the space shuttle .
as a human being , i am equally concerned about the debris which has fallen at the time of its blast , but hope that the space shuttle will not face the same problem as it did in the past .
the safe return of discovery will boost the moral of nasa 's team , who had worked day and night to make the space shuttle 's mission possible .
syed mateen , karachi , pakistan any country with ambitions to have manned missions to space would be more than happy to have a craft as good as the space shuttle .
if there is a cheaper way to break away from earth than i am all for it but i am not sure how much safer it will be .
exploration has always been a dangerous business .
erik , ft .
collins , u.s.a. manned space flight is a dangerous and expensive anachronism .
look at the success of hubble , the mars rovers and the cassini / huygens mission .
you can do 10 times as much real science for half the cost and no risk to life by concentrating on unmanned space exploration .
and tell me , were n't the pictures of titan far more exciting than anything the crew of the shuttle are likely to get up to ?
max , abu dhabi , uae i read some of the comments here with disbelief .
yes , we all know that there are problems in some areas of the world , it does n't however mean that everything has to stop because of that .
i can think of a lot more things which are more of a waste than space exploration .
i 'll bet half the people complaining about nasa being wasteful drive gas guzzlers and do n't bother to recycle .
the shuttle mission is vital to all areas of science and i 'm glad it is flying again .
the space shuttle is not an old machine ; discovery has only flown 30 times before .
most commercial airlines fly that often in a week !
dave , slough , uk many congratulations to nasa .
as a teacher i teach children who are fascinated by space .
it is good that the space missions continue .
it allows children to hope and dream that they might reach the stars themselves , one day !
michelle , birmingham we all know that it costs millions of dollars to support the space program .
one could argue that money could be better spent elsewhere .
the fact is we as human beings need to understand in order to learn new technologies and space exploration is just one of many things that need to be understood and conquered .
there will always be many arguments for and against the space program .
all i can say right now is well done to nasa and my best wishes for a truly successful return to space flight for discovery .
andrew howlett , cape town , south africa good luck and a safe landings to the crew of the discovery .
there are some here that would have the usa quit funding the space program until all the worlds ' problems are solved .
will you tell your children to wait for that day before pursuing their dreams ?
michael rosenbaum , san francisco , usa a plane crash or 9/11 does not stop air travel , so why should the columbia 2003 disaster stop space exploration ?
i 'm sure discovery will make it back safe and the astronauts will be given a well-deserved pat on the back .
jack , london / memphis the shuttle might be old but it still works , and has done the world a huge service towards on earth and in space exploration .
those who complain are clearly members of the flat earth society , and yet i bet they use technology every day ?
someone has to push the envelope .
go nasa go !
phil w , uk good launch .
let 's just hope she comes back in one piece .
ricardo , brazil the shuttles are aged dinosaurs that need to be " moth balled " before more lives are lost due to fragmenting styrofoam .
perhaps we should all consider shifting funding away from nasa and put it towards alternative fuel sources .
it would be revenue better spent .
kurt stuchell , cambridge , usa scuttle the shuttle gordon , auckland nz scuttle the shuttle !
obsolete equipment supplying a pointless lab .
much fanfare about increasing aid to africa by $ 25b but us military budget $ 400b makes you ill !
gordon , auckland nz i can not stand the mentality of myopic people who would rather we abandon the natural impulse to explore our surroundings , and instead focus on futile efforts to tackle every mundane earthbound problem .
surely , the sight of the shuttle blasting off into orbit is the most poignant statement of mankind 's destiny .
kevin , charlotte , north carolina , usa with so much bad news in the media : terrorism , war , poverty ... it 's wonderful to see what we as human beings can achieve , when we put our minds to something positive .
we have the potential to achieve great things .
the crew of this shuttle mission are from different countries , cultures and backgrounds ; proof that if we work together , we can produce something that makes us all proud .
charlie , newcastle , uk to all those who claim the space programme has helped advance medicine and technology . think how much further along in those fields we could be if all the money wasted at nasa went into development . let alone feeding the poor .
shameful waste of resources .
i do n't want my tax dollar to be spent this way .
p. o 'donnell , rotorua , n.z. there are always small-minded people who are terrified of exploration digby knight , henley-on-thames , uk there are always small-minded people who are terrified of exploration .
if we had their way , we 'd still be living in trees afraid of the dangerous savannah !
thankfully we 've always had a few who have done their best to pioneer new territories and worlds .
digby knight , henley-on-thames , uk i would argue that nasa is somewhat of an anachronism .
the " glory days " of the space race with russia are over .
instead , space exploration should be run by the national science foundation .
there , private and public money can be better organized to fund missions .
the nsf already runs most of the science stations here on earth .
why should space be any different ?
greg , alexandria , va space exploration * is * a waste of money .
had the billions been invested directly in more down-to-earth technologies , we would have seen the same spin-offs in medicine , it , and transport .
anonymous i ca n't believe the childish reactions to space exploration from folks like mike and anon , uk .
grow up , guys .
space exploration represents humanity at its most amazing .
you 're obviously just bitter because the us is leading the way .
typical .
shawn , washington , dc , usa exploration , of all kinds , has always helped man push the boundaries of technology .
the space programme is no different .
for this reason alone it is invaluable .
jason , detroit , usa despite all the delays and expert checks , something still fell off it on take off dan , yateley , uk looking at the shuttle i am always reminded of those creaking old 50 's and 60 's airliners you still see rattling around developing countries .
good in their day , but now so ropey and tired that they just scream " death trap " .
it says it all about the shuttle that despite all the delays and expert checks , something still fell off it on take off .
it 's high time this heap was scrapped , and a replacement worthy of the 21st century was introduced in its place .
dan , yateley , uk so the new ufos are unidentified falling objects ?
phil jones , frangy , france if you watch the film of the launch the piece of debris that falls off after the booster rocket drops off does not come from the shuttle it comes from the giant fuel tank , which is ' disposable ' anyway .
john nichols , brackley , nnorthants , uk how would brits feel if americans were talking about how britain should spend its money ?
michelle , raleigh , nc i think that nasa is still too hurried in launching the shuttle when the debris problem still exists .
maybe they should solve out the problem wholly before doing any thing else .
but the fact still shows that nasa has succeeded in launching the shuttle into space .
maybe that 's an incredible luck , although we still do n't know about the return of it .
but i believe it will succeed , too .
god 's will give luck to the crew .
nguyen hoang giang , hanoi , vietnam i just pray she makes it back down ok seun , london uk it was an excellent feeling seeing discovery go like that yesterday .
i am really happy for nasa and i just pray she makes it back down ok , that will be the icing on the cake .
seun , london uk oh dear !
the usa are off again trying to show how they can spend billions on space exploration , meanwhile trying to flex its muscles all around the world causing chaos- unbelievable !
mike , uk mankind is not content with polluting the earth !
it now wants to pollute space as well !
how sad !
millions starve while the usa burns dollars - what for ?
it truly is a sick world we live in these days !
anon , uk to anon , uk - the fuel is clean and non polluting - just water produced .
and as for waste of money - tell me about the dome and the london olympics .
longer term , i know what is more valuable !
george , chelmsford i 'm so glad to see the space programme resume shuttle launches .
space research is costly , but it 's like buying a lottery ticket - you never know what you 're going to get back from it , but once you go out there , there 's a chance you might win big .
and we already have - people have cited the benefits that have come from the space programme .
here 's to more exploration outside our atmosphere !
tony , london , uk i felt privileged to have been in florida for the launch .
it went off on time and from what i gather from reports , was perfect .
it 's something to tell the grandkids one day .
marylyn , london space travel fires the imagination !
tim goodchild , surrey space travel fires the imagination !
to all those that criticise that the shuttle is old and the fact that its had two failures should perhaps think again the next time they board a 747 on route to their holiday destination .
tim goodchild , surrey absolutely fantastic pictures from discovery , especially when the external fuel tank was detached from the shuttle with the curvature of the earth in the background .
overall great launch , well done nasa .
paul , coventry , uk the american space programme is a great achievement and it is important that it continues .
the human race is capable of great things and it is not in our nature to keep still .
terry , crewe , cheshire my gosh !
the people saying the space program is a waste of money ? !
the commercial products used now as a result of nasa are staggering .
cat scans , dialysis machines , materials in your athletic shoes , water purification technology , cordless power tools , cool suits for firefighters , physical therapy equipment .
the list goes on .
the program is invaluable !
eric , usa i think its well worth the effort and money to sustain humans in space carl lennon , northampton , uk most of the people on here with negative comments do not realise how much space has done for humanity .
many medical experiments have been conducted in space which was the only place that it could be done .
the results of these experiments have saved thousands if not millions of lives .
i think its well worth the effort and money to sustain humans in space .
carl lennon , northampton , uk although america has proven itself to be the world 's best engineers , nasa is living on past glory .
many of its best scientists and engineers have left , it is no longer in the public limelight unless it has a disaster , and it is grossly underfunded .
america should reinvigorate the program with major new investment and ambitious new goals or shut it down .
as the eu space agency has recently learned , you ca n't explore space on the cheap .
this old technology and this antiquated worn out hardware needs to be retired along with the mediocre management which has taken over .
mark , usa what a novel way to distract your nation from the real problems at home and abroad .
the cost does n't matter since the nation is paying the bill .
ed , canada there are those who say space exploration is a waste of money .
on the contrary , space travel forces society to stretch and reach further in order to solve highly complex problems associated with putting man into space .
the solutions to these problems are broad and serve mankind in many ways .
the space program enables us to move forward faster than we otherwise would .
without such large goals our advancement slows and we become lazy .
david , philadelphia , usa come on people , of course sending people into space is dangerous and expensive .
that does n't mean we should n't do it though .
even if space exploration did not lead to technical advances and practical application , it would still be worth it .
why ?
because it 's cool .
we put a man on the moon , that 's pretty impressive considering just prior to wwi a man could only travel as far as a horse could take him .
stu , st paul , usa the view from the fuel tank at over 14000mph was fantastic !
rod aries , glasgow the view from the fuel tank at over 14000mph was fantastic !
why are n't other space agencies doing this for the public ?
engage us !
rod aries , glasgow every time i see a rocket launch i think that newton made it possible ; his equations are still used to calculate the orbit .
how many other things in use today were invented over 300 years ago ?
vic , uk a sense of pride mixed with concern .
i live near the johnson space center and have relatives that have worked in the program as far back as gemini and apollo .
the space program is much more than a news story to us .
to those who think the space program is a waste of money : there is so much innovation and research that goes on behind the scenes that you 'd change your opinion if you took the time to look at what nasa has accomplished over the years and continues to accomplish today .
paul , houston , tx well , i 'm relieved it 's up there .
but they still seem to have this gung-ho attitude to safety .
i could n't believe that after killing two crews they are still happy to launch with a known serious fault .
chris hann , bay area , ca , usa congratulations to nasa on a successful launch .
i 'm glad to see that some nations still recognise the value of dreaming and aspiring to do great things and inspire their young people .
the money spent of spaceflight is miniscule compared to the many benefits .
it 's sad here in the uk that people are so ignorant and short-sighted with regards to space exploration that we ca n't see the good that can from it - and then we wonder the younger generations are n't interested in science , medicine and technology .
victor , birmingham , england this launch showed the world what can be accomplished with great teamwork , ambition and determination d soni , nuneaton , uk i watched the launch and was overcome with pride .
all the people involved in this great feat have overcome extreme obstacles .
this launch showed the world what can be accomplished with great teamwork , ambition and determination .
congratulations discovery !
d soni , nuneaton , uk mankind needs a vision .
interplanetary travel is necessary to achieve that end .
stuart haines , calgary , alberta , canada it 's time to junk the space shuttle and perhaps " rethink " this whole business of manned space flight for the time being .
think about it , other than as a showy display of national pride , what benefits do any nations get at this time from sending humans into space ?
perhaps in the future when we have real goals and reliable " safe " transportation we can start wasting our time and money with such " propaganda flights " , but now is n't the time and place for such foolishness .
charlie , niagara falls new york people always complain that space programs are too expensive , but do people appreciate how much safer the planet is with them ?
we can monitor dangerous weather , asteroids , and send tv , radio , and telephone signals via satellites .
space programs really have helped the planet excel in a positive way , and i 'm glad the discovery is finally continuing what has already been a remarkable feat of engineering .
tim hunt -lrb- 16 -rrb- , plymouth , england in these days darkened by the spectre of global terrorism , we seek hope and strength in many places .
the fog of war and the wind that whispers the question of " why are we fighting in the middle east ? ' diminish our confidence in our government .
today 's launch of the shuttle discovery renews our hope and faith in our abilities to overcome tragedy and defy adversity .
we owe the entire nasa family a debt of gratitude for restoring our faith in the human spirit .
paul telfer , franceville , gabon we need a new way of going to the stars clive , dartford , uk i wish the crew well on the mission , but the shuttle is old and just like any aircraft , it has its life expectancy and this bird has reached it .
we need a new way of going to the stars and to ditch the big firework approach to it .
clive , dartford , uk sure , okay .
maybe the shuttle programme is old .
maybe it should be scrapped for something better .
but , it is all we have at the moment .
and to all of you here who keep telling us to get rid of it , i have n't heard one of you say anything about putting up any money with us to fund a new programme .
jon , atlanta , usa what nasa needs is a real life scotty character to sort these technical issues out .
paul collier , london , uk the truth is that the shuttle concept has proved to be too expensive and technically complex to be the way forward in space .
i am pro-space exploration but the shuttle has slowed this to a crawl , and all the best work has been done by probes boosted by rockets e.g. mars landers , titan probes etc .
andy , uk " space is expensive ! " cry the critics .
i wish they would angle their criticism at a truly scandalous target .
the entire space programme to date has cost less than what the world spends on arms every year .
i know which i think is better value for money .
bernard o. quinn , barcelona , catalonia the exploration of space will continue with us or without us scott westwood , port orchard , wa , usa the shuttle is expensive , outdated and despite nasa 's assurances , its safety is still uncertain ; but it 's the only game in town .
the exploration of space will continue with us or without us ; to sit on the sidelines and watch others go up would be unthinkable for an america that prides itself on being a superpower .
scott westwood , port orchard , wa , usa space exploration is essential for the future of all humans .
flying over the atlantic was at first a risky endeavour and now it is done by millions every year without a thought for the early pioneers and the planes that never arrived .
colin , croydon , uk i do not understand all these people saying that america should scrap the shuttle , and spend it on ' the world ' .
the us is already the single largest contributor of foreign aid .
the us space program has helped everyday life for billions of people around the world , and churned out invention after invention for the world .
bill zimmer , seattle , wa congratulations to all those involved in discovery 's return to space !
to all the naysayers , next time you are browsing the internet on your pc , take a moment to find out what drove the development of semiconductors that power your pc .
yes , the space exploration that you think is a waste of money !
roger , london tears came to my eyes and i held my breath colleen , orlando , fl usa we were in the parking lot facing east , waiting and whispering to each other .
the first person to see the shuttle clearing the trees threw up their hand to point it out and some of the men started yelling , " go , baby , go ! " and cheering .
tears came to my eyes and i held my breath .
the space program has done so much to improve our lives in the fields of health and science , they further our knowledge of our environment and how our magnificent planet works .
colleen , orlando , fl usa go discovery !
the future of humanity is in space .
as an american living abroad , the lift-off of discovery is the first event that makes me proud to be american since leaving my country .
i hope that this success will lead to the completion of the iss and the continued exploration of space .
daniel valenti , canberra , australia people forget that we belong to this planet earth , in that our physical bodies are perfectly adapted to survive only on the earth .
we could never survive on other planets without extensive artificial aids .
as many have already pointed out , there are many , many more pressing needs requiring resolution and funds should be redirected where they are most needed for our survival on our home planet .

the crew on board the space shuttle have conducted inspections of discovery 's belly and repairs to the shuttle have also been carried out .
stephen robinson has begun a unique spacewalk , going under the orbiter 's belly to remove two ceramic strips sticking out between heatshield tiles .
nasa engineers are concerned the strips would cause part of discovery to overheat as it re-enters the earth 's atmosphere .
discovery had been due to return to earth on 7 august , but nasa has decided to extend the mission by an extra day .
what do you think of the mission so far ?
how do you feel about the mission being extended ?
what do you think about the repairs ?

this debate is now closed .
read a selection of your comments below .
click here to read a second page of your comments the following comments reflect the balance of opinion we have received so far : the money that is spent by the american government on space exploration could be much better spent on healthcare and education .
this would be much more beneficial to the american people than discovery 's mission .
carolynne burkholder , vancouver , british columbia i can not believe that the crew had to cobble together a hacksaw norman west , truro , cornwall i can not believe that the crew had to cobble together a hacksaw .
a small box of tools from any diy shop would have done the job .
also removing a gap filler between the tiles exposes a gap .
surely the wind can get in and potentially lift a tile causing a fatal problem .
norman west , truro , cornwall whilst i can see that advances may be made through this work , i saw two items on the news last night - one about children dying because they have n't got a few quid , the other about spending millions on keeping the shuttles going in and out of space .
priority check please .
mark , didcot , england space travel is dangerous , pioneers are going to die , but it is worthwhile .
what is needed now are new spaceships to let us travel between planets .
at the moment all our eggs are in one basket , we need to find other homes on other worlds .
we have made this one nearly uninhabitable .
i would go into space whatever the risk .
ruth , walsall maybe if all the countries stopped being so petty and pooled their resources , we 'd have superior technology and fewer incidents like this .
we do n't need to race against each other anymore to try and prove who 's superior ; instead we should look to a future of co-operation .
gaz , cardiff , uk i will never understand why we waste so much money on primitive space stations john gearing , st. helens , uk i will never understand why we waste so much money on primitive space stations and shuttles which clearly have no function for the human race at this time .
i do n't know why we do n't get all our experts and fund them in coming up with unmanned technologies and technology in shuttles that could take us to planets not to a tin can in the sky which is over expensive and serves no function to the mass population .
john gearing , st. helens , uk fascinating a brit would ask the question why the us is sending people into space .
as the brit , george mallory said in 1924 , " because its there " .
mt everest killed mallory and we remember him for his quest .
in a similar quest , the us will continue to go into space - because its there .
john b , windermere , florida do some of these contributors have no soul ?
what could be more magnificent than seeing human beings taking risks to explore the unknown ; triumphing over the problems they meet along the way ; opening up new horizons for the rest of us ?
yes let 's invest in a new space transportation system , and more manned flights , and unmanned probes and a bigger , better space station .
but to claim that stopping the current flights is sensible shows no faith in the species at all .
stop looking down at the ground and start looking up at the stars .
john r smith , uk please , armchair scientists , let the experts at nasa do their job making the risk calculations .
they 've got the know-how and the tools to make the decisions .
not you or me .
joe , usa this is the most ridiculous expenditure of precious funds in a time of great national travail .
nasa is an anachronism , a patronistic pet rock that has no justification whatsoever , especially in the current environment in which civilized societies are fighting for their mere existence .
the irresponsibility in launching this mission in the face of known deficiencies is appalling .
c. a. la varre , newport , ri usa the media paints such a doom and gloom picture of what is happening above us phil , hampshire , uk why-oh-why does the media take such a negative view to what the men and women on sts114 are doing .
the media paints such a doom and gloom picture of what is happening above us .
we as a united world should watch and praise these people who are up there performing the most fantastic things known to mankind .
yes there is a difficult time coming on returning to earth but the crew at this time seem very positive about it .
may i suggest that you all watch nasa tv on the web for real live happenings .
phil , hampshire , uk nasa is undergoing drastic changes .
i think the us should pause and take stock of what 's happening to their space missions .
give it a break , sort out problems and return 10years later .
i wonder how the us ever landed man on the moon ?
did they really ?
i wonder !
errol , dubai , uae space flight is still in its infancy .
so the fact that an astronaut was able to make a repair to the shuttle in space is a great triumph .
nasa should look on this feat in a positive light , not a negative one .
we know in the days of sailing ships as they travelled the globe to discover new lands , there were many times when sailors had to climb up masts in storms to make repairs , so is repairing space craft in flight any different ?
leon aarons , petach israel another piece of space theatre , justifying manned flight .
unmanned craft can put payloads into orbit much more cheaply , as well as exploring other planets .
martin , dubai , uae i 've just seen a picture of the tool , held together with strong tape that the astronauts used .
it 's great to imagine that a billion-dollar aircraft can be saved by a bit of strong tape and some elbow grease !
it 's that sort of thinking that 's saved astronauts in the past .
good luck to them , hope humans carry on going into space for many more years .
dave , manchester , uk this spacewalk and repair demonstrates two things .
firstly , the courage and initiative of the astronauts , secondly , the importance of retiring the ageing shuttle fleet and building a modern spacecraft .
electronics and materials technology have advanced tremendously in the past 30 years , but the shuttle is still using outdated technology .
gordon mcstraun , uk so , the offending piece if gap filler from between a couple of heat shields .
i 'm no nasa expert , but does n't this mean that the is now a gap between these tiles ?
michael , bucks , uk the astronauts are all volunteers , they know the risks involved , and that is why i praise and thank them kirsty , cambridge , uk i think it is fantastic that discovery has launched and its mission is going well .
a lesson has been learnt from colombia , and indeed , challenger .
the astronauts are all volunteers , they know the risks involved , and that is why i praise and thank them .
they are incredible people .
kirsty , cambridge , uk so what if the filler problem has to be fixed with a jerry-rigged hacksaw ?
this type of ingenuity has been saving lives since the age of tall ships and can only reflect well on the tenacity of the nasa engineers and astronauts .
remember when the progress hit mir ?
apollo 13 ?
we need the experience of these problems to give us the know-how to survive in space and give us the confidence in our ability to solve problems on longer , bolder voyages .
tim parker , edinburgh , scotland i work with remote operated vehicles in the oil and gas industry .
i am amazed that the crew of the discovery need to cobble together a makeshift hacksaw to carry out a job on the tiles .
the shuttles are old and things will go wrong so you would expect a decent tool kit to be onboard .
james , paderne , portugal why are the americans still sending people into space ?
if they want to explore they should be thinking of unmanned flights with intelligent technology which can spend decades in space .
this should help the ozone layer repair itself .
more is needed to be done to explore and catalogue this planet and its systems , this will be of more benefit to mankind and our home than space travel .
haz , nottingham , uk is going up in the shuttle much more dangerous than sailing unknown oceans a few hundred years ago in wooden ships ?
thank goodness that throughout history not everyone has wanted to sit at home in comfort in their own small world .
simon , manchester , uk with so many comings and goings to and from iss , would it not be sensible for just the bare minimum of crew to return in this shuttle and send up a half-empty shuttle to collect the rest of them ?
why take unnecessary risks ?
fraser irving , sheffield , uk until now , the shuttle missions have been routine , like taking a walk in the park .
but the reality of danger with the loss of two shuttles has almost brought the space program to its knees .
should it continue ?
of course it must go on because too much is at stake .
closing the space station , and not looking into space is the worst we can do .
life on earth is becoming dangerous .
we must look to the stars if humanity is to survive .
walter , chapel hill , nc i think - and hope - this flight is one of the safest ever .
my guess is the problems have appeared simply because they have been looking for them far more carefully than before .
however , there 's no doubt a replacement spacecraft is needed .
the private " space ship one " has a slow re-entry , avoiding thermal problems .
is this possible from orbit ?
and a separate , unmanned cargo vehicle seems a " no-brainer " .
simon , bristol it must be frightening for the astronauts but the space programme must prevail anya , london pioneers always take risks so that everyone else can eventually follow .
it must be frightening for the astronauts but the space programme must prevail .
updated technology is definitely needed .
unmanned missions are a good idea , but ultimately there is no substitute for human actions and reactions .
anya , london interesting to note that the two shuttle losses have not been due to design or engineering flaws in the shuttle themselves , but rather the propulsion system .
for 30 year old vehicles , i think the shuttles are doing pretty well , and i am sure they will continue for a long time .
matt , bristol space exploration is dangerous and the crew knows this better than any of us - and they still volunteered for it .
my view is that we need to continue to explore space and the shuttle repair should be seen as an experience that needs to be faced at some time .
let 's not be weak about this .
george , chelmsford what nasa has done is simply awesome .
nasa is the adventurer of our era , looking at and investigating things that are far bigger than us .
i say ground the space shuttles , but do not skimp on quickly building bigger , better , and safer spacecraft to replace them .
sk , ithaca , ny space technology is too integrated in our daily lives now peter byrd , worcester the few people who mock space projects should not use anything connected with space technology as a protest !
i bet hardly anyone would manage it or really want to .
space technology is too integrated in our daily lives now ; we all enjoy the advantages we get from it .
nasa tv via the net alone shows me how wonderful space is .
peter byrd , worcester i have just returned from florida where i was privileged enough to witness the breathtaking launch first hand .
it seems as though there are increasing difficulties using these shuttles .
are the lives of 7 astronauts each time it takes off a risk that is worth taking ?
matt , london given the loss of columbia and the uncertainty of this mission , nasa should scrap the shuttle programme .
luck prevented previous disasters and it would appear nasa 's luck has run out .
what makes them feel confident that they can repair in space what they failed to repair in two years on the ground ?
my thoughts are with the families of those on the iss .
phil , bracknell , uk the problems with discovery must have been encountered with all the previous shuttle flights .
it appears that each time it took off , it was russian roulette as to whether it would return safely .
this program should be abandoned until a new and safer means of transporting the shuttle into space can be developed .
chris , brazil will the resulting depression between the tiles create a possibility of a chink in the armour ?
k chowksey , bangalore , india even if the pieces sticking out are pulled or hacked , will the resulting depression between the tiles create a possibility of a chink in the armour ?
even a depression can alter the aerodynamic behaviour -lrb- as in golf balls -rrb- .
this will create uneven heat distribution .
k chowksey , bangalore , india from the idealists point of view we really should not be thinking about costs here .
space exploration is vital , not only to our technological development as a species , but also in terms of our wider understanding of the universe .
the whole nasa infrastructure is quite frankly awesome .
every endeavour has its risks and we 've seen the tragic consequences of those risks with the previous accidents .
chris , bracknell we need to explore space ; when you go to hospital and have a cat scan or an mri , that technology has come from the space program .
there is nothing wrong with the shuttle - the problem is with the way it is maintained .
they need to do better , i do n't know why do n't they paint it again , and seal the foam .
carol , pa , usa the saddest thing for me about this mission is that the next time the iss is visible from england on august 11th , the shuttle will have already left .
hopefully we 'll get to see the shuttle during the next mission .
after the moon , the iss is the brightest object in the night sky .
john airey , peterborough i looked at the images of the underside of the shuttle and thought that it looked like really bad bathroom tiling rob , spain major advances need to be made to the whole concept of effective re-entry heat-shield technology .
even before lift-off , i looked at the images of the underside of the shuttle and thought that it looked like really bad bathroom tiling .
initially , i expected it to be a smooth , seamless surface , but it was a patchwork of light and dark areas with patches that looked more raised than others .
i assume that tiles are the best option at the moment , but in future this issue needs to be solved completely .
rob , spain if nasa has decided to just rip out the relatively small strips protruding from between the heat shield tiles , then why ca n't they ask astronaut steve robinson to take his experimental repair kit out with him and fill the gaps with the mastic gum that they used to ' fix ' the tiles in their earlier experiments ?
paul greer , gothenburg , sweden i worked as an engineer on skylab in the 70s and i consider this nasa debacle a disgrace .
unknown risk is one thing , but gambling with lives on known problems with solutions is unacceptable .
i say : bring some crew home in russian capsule , leave the rest of the crew up there , fix the foam on atlantis -lrb- and everything else possible -rrb- and then send a rescue mission .
then ground the antiques and use modern technology to build new spacecraft .
rich dusek , orchard lake , mi , us bruce from huntsville says it 's not a trivial engineering problem and he 's probably right .
but that does n't alter the documented fact that nasa has sent people into space against the advice of contractors who have told them that certain aspects are n't safe .
if shuttles are prone to bits falling off then they should n't be flying .
david , chelmsford uk nasa do n't build all the parts and therefore an outside company may be partly responsible james , uk why do people expect space travel to be perfectly safe ?
look at any picture of launch and remember the orange tank is full of fuel and both white rockets once started ca n't be stopped .
man in space is an essential part of our future .
the earth can not sustain us forever particularly its natural resources .
i also think people should recognise that nasa do n't build all the parts and therefore an outside company may be partly responsible .
james , uk the problems with the space transportation system are a classic example of what happens when whole-life costs are not taken into account during early design phases of the system .
congress chose to buy shuttle on the cheap , opting for solid fuel boosters and a disposable fuel tank instead of spending extra money upfront to design a fully-reusable fly-back first stage to take the orbiter into space .
the result has been far higher operating costs and , tragically , the loss of fourteen astronauts .
will it be too much to hope that senior agency managers and politicians will learn these lessons in defining our future access to space ?
in europe as well as the usa .
phil , bath , uk so far this particular mission has been very worrying for relatives of the discovery crew .
any venture into space is a risk , but this one seems to have gone ahead knowing this risk factor was much higher than usual .
why are these missions so important ?
the risk factor is too great to risk innocent lives .
stop them now .
jose a holmes , loughborough , england i wish the crew a safe return but am sorry to see resources wasted on a manned flight with little real value for essentially political and pr reasons while much more scientifically valuable unmanned work is scaled back to pay for it .
this is all about the advancement of the usa , not science .
julian , london , uk the debris issue has been present in the shuttle programme from day one .
the tiles themselves are so fragile you can break them with one hand .
the space shuttle is a wonderful vehicle , but sadly owing to it 's bizarre design , is inherently dangerous and needs to be replaced soon .
as richard feynman said after the challenger disaster , " for a successful technology , reality must take precedence over public relations , for nature can not be fooled . "
chris dyer , bristol , england the immediate future of the space program will be best served by robot missions dr malcolm fairbairn , uk / sweden i , like most people connected with astrophysics , think that the immediate future of the space program will be best served by robot missions for at least the next twenty years .
it 's not taking a step backwards ; it 's about developing and testing new technologies which will eventually be applied to human spaceflight .
for the same amount of money you get much more science done with robotic missions because you do n't have to worry about the fragile humans .
dr malcolm fairbairn , uk / sweden as an aerospace engineer , in this particular instance i am not worried about discovery .
all indications are that the debris did no damage .
long term , though , it could be a problem .
the space shuttle has never fulfilled the promises that were made for it .
it is an expensive vehicle of very limited utility .
it consumes resources which could be better used elsewhere in the us space program .
andrew ogilvie , modesto , california , usa robert heinlein said it : " the earth is too small and fragile a basket for humanity to keep all its eggs in . "
the only safe place to be when disaster comes -lrb- an asteroid for example -rrb- is somewhere else .
well done , discovery .
keep it up .
john fielder , workington , uk there are a lot of negative comments on here by people who really have not done their research .
there are so many inventions that have come to be due to space travel most are indirect , technology passed to the public after it has been created to aid nasa and the like in various projects .
adam ransom , birmingham space flight is one of the things that most excites me jehuda arieh veenman , haifa , israel space flight is one of the things that most excites me .
it breaks my heart that foam broke off the insulation again .
apparently , the design has a basic flaw ; the vulnerable heat shield is exposed to a bombardment of debris falling of during take off .
in the more old fashioned designs , the heat shields were protected during take off .
jehuda arieh veenman , haifa , israel it seems to me that the logical fix for the launch system would be to mount the shuttle higher relative to the fuel tank .
the coldness of the fuel is always going to be a problem in causing freezing of water and air in and around the foam insulation .
since that is the nature of the beast , get the shuttle out of harms way above the possible falling debris nigel dandridge-perry , los angeles ca , usa good luck discovery , i look forward to seeing a safe flight back to earth .
mark , dorset there is no progress with manned missions .
it 's more of the same .
while unmanned missions are discovering lakes of water on mars , landing on distant moons and exploring planets , the manned missions are trying to work out how to stop foam falling off the fuel tank .
leave floating around in orbit to the chinese and get exploring .
matt , amsterdam , the netherlands -lrb- ex .
uk -rrb- the shuttle programme shows the greatness the human race can achieve when we focus d ward , portsmouth those who fly orbiters know the risks and accept the challenge .
the shuttle programme shows the greatness the human race can achieve when we focus .
a commitment should be made to give it whatever financial support it needs to continue .
nasa tv shows discovery 's latest mission is gripping .
we owe it to those astronauts who have lost their lives in space exploration , to carry on the work that they could n't finish .
d ward , portsmouth i have become addicted to nasa tv over the last few days , and find myself staring into space , thinking of discovery up there somewhere ... looking back on our little planet from a distance .
i am surely concerned about the debris ; remember nasa did not think this would be a problem for the ill-fated columbia crew either .
they have spent two years and thousands of dollars on this problem - so yes , i think we should be concerned , not only about the debris ' implications , but also that nasa got it wrong again .
verity worthington , bewdley , worcestershire hundreds of years ago people were afraid that they could sail off the edges of the earth .
thank heavens there were brave sailors then willing to push the limits of courage and technology , and thank heavens we still have them today .
i 'm also grateful that there are still those willing to fund such expeditions .
rob g. , kansas city , usa the disaster 2 years ago , and these recent problems with the shuttle show that nasa really need to get on with developing the next generation of re-useable shuttles .
technology has moved on so much in the nearly 30 years since it was developed with computer technology and new lightweight materials .
if they do n't , then the private space firms will take over , while nasa keeps flogging a dead horse .
tane piper , edinburgh , uk we are all with you , looking forward for success .
god be with you .
no surrender no retreat .
martin madulu , moshi - tanzania i am more worried about the apparent loss of a tile than the foam .
if any of the tiles were damaged , the mission is in jeopardy .
after the columbia disaster , i read an article published in 1980 calling the shuttles ' death traps ' .
considering that we 've already lost half the fleet , i think it is high time nasa invested in a different , more robust technology .
istvan , detroit , usa the safety of the crew should be of utmost importance , not launch schedules ss , usa my family and i were vacationing in florida at the time of the launch .
we saw it speeding skyward from the car on our way back home .
i am an aerospace design engineer specializing in flight dynamics .
my concern really lies with the inadequacy with which nasa has dealt with the foam / tile problem .
the safety of the crew should be of utmost importance , not launch schedules .
ss , usa only those at nasa who have looked at the images of debris falling will have the best idea .
the crew 's safe return is just our concern but it 's their mission .
venkat maruthamuthu , urbana , il , usa why was this problem not resolved after columbia two years ago ?
it is very wrong to send yet more people up there without being absolutely sure that it 's safe .
perhaps space travel should wait until we have progressed far enough that we are not relying on tiles that can just fall off ?
catherine , cheshunt , herts great to see the shuttle soar again .
our future lies not on earth but out there somewhere .
no matter how you argue it , in the future this planet will die and so will all those life forms still on it .
if the human species is to survive , then it must do so elsewhere and this sort of technology is the first step towards that ultimate goal .
ian jordan , wokingham the foam formulation was changed in 1996 ... most of the foam issues started after this change bruce g , huntsville , usa this is not a trivial engineering problem as some have implied .
there are two types of foam : a lightweight foam covering the large areas of the tank and a dense ablator foam covering areas exposed to aerodynamic heating .
the foam is exposed to supersonic airflow at about 27000 km / h -lrb- 17000 mph -rrb- during launch .
there are shock cones coming from the orbiter , the connecting struts and solid boosters which impinge on the tank .
there is also a lot of vibration .
the foam formulation was changed in 1996 to comply with the montreal protocol and eliminate the freon propellant .
most of the foam issues started after this change and may or may not be associated with it .
the shuttle is due to be retired in 2010 and solving this problem is important for future spacecraft design .
bruce g , huntsville , usa why ca n't the return module be encased within the main take off rocket ?
this would prevent bits flying off from damaging it .
tony lee , telford we were on vacation in orlando , and had tickets for the astronaut hall of fame to watch the original scheduled lift-off on 13 july .
we had such a good view , but with about an hour or so to go , the launch was cancelled .
we were gutted to have missed such a spectacular sight !
we watched it on television back here in ireland , but felt we had a special bond with sts 114 - return to flight .
we just hope now for the safe return of the shuttle and its crew on 7 august .
good luck to them .
hutch family , ireland one day when someone is sipping cocktails on saturn 's lunar resort , whilst looking back at the earth and the distant sun , they 'll thank these brave people for risking their lives .
let 's keep our nerve , and not look back .
chris phillips , chelmsford , essex it is an inherent part of our nature to explore caroline , edinburgh , uk i used to work at one of the nasa centres -lrb- in maryland -rrb- and i hope that space exploration continues .
as a scientist it is an inherent part of our nature to explore , discover and find out about the unknown .
i was overjoyed to see the launch of discovery and hope , beyond all hope , that they make it safely home .
as nasa have said - " exploring space is not for the faint hearted ' - it 's a huge undertaking " .
the astronauts know that , we all know that .
these are very brave people and i wish them , and nasa , well with their endeavours .
caroline , edinburgh , uk watching this made me feel giddy .
now hopefully we can complete the iss and get on with the business of colonising space .
the spirit of adventure lives on with discovery and her crew .
david mills , ballymena , uk we were very privileged to be able to see discovery launch when it flew mission 105 and the impression it left us with was ' it was amazing to see ' .
we believe that the crew and the engineers will be able to work together and face the challenge of bringing back this magnificent ship .
instead of shrinking from the challenge we should rise up to it just as they did in 1970 for apollo 13 , it is only by stretching our knowledge such as in times of emergencies that we reach beyond our capabilities .
good luck and best wishes to the crew and engineers .
julie and robert , manchester , england i would like to see the shuttle retired and replaced with a newer fleet scott , edinburgh congratulations to nasa on another successful launch .
however , i would like to see the shuttle retired and replaced with a newer and more capable fleet of vehicles .
not only will it be safer and hugely beneficial to space exploration , the project would provide thousands of jobs , contracts to companies and benefit the global economy .
scott , edinburgh people seem to forget that manned space travel is still very dangerous and those brave astronauts know the risks .
foam has been falling off fuel tanks for nearly 25 years now .
perhaps money should now be invested in developing better glue and a more efficient reusable manned space travel system .
john ellis , nottingham statistically , if commercial flights carried the same risks as spaceflight , there would be about 500 airliner crashes per day .
one therefore has to applaud the courage and determination of those people who accept this degree of risk in pursuit of our quest for knowledge .
we are an inquisitive species , in this case pushing the boundaries of what is possible .
i wish those seven brave souls a safe return .
bob , cheshire i 've been following the ' space race ' since sputnik and the mercury missions , and i ca n't think of anything more exciting than a successful launch .
but why do n't we stop racing against each other and form stronger international collaborations to make space travel safer ?
j forman , los angeles , usa if nasa says the shuttle is safe to fly , it 's safe to fly james , los angeles , usa it amazes me how many observers believe they are more of an expert on shuttle safety and capability than the engineers at nasa .
the fact is , the men and women who work at nasa are at the top of their field .
if they say the shuttle is safe to fly , it 's safe to fly .
james , los angeles , usa it was a beautiful launch .
the space shuttle program has been remarkably successful despite the previous disaster .
nobody can engineer absolute perfection , but this was very close .
h neil , south texas , usa i am very concerned about the damaged tiles on discovery , especially in light of nasa 's apparent slowness in acknowledging that the take-off incident with columbia caused the disaster upon return .
there is an option for the crew of discovery - to wait on the space station for rescue .
how can we even contemplate risking their lives ?
if the problem is serious enough to ground the fleet , discovery too should be ' grounded ' immediately .
sharon , dallas , texas i once saw a presentation on how the challenger disaster came to happen and how it could have been prevented and it made my blood run cold .
suffice it to say , i have nothing but the most profound admiration for the courage of the crews of the shuttle .
i 'm not a religious man , but i just hope to god they all get back safely .
steve , chesham tragic as the columbia accident was , the astronauts died doing what they loved - exploring space , a privilege only the select few get to do .
they also died at the end of their trip so they got to enjoy being in space , unlike the challenger crew .
before the columbia accident , i would expect that the shuttles got through intact in much worse condition than discovery .
i am not that concerned , although i will follow the investigations with great interest .
ian , london it seems ridiculous that it is being jeopardised by something so simple chris , brazil the shuttle has been up and down into space about 50 times before the columbia incident .
i can not believe that bits of foam from the fuel tank did n't come off during these trips .
are n't nasa being a bit super cautious about this problem ?
ca n't they encase the fuel tank in some sort of wire mesh in order to prevent the foam from breaking off ?
in such a high tech programme , it seems ridiculous that it is being jeopardised by something so simple .
chris , brazil what exactly are they doing out there that they have not had the chance to do before ?
first of all get a new ship and then go somewhere else than the moon !
that impressed my grand father , it will take more to impress me !
mathieu , gatineau , canada bits of foam have probably been falling off the shuttle since the first launch , but it 's only since a piece of that debris caused the destruction of columbia two years ago that anyone has noticed !
only now we have cameras watching every single part of the craft do we see what may well have been happening all along .
carry on as normal .
simon , peterborough , uk i remember watching the first ever shuttle flight as a kid .
i watched the launch the other day and got the exact same feelings of awe and excitement .
the shuttle launch is a wake up call to everyone .
sure the world has problems right now but despite those problems , look what we 're capable of !
my message to nasa , the esa and all the other agencies ?
keep going people .
take us there !
andrew k jones , wrexham , uk i watched the launch live on the internet and was overwhelmed .
we wo n't know of the mission 's success until 7 aug , but what surprises me is the us way of making everything big and the huge overhead costs .
it 's all show and little substance .
after having spent $ 1 billion and 2.5 years on the debris falling cause , they are back to square one and the shuttles are grounded again !
on the other hand the russians are making safe manned space missions with pinpoint accuracy every 3-6 months at a fraction of the cost .
rakesh , london uk without space exploration we would not have computers , hi-technology materials etc jim kirk , basildon i read once that spending on cosmetics in the usa dwarfs the nasa budget .
let 's get things in perspective .
without space exploration we would not have computers , hi-technology materials etc , all of which were a by-product .
if more is learned about our planet and its self-destructive population on each mission then we should keep it going .
come home safe guys !
jim kirk , basildon does anyone know why debris falls off a multi-million dollar spacecraft ?
ca n't some sort of outer layer be put around the fuel tank insulation to stop it disintegrating ?
i 'm not an engineer - i need someone else to explain it !
robert , sussex rather than risking the crew and the shuttle , if it is damaged , why do n't they leave it up there as service vehicle and bring the crew back in another shuttle at a later date ?
if nasa wants to survive they need to start making people believe in them again .
good luck discovery !
paul , london the space shuttle was under funded during its design and construction and the compromises mean it will never achieve its true potential .
the sooner it can be replaced with something newer and simpler the better .
david patrick , reading trying to make space exploration 100 % safe is just nonsense .
duncan , nottingham my heart sank when i heard the news that tiles had once again fallen off the space shuttle roger campbell , england my heart sank when i heard the news that tiles had once again fallen off the space shuttle .
if the cause of the tiles falling off is simply the vibration and air flow , then i wonder what will be the effect of the searing heat of re-entry .
roger campbell , england having watched the space shuttle launch on tv , it is good to see such a majestic craft finally back to what she was meant to do .
well done nasa for getting the space shuttle flying .
james , nottingham no-one made that big a deal when tiles were missing from the oms pods after columbia 's maiden flight in 1981 .
when designing this vehicle they must have made a risk assessment to determine safety parameters , and unfortunately the loss of columbia has made them refine these parameters further .
tim parker , edinburgh we watched the launch from our beach , about 90 miles away .
it was spectacular .
there are many more cameras watching the exterior shuttle craft than ever before which have alerted to the problems .
the engineers working for nasa are tireless and will get the current crew back safely one way or another .
the space programme will continue .
the only unknown is manned flights .
the mars rovers are still sending pictures and information long past when they were suppose to .
nasa will continue on and i believe has more government funding this year , or is due for an increase .
private companies are currently working on safe space travel for human passengers in the us and abroad i believe .
joan york , daytona beach , florida usa nasa 's team on the ground and the astronauts in the space are doing a great job for the mankind syed mateen , karachi , pakistan i have witnessed the launching of space shuttle discovery on television screen .
nasa 's team on the ground and the astronauts in the space are doing a great job for the mankind , as their experiences in the space will benefit the entire world .
i pray for the safe return of the astronauts and happy landing of the space shuttle .
as a human being , i am equally concerned about the debris which has fallen at the time of its blast , but hope that the space shuttle will not face the same problem as it did in the past .
the safe return of discovery will boost the moral of nasa 's team , who had worked day and night to make the space shuttle 's mission possible .
syed mateen , karachi , pakistan any country with ambitions to have manned missions to space would be more than happy to have a craft as good as the space shuttle .
if there is a cheaper way to break away from earth than i am all for it but i am not sure how much safer it will be .
exploration has always been a dangerous business .
erik , ft .
collins , u.s.a. manned space flight is a dangerous and expensive anachronism .
look at the success of hubble , the mars rovers and the cassini / huygens mission .
you can do 10 times as much real science for half the cost and no risk to life by concentrating on unmanned space exploration .
and tell me , were n't the pictures of titan far more exciting than anything the crew of the shuttle are likely to get up to ?
max , abu dhabi , uae i read some of the comments here with disbelief .
yes , we all know that there are problems in some areas of the world , it does n't however mean that everything has to stop because of that .
i can think of a lot more things which are more of a waste than space exploration .
i 'll bet half the people complaining about nasa being wasteful drive gas guzzlers and do n't bother to recycle .
the shuttle mission is vital to all areas of science and i 'm glad it is flying again .
the space shuttle is not an old machine ; discovery has only flown 30 times before .
most commercial airlines fly that often in a week !
dave , slough , uk many congratulations to nasa .
as a teacher i teach children who are fascinated by space .
it is good that the space missions continue .
it allows children to hope and dream that they might reach the stars themselves , one day !
michelle , birmingham we all know that it costs millions of dollars to support the space program .
one could argue that money could be better spent elsewhere .
the fact is we as human beings need to understand in order to learn new technologies and space exploration is just one of many things that need to be understood and conquered .
there will always be many arguments for and against the space program .
all i can say right now is well done to nasa and my best wishes for a truly successful return to space flight for discovery .
andrew howlett , cape town , south africa good luck and a safe landings to the crew of the discovery .
there are some here that would have the usa quit funding the space program until all the worlds ' problems are solved .
will you tell your children to wait for that day before pursuing their dreams ?
michael rosenbaum , san francisco , usa a plane crash or 9/11 does not stop air travel , so why should the columbia 2003 disaster stop space exploration ?
i 'm sure discovery will make it back safe and the astronauts will be given a well-deserved pat on the back .
jack , london / memphis the shuttle might be old but it still works , and has done the world a huge service towards on earth and in space exploration .
those who complain are clearly members of the flat earth society , and yet i bet they use technology every day ?
someone has to push the envelope .
go nasa go !
phil w , uk good launch .
let 's just hope she comes back in one piece .
ricardo , brazil the shuttles are aged dinosaurs that need to be " moth balled " before more lives are lost due to fragmenting styrofoam .
perhaps we should all consider shifting funding away from nasa and put it towards alternative fuel sources .
it would be revenue better spent .
kurt stuchell , cambridge , usa scuttle the shuttle gordon , auckland nz scuttle the shuttle !
obsolete equipment supplying a pointless lab .
much fanfare about increasing aid to africa by $ 25b but us military budget $ 400b makes you ill !
gordon , auckland nz i can not stand the mentality of myopic people who would rather we abandon the natural impulse to explore our surroundings , and instead focus on futile efforts to tackle every mundane earthbound problem .
surely , the sight of the shuttle blasting off into orbit is the most poignant statement of mankind 's destiny .
kevin , charlotte , north carolina , usa with so much bad news in the media : terrorism , war , poverty ... it 's wonderful to see what we as human beings can achieve , when we put our minds to something positive .
we have the potential to achieve great things .
the crew of this shuttle mission are from different countries , cultures and backgrounds ; proof that if we work together , we can produce something that makes us all proud .
charlie , newcastle , uk to all those who claim the space programme has helped advance medicine and technology . think how much further along in those fields we could be if all the money wasted at nasa went into development . let alone feeding the poor .
shameful waste of resources .
i do n't want my tax dollar to be spent this way .
p. o 'donnell , rotorua , n.z. there are always small-minded people who are terrified of exploration digby knight , henley-on-thames , uk there are always small-minded people who are terrified of exploration .
if we had their way , we 'd still be living in trees afraid of the dangerous savannah !
thankfully we 've always had a few who have done their best to pioneer new territories and worlds .
digby knight , henley-on-thames , uk i would argue that nasa is somewhat of an anachronism .
the " glory days " of the space race with russia are over .
instead , space exploration should be run by the national science foundation .
there , private and public money can be better organized to fund missions .
the nsf already runs most of the science stations here on earth .
why should space be any different ?
greg , alexandria , va space exploration * is * a waste of money .
had the billions been invested directly in more down-to-earth technologies , we would have seen the same spin-offs in medicine , it , and transport .
anonymous i ca n't believe the childish reactions to space exploration from folks like mike and anon , uk .
grow up , guys .
space exploration represents humanity at its most amazing .
you 're obviously just bitter because the us is leading the way .
typical .
shawn , washington , dc , usa exploration , of all kinds , has always helped man push the boundaries of technology .
the space programme is no different .
for this reason alone it is invaluable .
jason , detroit , usa despite all the delays and expert checks , something still fell off it on take off dan , yateley , uk looking at the shuttle i am always reminded of those creaking old 50 's and 60 's airliners you still see rattling around developing countries .
good in their day , but now so ropey and tired that they just scream " death trap " .
it says it all about the shuttle that despite all the delays and expert checks , something still fell off it on take off .
it 's high time this heap was scrapped , and a replacement worthy of the 21st century was introduced in its place .
dan , yateley , uk so the new ufos are unidentified falling objects ?
phil jones , frangy , france if you watch the film of the launch the piece of debris that falls off after the booster rocket drops off does not come from the shuttle it comes from the giant fuel tank , which is ' disposable ' anyway .
john nichols , brackley , nnorthants , uk how would brits feel if americans were talking about how britain should spend its money ?
michelle , raleigh , nc i think that nasa is still too hurried in launching the shuttle when the debris problem still exists .
maybe they should solve out the problem wholly before doing any thing else .
but the fact still shows that nasa has succeeded in launching the shuttle into space .
maybe that 's an incredible luck , although we still do n't know about the return of it .
but i believe it will succeed , too .
god 's will give luck to the crew .
nguyen hoang giang , hanoi , vietnam i just pray she makes it back down ok seun , london uk it was an excellent feeling seeing discovery go like that yesterday .
i am really happy for nasa and i just pray she makes it back down ok , that will be the icing on the cake .
seun , london uk oh dear !
the usa are off again trying to show how they can spend billions on space exploration , meanwhile trying to flex its muscles all around the world causing chaos- unbelievable !
mike , uk mankind is not content with polluting the earth !
it now wants to pollute space as well !
how sad !
millions starve while the usa burns dollars - what for ?
it truly is a sick world we live in these days !
anon , uk to anon , uk - the fuel is clean and non polluting - just water produced .
and as for waste of money - tell me about the dome and the london olympics .
longer term , i know what is more valuable !
george , chelmsford i 'm so glad to see the space programme resume shuttle launches .
space research is costly , but it 's like buying a lottery ticket - you never know what you 're going to get back from it , but once you go out there , there 's a chance you might win big .
and we already have - people have cited the benefits that have come from the space programme .
here 's to more exploration outside our atmosphere !
tony , london , uk i felt privileged to have been in florida for the launch .
it went off on time and from what i gather from reports , was perfect .
it 's something to tell the grandkids one day .
marylyn , london space travel fires the imagination !
tim goodchild , surrey space travel fires the imagination !
to all those that criticise that the shuttle is old and the fact that its had two failures should perhaps think again the next time they board a 747 on route to their holiday destination .
tim goodchild , surrey absolutely fantastic pictures from discovery , especially when the external fuel tank was detached from the shuttle with the curvature of the earth in the background .
overall great launch , well done nasa .
paul , coventry , uk the american space programme is a great achievement and it is important that it continues .
the human race is capable of great things and it is not in our nature to keep still .
terry , crewe , cheshire my gosh !
the people saying the space program is a waste of money ? !
the commercial products used now as a result of nasa are staggering .
cat scans , dialysis machines , materials in your athletic shoes , water purification technology , cordless power tools , cool suits for firefighters , physical therapy equipment .
the list goes on .
the program is invaluable !
eric , usa i think its well worth the effort and money to sustain humans in space carl lennon , northampton , uk most of the people on here with negative comments do not realise how much space has done for humanity .
many medical experiments have been conducted in space which was the only place that it could be done .
the results of these experiments have saved thousands if not millions of lives .
i think its well worth the effort and money to sustain humans in space .
carl lennon , northampton , uk although america has proven itself to be the world 's best engineers , nasa is living on past glory .
many of its best scientists and engineers have left , it is no longer in the public limelight unless it has a disaster , and it is grossly underfunded .
america should reinvigorate the program with major new investment and ambitious new goals or shut it down .
as the eu space agency has recently learned , you ca n't explore space on the cheap .
this old technology and this antiquated worn out hardware needs to be retired along with the mediocre management which has taken over .
mark , usa what a novel way to distract your nation from the real problems at home and abroad .
the cost does n't matter since the nation is paying the bill .
ed , canada there are those who say space exploration is a waste of money .
on the contrary , space travel forces society to stretch and reach further in order to solve highly complex problems associated with putting man into space .
the solutions to these problems are broad and serve mankind in many ways .
the space program enables us to move forward faster than we otherwise would .
without such large goals our advancement slows and we become lazy .
david , philadelphia , usa come on people , of course sending people into space is dangerous and expensive .
that does n't mean we should n't do it though .
even if space exploration did not lead to technical advances and practical application , it would still be worth it .
why ?
because it 's cool .
we put a man on the moon , that 's pretty impressive considering just prior to wwi a man could only travel as far as a horse could take him .
stu , st paul , usa the view from the fuel tank at over 14000mph was fantastic !
rod aries , glasgow the view from the fuel tank at over 14000mph was fantastic !
why are n't other space agencies doing this for the public ?
engage us !
rod aries , glasgow every time i see a rocket launch i think that newton made it possible ; his equations are still used to calculate the orbit .
how many other things in use today were invented over 300 years ago ?
vic , uk a sense of pride mixed with concern .
i live near the johnson space center and have relatives that have worked in the program as far back as gemini and apollo .
the space program is much more than a news story to us .
to those who think the space program is a waste of money : there is so much innovation and research that goes on behind the scenes that you 'd change your opinion if you took the time to look at what nasa has accomplished over the years and continues to accomplish today .
paul , houston , tx well , i 'm relieved it 's up there .
but they still seem to have this gung-ho attitude to safety .
i could n't believe that after killing two crews they are still happy to launch with a known serious fault .
chris hann , bay area , ca , usa congratulations to nasa on a successful launch .
i 'm glad to see that some nations still recognise the value of dreaming and aspiring to do great things and inspire their young people .
the money spent of spaceflight is miniscule compared to the many benefits .
it 's sad here in the uk that people are so ignorant and short-sighted with regards to space exploration that we ca n't see the good that can from it - and then we wonder the younger generations are n't interested in science , medicine and technology .
victor , birmingham , england this launch showed the world what can be accomplished with great teamwork , ambition and determination d soni , nuneaton , uk i watched the launch and was overcome with pride .
all the people involved in this great feat have overcome extreme obstacles .
this launch showed the world what can be accomplished with great teamwork , ambition and determination .
congratulations discovery !
d soni , nuneaton , uk mankind needs a vision .
interplanetary travel is necessary to achieve that end .
stuart haines , calgary , alberta , canada it 's time to junk the space shuttle and perhaps " rethink " this whole business of manned space flight for the time being .
think about it , other than as a showy display of national pride , what benefits do any nations get at this time from sending humans into space ?
perhaps in the future when we have real goals and reliable " safe " transportation we can start wasting our time and money with such " propaganda flights " , but now is n't the time and place for such foolishness .
charlie , niagara falls new york people always complain that space programs are too expensive , but do people appreciate how much safer the planet is with them ?
we can monitor dangerous weather , asteroids , and send tv , radio , and telephone signals via satellites .
space programs really have helped the planet excel in a positive way , and i 'm glad the discovery is finally continuing what has already been a remarkable feat of engineering .
tim hunt -lrb- 16 -rrb- , plymouth , england in these days darkened by the spectre of global terrorism , we seek hope and strength in many places .
the fog of war and the wind that whispers the question of " why are we fighting in the middle east ? ' diminish our confidence in our government .
today 's launch of the shuttle discovery renews our hope and faith in our abilities to overcome tragedy and defy adversity .
we owe the entire nasa family a debt of gratitude for restoring our faith in the human spirit .
paul telfer , franceville , gabon we need a new way of going to the stars clive , dartford , uk i wish the crew well on the mission , but the shuttle is old and just like any aircraft , it has its life expectancy and this bird has reached it .
we need a new way of going to the stars and to ditch the big firework approach to it .
clive , dartford , uk sure , okay .
maybe the shuttle programme is old .
maybe it should be scrapped for something better .
but , it is all we have at the moment .
and to all of you here who keep telling us to get rid of it , i have n't heard one of you say anything about putting up any money with us to fund a new programme .
jon , atlanta , usa what nasa needs is a real life scotty character to sort these technical issues out .
paul collier , london , uk the truth is that the shuttle concept has proved to be too expensive and technically complex to be the way forward in space .
i am pro-space exploration but the shuttle has slowed this to a crawl , and all the best work has been done by probes boosted by rockets e.g. mars landers , titan probes etc .
andy , uk " space is expensive ! " cry the critics .
i wish they would angle their criticism at a truly scandalous target .
the entire space programme to date has cost less than what the world spends on arms every year .
i know which i think is better value for money .
bernard o. quinn , barcelona , catalonia the exploration of space will continue with us or without us scott westwood , port orchard , wa , usa the shuttle is expensive , outdated and despite nasa 's assurances , its safety is still uncertain ; but it 's the only game in town .
the exploration of space will continue with us or without us ; to sit on the sidelines and watch others go up would be unthinkable for an america that prides itself on being a superpower .
scott westwood , port orchard , wa , usa space exploration is essential for the future of all humans .
flying over the atlantic was at first a risky endeavour and now it is done by millions every year without a thought for the early pioneers and the planes that never arrived .
colin , croydon , uk i do not understand all these people saying that america should scrap the shuttle , and spend it on ' the world ' .
the us is already the single largest contributor of foreign aid .
the us space program has helped everyday life for billions of people around the world , and churned out invention after invention for the world .
bill zimmer , seattle , wa congratulations to all those involved in discovery 's return to space !
to all the naysayers , next time you are browsing the internet on your pc , take a moment to find out what drove the development of semiconductors that power your pc .
yes , the space exploration that you think is a waste of money !
roger , london tears came to my eyes and i held my breath colleen , orlando , fl usa we were in the parking lot facing east , waiting and whispering to each other .
the first person to see the shuttle clearing the trees threw up their hand to point it out and some of the men started yelling , " go , baby , go ! " and cheering .
tears came to my eyes and i held my breath .
the space program has done so much to improve our lives in the fields of health and science , they further our knowledge of our environment and how our magnificent planet works .
colleen , orlando , fl usa go discovery !
the future of humanity is in space .
as an american living abroad , the lift-off of discovery is the first event that makes me proud to be american since leaving my country .
i hope that this success will lead to the completion of the iss and the continued exploration of space .
daniel valenti , canberra , australia people forget that we belong to this planet earth , in that our physical bodies are perfectly adapted to survive only on the earth .
we could never survive on other planets without extensive artificial aids .
as many have already pointed out , there are many , many more pressing needs requiring resolution and funds should be redirected where they are most needed for our survival on our home planet .

the crew on board the space shuttle have conducted inspections of discovery 's belly and repairs to the shuttle have also been carried out .
stephen robinson has begun a unique spacewalk , going under the orbiter 's belly to remove two ceramic strips sticking out between heatshield tiles .
nasa engineers are concerned the strips would cause part of discovery to overheat as it re-enters the earth 's atmosphere .
discovery had been due to return to earth on 7 august , but nasa has decided to extend the mission by an extra day .
what do you think of the mission so far ?
how do you feel about the mission being extended ?
what do you think about the repairs ?

read a selection of your comments below .
click here to read a second page of your comments the following comments reflect the balance of opinion we have received so far : the money that is spent by the american government on space exploration could be much better spent on healthcare and education .
this would be much more beneficial to the american people than discovery 's mission .
carolynne burkholder , vancouver , british columbia i can not believe that the crew had to cobble together a hacksaw norman west , truro , cornwall i can not believe that the crew had to cobble together a hacksaw .
a small box of tools from any diy shop would have done the job .
also removing a gap filler between the tiles exposes a gap .
surely the wind can get in and potentially lift a tile causing a fatal problem .
norman west , truro , cornwall whilst i can see that advances may be made through this work , i saw two items on the news last night - one about children dying because they have n't got a few quid , the other about spending millions on keeping the shuttles going in and out of space .
priority check please .
mark , didcot , england space travel is dangerous , pioneers are going to die , but it is worthwhile .
what is needed now are new spaceships to let us travel between planets .
at the moment all our eggs are in one basket , we need to find other homes on other worlds .
we have made this one nearly uninhabitable .
i would go into space whatever the risk .
ruth , walsall maybe if all the countries stopped being so petty and pooled their resources , we 'd have superior technology and fewer incidents like this .
we do n't need to race against each other anymore to try and prove who 's superior ; instead we should look to a future of co-operation .
gaz , cardiff , uk i will never understand why we waste so much money on primitive space stations john gearing , st. helens , uk i will never understand why we waste so much money on primitive space stations and shuttles which clearly have no function for the human race at this time .
i do n't know why we do n't get all our experts and fund them in coming up with unmanned technologies and technology in shuttles that could take us to planets not to a tin can in the sky which is over expensive and serves no function to the mass population .
john gearing , st. helens , uk fascinating a brit would ask the question why the us is sending people into space .
as the brit , george mallory said in 1924 , " because its there " .
mt everest killed mallory and we remember him for his quest .
in a similar quest , the us will continue to go into space - because its there .
john b , windermere , florida do some of these contributors have no soul ?
what could be more magnificent than seeing human beings taking risks to explore the unknown ; triumphing over the problems they meet along the way ; opening up new horizons for the rest of us ?
yes let 's invest in a new space transportation system , and more manned flights , and unmanned probes and a bigger , better space station .
but to claim that stopping the current flights is sensible shows no faith in the species at all .
stop looking down at the ground and start looking up at the stars .
john r smith , uk please , armchair scientists , let the experts at nasa do their job making the risk calculations .
they 've got the know-how and the tools to make the decisions .
not you or me .
joe , usa this is the most ridiculous expenditure of precious funds in a time of great national travail .
nasa is an anachronism , a patronistic pet rock that has no justification whatsoever , especially in the current environment in which civilized societies are fighting for their mere existence .
the irresponsibility in launching this mission in the face of known deficiencies is appalling .
c. a. la varre , newport , ri usa the media paints such a doom and gloom picture of what is happening above us phil , hampshire , uk why-oh-why does the media take such a negative view to what the men and women on sts114 are doing .
the media paints such a doom and gloom picture of what is happening above us .
we as a united world should watch and praise these people who are up there performing the most fantastic things known to mankind .
yes there is a difficult time coming on returning to earth but the crew at this time seem very positive about it .
may i suggest that you all watch nasa tv on the web for real live happenings .
phil , hampshire , uk nasa is undergoing drastic changes .
i think the us should pause and take stock of what 's happening to their space missions .
give it a break , sort out problems and return 10years later .
i wonder how the us ever landed man on the moon ?
did they really ?
i wonder !
errol , dubai , uae space flight is still in its infancy .
so the fact that an astronaut was able to make a repair to the shuttle in space is a great triumph .
nasa should look on this feat in a positive light , not a negative one .
we know in the days of sailing ships as they travelled the globe to discover new lands , there were many times when sailors had to climb up masts in storms to make repairs , so is repairing space craft in flight any different ?
leon aarons , petach israel another piece of space theatre , justifying manned flight .
unmanned craft can put payloads into orbit much more cheaply , as well as exploring other planets .
martin , dubai , uae i 've just seen a picture of the tool , held together with strong tape that the astronauts used .
it 's great to imagine that a billion-dollar aircraft can be saved by a bit of strong tape and some elbow grease !
it 's that sort of thinking that 's saved astronauts in the past .
good luck to them , hope humans carry on going into space for many more years .
dave , manchester , uk this spacewalk and repair demonstrates two things .
firstly , the courage and initiative of the astronauts , secondly , the importance of retiring the ageing shuttle fleet and building a modern spacecraft .
electronics and materials technology have advanced tremendously in the past 30 years , but the shuttle is still using outdated technology .
gordon mcstraun , uk so , the offending piece if gap filler from between a couple of heat shields .
i 'm no nasa expert , but does n't this mean that the is now a gap between these tiles ?
michael , bucks , uk the astronauts are all volunteers , they know the risks involved , and that is why i praise and thank them kirsty , cambridge , uk i think it is fantastic that discovery has launched and its mission is going well .
a lesson has been learnt from colombia , and indeed , challenger .
the astronauts are all volunteers , they know the risks involved , and that is why i praise and thank them .
they are incredible people .
kirsty , cambridge , uk so what if the filler problem has to be fixed with a jerry-rigged hacksaw ?
this type of ingenuity has been saving lives since the age of tall ships and can only reflect well on the tenacity of the nasa engineers and astronauts .
remember when the progress hit mir ?
apollo 13 ?
we need the experience of these problems to give us the know-how to survive in space and give us the confidence in our ability to solve problems on longer , bolder voyages .
tim parker , edinburgh , scotland i work with remote operated vehicles in the oil and gas industry .
i am amazed that the crew of the discovery need to cobble together a makeshift hacksaw to carry out a job on the tiles .
the shuttles are old and things will go wrong so you would expect a decent tool kit to be onboard .
james , paderne , portugal why are the americans still sending people into space ?
if they want to explore they should be thinking of unmanned flights with intelligent technology which can spend decades in space .
this should help the ozone layer repair itself .
more is needed to be done to explore and catalogue this planet and its systems , this will be of more benefit to mankind and our home than space travel .
haz , nottingham , uk is going up in the shuttle much more dangerous than sailing unknown oceans a few hundred years ago in wooden ships ?
thank goodness that throughout history not everyone has wanted to sit at home in comfort in their own small world .
simon , manchester , uk with so many comings and goings to and from iss , would it not be sensible for just the bare minimum of crew to return in this shuttle and send up a half-empty shuttle to collect the rest of them ?
why take unnecessary risks ?
fraser irving , sheffield , uk until now , the shuttle missions have been routine , like taking a walk in the park .
but the reality of danger with the loss of two shuttles has almost brought the space program to its knees .
should it continue ?
of course it must go on because too much is at stake .
closing the space station , and not looking into space is the worst we can do .
life on earth is becoming dangerous .
we must look to the stars if humanity is to survive .
walter , chapel hill , nc i think - and hope - this flight is one of the safest ever .
my guess is the problems have appeared simply because they have been looking for them far more carefully than before .
however , there 's no doubt a replacement spacecraft is needed .
the private " space ship one " has a slow re-entry , avoiding thermal problems .
is this possible from orbit ?
and a separate , unmanned cargo vehicle seems a " no-brainer " .
simon , bristol it must be frightening for the astronauts but the space programme must prevail anya , london pioneers always take risks so that everyone else can eventually follow .
it must be frightening for the astronauts but the space programme must prevail .
updated technology is definitely needed .
unmanned missions are a good idea , but ultimately there is no substitute for human actions and reactions .
anya , london interesting to note that the two shuttle losses have not been due to design or engineering flaws in the shuttle themselves , but rather the propulsion system .
for 30 year old vehicles , i think the shuttles are doing pretty well , and i am sure they will continue for a long time .
matt , bristol space exploration is dangerous and the crew knows this better than any of us - and they still volunteered for it .
my view is that we need to continue to explore space and the shuttle repair should be seen as an experience that needs to be faced at some time .
let 's not be weak about this .
george , chelmsford what nasa has done is simply awesome .
nasa is the adventurer of our era , looking at and investigating things that are far bigger than us .
i say ground the space shuttles , but do not skimp on quickly building bigger , better , and safer spacecraft to replace them .
sk , ithaca , ny space technology is too integrated in our daily lives now peter byrd , worcester the few people who mock space projects should not use anything connected with space technology as a protest !
i bet hardly anyone would manage it or really want to .
space technology is too integrated in our daily lives now ; we all enjoy the advantages we get from it .
nasa tv via the net alone shows me how wonderful space is .
peter byrd , worcester i have just returned from florida where i was privileged enough to witness the breathtaking launch first hand .
it seems as though there are increasing difficulties using these shuttles .
are the lives of 7 astronauts each time it takes off a risk that is worth taking ?
matt , london given the loss of columbia and the uncertainty of this mission , nasa should scrap the shuttle programme .
luck prevented previous disasters and it would appear nasa 's luck has run out .
what makes them feel confident that they can repair in space what they failed to repair in two years on the ground ?
my thoughts are with the families of those on the iss .
phil , bracknell , uk the problems with discovery must have been encountered with all the previous shuttle flights .
it appears that each time it took off , it was russian roulette as to whether it would return safely .
this program should be abandoned until a new and safer means of transporting the shuttle into space can be developed .
chris , brazil will the resulting depression between the tiles create a possibility of a chink in the armour ?
k chowksey , bangalore , india even if the pieces sticking out are pulled or hacked , will the resulting depression between the tiles create a possibility of a chink in the armour ?
even a depression can alter the aerodynamic behaviour -lrb- as in golf balls -rrb- .
this will create uneven heat distribution .
k chowksey , bangalore , india from the idealists point of view we really should not be thinking about costs here .
space exploration is vital , not only to our technological development as a species , but also in terms of our wider understanding of the universe .
the whole nasa infrastructure is quite frankly awesome .
every endeavour has its risks and we 've seen the tragic consequences of those risks with the previous accidents .
chris , bracknell we need to explore space ; when you go to hospital and have a cat scan or an mri , that technology has come from the space program .
there is nothing wrong with the shuttle - the problem is with the way it is maintained .
they need to do better , i do n't know why do n't they paint it again , and seal the foam .
carol , pa , usa the saddest thing for me about this mission is that the next time the iss is visible from england on august 11th , the shuttle will have already left .
hopefully we 'll get to see the shuttle during the next mission .
after the moon , the iss is the brightest object in the night sky .
john airey , peterborough i looked at the images of the underside of the shuttle and thought that it looked like really bad bathroom tiling rob , spain major advances need to be made to the whole concept of effective re-entry heat-shield technology .
even before lift-off , i looked at the images of the underside of the shuttle and thought that it looked like really bad bathroom tiling .
initially , i expected it to be a smooth , seamless surface , but it was a patchwork of light and dark areas with patches that looked more raised than others .
i assume that tiles are the best option at the moment , but in future this issue needs to be solved completely .
rob , spain if nasa has decided to just rip out the relatively small strips protruding from between the heat shield tiles , then why ca n't they ask astronaut steve robinson to take his experimental repair kit out with him and fill the gaps with the mastic gum that they used to ' fix ' the tiles in their earlier experiments ?
paul greer , gothenburg , sweden i worked as an engineer on skylab in the 70s and i consider this nasa debacle a disgrace .
unknown risk is one thing , but gambling with lives on known problems with solutions is unacceptable .
i say : bring some crew home in russian capsule , leave the rest of the crew up there , fix the foam on atlantis -lrb- and everything else possible -rrb- and then send a rescue mission .
then ground the antiques and use modern technology to build new spacecraft .
rich dusek , orchard lake , mi , us bruce from huntsville says it 's not a trivial engineering problem and he 's probably right .
but that does n't alter the documented fact that nasa has sent people into space against the advice of contractors who have told them that certain aspects are n't safe .
if shuttles are prone to bits falling off then they should n't be flying .
david , chelmsford uk nasa do n't build all the parts and therefore an outside company may be partly responsible james , uk why do people expect space travel to be perfectly safe ?
look at any picture of launch and remember the orange tank is full of fuel and both white rockets once started ca n't be stopped .
man in space is an essential part of our future .
the earth can not sustain us forever particularly its natural resources .
i also think people should recognise that nasa do n't build all the parts and therefore an outside company may be partly responsible .
james , uk the problems with the space transportation system are a classic example of what happens when whole-life costs are not taken into account during early design phases of the system .
congress chose to buy shuttle on the cheap , opting for solid fuel boosters and a disposable fuel tank instead of spending extra money upfront to design a fully-reusable fly-back first stage to take the orbiter into space .
the result has been far higher operating costs and , tragically , the loss of fourteen astronauts .
will it be too much to hope that senior agency managers and politicians will learn these lessons in defining our future access to space ?
in europe as well as the usa .
phil , bath , uk so far this particular mission has been very worrying for relatives of the discovery crew .
any venture into space is a risk , but this one seems to have gone ahead knowing this risk factor was much higher than usual .
why are these missions so important ?
the risk factor is too great to risk innocent lives .
stop them now .
jose a holmes , loughborough , england i wish the crew a safe return but am sorry to see resources wasted on a manned flight with little real value for essentially political and pr reasons while much more scientifically valuable unmanned work is scaled back to pay for it .
this is all about the advancement of the usa , not science .
julian , london , uk the debris issue has been present in the shuttle programme from day one .
the tiles themselves are so fragile you can break them with one hand .
the space shuttle is a wonderful vehicle , but sadly owing to it 's bizarre design , is inherently dangerous and needs to be replaced soon .
as richard feynman said after the challenger disaster , " for a successful technology , reality must take precedence over public relations , for nature can not be fooled . "
chris dyer , bristol , england the immediate future of the space program will be best served by robot missions dr malcolm fairbairn , uk / sweden i , like most people connected with astrophysics , think that the immediate future of the space program will be best served by robot missions for at least the next twenty years .
it 's not taking a step backwards ; it 's about developing and testing new technologies which will eventually be applied to human spaceflight .
for the same amount of money you get much more science done with robotic missions because you do n't have to worry about the fragile humans .
dr malcolm fairbairn , uk / sweden as an aerospace engineer , in this particular instance i am not worried about discovery .
all indications are that the debris did no damage .
long term , though , it could be a problem .
the space shuttle has never fulfilled the promises that were made for it .
it is an expensive vehicle of very limited utility .
it consumes resources which could be better used elsewhere in the us space program .
andrew ogilvie , modesto , california , usa robert heinlein said it : " the earth is too small and fragile a basket for humanity to keep all its eggs in . "
the only safe place to be when disaster comes -lrb- an asteroid for example -rrb- is somewhere else .
well done , discovery .
keep it up .
john fielder , workington , uk there are a lot of negative comments on here by people who really have not done their research .
there are so many inventions that have come to be due to space travel most are indirect , technology passed to the public after it has been created to aid nasa and the like in various projects .
adam ransom , birmingham space flight is one of the things that most excites me jehuda arieh veenman , haifa , israel space flight is one of the things that most excites me .
it breaks my heart that foam broke off the insulation again .
apparently , the design has a basic flaw ; the vulnerable heat shield is exposed to a bombardment of debris falling of during take off .
in the more old fashioned designs , the heat shields were protected during take off .
jehuda arieh veenman , haifa , israel it seems to me that the logical fix for the launch system would be to mount the shuttle higher relative to the fuel tank .
the coldness of the fuel is always going to be a problem in causing freezing of water and air in and around the foam insulation .
since that is the nature of the beast , get the shuttle out of harms way above the possible falling debris nigel dandridge-perry , los angeles ca , usa good luck discovery , i look forward to seeing a safe flight back to earth .
mark , dorset there is no progress with manned missions .
it 's more of the same .
while unmanned missions are discovering lakes of water on mars , landing on distant moons and exploring planets , the manned missions are trying to work out how to stop foam falling off the fuel tank .
leave floating around in orbit to the chinese and get exploring .
matt , amsterdam , the netherlands -lrb- ex .
uk -rrb- the shuttle programme shows the greatness the human race can achieve when we focus d ward , portsmouth those who fly orbiters know the risks and accept the challenge .
the shuttle programme shows the greatness the human race can achieve when we focus .
a commitment should be made to give it whatever financial support it needs to continue .
nasa tv shows discovery 's latest mission is gripping .
we owe it to those astronauts who have lost their lives in space exploration , to carry on the work that they could n't finish .
d ward , portsmouth i have become addicted to nasa tv over the last few days , and find myself staring into space , thinking of discovery up there somewhere ... looking back on our little planet from a distance .
i am surely concerned about the debris ; remember nasa did not think this would be a problem for the ill-fated columbia crew either .
they have spent two years and thousands of dollars on this problem - so yes , i think we should be concerned , not only about the debris ' implications , but also that nasa got it wrong again .
verity worthington , bewdley , worcestershire hundreds of years ago people were afraid that they could sail off the edges of the earth .
thank heavens there were brave sailors then willing to push the limits of courage and technology , and thank heavens we still have them today .
i 'm also grateful that there are still those willing to fund such expeditions .
rob g. , kansas city , usa the disaster 2 years ago , and these recent problems with the shuttle show that nasa really need to get on with developing the next generation of re-useable shuttles .
technology has moved on so much in the nearly 30 years since it was developed with computer technology and new lightweight materials .
if they do n't , then the private space firms will take over , while nasa keeps flogging a dead horse .
tane piper , edinburgh , uk we are all with you , looking forward for success .
god be with you .
no surrender no retreat .
martin madulu , moshi - tanzania i am more worried about the apparent loss of a tile than the foam .
if any of the tiles were damaged , the mission is in jeopardy .
after the columbia disaster , i read an article published in 1980 calling the shuttles ' death traps ' .
considering that we 've already lost half the fleet , i think it is high time nasa invested in a different , more robust technology .
istvan , detroit , usa the safety of the crew should be of utmost importance , not launch schedules ss , usa my family and i were vacationing in florida at the time of the launch .
we saw it speeding skyward from the car on our way back home .
i am an aerospace design engineer specializing in flight dynamics .
my concern really lies with the inadequacy with which nasa has dealt with the foam / tile problem .
the safety of the crew should be of utmost importance , not launch schedules .
ss , usa only those at nasa who have looked at the images of debris falling will have the best idea .
the crew 's safe return is just our concern but it 's their mission .
venkat maruthamuthu , urbana , il , usa why was this problem not resolved after columbia two years ago ?
it is very wrong to send yet more people up there without being absolutely sure that it 's safe .
perhaps space travel should wait until we have progressed far enough that we are not relying on tiles that can just fall off ?
catherine , cheshunt , herts great to see the shuttle soar again .
our future lies not on earth but out there somewhere .
no matter how you argue it , in the future this planet will die and so will all those life forms still on it .
if the human species is to survive , then it must do so elsewhere and this sort of technology is the first step towards that ultimate goal .
ian jordan , wokingham the foam formulation was changed in 1996 ... most of the foam issues started after this change bruce g , huntsville , usa this is not a trivial engineering problem as some have implied .
there are two types of foam : a lightweight foam covering the large areas of the tank and a dense ablator foam covering areas exposed to aerodynamic heating .
the foam is exposed to supersonic airflow at about 27000 km / h -lrb- 17000 mph -rrb- during launch .
there are shock cones coming from the orbiter , the connecting struts and solid boosters which impinge on the tank .
there is also a lot of vibration .
the foam formulation was changed in 1996 to comply with the montreal protocol and eliminate the freon propellant .
most of the foam issues started after this change and may or may not be associated with it .
the shuttle is due to be retired in 2010 and solving this problem is important for future spacecraft design .
bruce g , huntsville , usa why ca n't the return module be encased within the main take off rocket ?
this would prevent bits flying off from damaging it .
tony lee , telford we were on vacation in orlando , and had tickets for the astronaut hall of fame to watch the original scheduled lift-off on 13 july .
we had such a good view , but with about an hour or so to go , the launch was cancelled .
we were gutted to have missed such a spectacular sight !
we watched it on television back here in ireland , but felt we had a special bond with sts 114 - return to flight .
we just hope now for the safe return of the shuttle and its crew on 7 august .
good luck to them .
hutch family , ireland one day when someone is sipping cocktails on saturn 's lunar resort , whilst looking back at the earth and the distant sun , they 'll thank these brave people for risking their lives .
let 's keep our nerve , and not look back .
chris phillips , chelmsford , essex it is an inherent part of our nature to explore caroline , edinburgh , uk i used to work at one of the nasa centres -lrb- in maryland -rrb- and i hope that space exploration continues .
as a scientist it is an inherent part of our nature to explore , discover and find out about the unknown .
i was overjoyed to see the launch of discovery and hope , beyond all hope , that they make it safely home .
as nasa have said - " exploring space is not for the faint hearted ' - it 's a huge undertaking " .
the astronauts know that , we all know that .
these are very brave people and i wish them , and nasa , well with their endeavours .
caroline , edinburgh , uk watching this made me feel giddy .
now hopefully we can complete the iss and get on with the business of colonising space .
the spirit of adventure lives on with discovery and her crew .
david mills , ballymena , uk we were very privileged to be able to see discovery launch when it flew mission 105 and the impression it left us with was ' it was amazing to see ' .
we believe that the crew and the engineers will be able to work together and face the challenge of bringing back this magnificent ship .
instead of shrinking from the challenge we should rise up to it just as they did in 1970 for apollo 13 , it is only by stretching our knowledge such as in times of emergencies that we reach beyond our capabilities .
good luck and best wishes to the crew and engineers .
julie and robert , manchester , england i would like to see the shuttle retired and replaced with a newer fleet scott , edinburgh congratulations to nasa on another successful launch .
however , i would like to see the shuttle retired and replaced with a newer and more capable fleet of vehicles .
not only will it be safer and hugely beneficial to space exploration , the project would provide thousands of jobs , contracts to companies and benefit the global economy .
scott , edinburgh people seem to forget that manned space travel is still very dangerous and those brave astronauts know the risks .
foam has been falling off fuel tanks for nearly 25 years now .
perhaps money should now be invested in developing better glue and a more efficient reusable manned space travel system .
john ellis , nottingham statistically , if commercial flights carried the same risks as spaceflight , there would be about 500 airliner crashes per day .
one therefore has to applaud the courage and determination of those people who accept this degree of risk in pursuit of our quest for knowledge .
we are an inquisitive species , in this case pushing the boundaries of what is possible .
i wish those seven brave souls a safe return .
bob , cheshire i 've been following the ' space race ' since sputnik and the mercury missions , and i ca n't think of anything more exciting than a successful launch .
but why do n't we stop racing against each other and form stronger international collaborations to make space travel safer ?
j forman , los angeles , usa if nasa says the shuttle is safe to fly , it 's safe to fly james , los angeles , usa it amazes me how many observers believe they are more of an expert on shuttle safety and capability than the engineers at nasa .
the fact is , the men and women who work at nasa are at the top of their field .
if they say the shuttle is safe to fly , it 's safe to fly .
james , los angeles , usa it was a beautiful launch .
the space shuttle program has been remarkably successful despite the previous disaster .
nobody can engineer absolute perfection , but this was very close .
h neil , south texas , usa i am very concerned about the damaged tiles on discovery , especially in light of nasa 's apparent slowness in acknowledging that the take-off incident with columbia caused the disaster upon return .
there is an option for the crew of discovery - to wait on the space station for rescue .
how can we even contemplate risking their lives ?
if the problem is serious enough to ground the fleet , discovery too should be ' grounded ' immediately .
sharon , dallas , texas i once saw a presentation on how the challenger disaster came to happen and how it could have been prevented and it made my blood run cold .
suffice it to say , i have nothing but the most profound admiration for the courage of the crews of the shuttle .
i 'm not a religious man , but i just hope to god they all get back safely .
steve , chesham tragic as the columbia accident was , the astronauts died doing what they loved - exploring space , a privilege only the select few get to do .
they also died at the end of their trip so they got to enjoy being in space , unlike the challenger crew .
before the columbia accident , i would expect that the shuttles got through intact in much worse condition than discovery .
i am not that concerned , although i will follow the investigations with great interest .
ian , london it seems ridiculous that it is being jeopardised by something so simple chris , brazil the shuttle has been up and down into space about 50 times before the columbia incident .
i can not believe that bits of foam from the fuel tank did n't come off during these trips .
are n't nasa being a bit super cautious about this problem ?
ca n't they encase the fuel tank in some sort of wire mesh in order to prevent the foam from breaking off ?
in such a high tech programme , it seems ridiculous that it is being jeopardised by something so simple .
chris , brazil what exactly are they doing out there that they have not had the chance to do before ?
first of all get a new ship and then go somewhere else than the moon !
that impressed my grand father , it will take more to impress me !
mathieu , gatineau , canada bits of foam have probably been falling off the shuttle since the first launch , but it 's only since a piece of that debris caused the destruction of columbia two years ago that anyone has noticed !
only now we have cameras watching every single part of the craft do we see what may well have been happening all along .
carry on as normal .
simon , peterborough , uk i remember watching the first ever shuttle flight as a kid .
i watched the launch the other day and got the exact same feelings of awe and excitement .
the shuttle launch is a wake up call to everyone .
sure the world has problems right now but despite those problems , look what we 're capable of !
my message to nasa , the esa and all the other agencies ?
keep going people .
take us there !
andrew k jones , wrexham , uk i watched the launch live on the internet and was overwhelmed .
we wo n't know of the mission 's success until 7 aug , but what surprises me is the us way of making everything big and the huge overhead costs .
it 's all show and little substance .
after having spent $ 1 billion and 2.5 years on the debris falling cause , they are back to square one and the shuttles are grounded again !
on the other hand the russians are making safe manned space missions with pinpoint accuracy every 3-6 months at a fraction of the cost .
rakesh , london uk without space exploration we would not have computers , hi-technology materials etc jim kirk , basildon i read once that spending on cosmetics in the usa dwarfs the nasa budget .
let 's get things in perspective .
without space exploration we would not have computers , hi-technology materials etc , all of which were a by-product .
if more is learned about our planet and its self-destructive population on each mission then we should keep it going .
come home safe guys !
jim kirk , basildon does anyone know why debris falls off a multi-million dollar spacecraft ?
ca n't some sort of outer layer be put around the fuel tank insulation to stop it disintegrating ?
i 'm not an engineer - i need someone else to explain it !
robert , sussex rather than risking the crew and the shuttle , if it is damaged , why do n't they leave it up there as service vehicle and bring the crew back in another shuttle at a later date ?
if nasa wants to survive they need to start making people believe in them again .
good luck discovery !
paul , london the space shuttle was under funded during its design and construction and the compromises mean it will never achieve its true potential .
the sooner it can be replaced with something newer and simpler the better .
david patrick , reading trying to make space exploration 100 % safe is just nonsense .
duncan , nottingham my heart sank when i heard the news that tiles had once again fallen off the space shuttle roger campbell , england my heart sank when i heard the news that tiles had once again fallen off the space shuttle .
if the cause of the tiles falling off is simply the vibration and air flow , then i wonder what will be the effect of the searing heat of re-entry .
roger campbell , england having watched the space shuttle launch on tv , it is good to see such a majestic craft finally back to what she was meant to do .
well done nasa for getting the space shuttle flying .
james , nottingham no-one made that big a deal when tiles were missing from the oms pods after columbia 's maiden flight in 1981 .
when designing this vehicle they must have made a risk assessment to determine safety parameters , and unfortunately the loss of columbia has made them refine these parameters further .
tim parker , edinburgh we watched the launch from our beach , about 90 miles away .
it was spectacular .
there are many more cameras watching the exterior shuttle craft than ever before which have alerted to the problems .
the engineers working for nasa are tireless and will get the current crew back safely one way or another .
the space programme will continue .
the only unknown is manned flights .
the mars rovers are still sending pictures and information long past when they were suppose to .
nasa will continue on and i believe has more government funding this year , or is due for an increase .
private companies are currently working on safe space travel for human passengers in the us and abroad i believe .
joan york , daytona beach , florida usa nasa 's team on the ground and the astronauts in the space are doing a great job for the mankind syed mateen , karachi , pakistan i have witnessed the launching of space shuttle discovery on television screen .
nasa 's team on the ground and the astronauts in the space are doing a great job for the mankind , as their experiences in the space will benefit the entire world .
i pray for the safe return of the astronauts and happy landing of the space shuttle .
as a human being , i am equally concerned about the debris which has fallen at the time of its blast , but hope that the space shuttle will not face the same problem as it did in the past .
the safe return of discovery will boost the moral of nasa 's team , who had worked day and night to make the space shuttle 's mission possible .
syed mateen , karachi , pakistan any country with ambitions to have manned missions to space would be more than happy to have a craft as good as the space shuttle .
if there is a cheaper way to break away from earth than i am all for it but i am not sure how much safer it will be .
exploration has always been a dangerous business .
erik , ft .
collins , u.s.a. manned space flight is a dangerous and expensive anachronism .
look at the success of hubble , the mars rovers and the cassini / huygens mission .
you can do 10 times as much real science for half the cost and no risk to life by concentrating on unmanned space exploration .
and tell me , were n't the pictures of titan far more exciting than anything the crew of the shuttle are likely to get up to ?
max , abu dhabi , uae i read some of the comments here with disbelief .
yes , we all know that there are problems in some areas of the world , it does n't however mean that everything has to stop because of that .
i can think of a lot more things which are more of a waste than space exploration .
i 'll bet half the people complaining about nasa being wasteful drive gas guzzlers and do n't bother to recycle .
the shuttle mission is vital to all areas of science and i 'm glad it is flying again .
the space shuttle is not an old machine ; discovery has only flown 30 times before .
most commercial airlines fly that often in a week !
dave , slough , uk many congratulations to nasa .
as a teacher i teach children who are fascinated by space .
it is good that the space missions continue .
it allows children to hope and dream that they might reach the stars themselves , one day !
michelle , birmingham we all know that it costs millions of dollars to support the space program .
one could argue that money could be better spent elsewhere .
the fact is we as human beings need to understand in order to learn new technologies and space exploration is just one of many things that need to be understood and conquered .
there will always be many arguments for and against the space program .
all i can say right now is well done to nasa and my best wishes for a truly successful return to space flight for discovery .
andrew howlett , cape town , south africa good luck and a safe landings to the crew of the discovery .
there are some here that would have the usa quit funding the space program until all the worlds ' problems are solved .
will you tell your children to wait for that day before pursuing their dreams ?
michael rosenbaum , san francisco , usa a plane crash or 9/11 does not stop air travel , so why should the columbia 2003 disaster stop space exploration ?
i 'm sure discovery will make it back safe and the astronauts will be given a well-deserved pat on the back .
jack , london / memphis the shuttle might be old but it still works , and has done the world a huge service towards on earth and in space exploration .
those who complain are clearly members of the flat earth society , and yet i bet they use technology every day ?
someone has to push the envelope .
go nasa go !
phil w , uk good launch .
let 's just hope she comes back in one piece .
ricardo , brazil the shuttles are aged dinosaurs that need to be " moth balled " before more lives are lost due to fragmenting styrofoam .
perhaps we should all consider shifting funding away from nasa and put it towards alternative fuel sources .
it would be revenue better spent .
kurt stuchell , cambridge , usa scuttle the shuttle gordon , auckland nz scuttle the shuttle !
obsolete equipment supplying a pointless lab .
much fanfare about increasing aid to africa by $ 25b but us military budget $ 400b makes you ill !
gordon , auckland nz i can not stand the mentality of myopic people who would rather we abandon the natural impulse to explore our surroundings , and instead focus on futile efforts to tackle every mundane earthbound problem .
surely , the sight of the shuttle blasting off into orbit is the most poignant statement of mankind 's destiny .
kevin , charlotte , north carolina , usa with so much bad news in the media : terrorism , war , poverty ... it 's wonderful to see what we as human beings can achieve , when we put our minds to something positive .
we have the potential to achieve great things .
the crew of this shuttle mission are from different countries , cultures and backgrounds ; proof that if we work together , we can produce something that makes us all proud .
charlie , newcastle , uk to all those who claim the space programme has helped advance medicine and technology . think how much further along in those fields we could be if all the money wasted at nasa went into development . let alone feeding the poor .
shameful waste of resources .
i do n't want my tax dollar to be spent this way .
p. o 'donnell , rotorua , n.z. there are always small-minded people who are terrified of exploration digby knight , henley-on-thames , uk there are always small-minded people who are terrified of exploration .
if we had their way , we 'd still be living in trees afraid of the dangerous savannah !
thankfully we 've always had a few who have done their best to pioneer new territories and worlds .
digby knight , henley-on-thames , uk i would argue that nasa is somewhat of an anachronism .
the " glory days " of the space race with russia are over .
instead , space exploration should be run by the national science foundation .
there , private and public money can be better organized to fund missions .
the nsf already runs most of the science stations here on earth .
why should space be any different ?
greg , alexandria , va space exploration * is * a waste of money .
had the billions been invested directly in more down-to-earth technologies , we would have seen the same spin-offs in medicine , it , and transport .
anonymous i ca n't believe the childish reactions to space exploration from folks like mike and anon , uk .
grow up , guys .
space exploration represents humanity at its most amazing .
you 're obviously just bitter because the us is leading the way .
typical .
shawn , washington , dc , usa exploration , of all kinds , has always helped man push the boundaries of technology .
the space programme is no different .
for this reason alone it is invaluable .
jason , detroit , usa despite all the delays and expert checks , something still fell off it on take off dan , yateley , uk looking at the shuttle i am always reminded of those creaking old 50 's and 60 's airliners you still see rattling around developing countries .
good in their day , but now so ropey and tired that they just scream " death trap " .
it says it all about the shuttle that despite all the delays and expert checks , something still fell off it on take off .
it 's high time this heap was scrapped , and a replacement worthy of the 21st century was introduced in its place .
dan , yateley , uk so the new ufos are unidentified falling objects ?
phil jones , frangy , france if you watch the film of the launch the piece of debris that falls off after the booster rocket drops off does not come from the shuttle it comes from the giant fuel tank , which is ' disposable ' anyway .
john nichols , brackley , nnorthants , uk how would brits feel if americans were talking about how britain should spend its money ?
michelle , raleigh , nc i think that nasa is still too hurried in launching the shuttle when the debris problem still exists .
maybe they should solve out the problem wholly before doing any thing else .
but the fact still shows that nasa has succeeded in launching the shuttle into space .
maybe that 's an incredible luck , although we still do n't know about the return of it .
but i believe it will succeed , too .
god 's will give luck to the crew .
nguyen hoang giang , hanoi , vietnam i just pray she makes it back down ok seun , london uk it was an excellent feeling seeing discovery go like that yesterday .
i am really happy for nasa and i just pray she makes it back down ok , that will be the icing on the cake .
seun , london uk oh dear !
the usa are off again trying to show how they can spend billions on space exploration , meanwhile trying to flex its muscles all around the world causing chaos- unbelievable !
mike , uk mankind is not content with polluting the earth !
it now wants to pollute space as well !
how sad !
millions starve while the usa burns dollars - what for ?
it truly is a sick world we live in these days !
anon , uk to anon , uk - the fuel is clean and non polluting - just water produced .
and as for waste of money - tell me about the dome and the london olympics .
longer term , i know what is more valuable !
george , chelmsford i 'm so glad to see the space programme resume shuttle launches .
space research is costly , but it 's like buying a lottery ticket - you never know what you 're going to get back from it , but once you go out there , there 's a chance you might win big .
and we already have - people have cited the benefits that have come from the space programme .
here 's to more exploration outside our atmosphere !
tony , london , uk i felt privileged to have been in florida for the launch .
it went off on time and from what i gather from reports , was perfect .
it 's something to tell the grandkids one day .
marylyn , london space travel fires the imagination !
tim goodchild , surrey space travel fires the imagination !
to all those that criticise that the shuttle is old and the fact that its had two failures should perhaps think again the next time they board a 747 on route to their holiday destination .
tim goodchild , surrey absolutely fantastic pictures from discovery , especially when the external fuel tank was detached from the shuttle with the curvature of the earth in the background .
overall great launch , well done nasa .
paul , coventry , uk the american space programme is a great achievement and it is important that it continues .
the human race is capable of great things and it is not in our nature to keep still .
terry , crewe , cheshire my gosh !
the people saying the space program is a waste of money ? !
the commercial products used now as a result of nasa are staggering .
cat scans , dialysis machines , materials in your athletic shoes , water purification technology , cordless power tools , cool suits for firefighters , physical therapy equipment .
the list goes on .
the program is invaluable !
eric , usa i think its well worth the effort and money to sustain humans in space carl lennon , northampton , uk most of the people on here with negative comments do not realise how much space has done for humanity .
many medical experiments have been conducted in space which was the only place that it could be done .
the results of these experiments have saved thousands if not millions of lives .
i think its well worth the effort and money to sustain humans in space .
carl lennon , northampton , uk although america has proven itself to be the world 's best engineers , nasa is living on past glory .
many of its best scientists and engineers have left , it is no longer in the public limelight unless it has a disaster , and it is grossly underfunded .
america should reinvigorate the program with major new investment and ambitious new goals or shut it down .
as the eu space agency has recently learned , you ca n't explore space on the cheap .
this old technology and this antiquated worn out hardware needs to be retired along with the mediocre management which has taken over .
mark , usa what a novel way to distract your nation from the real problems at home and abroad .
the cost does n't matter since the nation is paying the bill .
ed , canada there are those who say space exploration is a waste of money .
on the contrary , space travel forces society to stretch and reach further in order to solve highly complex problems associated with putting man into space .
the solutions to these problems are broad and serve mankind in many ways .
the space program enables us to move forward faster than we otherwise would .
without such large goals our advancement slows and we become lazy .
david , philadelphia , usa come on people , of course sending people into space is dangerous and expensive .
that does n't mean we should n't do it though .
even if space exploration did not lead to technical advances and practical application , it would still be worth it .
why ?
because it 's cool .
we put a man on the moon , that 's pretty impressive considering just prior to wwi a man could only travel as far as a horse could take him .
stu , st paul , usa the view from the fuel tank at over 14000mph was fantastic !
rod aries , glasgow the view from the fuel tank at over 14000mph was fantastic !
why are n't other space agencies doing this for the public ?
engage us !
rod aries , glasgow every time i see a rocket launch i think that newton made it possible ; his equations are still used to calculate the orbit .
how many other things in use today were invented over 300 years ago ?
vic , uk a sense of pride mixed with concern .
i live near the johnson space center and have relatives that have worked in the program as far back as gemini and apollo .
the space program is much more than a news story to us .
to those who think the space program is a waste of money : there is so much innovation and research that goes on behind the scenes that you 'd change your opinion if you took the time to look at what nasa has accomplished over the years and continues to accomplish today .
paul , houston , tx well , i 'm relieved it 's up there .
but they still seem to have this gung-ho attitude to safety .
i could n't believe that after killing two crews they are still happy to launch with a known serious fault .
chris hann , bay area , ca , usa congratulations to nasa on a successful launch .
i 'm glad to see that some nations still recognise the value of dreaming and aspiring to do great things and inspire their young people .
the money spent of spaceflight is miniscule compared to the many benefits .
it 's sad here in the uk that people are so ignorant and short-sighted with regards to space exploration that we ca n't see the good that can from it - and then we wonder the younger generations are n't interested in science , medicine and technology .
victor , birmingham , england this launch showed the world what can be accomplished with great teamwork , ambition and determination d soni , nuneaton , uk i watched the launch and was overcome with pride .
all the people involved in this great feat have overcome extreme obstacles .
this launch showed the world what can be accomplished with great teamwork , ambition and determination .
congratulations discovery !
d soni , nuneaton , uk mankind needs a vision .
interplanetary travel is necessary to achieve that end .
stuart haines , calgary , alberta , canada it 's time to junk the space shuttle and perhaps " rethink " this whole business of manned space flight for the time being .
think about it , other than as a showy display of national pride , what benefits do any nations get at this time from sending humans into space ?
perhaps in the future when we have real goals and reliable " safe " transportation we can start wasting our time and money with such " propaganda flights " , but now is n't the time and place for such foolishness .
charlie , niagara falls new york people always complain that space programs are too expensive , but do people appreciate how much safer the planet is with them ?
we can monitor dangerous weather , asteroids , and send tv , radio , and telephone signals via satellites .
space programs really have helped the planet excel in a positive way , and i 'm glad the discovery is finally continuing what has already been a remarkable feat of engineering .
tim hunt -lrb- 16 -rrb- , plymouth , england in these days darkened by the spectre of global terrorism , we seek hope and strength in many places .
the fog of war and the wind that whispers the question of " why are we fighting in the middle east ? ' diminish our confidence in our government .
today 's launch of the shuttle discovery renews our hope and faith in our abilities to overcome tragedy and defy adversity .
we owe the entire nasa family a debt of gratitude for restoring our faith in the human spirit .
paul telfer , franceville , gabon we need a new way of going to the stars clive , dartford , uk i wish the crew well on the mission , but the shuttle is old and just like any aircraft , it has its life expectancy and this bird has reached it .
we need a new way of going to the stars and to ditch the big firework approach to it .
clive , dartford , uk sure , okay .
maybe the shuttle programme is old .
maybe it should be scrapped for something better .
but , it is all we have at the moment .
and to all of you here who keep telling us to get rid of it , i have n't heard one of you say anything about putting up any money with us to fund a new programme .
jon , atlanta , usa what nasa needs is a real life scotty character to sort these technical issues out .
paul collier , london , uk the truth is that the shuttle concept has proved to be too expensive and technically complex to be the way forward in space .
i am pro-space exploration but the shuttle has slowed this to a crawl , and all the best work has been done by probes boosted by rockets e.g. mars landers , titan probes etc .
andy , uk " space is expensive ! " cry the critics .
i wish they would angle their criticism at a truly scandalous target .
the entire space programme to date has cost less than what the world spends on arms every year .
i know which i think is better value for money .
bernard o. quinn , barcelona , catalonia the exploration of space will continue with us or without us scott westwood , port orchard , wa , usa the shuttle is expensive , outdated and despite nasa 's assurances , its safety is still uncertain ; but it 's the only game in town .
the exploration of space will continue with us or without us ; to sit on the sidelines and watch others go up would be unthinkable for an america that prides itself on being a superpower .
scott westwood , port orchard , wa , usa space exploration is essential for the future of all humans .
flying over the atlantic was at first a risky endeavour and now it is done by millions every year without a thought for the early pioneers and the planes that never arrived .
colin , croydon , uk i do not understand all these people saying that america should scrap the shuttle , and spend it on ' the world ' .
the us is already the single largest contributor of foreign aid .
the us space program has helped everyday life for billions of people around the world , and churned out invention after invention for the world .
bill zimmer , seattle , wa congratulations to all those involved in discovery 's return to space !
to all the naysayers , next time you are browsing the internet on your pc , take a moment to find out what drove the development of semiconductors that power your pc .
yes , the space exploration that you think is a waste of money !
roger , london tears came to my eyes and i held my breath colleen , orlando , fl usa we were in the parking lot facing east , waiting and whispering to each other .
the first person to see the shuttle clearing the trees threw up their hand to point it out and some of the men started yelling , " go , baby , go ! " and cheering .
tears came to my eyes and i held my breath .
the space program has done so much to improve our lives in the fields of health and science , they further our knowledge of our environment and how our magnificent planet works .
colleen , orlando , fl usa go discovery !
the future of humanity is in space .
as an american living abroad , the lift-off of discovery is the first event that makes me proud to be american since leaving my country .
i hope that this success will lead to the completion of the iss and the continued exploration of space .
daniel valenti , canberra , australia people forget that we belong to this planet earth , in that our physical bodies are perfectly adapted to survive only on the earth .
we could never survive on other planets without extensive artificial aids .
as many have already pointed out , there are many , many more pressing needs requiring resolution and funds should be redirected where they are most needed for our survival on our home planet .
yvonne , doncaster whatever the administration in the us , it 's only nasa that keeps public morale up and at same time keeps the defence lobby in good humor .

the crew on board the space shuttle have conducted inspections of discovery 's belly and repairs to the shuttle have also been carried out .
stephen robinson has begun a unique spacewalk , going under the orbiter 's belly to remove two ceramic strips sticking out between heatshield tiles .
nasa engineers are concerned the strips would cause part of discovery to overheat as it re-enters the earth 's atmosphere .
discovery had been due to return to earth on 7 august , but nasa has decided to extend the mission by an extra day .
what do you think of the mission so far ?
how do you feel about the mission being extended ?
what do you think about the repairs ?

read a selection of your comments below .
click here to read a second page of your comments the following comments reflect the balance of opinion we have received so far : the money that is spent by the american government on space exploration could be much better spent on healthcare and education .
this would be much more beneficial to the american people than discovery 's mission .
carolynne burkholder , vancouver , british columbia i can not believe that the crew had to cobble together a hacksaw norman west , truro , cornwall i can not believe that the crew had to cobble together a hacksaw .
a small box of tools from any diy shop would have done the job .
also removing a gap filler between the tiles exposes a gap .
surely the wind can get in and potentially lift a tile causing a fatal problem .
norman west , truro , cornwall whilst i can see that advances may be made through this work , i saw two items on the news last night - one about children dying because they have n't got a few quid , the other about spending millions on keeping the shuttles going in and out of space .
priority check please .
mark , didcot , england space travel is dangerous , pioneers are going to die , but it is worthwhile .
what is needed now are new spaceships to let us travel between planets .
at the moment all our eggs are in one basket , we need to find other homes on other worlds .
we have made this one nearly uninhabitable .
i would go into space whatever the risk .
ruth , walsall maybe if all the countries stopped being so petty and pooled their resources , we 'd have superior technology and fewer incidents like this .
we do n't need to race against each other anymore to try and prove who 's superior ; instead we should look to a future of co-operation .
gaz , cardiff , uk i will never understand why we waste so much money on primitive space stations john gearing , st. helens , uk i will never understand why we waste so much money on primitive space stations and shuttles which clearly have no function for the human race at this time .
i do n't know why we do n't get all our experts and fund them in coming up with unmanned technologies and technology in shuttles that could take us to planets not to a tin can in the sky which is over expensive and serves no function to the mass population .
john gearing , st. helens , uk fascinating a brit would ask the question why the us is sending people into space .
as the brit , george mallory said in 1924 , " because its there " .
mt everest killed mallory and we remember him for his quest .
in a similar quest , the us will continue to go into space - because its there .
john b , windermere , florida do some of these contributors have no soul ?
what could be more magnificent than seeing human beings taking risks to explore the unknown ; triumphing over the problems they meet along the way ; opening up new horizons for the rest of us ?
yes let 's invest in a new space transportation system , and more manned flights , and unmanned probes and a bigger , better space station .
but to claim that stopping the current flights is sensible shows no faith in the species at all .
stop looking down at the ground and start looking up at the stars .
john r smith , uk please , armchair scientists , let the experts at nasa do their job making the risk calculations .
they 've got the know-how and the tools to make the decisions .
not you or me .
joe , usa this is the most ridiculous expenditure of precious funds in a time of great national travail .
nasa is an anachronism , a patronistic pet rock that has no justification whatsoever , especially in the current environment in which civilized societies are fighting for their mere existence .
the irresponsibility in launching this mission in the face of known deficiencies is appalling .
c. a. la varre , newport , ri usa the media paints such a doom and gloom picture of what is happening above us phil , hampshire , uk why-oh-why does the media take such a negative view to what the men and women on sts114 are doing .
the media paints such a doom and gloom picture of what is happening above us .
we as a united world should watch and praise these people who are up there performing the most fantastic things known to mankind .
yes there is a difficult time coming on returning to earth but the crew at this time seem very positive about it .
may i suggest that you all watch nasa tv on the web for real live happenings .
phil , hampshire , uk nasa is undergoing drastic changes .
i think the us should pause and take stock of what 's happening to their space missions .
give it a break , sort out problems and return 10years later .
i wonder how the us ever landed man on the moon ?
did they really ?
i wonder !
errol , dubai , uae space flight is still in its infancy .
so the fact that an astronaut was able to make a repair to the shuttle in space is a great triumph .
nasa should look on this feat in a positive light , not a negative one .
we know in the days of sailing ships as they travelled the globe to discover new lands , there were many times when sailors had to climb up masts in storms to make repairs , so is repairing space craft in flight any different ?
leon aarons , petach israel another piece of space theatre , justifying manned flight .
unmanned craft can put payloads into orbit much more cheaply , as well as exploring other planets .
martin , dubai , uae i 've just seen a picture of the tool , held together with strong tape that the astronauts used .
it 's great to imagine that a billion-dollar aircraft can be saved by a bit of strong tape and some elbow grease !
it 's that sort of thinking that 's saved astronauts in the past .
good luck to them , hope humans carry on going into space for many more years .
dave , manchester , uk this spacewalk and repair demonstrates two things .
firstly , the courage and initiative of the astronauts , secondly , the importance of retiring the ageing shuttle fleet and building a modern spacecraft .
electronics and materials technology have advanced tremendously in the past 30 years , but the shuttle is still using outdated technology .
gordon mcstraun , uk so , the offending piece if gap filler from between a couple of heat shields .
i 'm no nasa expert , but does n't this mean that the is now a gap between these tiles ?
michael , bucks , uk the astronauts are all volunteers , they know the risks involved , and that is why i praise and thank them kirsty , cambridge , uk i think it is fantastic that discovery has launched and its mission is going well .
a lesson has been learnt from colombia , and indeed , challenger .
the astronauts are all volunteers , they know the risks involved , and that is why i praise and thank them .
they are incredible people .
kirsty , cambridge , uk so what if the filler problem has to be fixed with a jerry-rigged hacksaw ?
this type of ingenuity has been saving lives since the age of tall ships and can only reflect well on the tenacity of the nasa engineers and astronauts .
remember when the progress hit mir ?
apollo 13 ?
we need the experience of these problems to give us the know-how to survive in space and give us the confidence in our ability to solve problems on longer , bolder voyages .
tim parker , edinburgh , scotland i work with remote operated vehicles in the oil and gas industry .
i am amazed that the crew of the discovery need to cobble together a makeshift hacksaw to carry out a job on the tiles .
the shuttles are old and things will go wrong so you would expect a decent tool kit to be onboard .
james , paderne , portugal why are the americans still sending people into space ?
if they want to explore they should be thinking of unmanned flights with intelligent technology which can spend decades in space .
this should help the ozone layer repair itself .
more is needed to be done to explore and catalogue this planet and its systems , this will be of more benefit to mankind and our home than space travel .
haz , nottingham , uk is going up in the shuttle much more dangerous than sailing unknown oceans a few hundred years ago in wooden ships ?
thank goodness that throughout history not everyone has wanted to sit at home in comfort in their own small world .
simon , manchester , uk with so many comings and goings to and from iss , would it not be sensible for just the bare minimum of crew to return in this shuttle and send up a half-empty shuttle to collect the rest of them ?
why take unnecessary risks ?
fraser irving , sheffield , uk until now , the shuttle missions have been routine , like taking a walk in the park .
but the reality of danger with the loss of two shuttles has almost brought the space program to its knees .
should it continue ?
of course it must go on because too much is at stake .
closing the space station , and not looking into space is the worst we can do .
life on earth is becoming dangerous .
we must look to the stars if humanity is to survive .
walter , chapel hill , nc i think - and hope - this flight is one of the safest ever .
my guess is the problems have appeared simply because they have been looking for them far more carefully than before .
however , there 's no doubt a replacement spacecraft is needed .
the private " space ship one " has a slow re-entry , avoiding thermal problems .
is this possible from orbit ?
and a separate , unmanned cargo vehicle seems a " no-brainer " .
simon , bristol it must be frightening for the astronauts but the space programme must prevail anya , london pioneers always take risks so that everyone else can eventually follow .
it must be frightening for the astronauts but the space programme must prevail .
updated technology is definitely needed .
unmanned missions are a good idea , but ultimately there is no substitute for human actions and reactions .
anya , london interesting to note that the two shuttle losses have not been due to design or engineering flaws in the shuttle themselves , but rather the propulsion system .
for 30 year old vehicles , i think the shuttles are doing pretty well , and i am sure they will continue for a long time .
matt , bristol space exploration is dangerous and the crew knows this better than any of us - and they still volunteered for it .
my view is that we need to continue to explore space and the shuttle repair should be seen as an experience that needs to be faced at some time .
let 's not be weak about this .
george , chelmsford what nasa has done is simply awesome .
nasa is the adventurer of our era , looking at and investigating things that are far bigger than us .
i say ground the space shuttles , but do not skimp on quickly building bigger , better , and safer spacecraft to replace them .
sk , ithaca , ny space technology is too integrated in our daily lives now peter byrd , worcester the few people who mock space projects should not use anything connected with space technology as a protest !
i bet hardly anyone would manage it or really want to .
space technology is too integrated in our daily lives now ; we all enjoy the advantages we get from it .
nasa tv via the net alone shows me how wonderful space is .
peter byrd , worcester i have just returned from florida where i was privileged enough to witness the breathtaking launch first hand .
it seems as though there are increasing difficulties using these shuttles .
are the lives of 7 astronauts each time it takes off a risk that is worth taking ?
matt , london given the loss of columbia and the uncertainty of this mission , nasa should scrap the shuttle programme .
luck prevented previous disasters and it would appear nasa 's luck has run out .
what makes them feel confident that they can repair in space what they failed to repair in two years on the ground ?
my thoughts are with the families of those on the iss .
phil , bracknell , uk the problems with discovery must have been encountered with all the previous shuttle flights .
it appears that each time it took off , it was russian roulette as to whether it would return safely .
this program should be abandoned until a new and safer means of transporting the shuttle into space can be developed .
chris , brazil will the resulting depression between the tiles create a possibility of a chink in the armour ?
k chowksey , bangalore , india even if the pieces sticking out are pulled or hacked , will the resulting depression between the tiles create a possibility of a chink in the armour ?
even a depression can alter the aerodynamic behaviour -lrb- as in golf balls -rrb- .
this will create uneven heat distribution .
k chowksey , bangalore , india from the idealists point of view we really should not be thinking about costs here .
space exploration is vital , not only to our technological development as a species , but also in terms of our wider understanding of the universe .
the whole nasa infrastructure is quite frankly awesome .
every endeavour has its risks and we 've seen the tragic consequences of those risks with the previous accidents .
chris , bracknell we need to explore space ; when you go to hospital and have a cat scan or an mri , that technology has come from the space program .
there is nothing wrong with the shuttle - the problem is with the way it is maintained .
they need to do better , i do n't know why do n't they paint it again , and seal the foam .
carol , pa , usa the saddest thing for me about this mission is that the next time the iss is visible from england on august 11th , the shuttle will have already left .
hopefully we 'll get to see the shuttle during the next mission .
after the moon , the iss is the brightest object in the night sky .
john airey , peterborough i looked at the images of the underside of the shuttle and thought that it looked like really bad bathroom tiling rob , spain major advances need to be made to the whole concept of effective re-entry heat-shield technology .
even before lift-off , i looked at the images of the underside of the shuttle and thought that it looked like really bad bathroom tiling .
initially , i expected it to be a smooth , seamless surface , but it was a patchwork of light and dark areas with patches that looked more raised than others .
i assume that tiles are the best option at the moment , but in future this issue needs to be solved completely .
rob , spain if nasa has decided to just rip out the relatively small strips protruding from between the heat shield tiles , then why ca n't they ask astronaut steve robinson to take his experimental repair kit out with him and fill the gaps with the mastic gum that they used to ' fix ' the tiles in their earlier experiments ?
paul greer , gothenburg , sweden i worked as an engineer on skylab in the 70s and i consider this nasa debacle a disgrace .
unknown risk is one thing , but gambling with lives on known problems with solutions is unacceptable .
i say : bring some crew home in russian capsule , leave the rest of the crew up there , fix the foam on atlantis -lrb- and everything else possible -rrb- and then send a rescue mission .
then ground the antiques and use modern technology to build new spacecraft .
rich dusek , orchard lake , mi , us bruce from huntsville says it 's not a trivial engineering problem and he 's probably right .
but that does n't alter the documented fact that nasa has sent people into space against the advice of contractors who have told them that certain aspects are n't safe .
if shuttles are prone to bits falling off then they should n't be flying .
david , chelmsford uk nasa do n't build all the parts and therefore an outside company may be partly responsible james , uk why do people expect space travel to be perfectly safe ?
look at any picture of launch and remember the orange tank is full of fuel and both white rockets once started ca n't be stopped .
man in space is an essential part of our future .
the earth can not sustain us forever particularly its natural resources .
i also think people should recognise that nasa do n't build all the parts and therefore an outside company may be partly responsible .
james , uk the problems with the space transportation system are a classic example of what happens when whole-life costs are not taken into account during early design phases of the system .
congress chose to buy shuttle on the cheap , opting for solid fuel boosters and a disposable fuel tank instead of spending extra money upfront to design a fully-reusable fly-back first stage to take the orbiter into space .
the result has been far higher operating costs and , tragically , the loss of fourteen astronauts .
will it be too much to hope that senior agency managers and politicians will learn these lessons in defining our future access to space ?
in europe as well as the usa .
phil , bath , uk so far this particular mission has been very worrying for relatives of the discovery crew .
any venture into space is a risk , but this one seems to have gone ahead knowing this risk factor was much higher than usual .
why are these missions so important ?
the risk factor is too great to risk innocent lives .
stop them now .
jose a holmes , loughborough , england i wish the crew a safe return but am sorry to see resources wasted on a manned flight with little real value for essentially political and pr reasons while much more scientifically valuable unmanned work is scaled back to pay for it .
this is all about the advancement of the usa , not science .
julian , london , uk the debris issue has been present in the shuttle programme from day one .
the tiles themselves are so fragile you can break them with one hand .
the space shuttle is a wonderful vehicle , but sadly owing to it 's bizarre design , is inherently dangerous and needs to be replaced soon .
as richard feynman said after the challenger disaster , " for a successful technology , reality must take precedence over public relations , for nature can not be fooled . "
chris dyer , bristol , england the immediate future of the space program will be best served by robot missions dr malcolm fairbairn , uk / sweden i , like most people connected with astrophysics , think that the immediate future of the space program will be best served by robot missions for at least the next twenty years .
it 's not taking a step backwards ; it 's about developing and testing new technologies which will eventually be applied to human spaceflight .
for the same amount of money you get much more science done with robotic missions because you do n't have to worry about the fragile humans .
dr malcolm fairbairn , uk / sweden as an aerospace engineer , in this particular instance i am not worried about discovery .
all indications are that the debris did no damage .
long term , though , it could be a problem .
the space shuttle has never fulfilled the promises that were made for it .
it is an expensive vehicle of very limited utility .
it consumes resources which could be better used elsewhere in the us space program .
andrew ogilvie , modesto , california , usa robert heinlein said it : " the earth is too small and fragile a basket for humanity to keep all its eggs in . "
the only safe place to be when disaster comes -lrb- an asteroid for example -rrb- is somewhere else .
well done , discovery .
keep it up .
john fielder , workington , uk there are a lot of negative comments on here by people who really have not done their research .
there are so many inventions that have come to be due to space travel most are indirect , technology passed to the public after it has been created to aid nasa and the like in various projects .
adam ransom , birmingham space flight is one of the things that most excites me jehuda arieh veenman , haifa , israel space flight is one of the things that most excites me .
it breaks my heart that foam broke off the insulation again .
apparently , the design has a basic flaw ; the vulnerable heat shield is exposed to a bombardment of debris falling of during take off .
in the more old fashioned designs , the heat shields were protected during take off .
jehuda arieh veenman , haifa , israel it seems to me that the logical fix for the launch system would be to mount the shuttle higher relative to the fuel tank .
the coldness of the fuel is always going to be a problem in causing freezing of water and air in and around the foam insulation .
since that is the nature of the beast , get the shuttle out of harms way above the possible falling debris nigel dandridge-perry , los angeles ca , usa good luck discovery , i look forward to seeing a safe flight back to earth .
mark , dorset there is no progress with manned missions .
it 's more of the same .
while unmanned missions are discovering lakes of water on mars , landing on distant moons and exploring planets , the manned missions are trying to work out how to stop foam falling off the fuel tank .
leave floating around in orbit to the chinese and get exploring .
matt , amsterdam , the netherlands -lrb- ex .
uk -rrb- the shuttle programme shows the greatness the human race can achieve when we focus d ward , portsmouth those who fly orbiters know the risks and accept the challenge .
the shuttle programme shows the greatness the human race can achieve when we focus .
a commitment should be made to give it whatever financial support it needs to continue .
nasa tv shows discovery 's latest mission is gripping .
we owe it to those astronauts who have lost their lives in space exploration , to carry on the work that they could n't finish .
d ward , portsmouth i have become addicted to nasa tv over the last few days , and find myself staring into space , thinking of discovery up there somewhere ... looking back on our little planet from a distance .
i am surely concerned about the debris ; remember nasa did not think this would be a problem for the ill-fated columbia crew either .
they have spent two years and thousands of dollars on this problem - so yes , i think we should be concerned , not only about the debris ' implications , but also that nasa got it wrong again .
verity worthington , bewdley , worcestershire hundreds of years ago people were afraid that they could sail off the edges of the earth .
thank heavens there were brave sailors then willing to push the limits of courage and technology , and thank heavens we still have them today .
i 'm also grateful that there are still those willing to fund such expeditions .
rob g. , kansas city , usa the disaster 2 years ago , and these recent problems with the shuttle show that nasa really need to get on with developing the next generation of re-useable shuttles .
technology has moved on so much in the nearly 30 years since it was developed with computer technology and new lightweight materials .
if they do n't , then the private space firms will take over , while nasa keeps flogging a dead horse .
tane piper , edinburgh , uk we are all with you , looking forward for success .
god be with you .
no surrender no retreat .
martin madulu , moshi - tanzania i am more worried about the apparent loss of a tile than the foam .
if any of the tiles were damaged , the mission is in jeopardy .
after the columbia disaster , i read an article published in 1980 calling the shuttles ' death traps ' .
considering that we 've already lost half the fleet , i think it is high time nasa invested in a different , more robust technology .
istvan , detroit , usa the safety of the crew should be of utmost importance , not launch schedules ss , usa my family and i were vacationing in florida at the time of the launch .
we saw it speeding skyward from the car on our way back home .
i am an aerospace design engineer specializing in flight dynamics .
my concern really lies with the inadequacy with which nasa has dealt with the foam / tile problem .
the safety of the crew should be of utmost importance , not launch schedules .
ss , usa only those at nasa who have looked at the images of debris falling will have the best idea .
the crew 's safe return is just our concern but it 's their mission .
venkat maruthamuthu , urbana , il , usa why was this problem not resolved after columbia two years ago ?
it is very wrong to send yet more people up there without being absolutely sure that it 's safe .
perhaps space travel should wait until we have progressed far enough that we are not relying on tiles that can just fall off ?
catherine , cheshunt , herts great to see the shuttle soar again .
our future lies not on earth but out there somewhere .
no matter how you argue it , in the future this planet will die and so will all those life forms still on it .
if the human species is to survive , then it must do so elsewhere and this sort of technology is the first step towards that ultimate goal .
ian jordan , wokingham the foam formulation was changed in 1996 ... most of the foam issues started after this change bruce g , huntsville , usa this is not a trivial engineering problem as some have implied .
there are two types of foam : a lightweight foam covering the large areas of the tank and a dense ablator foam covering areas exposed to aerodynamic heating .
the foam is exposed to supersonic airflow at about 27000 km / h -lrb- 17000 mph -rrb- during launch .
there are shock cones coming from the orbiter , the connecting struts and solid boosters which impinge on the tank .
there is also a lot of vibration .
the foam formulation was changed in 1996 to comply with the montreal protocol and eliminate the freon propellant .
most of the foam issues started after this change and may or may not be associated with it .
the shuttle is due to be retired in 2010 and solving this problem is important for future spacecraft design .
bruce g , huntsville , usa why ca n't the return module be encased within the main take off rocket ?
this would prevent bits flying off from damaging it .
tony lee , telford we were on vacation in orlando , and had tickets for the astronaut hall of fame to watch the original scheduled lift-off on 13 july .
we had such a good view , but with about an hour or so to go , the launch was cancelled .
we were gutted to have missed such a spectacular sight !
we watched it on television back here in ireland , but felt we had a special bond with sts 114 - return to flight .
we just hope now for the safe return of the shuttle and its crew on 7 august .
good luck to them .
hutch family , ireland one day when someone is sipping cocktails on saturn 's lunar resort , whilst looking back at the earth and the distant sun , they 'll thank these brave people for risking their lives .
let 's keep our nerve , and not look back .
chris phillips , chelmsford , essex it is an inherent part of our nature to explore caroline , edinburgh , uk i used to work at one of the nasa centres -lrb- in maryland -rrb- and i hope that space exploration continues .
as a scientist it is an inherent part of our nature to explore , discover and find out about the unknown .
i was overjoyed to see the launch of discovery and hope , beyond all hope , that they make it safely home .
as nasa have said - " exploring space is not for the faint hearted ' - it 's a huge undertaking " .
the astronauts know that , we all know that .
these are very brave people and i wish them , and nasa , well with their endeavours .
caroline , edinburgh , uk watching this made me feel giddy .
now hopefully we can complete the iss and get on with the business of colonising space .
the spirit of adventure lives on with discovery and her crew .
david mills , ballymena , uk we were very privileged to be able to see discovery launch when it flew mission 105 and the impression it left us with was ' it was amazing to see ' .
we believe that the crew and the engineers will be able to work together and face the challenge of bringing back this magnificent ship .
instead of shrinking from the challenge we should rise up to it just as they did in 1970 for apollo 13 , it is only by stretching our knowledge such as in times of emergencies that we reach beyond our capabilities .
good luck and best wishes to the crew and engineers .
julie and robert , manchester , england i would like to see the shuttle retired and replaced with a newer fleet scott , edinburgh congratulations to nasa on another successful launch .
however , i would like to see the shuttle retired and replaced with a newer and more capable fleet of vehicles .
not only will it be safer and hugely beneficial to space exploration , the project would provide thousands of jobs , contracts to companies and benefit the global economy .
scott , edinburgh people seem to forget that manned space travel is still very dangerous and those brave astronauts know the risks .
foam has been falling off fuel tanks for nearly 25 years now .
perhaps money should now be invested in developing better glue and a more efficient reusable manned space travel system .
john ellis , nottingham statistically , if commercial flights carried the same risks as spaceflight , there would be about 500 airliner crashes per day .
one therefore has to applaud the courage and determination of those people who accept this degree of risk in pursuit of our quest for knowledge .
we are an inquisitive species , in this case pushing the boundaries of what is possible .
i wish those seven brave souls a safe return .
bob , cheshire i 've been following the ' space race ' since sputnik and the mercury missions , and i ca n't think of anything more exciting than a successful launch .
but why do n't we stop racing against each other and form stronger international collaborations to make space travel safer ?
j forman , los angeles , usa if nasa says the shuttle is safe to fly , it 's safe to fly james , los angeles , usa it amazes me how many observers believe they are more of an expert on shuttle safety and capability than the engineers at nasa .
the fact is , the men and women who work at nasa are at the top of their field .
if they say the shuttle is safe to fly , it 's safe to fly .
james , los angeles , usa it was a beautiful launch .
the space shuttle program has been remarkably successful despite the previous disaster .
nobody can engineer absolute perfection , but this was very close .
h neil , south texas , usa i am very concerned about the damaged tiles on discovery , especially in light of nasa 's apparent slowness in acknowledging that the take-off incident with columbia caused the disaster upon return .
there is an option for the crew of discovery - to wait on the space station for rescue .
how can we even contemplate risking their lives ?
if the problem is serious enough to ground the fleet , discovery too should be ' grounded ' immediately .
sharon , dallas , texas i once saw a presentation on how the challenger disaster came to happen and how it could have been prevented and it made my blood run cold .
suffice it to say , i have nothing but the most profound admiration for the courage of the crews of the shuttle .
i 'm not a religious man , but i just hope to god they all get back safely .
steve , chesham tragic as the columbia accident was , the astronauts died doing what they loved - exploring space , a privilege only the select few get to do .
they also died at the end of their trip so they got to enjoy being in space , unlike the challenger crew .
before the columbia accident , i would expect that the shuttles got through intact in much worse condition than discovery .
i am not that concerned , although i will follow the investigations with great interest .
ian , london it seems ridiculous that it is being jeopardised by something so simple chris , brazil the shuttle has been up and down into space about 50 times before the columbia incident .
i can not believe that bits of foam from the fuel tank did n't come off during these trips .
are n't nasa being a bit super cautious about this problem ?
ca n't they encase the fuel tank in some sort of wire mesh in order to prevent the foam from breaking off ?
in such a high tech programme , it seems ridiculous that it is being jeopardised by something so simple .
chris , brazil what exactly are they doing out there that they have not had the chance to do before ?
first of all get a new ship and then go somewhere else than the moon !
that impressed my grand father , it will take more to impress me !
mathieu , gatineau , canada bits of foam have probably been falling off the shuttle since the first launch , but it 's only since a piece of that debris caused the destruction of columbia two years ago that anyone has noticed !
only now we have cameras watching every single part of the craft do we see what may well have been happening all along .
carry on as normal .
simon , peterborough , uk i remember watching the first ever shuttle flight as a kid .
i watched the launch the other day and got the exact same feelings of awe and excitement .
the shuttle launch is a wake up call to everyone .
sure the world has problems right now but despite those problems , look what we 're capable of !
my message to nasa , the esa and all the other agencies ?
keep going people .
take us there !
andrew k jones , wrexham , uk i watched the launch live on the internet and was overwhelmed .
we wo n't know of the mission 's success until 7 aug , but what surprises me is the us way of making everything big and the huge overhead costs .
it 's all show and little substance .
after having spent $ 1 billion and 2.5 years on the debris falling cause , they are back to square one and the shuttles are grounded again !
on the other hand the russians are making safe manned space missions with pinpoint accuracy every 3-6 months at a fraction of the cost .
rakesh , london uk without space exploration we would not have computers , hi-technology materials etc jim kirk , basildon i read once that spending on cosmetics in the usa dwarfs the nasa budget .
let 's get things in perspective .
without space exploration we would not have computers , hi-technology materials etc , all of which were a by-product .
if more is learned about our planet and its self-destructive population on each mission then we should keep it going .
come home safe guys !
jim kirk , basildon does anyone know why debris falls off a multi-million dollar spacecraft ?
ca n't some sort of outer layer be put around the fuel tank insulation to stop it disintegrating ?
i 'm not an engineer - i need someone else to explain it !
robert , sussex rather than risking the crew and the shuttle , if it is damaged , why do n't they leave it up there as service vehicle and bring the crew back in another shuttle at a later date ?
if nasa wants to survive they need to start making people believe in them again .
good luck discovery !
paul , london the space shuttle was under funded during its design and construction and the compromises mean it will never achieve its true potential .
the sooner it can be replaced with something newer and simpler the better .
david patrick , reading trying to make space exploration 100 % safe is just nonsense .
duncan , nottingham my heart sank when i heard the news that tiles had once again fallen off the space shuttle roger campbell , england my heart sank when i heard the news that tiles had once again fallen off the space shuttle .
if the cause of the tiles falling off is simply the vibration and air flow , then i wonder what will be the effect of the searing heat of re-entry .
roger campbell , england having watched the space shuttle launch on tv , it is good to see such a majestic craft finally back to what she was meant to do .
well done nasa for getting the space shuttle flying .
james , nottingham no-one made that big a deal when tiles were missing from the oms pods after columbia 's maiden flight in 1981 .
when designing this vehicle they must have made a risk assessment to determine safety parameters , and unfortunately the loss of columbia has made them refine these parameters further .
tim parker , edinburgh we watched the launch from our beach , about 90 miles away .
it was spectacular .
there are many more cameras watching the exterior shuttle craft than ever before which have alerted to the problems .
the engineers working for nasa are tireless and will get the current crew back safely one way or another .
the space programme will continue .
the only unknown is manned flights .
the mars rovers are still sending pictures and information long past when they were suppose to .
nasa will continue on and i believe has more government funding this year , or is due for an increase .
private companies are currently working on safe space travel for human passengers in the us and abroad i believe .
joan york , daytona beach , florida usa nasa 's team on the ground and the astronauts in the space are doing a great job for the mankind syed mateen , karachi , pakistan i have witnessed the launching of space shuttle discovery on television screen .
nasa 's team on the ground and the astronauts in the space are doing a great job for the mankind , as their experiences in the space will benefit the entire world .
i pray for the safe return of the astronauts and happy landing of the space shuttle .
as a human being , i am equally concerned about the debris which has fallen at the time of its blast , but hope that the space shuttle will not face the same problem as it did in the past .
the safe return of discovery will boost the moral of nasa 's team , who had worked day and night to make the space shuttle 's mission possible .
syed mateen , karachi , pakistan any country with ambitions to have manned missions to space would be more than happy to have a craft as good as the space shuttle .
if there is a cheaper way to break away from earth than i am all for it but i am not sure how much safer it will be .
exploration has always been a dangerous business .
erik , ft .
collins , u.s.a. manned space flight is a dangerous and expensive anachronism .
look at the success of hubble , the mars rovers and the cassini / huygens mission .
you can do 10 times as much real science for half the cost and no risk to life by concentrating on unmanned space exploration .
and tell me , were n't the pictures of titan far more exciting than anything the crew of the shuttle are likely to get up to ?
max , abu dhabi , uae i read some of the comments here with disbelief .
yes , we all know that there are problems in some areas of the world , it does n't however mean that everything has to stop because of that .
i can think of a lot more things which are more of a waste than space exploration .
i 'll bet half the people complaining about nasa being wasteful drive gas guzzlers and do n't bother to recycle .
the shuttle mission is vital to all areas of science and i 'm glad it is flying again .
the space shuttle is not an old machine ; discovery has only flown 30 times before .
most commercial airlines fly that often in a week !
dave , slough , uk many congratulations to nasa .
as a teacher i teach children who are fascinated by space .
it is good that the space missions continue .
it allows children to hope and dream that they might reach the stars themselves , one day !
michelle , birmingham we all know that it costs millions of dollars to support the space program .
one could argue that money could be better spent elsewhere .
the fact is we as human beings need to understand in order to learn new technologies and space exploration is just one of many things that need to be understood and conquered .
there will always be many arguments for and against the space program .
all i can say right now is well done to nasa and my best wishes for a truly successful return to space flight for discovery .
andrew howlett , cape town , south africa good luck and a safe landings to the crew of the discovery .
there are some here that would have the usa quit funding the space program until all the worlds ' problems are solved .
will you tell your children to wait for that day before pursuing their dreams ?
michael rosenbaum , san francisco , usa a plane crash or 9/11 does not stop air travel , so why should the columbia 2003 disaster stop space exploration ?
i 'm sure discovery will make it back safe and the astronauts will be given a well-deserved pat on the back .
jack , london / memphis the shuttle might be old but it still works , and has done the world a huge service towards on earth and in space exploration .
those who complain are clearly members of the flat earth society , and yet i bet they use technology every day ?
someone has to push the envelope .
go nasa go !
phil w , uk good launch .
let 's just hope she comes back in one piece .
ricardo , brazil the shuttles are aged dinosaurs that need to be " moth balled " before more lives are lost due to fragmenting styrofoam .
perhaps we should all consider shifting funding away from nasa and put it towards alternative fuel sources .
it would be revenue better spent .
kurt stuchell , cambridge , usa scuttle the shuttle gordon , auckland nz scuttle the shuttle !
obsolete equipment supplying a pointless lab .
much fanfare about increasing aid to africa by $ 25b but us military budget $ 400b makes you ill !
gordon , auckland nz i can not stand the mentality of myopic people who would rather we abandon the natural impulse to explore our surroundings , and instead focus on futile efforts to tackle every mundane earthbound problem .
surely , the sight of the shuttle blasting off into orbit is the most poignant statement of mankind 's destiny .
kevin , charlotte , north carolina , usa with so much bad news in the media : terrorism , war , poverty ... it 's wonderful to see what we as human beings can achieve , when we put our minds to something positive .
we have the potential to achieve great things .
the crew of this shuttle mission are from different countries , cultures and backgrounds ; proof that if we work together , we can produce something that makes us all proud .
charlie , newcastle , uk to all those who claim the space programme has helped advance medicine and technology . think how much further along in those fields we could be if all the money wasted at nasa went into development . let alone feeding the poor .
shameful waste of resources .
i do n't want my tax dollar to be spent this way .
p. o 'donnell , rotorua , n.z. there are always small-minded people who are terrified of exploration digby knight , henley-on-thames , uk there are always small-minded people who are terrified of exploration .
if we had their way , we 'd still be living in trees afraid of the dangerous savannah !
thankfully we 've always had a few who have done their best to pioneer new territories and worlds .
digby knight , henley-on-thames , uk i would argue that nasa is somewhat of an anachronism .
the " glory days " of the space race with russia are over .
instead , space exploration should be run by the national science foundation .
there , private and public money can be better organized to fund missions .
the nsf already runs most of the science stations here on earth .
why should space be any different ?
greg , alexandria , va space exploration * is * a waste of money .
had the billions been invested directly in more down-to-earth technologies , we would have seen the same spin-offs in medicine , it , and transport .
anonymous i ca n't believe the childish reactions to space exploration from folks like mike and anon , uk .
grow up , guys .
space exploration represents humanity at its most amazing .
you 're obviously just bitter because the us is leading the way .
typical .
shawn , washington , dc , usa exploration , of all kinds , has always helped man push the boundaries of technology .
the space programme is no different .
for this reason alone it is invaluable .
jason , detroit , usa despite all the delays and expert checks , something still fell off it on take off dan , yateley , uk looking at the shuttle i am always reminded of those creaking old 50 's and 60 's airliners you still see rattling around developing countries .
good in their day , but now so ropey and tired that they just scream " death trap " .
it says it all about the shuttle that despite all the delays and expert checks , something still fell off it on take off .
it 's high time this heap was scrapped , and a replacement worthy of the 21st century was introduced in its place .
dan , yateley , uk so the new ufos are unidentified falling objects ?
phil jones , frangy , france if you watch the film of the launch the piece of debris that falls off after the booster rocket drops off does not come from the shuttle it comes from the giant fuel tank , which is ' disposable ' anyway .
john nichols , brackley , nnorthants , uk how would brits feel if americans were talking about how britain should spend its money ?
michelle , raleigh , nc i think that nasa is still too hurried in launching the shuttle when the debris problem still exists .
maybe they should solve out the problem wholly before doing any thing else .
but the fact still shows that nasa has succeeded in launching the shuttle into space .
maybe that 's an incredible luck , although we still do n't know about the return of it .
but i believe it will succeed , too .
god 's will give luck to the crew .
nguyen hoang giang , hanoi , vietnam i just pray she makes it back down ok seun , london uk it was an excellent feeling seeing discovery go like that yesterday .
i am really happy for nasa and i just pray she makes it back down ok , that will be the icing on the cake .
seun , london uk oh dear !
the usa are off again trying to show how they can spend billions on space exploration , meanwhile trying to flex its muscles all around the world causing chaos- unbelievable !
mike , uk mankind is not content with polluting the earth !
it now wants to pollute space as well !
how sad !
millions starve while the usa burns dollars - what for ?
it truly is a sick world we live in these days !
anon , uk to anon , uk - the fuel is clean and non polluting - just water produced .
and as for waste of money - tell me about the dome and the london olympics .
longer term , i know what is more valuable !
george , chelmsford i 'm so glad to see the space programme resume shuttle launches .
space research is costly , but it 's like buying a lottery ticket - you never know what you 're going to get back from it , but once you go out there , there 's a chance you might win big .
and we already have - people have cited the benefits that have come from the space programme .
here 's to more exploration outside our atmosphere !
tony , london , uk i felt privileged to have been in florida for the launch .
it went off on time and from what i gather from reports , was perfect .
it 's something to tell the grandkids one day .
marylyn , london space travel fires the imagination !
tim goodchild , surrey space travel fires the imagination !
to all those that criticise that the shuttle is old and the fact that its had two failures should perhaps think again the next time they board a 747 on route to their holiday destination .
tim goodchild , surrey absolutely fantastic pictures from discovery , especially when the external fuel tank was detached from the shuttle with the curvature of the earth in the background .
overall great launch , well done nasa .
paul , coventry , uk the american space programme is a great achievement and it is important that it continues .
the human race is capable of great things and it is not in our nature to keep still .
terry , crewe , cheshire my gosh !
the people saying the space program is a waste of money ? !
the commercial products used now as a result of nasa are staggering .
cat scans , dialysis machines , materials in your athletic shoes , water purification technology , cordless power tools , cool suits for firefighters , physical therapy equipment .
the list goes on .
the program is invaluable !
eric , usa i think its well worth the effort and money to sustain humans in space carl lennon , northampton , uk most of the people on here with negative comments do not realise how much space has done for humanity .
many medical experiments have been conducted in space which was the only place that it could be done .
the results of these experiments have saved thousands if not millions of lives .
i think its well worth the effort and money to sustain humans in space .
carl lennon , northampton , uk although america has proven itself to be the world 's best engineers , nasa is living on past glory .
many of its best scientists and engineers have left , it is no longer in the public limelight unless it has a disaster , and it is grossly underfunded .
america should reinvigorate the program with major new investment and ambitious new goals or shut it down .
as the eu space agency has recently learned , you ca n't explore space on the cheap .
this old technology and this antiquated worn out hardware needs to be retired along with the mediocre management which has taken over .
mark , usa what a novel way to distract your nation from the real problems at home and abroad .
the cost does n't matter since the nation is paying the bill .
ed , canada there are those who say space exploration is a waste of money .
on the contrary , space travel forces society to stretch and reach further in order to solve highly complex problems associated with putting man into space .
the solutions to these problems are broad and serve mankind in many ways .
the space program enables us to move forward faster than we otherwise would .
without such large goals our advancement slows and we become lazy .
david , philadelphia , usa come on people , of course sending people into space is dangerous and expensive .
that does n't mean we should n't do it though .
even if space exploration did not lead to technical advances and practical application , it would still be worth it .
why ?
because it 's cool .
we put a man on the moon , that 's pretty impressive considering just prior to wwi a man could only travel as far as a horse could take him .
stu , st paul , usa the view from the fuel tank at over 14000mph was fantastic !
rod aries , glasgow the view from the fuel tank at over 14000mph was fantastic !
why are n't other space agencies doing this for the public ?
engage us !
rod aries , glasgow every time i see a rocket launch i think that newton made it possible ; his equations are still used to calculate the orbit .
how many other things in use today were invented over 300 years ago ?
vic , uk a sense of pride mixed with concern .
i live near the johnson space center and have relatives that have worked in the program as far back as gemini and apollo .
the space program is much more than a news story to us .
to those who think the space program is a waste of money : there is so much innovation and research that goes on behind the scenes that you 'd change your opinion if you took the time to look at what nasa has accomplished over the years and continues to accomplish today .
paul , houston , tx well , i 'm relieved it 's up there .
but they still seem to have this gung-ho attitude to safety .
i could n't believe that after killing two crews they are still happy to launch with a known serious fault .
chris hann , bay area , ca , usa congratulations to nasa on a successful launch .
i 'm glad to see that some nations still recognise the value of dreaming and aspiring to do great things and inspire their young people .
the money spent of spaceflight is miniscule compared to the many benefits .
it 's sad here in the uk that people are so ignorant and short-sighted with regards to space exploration that we ca n't see the good that can from it - and then we wonder the younger generations are n't interested in science , medicine and technology .
victor , birmingham , england this launch showed the world what can be accomplished with great teamwork , ambition and determination d soni , nuneaton , uk i watched the launch and was overcome with pride .
all the people involved in this great feat have overcome extreme obstacles .
this launch showed the world what can be accomplished with great teamwork , ambition and determination .
congratulations discovery !
d soni , nuneaton , uk mankind needs a vision .
interplanetary travel is necessary to achieve that end .
stuart haines , calgary , alberta , canada it 's time to junk the space shuttle and perhaps " rethink " this whole business of manned space flight for the time being .
think about it , other than as a showy display of national pride , what benefits do any nations get at this time from sending humans into space ?
perhaps in the future when we have real goals and reliable " safe " transportation we can start wasting our time and money with such " propaganda flights " , but now is n't the time and place for such foolishness .
charlie , niagara falls new york people always complain that space programs are too expensive , but do people appreciate how much safer the planet is with them ?
we can monitor dangerous weather , asteroids , and send tv , radio , and telephone signals via satellites .
space programs really have helped the planet excel in a positive way , and i 'm glad the discovery is finally continuing what has already been a remarkable feat of engineering .
tim hunt -lrb- 16 -rrb- , plymouth , england in these days darkened by the spectre of global terrorism , we seek hope and strength in many places .
the fog of war and the wind that whispers the question of " why are we fighting in the middle east ? ' diminish our confidence in our government .
today 's launch of the shuttle discovery renews our hope and faith in our abilities to overcome tragedy and defy adversity .
we owe the entire nasa family a debt of gratitude for restoring our faith in the human spirit .
paul telfer , franceville , gabon we need a new way of going to the stars clive , dartford , uk i wish the crew well on the mission , but the shuttle is old and just like any aircraft , it has its life expectancy and this bird has reached it .
we need a new way of going to the stars and to ditch the big firework approach to it .
clive , dartford , uk sure , okay .
maybe the shuttle programme is old .
maybe it should be scrapped for something better .
but , it is all we have at the moment .
and to all of you here who keep telling us to get rid of it , i have n't heard one of you say anything about putting up any money with us to fund a new programme .
jon , atlanta , usa what nasa needs is a real life scotty character to sort these technical issues out .
paul collier , london , uk the truth is that the shuttle concept has proved to be too expensive and technically complex to be the way forward in space .
i am pro-space exploration but the shuttle has slowed this to a crawl , and all the best work has been done by probes boosted by rockets e.g. mars landers , titan probes etc .
andy , uk " space is expensive ! " cry the critics .
i wish they would angle their criticism at a truly scandalous target .
the entire space programme to date has cost less than what the world spends on arms every year .
i know which i think is better value for money .
bernard o. quinn , barcelona , catalonia the exploration of space will continue with us or without us scott westwood , port orchard , wa , usa the shuttle is expensive , outdated and despite nasa 's assurances , its safety is still uncertain ; but it 's the only game in town .
the exploration of space will continue with us or without us ; to sit on the sidelines and watch others go up would be unthinkable for an america that prides itself on being a superpower .
scott westwood , port orchard , wa , usa space exploration is essential for the future of all humans .
flying over the atlantic was at first a risky endeavour and now it is done by millions every year without a thought for the early pioneers and the planes that never arrived .
colin , croydon , uk i do not understand all these people saying that america should scrap the shuttle , and spend it on ' the world ' .
the us is already the single largest contributor of foreign aid .
the us space program has helped everyday life for billions of people around the world , and churned out invention after invention for the world .
bill zimmer , seattle , wa congratulations to all those involved in discovery 's return to space !
to all the naysayers , next time you are browsing the internet on your pc , take a moment to find out what drove the development of semiconductors that power your pc .
yes , the space exploration that you think is a waste of money !
roger , london tears came to my eyes and i held my breath colleen , orlando , fl usa we were in the parking lot facing east , waiting and whispering to each other .
the first person to see the shuttle clearing the trees threw up their hand to point it out and some of the men started yelling , " go , baby , go ! " and cheering .
tears came to my eyes and i held my breath .
the space program has done so much to improve our lives in the fields of health and science , they further our knowledge of our environment and how our magnificent planet works .
colleen , orlando , fl usa go discovery !
the future of humanity is in space .
as an american living abroad , the lift-off of discovery is the first event that makes me proud to be american since leaving my country .
i hope that this success will lead to the completion of the iss and the continued exploration of space .
daniel valenti , canberra , australia people forget that we belong to this planet earth , in that our physical bodies are perfectly adapted to survive only on the earth .
we could never survive on other planets without extensive artificial aids .
as many have already pointed out , there are many , many more pressing needs requiring resolution and funds should be redirected where they are most needed for our survival on our home planet .
yvonne , doncaster whatever the administration in the us , it 's only nasa that keeps public morale up and at same time keeps the defence lobby in good humor .

the crew on board the space shuttle have conducted inspections of discovery 's belly and repairs to the shuttle have also been carried out .
stephen robinson has begun a unique spacewalk , going under the orbiter 's belly to remove two ceramic strips sticking out between heatshield tiles .
nasa engineers are concerned the strips would cause part of discovery to overheat as it re-enters the earth 's atmosphere .
discovery had been due to return to earth on 7 august , but nasa has decided to extend the mission by an extra day .
what do you think of the mission so far ?
how do you feel about the mission being extended ?
what do you think about the repairs ?

this debate is now closed .
read a selection of your comments below .
click here to read a second page of your comments the following comments reflect the balance of opinion we have received so far : the money that is spent by the american government on space exploration could be much better spent on healthcare and education .
this would be much more beneficial to the american people than discovery 's mission .
carolynne burkholder , vancouver , british columbia i can not believe that the crew had to cobble together a hacksaw norman west , truro , cornwall i can not believe that the crew had to cobble together a hacksaw .
a small box of tools from any diy shop would have done the job .
also removing a gap filler between the tiles exposes a gap .
surely the wind can get in and potentially lift a tile causing a fatal problem .
norman west , truro , cornwall whilst i can see that advances may be made through this work , i saw two items on the news last night - one about children dying because they have n't got a few quid , the other about spending millions on keeping the shuttles going in and out of space .
priority check please .
mark , didcot , england space travel is dangerous , pioneers are going to die , but it is worthwhile .
what is needed now are new spaceships to let us travel between planets .
at the moment all our eggs are in one basket , we need to find other homes on other worlds .
we have made this one nearly uninhabitable .
i would go into space whatever the risk .
ruth , walsall maybe if all the countries stopped being so petty and pooled their resources , we 'd have superior technology and fewer incidents like this .
we do n't need to race against each other anymore to try and prove who 's superior ; instead we should look to a future of co-operation .
gaz , cardiff , uk i will never understand why we waste so much money on primitive space stations john gearing , st. helens , uk i will never understand why we waste so much money on primitive space stations and shuttles which clearly have no function for the human race at this time .
i do n't know why we do n't get all our experts and fund them in coming up with unmanned technologies and technology in shuttles that could take us to planets not to a tin can in the sky which is over expensive and serves no function to the mass population .
john gearing , st. helens , uk fascinating a brit would ask the question why the us is sending people into space .
as the brit , george mallory said in 1924 , " because its there " .
mt everest killed mallory and we remember him for his quest .
in a similar quest , the us will continue to go into space - because its there .
john b , windermere , florida do some of these contributors have no soul ?
what could be more magnificent than seeing human beings taking risks to explore the unknown ; triumphing over the problems they meet along the way ; opening up new horizons for the rest of us ?
yes let 's invest in a new space transportation system , and more manned flights , and unmanned probes and a bigger , better space station .
but to claim that stopping the current flights is sensible shows no faith in the species at all .
stop looking down at the ground and start looking up at the stars .
john r smith , uk please , armchair scientists , let the experts at nasa do their job making the risk calculations .
they 've got the know-how and the tools to make the decisions .
not you or me .
joe , usa this is the most ridiculous expenditure of precious funds in a time of great national travail .
nasa is an anachronism , a patronistic pet rock that has no justification whatsoever , especially in the current environment in which civilized societies are fighting for their mere existence .
the irresponsibility in launching this mission in the face of known deficiencies is appalling .
c. a. la varre , newport , ri usa the media paints such a doom and gloom picture of what is happening above us phil , hampshire , uk why-oh-why does the media take such a negative view to what the men and women on sts114 are doing .
the media paints such a doom and gloom picture of what is happening above us .
we as a united world should watch and praise these people who are up there performing the most fantastic things known to mankind .
yes there is a difficult time coming on returning to earth but the crew at this time seem very positive about it .
may i suggest that you all watch nasa tv on the web for real live happenings .
phil , hampshire , uk nasa is undergoing drastic changes .
i think the us should pause and take stock of what 's happening to their space missions .
give it a break , sort out problems and return 10years later .
i wonder how the us ever landed man on the moon ?
did they really ?
i wonder !
errol , dubai , uae space flight is still in its infancy .
so the fact that an astronaut was able to make a repair to the shuttle in space is a great triumph .
nasa should look on this feat in a positive light , not a negative one .
we know in the days of sailing ships as they travelled the globe to discover new lands , there were many times when sailors had to climb up masts in storms to make repairs , so is repairing space craft in flight any different ?
leon aarons , petach israel another piece of space theatre , justifying manned flight .
unmanned craft can put payloads into orbit much more cheaply , as well as exploring other planets .
martin , dubai , uae i 've just seen a picture of the tool , held together with strong tape that the astronauts used .
it 's great to imagine that a billion-dollar aircraft can be saved by a bit of strong tape and some elbow grease !
it 's that sort of thinking that 's saved astronauts in the past .
good luck to them , hope humans carry on going into space for many more years .
dave , manchester , uk this spacewalk and repair demonstrates two things .
firstly , the courage and initiative of the astronauts , secondly , the importance of retiring the ageing shuttle fleet and building a modern spacecraft .
electronics and materials technology have advanced tremendously in the past 30 years , but the shuttle is still using outdated technology .
gordon mcstraun , uk so , the offending piece if gap filler from between a couple of heat shields .
i 'm no nasa expert , but does n't this mean that the is now a gap between these tiles ?
michael , bucks , uk the astronauts are all volunteers , they know the risks involved , and that is why i praise and thank them kirsty , cambridge , uk i think it is fantastic that discovery has launched and its mission is going well .
a lesson has been learnt from colombia , and indeed , challenger .
the astronauts are all volunteers , they know the risks involved , and that is why i praise and thank them .
they are incredible people .
kirsty , cambridge , uk so what if the filler problem has to be fixed with a jerry-rigged hacksaw ?
this type of ingenuity has been saving lives since the age of tall ships and can only reflect well on the tenacity of the nasa engineers and astronauts .
remember when the progress hit mir ?
apollo 13 ?
we need the experience of these problems to give us the know-how to survive in space and give us the confidence in our ability to solve problems on longer , bolder voyages .
tim parker , edinburgh , scotland i work with remote operated vehicles in the oil and gas industry .
i am amazed that the crew of the discovery need to cobble together a makeshift hacksaw to carry out a job on the tiles .
the shuttles are old and things will go wrong so you would expect a decent tool kit to be onboard .
james , paderne , portugal why are the americans still sending people into space ?
if they want to explore they should be thinking of unmanned flights with intelligent technology which can spend decades in space .
this should help the ozone layer repair itself .
more is needed to be done to explore and catalogue this planet and its systems , this will be of more benefit to mankind and our home than space travel .
haz , nottingham , uk is going up in the shuttle much more dangerous than sailing unknown oceans a few hundred years ago in wooden ships ?
thank goodness that throughout history not everyone has wanted to sit at home in comfort in their own small world .
simon , manchester , uk with so many comings and goings to and from iss , would it not be sensible for just the bare minimum of crew to return in this shuttle and send up a half-empty shuttle to collect the rest of them ?
why take unnecessary risks ?
fraser irving , sheffield , uk until now , the shuttle missions have been routine , like taking a walk in the park .
but the reality of danger with the loss of two shuttles has almost brought the space program to its knees .
should it continue ?
of course it must go on because too much is at stake .
closing the space station , and not looking into space is the worst we can do .
life on earth is becoming dangerous .
we must look to the stars if humanity is to survive .
walter , chapel hill , nc i think - and hope - this flight is one of the safest ever .
my guess is the problems have appeared simply because they have been looking for them far more carefully than before .
however , there 's no doubt a replacement spacecraft is needed .
the private " space ship one " has a slow re-entry , avoiding thermal problems .
is this possible from orbit ?
and a separate , unmanned cargo vehicle seems a " no-brainer " .
simon , bristol it must be frightening for the astronauts but the space programme must prevail anya , london pioneers always take risks so that everyone else can eventually follow .
it must be frightening for the astronauts but the space programme must prevail .
updated technology is definitely needed .
unmanned missions are a good idea , but ultimately there is no substitute for human actions and reactions .
anya , london interesting to note that the two shuttle losses have not been due to design or engineering flaws in the shuttle themselves , but rather the propulsion system .
for 30 year old vehicles , i think the shuttles are doing pretty well , and i am sure they will continue for a long time .
matt , bristol space exploration is dangerous and the crew knows this better than any of us - and they still volunteered for it .
my view is that we need to continue to explore space and the shuttle repair should be seen as an experience that needs to be faced at some time .
let 's not be weak about this .
george , chelmsford what nasa has done is simply awesome .
nasa is the adventurer of our era , looking at and investigating things that are far bigger than us .
i say ground the space shuttles , but do not skimp on quickly building bigger , better , and safer spacecraft to replace them .
sk , ithaca , ny space technology is too integrated in our daily lives now peter byrd , worcester the few people who mock space projects should not use anything connected with space technology as a protest !
i bet hardly anyone would manage it or really want to .
space technology is too integrated in our daily lives now ; we all enjoy the advantages we get from it .
nasa tv via the net alone shows me how wonderful space is .
peter byrd , worcester i have just returned from florida where i was privileged enough to witness the breathtaking launch first hand .
it seems as though there are increasing difficulties using these shuttles .
are the lives of 7 astronauts each time it takes off a risk that is worth taking ?
matt , london given the loss of columbia and the uncertainty of this mission , nasa should scrap the shuttle programme .
luck prevented previous disasters and it would appear nasa 's luck has run out .
what makes them feel confident that they can repair in space what they failed to repair in two years on the ground ?
my thoughts are with the families of those on the iss .
phil , bracknell , uk the problems with discovery must have been encountered with all the previous shuttle flights .
it appears that each time it took off , it was russian roulette as to whether it would return safely .
this program should be abandoned until a new and safer means of transporting the shuttle into space can be developed .
chris , brazil will the resulting depression between the tiles create a possibility of a chink in the armour ?
k chowksey , bangalore , india even if the pieces sticking out are pulled or hacked , will the resulting depression between the tiles create a possibility of a chink in the armour ?
even a depression can alter the aerodynamic behaviour -lrb- as in golf balls -rrb- .
this will create uneven heat distribution .
k chowksey , bangalore , india from the idealists point of view we really should not be thinking about costs here .
space exploration is vital , not only to our technological development as a species , but also in terms of our wider understanding of the universe .
the whole nasa infrastructure is quite frankly awesome .
every endeavour has its risks and we 've seen the tragic consequences of those risks with the previous accidents .
chris , bracknell we need to explore space ; when you go to hospital and have a cat scan or an mri , that technology has come from the space program .
there is nothing wrong with the shuttle - the problem is with the way it is maintained .
they need to do better , i do n't know why do n't they paint it again , and seal the foam .
carol , pa , usa the saddest thing for me about this mission is that the next time the iss is visible from england on august 11th , the shuttle will have already left .
hopefully we 'll get to see the shuttle during the next mission .
after the moon , the iss is the brightest object in the night sky .
john airey , peterborough i looked at the images of the underside of the shuttle and thought that it looked like really bad bathroom tiling rob , spain major advances need to be made to the whole concept of effective re-entry heat-shield technology .
even before lift-off , i looked at the images of the underside of the shuttle and thought that it looked like really bad bathroom tiling .
initially , i expected it to be a smooth , seamless surface , but it was a patchwork of light and dark areas with patches that looked more raised than others .
i assume that tiles are the best option at the moment , but in future this issue needs to be solved completely .
rob , spain if nasa has decided to just rip out the relatively small strips protruding from between the heat shield tiles , then why ca n't they ask astronaut steve robinson to take his experimental repair kit out with him and fill the gaps with the mastic gum that they used to ' fix ' the tiles in their earlier experiments ?
paul greer , gothenburg , sweden i worked as an engineer on skylab in the 70s and i consider this nasa debacle a disgrace .
unknown risk is one thing , but gambling with lives on known problems with solutions is unacceptable .
i say : bring some crew home in russian capsule , leave the rest of the crew up there , fix the foam on atlantis -lrb- and everything else possible -rrb- and then send a rescue mission .
then ground the antiques and use modern technology to build new spacecraft .
rich dusek , orchard lake , mi , us bruce from huntsville says it 's not a trivial engineering problem and he 's probably right .
but that does n't alter the documented fact that nasa has sent people into space against the advice of contractors who have told them that certain aspects are n't safe .
if shuttles are prone to bits falling off then they should n't be flying .
david , chelmsford uk nasa do n't build all the parts and therefore an outside company may be partly responsible james , uk why do people expect space travel to be perfectly safe ?
look at any picture of launch and remember the orange tank is full of fuel and both white rockets once started ca n't be stopped .
man in space is an essential part of our future .
the earth can not sustain us forever particularly its natural resources .
i also think people should recognise that nasa do n't build all the parts and therefore an outside company may be partly responsible .
james , uk the problems with the space transportation system are a classic example of what happens when whole-life costs are not taken into account during early design phases of the system .
congress chose to buy shuttle on the cheap , opting for solid fuel boosters and a disposable fuel tank instead of spending extra money upfront to design a fully-reusable fly-back first stage to take the orbiter into space .
the result has been far higher operating costs and , tragically , the loss of fourteen astronauts .
will it be too much to hope that senior agency managers and politicians will learn these lessons in defining our future access to space ?
in europe as well as the usa .
phil , bath , uk so far this particular mission has been very worrying for relatives of the discovery crew .
any venture into space is a risk , but this one seems to have gone ahead knowing this risk factor was much higher than usual .
why are these missions so important ?
the risk factor is too great to risk innocent lives .
stop them now .
jose a holmes , loughborough , england i wish the crew a safe return but am sorry to see resources wasted on a manned flight with little real value for essentially political and pr reasons while much more scientifically valuable unmanned work is scaled back to pay for it .
this is all about the advancement of the usa , not science .
julian , london , uk the debris issue has been present in the shuttle programme from day one .
the tiles themselves are so fragile you can break them with one hand .
the space shuttle is a wonderful vehicle , but sadly owing to it 's bizarre design , is inherently dangerous and needs to be replaced soon .
as richard feynman said after the challenger disaster , " for a successful technology , reality must take precedence over public relations , for nature can not be fooled . "
chris dyer , bristol , england the immediate future of the space program will be best served by robot missions dr malcolm fairbairn , uk / sweden i , like most people connected with astrophysics , think that the immediate future of the space program will be best served by robot missions for at least the next twenty years .
it 's not taking a step backwards ; it 's about developing and testing new technologies which will eventually be applied to human spaceflight .
for the same amount of money you get much more science done with robotic missions because you do n't have to worry about the fragile humans .
dr malcolm fairbairn , uk / sweden as an aerospace engineer , in this particular instance i am not worried about discovery .
all indications are that the debris did no damage .
long term , though , it could be a problem .
the space shuttle has never fulfilled the promises that were made for it .
it is an expensive vehicle of very limited utility .
it consumes resources which could be better used elsewhere in the us space program .
andrew ogilvie , modesto , california , usa robert heinlein said it : " the earth is too small and fragile a basket for humanity to keep all its eggs in . "
the only safe place to be when disaster comes -lrb- an asteroid for example -rrb- is somewhere else .
well done , discovery .
keep it up .
john fielder , workington , uk there are a lot of negative comments on here by people who really have not done their research .
there are so many inventions that have come to be due to space travel most are indirect , technology passed to the public after it has been created to aid nasa and the like in various projects .
adam ransom , birmingham space flight is one of the things that most excites me jehuda arieh veenman , haifa , israel space flight is one of the things that most excites me .
it breaks my heart that foam broke off the insulation again .
apparently , the design has a basic flaw ; the vulnerable heat shield is exposed to a bombardment of debris falling of during take off .
in the more old fashioned designs , the heat shields were protected during take off .
jehuda arieh veenman , haifa , israel it seems to me that the logical fix for the launch system would be to mount the shuttle higher relative to the fuel tank .
the coldness of the fuel is always going to be a problem in causing freezing of water and air in and around the foam insulation .
since that is the nature of the beast , get the shuttle out of harms way above the possible falling debris nigel dandridge-perry , los angeles ca , usa good luck discovery , i look forward to seeing a safe flight back to earth .
mark , dorset there is no progress with manned missions .
it 's more of the same .
while unmanned missions are discovering lakes of water on mars , landing on distant moons and exploring planets , the manned missions are trying to work out how to stop foam falling off the fuel tank .
leave floating around in orbit to the chinese and get exploring .
matt , amsterdam , the netherlands -lrb- ex .
uk -rrb- the shuttle programme shows the greatness the human race can achieve when we focus d ward , portsmouth those who fly orbiters know the risks and accept the challenge .
the shuttle programme shows the greatness the human race can achieve when we focus .
a commitment should be made to give it whatever financial support it needs to continue .
nasa tv shows discovery 's latest mission is gripping .
we owe it to those astronauts who have lost their lives in space exploration , to carry on the work that they could n't finish .
d ward , portsmouth i have become addicted to nasa tv over the last few days , and find myself staring into space , thinking of discovery up there somewhere ... looking back on our little planet from a distance .
i am surely concerned about the debris ; remember nasa did not think this would be a problem for the ill-fated columbia crew either .
they have spent two years and thousands of dollars on this problem - so yes , i think we should be concerned , not only about the debris ' implications , but also that nasa got it wrong again .
verity worthington , bewdley , worcestershire hundreds of years ago people were afraid that they could sail off the edges of the earth .
thank heavens there were brave sailors then willing to push the limits of courage and technology , and thank heavens we still have them today .
i 'm also grateful that there are still those willing to fund such expeditions .
rob g. , kansas city , usa the disaster 2 years ago , and these recent problems with the shuttle show that nasa really need to get on with developing the next generation of re-useable shuttles .
technology has moved on so much in the nearly 30 years since it was developed with computer technology and new lightweight materials .
if they do n't , then the private space firms will take over , while nasa keeps flogging a dead horse .
tane piper , edinburgh , uk we are all with you , looking forward for success .
god be with you .
no surrender no retreat .
martin madulu , moshi - tanzania i am more worried about the apparent loss of a tile than the foam .
if any of the tiles were damaged , the mission is in jeopardy .
after the columbia disaster , i read an article published in 1980 calling the shuttles ' death traps ' .
considering that we 've already lost half the fleet , i think it is high time nasa invested in a different , more robust technology .
istvan , detroit , usa the safety of the crew should be of utmost importance , not launch schedules ss , usa my family and i were vacationing in florida at the time of the launch .
we saw it speeding skyward from the car on our way back home .
i am an aerospace design engineer specializing in flight dynamics .
my concern really lies with the inadequacy with which nasa has dealt with the foam / tile problem .
the safety of the crew should be of utmost importance , not launch schedules .
ss , usa only those at nasa who have looked at the images of debris falling will have the best idea .
the crew 's safe return is just our concern but it 's their mission .
venkat maruthamuthu , urbana , il , usa why was this problem not resolved after columbia two years ago ?
it is very wrong to send yet more people up there without being absolutely sure that it 's safe .
perhaps space travel should wait until we have progressed far enough that we are not relying on tiles that can just fall off ?
catherine , cheshunt , herts great to see the shuttle soar again .
our future lies not on earth but out there somewhere .
no matter how you argue it , in the future this planet will die and so will all those life forms still on it .
if the human species is to survive , then it must do so elsewhere and this sort of technology is the first step towards that ultimate goal .
ian jordan , wokingham the foam formulation was changed in 1996 ... most of the foam issues started after this change bruce g , huntsville , usa this is not a trivial engineering problem as some have implied .
there are two types of foam : a lightweight foam covering the large areas of the tank and a dense ablator foam covering areas exposed to aerodynamic heating .
the foam is exposed to supersonic airflow at about 27000 km / h -lrb- 17000 mph -rrb- during launch .
there are shock cones coming from the orbiter , the connecting struts and solid boosters which impinge on the tank .
there is also a lot of vibration .
the foam formulation was changed in 1996 to comply with the montreal protocol and eliminate the freon propellant .
most of the foam issues started after this change and may or may not be associated with it .
the shuttle is due to be retired in 2010 and solving this problem is important for future spacecraft design .
bruce g , huntsville , usa why ca n't the return module be encased within the main take off rocket ?
this would prevent bits flying off from damaging it .
tony lee , telford we were on vacation in orlando , and had tickets for the astronaut hall of fame to watch the original scheduled lift-off on 13 july .
we had such a good view , but with about an hour or so to go , the launch was cancelled .
we were gutted to have missed such a spectacular sight !
we watched it on television back here in ireland , but felt we had a special bond with sts 114 - return to flight .
we just hope now for the safe return of the shuttle and its crew on 7 august .
good luck to them .
hutch family , ireland one day when someone is sipping cocktails on saturn 's lunar resort , whilst looking back at the earth and the distant sun , they 'll thank these brave people for risking their lives .
let 's keep our nerve , and not look back .
chris phillips , chelmsford , essex it is an inherent part of our nature to explore caroline , edinburgh , uk i used to work at one of the nasa centres -lrb- in maryland -rrb- and i hope that space exploration continues .
as a scientist it is an inherent part of our nature to explore , discover and find out about the unknown .
i was overjoyed to see the launch of discovery and hope , beyond all hope , that they make it safely home .
as nasa have said - " exploring space is not for the faint hearted ' - it 's a huge undertaking " .
the astronauts know that , we all know that .
these are very brave people and i wish them , and nasa , well with their endeavours .
caroline , edinburgh , uk watching this made me feel giddy .
now hopefully we can complete the iss and get on with the business of colonising space .
the spirit of adventure lives on with discovery and her crew .
david mills , ballymena , uk we were very privileged to be able to see discovery launch when it flew mission 105 and the impression it left us with was ' it was amazing to see ' .
we believe that the crew and the engineers will be able to work together and face the challenge of bringing back this magnificent ship .
instead of shrinking from the challenge we should rise up to it just as they did in 1970 for apollo 13 , it is only by stretching our knowledge such as in times of emergencies that we reach beyond our capabilities .
good luck and best wishes to the crew and engineers .
julie and robert , manchester , england i would like to see the shuttle retired and replaced with a newer fleet scott , edinburgh congratulations to nasa on another successful launch .
however , i would like to see the shuttle retired and replaced with a newer and more capable fleet of vehicles .
not only will it be safer and hugely beneficial to space exploration , the project would provide thousands of jobs , contracts to companies and benefit the global economy .
scott , edinburgh people seem to forget that manned space travel is still very dangerous and those brave astronauts know the risks .
foam has been falling off fuel tanks for nearly 25 years now .
perhaps money should now be invested in developing better glue and a more efficient reusable manned space travel system .
john ellis , nottingham statistically , if commercial flights carried the same risks as spaceflight , there would be about 500 airliner crashes per day .
one therefore has to applaud the courage and determination of those people who accept this degree of risk in pursuit of our quest for knowledge .
we are an inquisitive species , in this case pushing the boundaries of what is possible .
i wish those seven brave souls a safe return .
bob , cheshire i 've been following the ' space race ' since sputnik and the mercury missions , and i ca n't think of anything more exciting than a successful launch .
but why do n't we stop racing against each other and form stronger international collaborations to make space travel safer ?
j forman , los angeles , usa if nasa says the shuttle is safe to fly , it 's safe to fly james , los angeles , usa it amazes me how many observers believe they are more of an expert on shuttle safety and capability than the engineers at nasa .
the fact is , the men and women who work at nasa are at the top of their field .
if they say the shuttle is safe to fly , it 's safe to fly .
james , los angeles , usa it was a beautiful launch .
the space shuttle program has been remarkably successful despite the previous disaster .
nobody can engineer absolute perfection , but this was very close .
h neil , south texas , usa i am very concerned about the damaged tiles on discovery , especially in light of nasa 's apparent slowness in acknowledging that the take-off incident with columbia caused the disaster upon return .
there is an option for the crew of discovery - to wait on the space station for rescue .
how can we even contemplate risking their lives ?
if the problem is serious enough to ground the fleet , discovery too should be ' grounded ' immediately .
sharon , dallas , texas i once saw a presentation on how the challenger disaster came to happen and how it could have been prevented and it made my blood run cold .
suffice it to say , i have nothing but the most profound admiration for the courage of the crews of the shuttle .
i 'm not a religious man , but i just hope to god they all get back safely .
steve , chesham tragic as the columbia accident was , the astronauts died doing what they loved - exploring space , a privilege only the select few get to do .
they also died at the end of their trip so they got to enjoy being in space , unlike the challenger crew .
before the columbia accident , i would expect that the shuttles got through intact in much worse condition than discovery .
i am not that concerned , although i will follow the investigations with great interest .
ian , london it seems ridiculous that it is being jeopardised by something so simple chris , brazil the shuttle has been up and down into space about 50 times before the columbia incident .
i can not believe that bits of foam from the fuel tank did n't come off during these trips .
are n't nasa being a bit super cautious about this problem ?
ca n't they encase the fuel tank in some sort of wire mesh in order to prevent the foam from breaking off ?
in such a high tech programme , it seems ridiculous that it is being jeopardised by something so simple .
chris , brazil what exactly are they doing out there that they have not had the chance to do before ?
first of all get a new ship and then go somewhere else than the moon !
that impressed my grand father , it will take more to impress me !
mathieu , gatineau , canada bits of foam have probably been falling off the shuttle since the first launch , but it 's only since a piece of that debris caused the destruction of columbia two years ago that anyone has noticed !
only now we have cameras watching every single part of the craft do we see what may well have been happening all along .
carry on as normal .
simon , peterborough , uk i remember watching the first ever shuttle flight as a kid .
i watched the launch the other day and got the exact same feelings of awe and excitement .
the shuttle launch is a wake up call to everyone .
sure the world has problems right now but despite those problems , look what we 're capable of !
my message to nasa , the esa and all the other agencies ?
keep going people .
take us there !
andrew k jones , wrexham , uk i watched the launch live on the internet and was overwhelmed .
we wo n't know of the mission 's success until 7 aug , but what surprises me is the us way of making everything big and the huge overhead costs .
it 's all show and little substance .
after having spent $ 1 billion and 2.5 years on the debris falling cause , they are back to square one and the shuttles are grounded again !
on the other hand the russians are making safe manned space missions with pinpoint accuracy every 3-6 months at a fraction of the cost .
rakesh , london uk without space exploration we would not have computers , hi-technology materials etc jim kirk , basildon i read once that spending on cosmetics in the usa dwarfs the nasa budget .
let 's get things in perspective .
without space exploration we would not have computers , hi-technology materials etc , all of which were a by-product .
if more is learned about our planet and its self-destructive population on each mission then we should keep it going .
come home safe guys !
jim kirk , basildon does anyone know why debris falls off a multi-million dollar spacecraft ?
ca n't some sort of outer layer be put around the fuel tank insulation to stop it disintegrating ?
i 'm not an engineer - i need someone else to explain it !
robert , sussex rather than risking the crew and the shuttle , if it is damaged , why do n't they leave it up there as service vehicle and bring the crew back in another shuttle at a later date ?
if nasa wants to survive they need to start making people believe in them again .
good luck discovery !
paul , london the space shuttle was under funded during its design and construction and the compromises mean it will never achieve its true potential .
the sooner it can be replaced with something newer and simpler the better .
david patrick , reading trying to make space exploration 100 % safe is just nonsense .
duncan , nottingham my heart sank when i heard the news that tiles had once again fallen off the space shuttle roger campbell , england my heart sank when i heard the news that tiles had once again fallen off the space shuttle .
if the cause of the tiles falling off is simply the vibration and air flow , then i wonder what will be the effect of the searing heat of re-entry .
roger campbell , england having watched the space shuttle launch on tv , it is good to see such a majestic craft finally back to what she was meant to do .
well done nasa for getting the space shuttle flying .
james , nottingham no-one made that big a deal when tiles were missing from the oms pods after columbia 's maiden flight in 1981 .
when designing this vehicle they must have made a risk assessment to determine safety parameters , and unfortunately the loss of columbia has made them refine these parameters further .
tim parker , edinburgh we watched the launch from our beach , about 90 miles away .
it was spectacular .
there are many more cameras watching the exterior shuttle craft than ever before which have alerted to the problems .
the engineers working for nasa are tireless and will get the current crew back safely one way or another .
the space programme will continue .
the only unknown is manned flights .
the mars rovers are still sending pictures and information long past when they were suppose to .
nasa will continue on and i believe has more government funding this year , or is due for an increase .
private companies are currently working on safe space travel for human passengers in the us and abroad i believe .
joan york , daytona beach , florida usa nasa 's team on the ground and the astronauts in the space are doing a great job for the mankind syed mateen , karachi , pakistan i have witnessed the launching of space shuttle discovery on television screen .
nasa 's team on the ground and the astronauts in the space are doing a great job for the mankind , as their experiences in the space will benefit the entire world .
i pray for the safe return of the astronauts and happy landing of the space shuttle .
as a human being , i am equally concerned about the debris which has fallen at the time of its blast , but hope that the space shuttle will not face the same problem as it did in the past .
the safe return of discovery will boost the moral of nasa 's team , who had worked day and night to make the space shuttle 's mission possible .
syed mateen , karachi , pakistan any country with ambitions to have manned missions to space would be more than happy to have a craft as good as the space shuttle .
if there is a cheaper way to break away from earth than i am all for it but i am not sure how much safer it will be .
exploration has always been a dangerous business .
erik , ft .
collins , u.s.a. manned space flight is a dangerous and expensive anachronism .
look at the success of hubble , the mars rovers and the cassini / huygens mission .
you can do 10 times as much real science for half the cost and no risk to life by concentrating on unmanned space exploration .
and tell me , were n't the pictures of titan far more exciting than anything the crew of the shuttle are likely to get up to ?
max , abu dhabi , uae i read some of the comments here with disbelief .
yes , we all know that there are problems in some areas of the world , it does n't however mean that everything has to stop because of that .
i can think of a lot more things which are more of a waste than space exploration .
i 'll bet half the people complaining about nasa being wasteful drive gas guzzlers and do n't bother to recycle .
the shuttle mission is vital to all areas of science and i 'm glad it is flying again .
the space shuttle is not an old machine ; discovery has only flown 30 times before .
most commercial airlines fly that often in a week !
dave , slough , uk many congratulations to nasa .
as a teacher i teach children who are fascinated by space .
it is good that the space missions continue .
it allows children to hope and dream that they might reach the stars themselves , one day !
michelle , birmingham we all know that it costs millions of dollars to support the space program .
one could argue that money could be better spent elsewhere .
the fact is we as human beings need to understand in order to learn new technologies and space exploration is just one of many things that need to be understood and conquered .
there will always be many arguments for and against the space program .
all i can say right now is well done to nasa and my best wishes for a truly successful return to space flight for discovery .
andrew howlett , cape town , south africa good luck and a safe landings to the crew of the discovery .
there are some here that would have the usa quit funding the space program until all the worlds ' problems are solved .
will you tell your children to wait for that day before pursuing their dreams ?
michael rosenbaum , san francisco , usa a plane crash or 9/11 does not stop air travel , so why should the columbia 2003 disaster stop space exploration ?
i 'm sure discovery will make it back safe and the astronauts will be given a well-deserved pat on the back .
jack , london / memphis the shuttle might be old but it still works , and has done the world a huge service towards on earth and in space exploration .
those who complain are clearly members of the flat earth society , and yet i bet they use technology every day ?
someone has to push the envelope .
go nasa go !
phil w , uk good launch .
let 's just hope she comes back in one piece .
ricardo , brazil the shuttles are aged dinosaurs that need to be " moth balled " before more lives are lost due to fragmenting styrofoam .
perhaps we should all consider shifting funding away from nasa and put it towards alternative fuel sources .
it would be revenue better spent .
kurt stuchell , cambridge , usa scuttle the shuttle gordon , auckland nz scuttle the shuttle !
obsolete equipment supplying a pointless lab .
much fanfare about increasing aid to africa by $ 25b but us military budget $ 400b makes you ill !
gordon , auckland nz i can not stand the mentality of myopic people who would rather we abandon the natural impulse to explore our surroundings , and instead focus on futile efforts to tackle every mundane earthbound problem .
surely , the sight of the shuttle blasting off into orbit is the most poignant statement of mankind 's destiny .
kevin , charlotte , north carolina , usa with so much bad news in the media : terrorism , war , poverty ... it 's wonderful to see what we as human beings can achieve , when we put our minds to something positive .
we have the potential to achieve great things .
the crew of this shuttle mission are from different countries , cultures and backgrounds ; proof that if we work together , we can produce something that makes us all proud .
charlie , newcastle , uk to all those who claim the space programme has helped advance medicine and technology . think how much further along in those fields we could be if all the money wasted at nasa went into development . let alone feeding the poor .
shameful waste of resources .
i do n't want my tax dollar to be spent this way .
p. o 'donnell , rotorua , n.z. there are always small-minded people who are terrified of exploration digby knight , henley-on-thames , uk there are always small-minded people who are terrified of exploration .
if we had their way , we 'd still be living in trees afraid of the dangerous savannah !
thankfully we 've always had a few who have done their best to pioneer new territories and worlds .
digby knight , henley-on-thames , uk i would argue that nasa is somewhat of an anachronism .
the " glory days " of the space race with russia are over .
instead , space exploration should be run by the national science foundation .
there , private and public money can be better organized to fund missions .
the nsf already runs most of the science stations here on earth .
why should space be any different ?
greg , alexandria , va space exploration * is * a waste of money .
had the billions been invested directly in more down-to-earth technologies , we would have seen the same spin-offs in medicine , it , and transport .
anonymous i ca n't believe the childish reactions to space exploration from folks like mike and anon , uk .
grow up , guys .
space exploration represents humanity at its most amazing .
you 're obviously just bitter because the us is leading the way .
typical .
shawn , washington , dc , usa exploration , of all kinds , has always helped man push the boundaries of technology .
the space programme is no different .
for this reason alone it is invaluable .
jason , detroit , usa despite all the delays and expert checks , something still fell off it on take off dan , yateley , uk looking at the shuttle i am always reminded of those creaking old 50 's and 60 's airliners you still see rattling around developing countries .
good in their day , but now so ropey and tired that they just scream " death trap " .
it says it all about the shuttle that despite all the delays and expert checks , something still fell off it on take off .
it 's high time this heap was scrapped , and a replacement worthy of the 21st century was introduced in its place .
dan , yateley , uk so the new ufos are unidentified falling objects ?
phil jones , frangy , france if you watch the film of the launch the piece of debris that falls off after the booster rocket drops off does not come from the shuttle it comes from the giant fuel tank , which is ' disposable ' anyway .
john nichols , brackley , nnorthants , uk how would brits feel if americans were talking about how britain should spend its money ?
michelle , raleigh , nc i think that nasa is still too hurried in launching the shuttle when the debris problem still exists .
maybe they should solve out the problem wholly before doing any thing else .
but the fact still shows that nasa has succeeded in launching the shuttle into space .
maybe that 's an incredible luck , although we still do n't know about the return of it .
but i believe it will succeed , too .
god 's will give luck to the crew .
nguyen hoang giang , hanoi , vietnam i just pray she makes it back down ok seun , london uk it was an excellent feeling seeing discovery go like that yesterday .
i am really happy for nasa and i just pray she makes it back down ok , that will be the icing on the cake .
seun , london uk oh dear !
the usa are off again trying to show how they can spend billions on space exploration , meanwhile trying to flex its muscles all around the world causing chaos- unbelievable !
mike , uk mankind is not content with polluting the earth !
it now wants to pollute space as well !
how sad !
millions starve while the usa burns dollars - what for ?
it truly is a sick world we live in these days !
anon , uk to anon , uk - the fuel is clean and non polluting - just water produced .
and as for waste of money - tell me about the dome and the london olympics .
longer term , i know what is more valuable !
george , chelmsford i 'm so glad to see the space programme resume shuttle launches .
space research is costly , but it 's like buying a lottery ticket - you never know what you 're going to get back from it , but once you go out there , there 's a chance you might win big .
and we already have - people have cited the benefits that have come from the space programme .
here 's to more exploration outside our atmosphere !
tony , london , uk i felt privileged to have been in florida for the launch .
it went off on time and from what i gather from reports , was perfect .
it 's something to tell the grandkids one day .
marylyn , london space travel fires the imagination !
tim goodchild , surrey space travel fires the imagination !
to all those that criticise that the shuttle is old and the fact that its had two failures should perhaps think again the next time they board a 747 on route to their holiday destination .
tim goodchild , surrey absolutely fantastic pictures from discovery , especially when the external fuel tank was detached from the shuttle with the curvature of the earth in the background .
overall great launch , well done nasa .
paul , coventry , uk the american space programme is a great achievement and it is important that it continues .
the human race is capable of great things and it is not in our nature to keep still .
terry , crewe , cheshire my gosh !
the people saying the space program is a waste of money ? !
the commercial products used now as a result of nasa are staggering .
cat scans , dialysis machines , materials in your athletic shoes , water purification technology , cordless power tools , cool suits for firefighters , physical therapy equipment .
the list goes on .
the program is invaluable !
eric , usa i think its well worth the effort and money to sustain humans in space carl lennon , northampton , uk most of the people on here with negative comments do not realise how much space has done for humanity .
many medical experiments have been conducted in space which was the only place that it could be done .
the results of these experiments have saved thousands if not millions of lives .
i think its well worth the effort and money to sustain humans in space .
carl lennon , northampton , uk although america has proven itself to be the world 's best engineers , nasa is living on past glory .
many of its best scientists and engineers have left , it is no longer in the public limelight unless it has a disaster , and it is grossly underfunded .
america should reinvigorate the program with major new investment and ambitious new goals or shut it down .
as the eu space agency has recently learned , you ca n't explore space on the cheap .
this old technology and this antiquated worn out hardware needs to be retired along with the mediocre management which has taken over .
mark , usa what a novel way to distract your nation from the real problems at home and abroad .
the cost does n't matter since the nation is paying the bill .
ed , canada there are those who say space exploration is a waste of money .
on the contrary , space travel forces society to stretch and reach further in order to solve highly complex problems associated with putting man into space .
the solutions to these problems are broad and serve mankind in many ways .
the space program enables us to move forward faster than we otherwise would .
without such large goals our advancement slows and we become lazy .
david , philadelphia , usa come on people , of course sending people into space is dangerous and expensive .
that does n't mean we should n't do it though .
even if space exploration did not lead to technical advances and practical application , it would still be worth it .
why ?
because it 's cool .
we put a man on the moon , that 's pretty impressive considering just prior to wwi a man could only travel as far as a horse could take him .
stu , st paul , usa the view from the fuel tank at over 14000mph was fantastic !
rod aries , glasgow the view from the fuel tank at over 14000mph was fantastic !
why are n't other space agencies doing this for the public ?
engage us !
rod aries , glasgow every time i see a rocket launch i think that newton made it possible ; his equations are still used to calculate the orbit .
how many other things in use today were invented over 300 years ago ?
vic , uk a sense of pride mixed with concern .
i live near the johnson space center and have relatives that have worked in the program as far back as gemini and apollo .
the space program is much more than a news story to us .
to those who think the space program is a waste of money : there is so much innovation and research that goes on behind the scenes that you 'd change your opinion if you took the time to look at what nasa has accomplished over the years and continues to accomplish today .
paul , houston , tx well , i 'm relieved it 's up there .
but they still seem to have this gung-ho attitude to safety .
i could n't believe that after killing two crews they are still happy to launch with a known serious fault .
chris hann , bay area , ca , usa congratulations to nasa on a successful launch .
i 'm glad to see that some nations still recognise the value of dreaming and aspiring to do great things and inspire their young people .
the money spent of spaceflight is miniscule compared to the many benefits .
it 's sad here in the uk that people are so ignorant and short-sighted with regards to space exploration that we ca n't see the good that can from it - and then we wonder the younger generations are n't interested in science , medicine and technology .
victor , birmingham , england this launch showed the world what can be accomplished with great teamwork , ambition and determination d soni , nuneaton , uk i watched the launch and was overcome with pride .
all the people involved in this great feat have overcome extreme obstacles .
this launch showed the world what can be accomplished with great teamwork , ambition and determination .
congratulations discovery !
d soni , nuneaton , uk mankind needs a vision .
interplanetary travel is necessary to achieve that end .
stuart haines , calgary , alberta , canada it 's time to junk the space shuttle and perhaps " rethink " this whole business of manned space flight for the time being .
think about it , other than as a showy display of national pride , what benefits do any nations get at this time from sending humans into space ?
perhaps in the future when we have real goals and reliable " safe " transportation we can start wasting our time and money with such " propaganda flights " , but now is n't the time and place for such foolishness .
charlie , niagara falls new york people always complain that space programs are too expensive , but do people appreciate how much safer the planet is with them ?
we can monitor dangerous weather , asteroids , and send tv , radio , and telephone signals via satellites .
space programs really have helped the planet excel in a positive way , and i 'm glad the discovery is finally continuing what has already been a remarkable feat of engineering .
tim hunt -lrb- 16 -rrb- , plymouth , england in these days darkened by the spectre of global terrorism , we seek hope and strength in many places .
the fog of war and the wind that whispers the question of " why are we fighting in the middle east ? ' diminish our confidence in our government .
today 's launch of the shuttle discovery renews our hope and faith in our abilities to overcome tragedy and defy adversity .
we owe the entire nasa family a debt of gratitude for restoring our faith in the human spirit .
paul telfer , franceville , gabon we need a new way of going to the stars clive , dartford , uk i wish the crew well on the mission , but the shuttle is old and just like any aircraft , it has its life expectancy and this bird has reached it .
we need a new way of going to the stars and to ditch the big firework approach to it .
clive , dartford , uk sure , okay .
maybe the shuttle programme is old .
maybe it should be scrapped for something better .
but , it is all we have at the moment .
and to all of you here who keep telling us to get rid of it , i have n't heard one of you say anything about putting up any money with us to fund a new programme .
jon , atlanta , usa what nasa needs is a real life scotty character to sort these technical issues out .
paul collier , london , uk the truth is that the shuttle concept has proved to be too expensive and technically complex to be the way forward in space .
i am pro-space exploration but the shuttle has slowed this to a crawl , and all the best work has been done by probes boosted by rockets e.g. mars landers , titan probes etc .
andy , uk " space is expensive ! " cry the critics .
i wish they would angle their criticism at a truly scandalous target .
the entire space programme to date has cost less than what the world spends on arms every year .
i know which i think is better value for money .
bernard o. quinn , barcelona , catalonia the exploration of space will continue with us or without us scott westwood , port orchard , wa , usa the shuttle is expensive , outdated and despite nasa 's assurances , its safety is still uncertain ; but it 's the only game in town .
the exploration of space will continue with us or without us ; to sit on the sidelines and watch others go up would be unthinkable for an america that prides itself on being a superpower .
scott westwood , port orchard , wa , usa space exploration is essential for the future of all humans .
flying over the atlantic was at first a risky endeavour and now it is done by millions every year without a thought for the early pioneers and the planes that never arrived .
colin , croydon , uk i do not understand all these people saying that america should scrap the shuttle , and spend it on ' the world ' .
the us is already the single largest contributor of foreign aid .
the us space program has helped everyday life for billions of people around the world , and churned out invention after invention for the world .
bill zimmer , seattle , wa congratulations to all those involved in discovery 's return to space !
to all the naysayers , next time you are browsing the internet on your pc , take a moment to find out what drove the development of semiconductors that power your pc .
yes , the space exploration that you think is a waste of money !
roger , london tears came to my eyes and i held my breath colleen , orlando , fl usa we were in the parking lot facing east , waiting and whispering to each other .
the first person to see the shuttle clearing the trees threw up their hand to point it out and some of the men started yelling , " go , baby , go ! " and cheering .
tears came to my eyes and i held my breath .
the space program has done so much to improve our lives in the fields of health and science , they further our knowledge of our environment and how our magnificent planet works .
colleen , orlando , fl usa go discovery !
the future of humanity is in space .
as an american living abroad , the lift-off of discovery is the first event that makes me proud to be american since leaving my country .
i hope that this success will lead to the completion of the iss and the continued exploration of space .
daniel valenti , canberra , australia people forget that we belong to this planet earth , in that our physical bodies are perfectly adapted to survive only on the earth .
we could never survive on other planets without extensive artificial aids .
as many have already pointed out , there are many , many more pressing needs requiring resolution and funds should be redirected where they are most needed for our survival on our home planet .

the crew on board the space shuttle have conducted inspections of discovery 's belly and repairs to the shuttle have also been carried out .
stephen robinson has begun a unique spacewalk , going under the orbiter 's belly to remove two ceramic strips sticking out between heatshield tiles .
nasa engineers are concerned the strips would cause part of discovery to overheat as it re-enters the earth 's atmosphere .
discovery had been due to return to earth on 7 august , but nasa has decided to extend the mission by an extra day .
what do you think of the mission so far ?
how do you feel about the mission being extended ?
what do you think about the repairs ?

this debate is now closed .
read a selection of your comments below .
click here to read a second page of your comments the following comments reflect the balance of opinion we have received so far : the money that is spent by the american government on space exploration could be much better spent on healthcare and education .
this would be much more beneficial to the american people than discovery 's mission .
carolynne burkholder , vancouver , british columbia i can not believe that the crew had to cobble together a hacksaw norman west , truro , cornwall i can not believe that the crew had to cobble together a hacksaw .
a small box of tools from any diy shop would have done the job .
also removing a gap filler between the tiles exposes a gap .
surely the wind can get in and potentially lift a tile causing a fatal problem .
norman west , truro , cornwall whilst i can see that advances may be made through this work , i saw two items on the news last night - one about children dying because they have n't got a few quid , the other about spending millions on keeping the shuttles going in and out of space .
priority check please .
mark , didcot , england space travel is dangerous , pioneers are going to die , but it is worthwhile .
what is needed now are new spaceships to let us travel between planets .
at the moment all our eggs are in one basket , we need to find other homes on other worlds .
we have made this one nearly uninhabitable .
i would go into space whatever the risk .
ruth , walsall maybe if all the countries stopped being so petty and pooled their resources , we 'd have superior technology and fewer incidents like this .
we do n't need to race against each other anymore to try and prove who 's superior ; instead we should look to a future of co-operation .
gaz , cardiff , uk i will never understand why we waste so much money on primitive space stations john gearing , st. helens , uk i will never understand why we waste so much money on primitive space stations and shuttles which clearly have no function for the human race at this time .
i do n't know why we do n't get all our experts and fund them in coming up with unmanned technologies and technology in shuttles that could take us to planets not to a tin can in the sky which is over expensive and serves no function to the mass population .
john gearing , st. helens , uk fascinating a brit would ask the question why the us is sending people into space .
as the brit , george mallory said in 1924 , " because its there " .
mt everest killed mallory and we remember him for his quest .
in a similar quest , the us will continue to go into space - because its there .
john b , windermere , florida do some of these contributors have no soul ?
what could be more magnificent than seeing human beings taking risks to explore the unknown ; triumphing over the problems they meet along the way ; opening up new horizons for the rest of us ?
yes let 's invest in a new space transportation system , and more manned flights , and unmanned probes and a bigger , better space station .
but to claim that stopping the current flights is sensible shows no faith in the species at all .
stop looking down at the ground and start looking up at the stars .
john r smith , uk please , armchair scientists , let the experts at nasa do their job making the risk calculations .
they 've got the know-how and the tools to make the decisions .
not you or me .
joe , usa this is the most ridiculous expenditure of precious funds in a time of great national travail .
nasa is an anachronism , a patronistic pet rock that has no justification whatsoever , especially in the current environment in which civilized societies are fighting for their mere existence .
the irresponsibility in launching this mission in the face of known deficiencies is appalling .
c. a. la varre , newport , ri usa the media paints such a doom and gloom picture of what is happening above us phil , hampshire , uk why-oh-why does the media take such a negative view to what the men and women on sts114 are doing .
the media paints such a doom and gloom picture of what is happening above us .
we as a united world should watch and praise these people who are up there performing the most fantastic things known to mankind .
yes there is a difficult time coming on returning to earth but the crew at this time seem very positive about it .
may i suggest that you all watch nasa tv on the web for real live happenings .
phil , hampshire , uk nasa is undergoing drastic changes .
i think the us should pause and take stock of what 's happening to their space missions .
give it a break , sort out problems and return 10years later .
i wonder how the us ever landed man on the moon ?
did they really ?
i wonder !
errol , dubai , uae space flight is still in its infancy .
so the fact that an astronaut was able to make a repair to the shuttle in space is a great triumph .
nasa should look on this feat in a positive light , not a negative one .
we know in the days of sailing ships as they travelled the globe to discover new lands , there were many times when sailors had to climb up masts in storms to make repairs , so is repairing space craft in flight any different ?
leon aarons , petach israel another piece of space theatre , justifying manned flight .
unmanned craft can put payloads into orbit much more cheaply , as well as exploring other planets .
martin , dubai , uae i 've just seen a picture of the tool , held together with strong tape that the astronauts used .
it 's great to imagine that a billion-dollar aircraft can be saved by a bit of strong tape and some elbow grease !
it 's that sort of thinking that 's saved astronauts in the past .
good luck to them , hope humans carry on going into space for many more years .
dave , manchester , uk this spacewalk and repair demonstrates two things .
firstly , the courage and initiative of the astronauts , secondly , the importance of retiring the ageing shuttle fleet and building a modern spacecraft .
electronics and materials technology have advanced tremendously in the past 30 years , but the shuttle is still using outdated technology .
gordon mcstraun , uk so , the offending piece if gap filler from between a couple of heat shields .
i 'm no nasa expert , but does n't this mean that the is now a gap between these tiles ?
michael , bucks , uk the astronauts are all volunteers , they know the risks involved , and that is why i praise and thank them kirsty , cambridge , uk i think it is fantastic that discovery has launched and its mission is going well .
a lesson has been learnt from colombia , and indeed , challenger .
the astronauts are all volunteers , they know the risks involved , and that is why i praise and thank them .
they are incredible people .
kirsty , cambridge , uk so what if the filler problem has to be fixed with a jerry-rigged hacksaw ?
this type of ingenuity has been saving lives since the age of tall ships and can only reflect well on the tenacity of the nasa engineers and astronauts .
remember when the progress hit mir ?
apollo 13 ?
we need the experience of these problems to give us the know-how to survive in space and give us the confidence in our ability to solve problems on longer , bolder voyages .
tim parker , edinburgh , scotland i work with remote operated vehicles in the oil and gas industry .
i am amazed that the crew of the discovery need to cobble together a makeshift hacksaw to carry out a job on the tiles .
the shuttles are old and things will go wrong so you would expect a decent tool kit to be onboard .
james , paderne , portugal why are the americans still sending people into space ?
if they want to explore they should be thinking of unmanned flights with intelligent technology which can spend decades in space .
this should help the ozone layer repair itself .
more is needed to be done to explore and catalogue this planet and its systems , this will be of more benefit to mankind and our home than space travel .
haz , nottingham , uk is going up in the shuttle much more dangerous than sailing unknown oceans a few hundred years ago in wooden ships ?
thank goodness that throughout history not everyone has wanted to sit at home in comfort in their own small world .
simon , manchester , uk with so many comings and goings to and from iss , would it not be sensible for just the bare minimum of crew to return in this shuttle and send up a half-empty shuttle to collect the rest of them ?
why take unnecessary risks ?
fraser irving , sheffield , uk until now , the shuttle missions have been routine , like taking a walk in the park .
but the reality of danger with the loss of two shuttles has almost brought the space program to its knees .
should it continue ?
of course it must go on because too much is at stake .
closing the space station , and not looking into space is the worst we can do .
life on earth is becoming dangerous .
we must look to the stars if humanity is to survive .
walter , chapel hill , nc i think - and hope - this flight is one of the safest ever .
my guess is the problems have appeared simply because they have been looking for them far more carefully than before .
however , there 's no doubt a replacement spacecraft is needed .
the private " space ship one " has a slow re-entry , avoiding thermal problems .
is this possible from orbit ?
and a separate , unmanned cargo vehicle seems a " no-brainer " .
simon , bristol it must be frightening for the astronauts but the space programme must prevail anya , london pioneers always take risks so that everyone else can eventually follow .
it must be frightening for the astronauts but the space programme must prevail .
updated technology is definitely needed .
unmanned missions are a good idea , but ultimately there is no substitute for human actions and reactions .
anya , london interesting to note that the two shuttle losses have not been due to design or engineering flaws in the shuttle themselves , but rather the propulsion system .
for 30 year old vehicles , i think the shuttles are doing pretty well , and i am sure they will continue for a long time .
matt , bristol space exploration is dangerous and the crew knows this better than any of us - and they still volunteered for it .
my view is that we need to continue to explore space and the shuttle repair should be seen as an experience that needs to be faced at some time .
let 's not be weak about this .
george , chelmsford what nasa has done is simply awesome .
nasa is the adventurer of our era , looking at and investigating things that are far bigger than us .
i say ground the space shuttles , but do not skimp on quickly building bigger , better , and safer spacecraft to replace them .
sk , ithaca , ny space technology is too integrated in our daily lives now peter byrd , worcester the few people who mock space projects should not use anything connected with space technology as a protest !
i bet hardly anyone would manage it or really want to .
space technology is too integrated in our daily lives now ; we all enjoy the advantages we get from it .
nasa tv via the net alone shows me how wonderful space is .
peter byrd , worcester i have just returned from florida where i was privileged enough to witness the breathtaking launch first hand .
it seems as though there are increasing difficulties using these shuttles .
are the lives of 7 astronauts each time it takes off a risk that is worth taking ?
matt , london given the loss of columbia and the uncertainty of this mission , nasa should scrap the shuttle programme .
luck prevented previous disasters and it would appear nasa 's luck has run out .
what makes them feel confident that they can repair in space what they failed to repair in two years on the ground ?
my thoughts are with the families of those on the iss .
phil , bracknell , uk the problems with discovery must have been encountered with all the previous shuttle flights .
it appears that each time it took off , it was russian roulette as to whether it would return safely .
this program should be abandoned until a new and safer means of transporting the shuttle into space can be developed .
chris , brazil will the resulting depression between the tiles create a possibility of a chink in the armour ?
k chowksey , bangalore , india even if the pieces sticking out are pulled or hacked , will the resulting depression between the tiles create a possibility of a chink in the armour ?
even a depression can alter the aerodynamic behaviour -lrb- as in golf balls -rrb- .
this will create uneven heat distribution .
k chowksey , bangalore , india from the idealists point of view we really should not be thinking about costs here .
space exploration is vital , not only to our technological development as a species , but also in terms of our wider understanding of the universe .
the whole nasa infrastructure is quite frankly awesome .
every endeavour has its risks and we 've seen the tragic consequences of those risks with the previous accidents .
chris , bracknell we need to explore space ; when you go to hospital and have a cat scan or an mri , that technology has come from the space program .
there is nothing wrong with the shuttle - the problem is with the way it is maintained .
they need to do better , i do n't know why do n't they paint it again , and seal the foam .
carol , pa , usa the saddest thing for me about this mission is that the next time the iss is visible from england on august 11th , the shuttle will have already left .
hopefully we 'll get to see the shuttle during the next mission .
after the moon , the iss is the brightest object in the night sky .
john airey , peterborough i looked at the images of the underside of the shuttle and thought that it looked like really bad bathroom tiling rob , spain major advances need to be made to the whole concept of effective re-entry heat-shield technology .
even before lift-off , i looked at the images of the underside of the shuttle and thought that it looked like really bad bathroom tiling .
initially , i expected it to be a smooth , seamless surface , but it was a patchwork of light and dark areas with patches that looked more raised than others .
i assume that tiles are the best option at the moment , but in future this issue needs to be solved completely .
rob , spain if nasa has decided to just rip out the relatively small strips protruding from between the heat shield tiles , then why ca n't they ask astronaut steve robinson to take his experimental repair kit out with him and fill the gaps with the mastic gum that they used to ' fix ' the tiles in their earlier experiments ?
paul greer , gothenburg , sweden i worked as an engineer on skylab in the 70s and i consider this nasa debacle a disgrace .
unknown risk is one thing , but gambling with lives on known problems with solutions is unacceptable .
i say : bring some crew home in russian capsule , leave the rest of the crew up there , fix the foam on atlantis -lrb- and everything else possible -rrb- and then send a rescue mission .
then ground the antiques and use modern technology to build new spacecraft .
rich dusek , orchard lake , mi , us bruce from huntsville says it 's not a trivial engineering problem and he 's probably right .
but that does n't alter the documented fact that nasa has sent people into space against the advice of contractors who have told them that certain aspects are n't safe .
if shuttles are prone to bits falling off then they should n't be flying .
david , chelmsford uk nasa do n't build all the parts and therefore an outside company may be partly responsible james , uk why do people expect space travel to be perfectly safe ?
look at any picture of launch and remember the orange tank is full of fuel and both white rockets once started ca n't be stopped .
man in space is an essential part of our future .
the earth can not sustain us forever particularly its natural resources .
i also think people should recognise that nasa do n't build all the parts and therefore an outside company may be partly responsible .
james , uk the problems with the space transportation system are a classic example of what happens when whole-life costs are not taken into account during early design phases of the system .
congress chose to buy shuttle on the cheap , opting for solid fuel boosters and a disposable fuel tank instead of spending extra money upfront to design a fully-reusable fly-back first stage to take the orbiter into space .
the result has been far higher operating costs and , tragically , the loss of fourteen astronauts .
will it be too much to hope that senior agency managers and politicians will learn these lessons in defining our future access to space ?
in europe as well as the usa .
phil , bath , uk so far this particular mission has been very worrying for relatives of the discovery crew .
any venture into space is a risk , but this one seems to have gone ahead knowing this risk factor was much higher than usual .
why are these missions so important ?
the risk factor is too great to risk innocent lives .
stop them now .
jose a holmes , loughborough , england i wish the crew a safe return but am sorry to see resources wasted on a manned flight with little real value for essentially political and pr reasons while much more scientifically valuable unmanned work is scaled back to pay for it .
this is all about the advancement of the usa , not science .
julian , london , uk the debris issue has been present in the shuttle programme from day one .
the tiles themselves are so fragile you can break them with one hand .
the space shuttle is a wonderful vehicle , but sadly owing to it 's bizarre design , is inherently dangerous and needs to be replaced soon .
as richard feynman said after the challenger disaster , " for a successful technology , reality must take precedence over public relations , for nature can not be fooled . "
chris dyer , bristol , england the immediate future of the space program will be best served by robot missions dr malcolm fairbairn , uk / sweden i , like most people connected with astrophysics , think that the immediate future of the space program will be best served by robot missions for at least the next twenty years .
it 's not taking a step backwards ; it 's about developing and testing new technologies which will eventually be applied to human spaceflight .
for the same amount of money you get much more science done with robotic missions because you do n't have to worry about the fragile humans .
dr malcolm fairbairn , uk / sweden as an aerospace engineer , in this particular instance i am not worried about discovery .
all indications are that the debris did no damage .
long term , though , it could be a problem .
the space shuttle has never fulfilled the promises that were made for it .
it is an expensive vehicle of very limited utility .
it consumes resources which could be better used elsewhere in the us space program .
andrew ogilvie , modesto , california , usa robert heinlein said it : " the earth is too small and fragile a basket for humanity to keep all its eggs in . "
the only safe place to be when disaster comes -lrb- an asteroid for example -rrb- is somewhere else .
well done , discovery .
keep it up .
john fielder , workington , uk there are a lot of negative comments on here by people who really have not done their research .
there are so many inventions that have come to be due to space travel most are indirect , technology passed to the public after it has been created to aid nasa and the like in various projects .
adam ransom , birmingham space flight is one of the things that most excites me jehuda arieh veenman , haifa , israel space flight is one of the things that most excites me .
it breaks my heart that foam broke off the insulation again .
apparently , the design has a basic flaw ; the vulnerable heat shield is exposed to a bombardment of debris falling of during take off .
in the more old fashioned designs , the heat shields were protected during take off .
jehuda arieh veenman , haifa , israel it seems to me that the logical fix for the launch system would be to mount the shuttle higher relative to the fuel tank .
the coldness of the fuel is always going to be a problem in causing freezing of water and air in and around the foam insulation .
since that is the nature of the beast , get the shuttle out of harms way above the possible falling debris nigel dandridge-perry , los angeles ca , usa good luck discovery , i look forward to seeing a safe flight back to earth .
mark , dorset there is no progress with manned missions .
it 's more of the same .
while unmanned missions are discovering lakes of water on mars , landing on distant moons and exploring planets , the manned missions are trying to work out how to stop foam falling off the fuel tank .
leave floating around in orbit to the chinese and get exploring .
matt , amsterdam , the netherlands -lrb- ex .
uk -rrb- the shuttle programme shows the greatness the human race can achieve when we focus d ward , portsmouth those who fly orbiters know the risks and accept the challenge .
the shuttle programme shows the greatness the human race can achieve when we focus .
a commitment should be made to give it whatever financial support it needs to continue .
nasa tv shows discovery 's latest mission is gripping .
we owe it to those astronauts who have lost their lives in space exploration , to carry on the work that they could n't finish .
d ward , portsmouth i have become addicted to nasa tv over the last few days , and find myself staring into space , thinking of discovery up there somewhere ... looking back on our little planet from a distance .
i am surely concerned about the debris ; remember nasa did not think this would be a problem for the ill-fated columbia crew either .
they have spent two years and thousands of dollars on this problem - so yes , i think we should be concerned , not only about the debris ' implications , but also that nasa got it wrong again .
verity worthington , bewdley , worcestershire hundreds of years ago people were afraid that they could sail off the edges of the earth .
thank heavens there were brave sailors then willing to push the limits of courage and technology , and thank heavens we still have them today .
i 'm also grateful that there are still those willing to fund such expeditions .
rob g. , kansas city , usa the disaster 2 years ago , and these recent problems with the shuttle show that nasa really need to get on with developing the next generation of re-useable shuttles .
technology has moved on so much in the nearly 30 years since it was developed with computer technology and new lightweight materials .
if they do n't , then the private space firms will take over , while nasa keeps flogging a dead horse .
tane piper , edinburgh , uk we are all with you , looking forward for success .
god be with you .
no surrender no retreat .
martin madulu , moshi - tanzania i am more worried about the apparent loss of a tile than the foam .
if any of the tiles were damaged , the mission is in jeopardy .
after the columbia disaster , i read an article published in 1980 calling the shuttles ' death traps ' .
considering that we 've already lost half the fleet , i think it is high time nasa invested in a different , more robust technology .
istvan , detroit , usa the safety of the crew should be of utmost importance , not launch schedules ss , usa my family and i were vacationing in florida at the time of the launch .
we saw it speeding skyward from the car on our way back home .
i am an aerospace design engineer specializing in flight dynamics .
my concern really lies with the inadequacy with which nasa has dealt with the foam / tile problem .
the safety of the crew should be of utmost importance , not launch schedules .
ss , usa only those at nasa who have looked at the images of debris falling will have the best idea .
the crew 's safe return is just our concern but it 's their mission .
venkat maruthamuthu , urbana , il , usa why was this problem not resolved after columbia two years ago ?
it is very wrong to send yet more people up there without being absolutely sure that it 's safe .
perhaps space travel should wait until we have progressed far enough that we are not relying on tiles that can just fall off ?
catherine , cheshunt , herts great to see the shuttle soar again .
our future lies not on earth but out there somewhere .
no matter how you argue it , in the future this planet will die and so will all those life forms still on it .
if the human species is to survive , then it must do so elsewhere and this sort of technology is the first step towards that ultimate goal .
ian jordan , wokingham the foam formulation was changed in 1996 ... most of the foam issues started after this change bruce g , huntsville , usa this is not a trivial engineering problem as some have implied .
there are two types of foam : a lightweight foam covering the large areas of the tank and a dense ablator foam covering areas exposed to aerodynamic heating .
the foam is exposed to supersonic airflow at about 27000 km / h -lrb- 17000 mph -rrb- during launch .
there are shock cones coming from the orbiter , the connecting struts and solid boosters which impinge on the tank .
there is also a lot of vibration .
the foam formulation was changed in 1996 to comply with the montreal protocol and eliminate the freon propellant .
most of the foam issues started after this change and may or may not be associated with it .
the shuttle is due to be retired in 2010 and solving this problem is important for future spacecraft design .
bruce g , huntsville , usa why ca n't the return module be encased within the main take off rocket ?
this would prevent bits flying off from damaging it .
tony lee , telford we were on vacation in orlando , and had tickets for the astronaut hall of fame to watch the original scheduled lift-off on 13 july .
we had such a good view , but with about an hour or so to go , the launch was cancelled .
we were gutted to have missed such a spectacular sight !
we watched it on television back here in ireland , but felt we had a special bond with sts 114 - return to flight .
we just hope now for the safe return of the shuttle and its crew on 7 august .
good luck to them .
hutch family , ireland one day when someone is sipping cocktails on saturn 's lunar resort , whilst looking back at the earth and the distant sun , they 'll thank these brave people for risking their lives .
let 's keep our nerve , and not look back .
chris phillips , chelmsford , essex it is an inherent part of our nature to explore caroline , edinburgh , uk i used to work at one of the nasa centres -lrb- in maryland -rrb- and i hope that space exploration continues .
as a scientist it is an inherent part of our nature to explore , discover and find out about the unknown .
i was overjoyed to see the launch of discovery and hope , beyond all hope , that they make it safely home .
as nasa have said - " exploring space is not for the faint hearted ' - it 's a huge undertaking " .
the astronauts know that , we all know that .
these are very brave people and i wish them , and nasa , well with their endeavours .
caroline , edinburgh , uk watching this made me feel giddy .
now hopefully we can complete the iss and get on with the business of colonising space .
the spirit of adventure lives on with discovery and her crew .
david mills , ballymena , uk we were very privileged to be able to see discovery launch when it flew mission 105 and the impression it left us with was ' it was amazing to see ' .
we believe that the crew and the engineers will be able to work together and face the challenge of bringing back this magnificent ship .
instead of shrinking from the challenge we should rise up to it just as they did in 1970 for apollo 13 , it is only by stretching our knowledge such as in times of emergencies that we reach beyond our capabilities .
good luck and best wishes to the crew and engineers .
julie and robert , manchester , england i would like to see the shuttle retired and replaced with a newer fleet scott , edinburgh congratulations to nasa on another successful launch .
however , i would like to see the shuttle retired and replaced with a newer and more capable fleet of vehicles .
not only will it be safer and hugely beneficial to space exploration , the project would provide thousands of jobs , contracts to companies and benefit the global economy .
scott , edinburgh people seem to forget that manned space travel is still very dangerous and those brave astronauts know the risks .
foam has been falling off fuel tanks for nearly 25 years now .
perhaps money should now be invested in developing better glue and a more efficient reusable manned space travel system .
john ellis , nottingham statistically , if commercial flights carried the same risks as spaceflight , there would be about 500 airliner crashes per day .
one therefore has to applaud the courage and determination of those people who accept this degree of risk in pursuit of our quest for knowledge .
we are an inquisitive species , in this case pushing the boundaries of what is possible .
i wish those seven brave souls a safe return .
bob , cheshire i 've been following the ' space race ' since sputnik and the mercury missions , and i ca n't think of anything more exciting than a successful launch .
but why do n't we stop racing against each other and form stronger international collaborations to make space travel safer ?
j forman , los angeles , usa if nasa says the shuttle is safe to fly , it 's safe to fly james , los angeles , usa it amazes me how many observers believe they are more of an expert on shuttle safety and capability than the engineers at nasa .
the fact is , the men and women who work at nasa are at the top of their field .
if they say the shuttle is safe to fly , it 's safe to fly .
james , los angeles , usa it was a beautiful launch .
the space shuttle program has been remarkably successful despite the previous disaster .
nobody can engineer absolute perfection , but this was very close .
h neil , south texas , usa i am very concerned about the damaged tiles on discovery , especially in light of nasa 's apparent slowness in acknowledging that the take-off incident with columbia caused the disaster upon return .
there is an option for the crew of discovery - to wait on the space station for rescue .
how can we even contemplate risking their lives ?
if the problem is serious enough to ground the fleet , discovery too should be ' grounded ' immediately .
sharon , dallas , texas i once saw a presentation on how the challenger disaster came to happen and how it could have been prevented and it made my blood run cold .
suffice it to say , i have nothing but the most profound admiration for the courage of the crews of the shuttle .
i 'm not a religious man , but i just hope to god they all get back safely .
steve , chesham tragic as the columbia accident was , the astronauts died doing what they loved - exploring space , a privilege only the select few get to do .
they also died at the end of their trip so they got to enjoy being in space , unlike the challenger crew .
before the columbia accident , i would expect that the shuttles got through intact in much worse condition than discovery .
i am not that concerned , although i will follow the investigations with great interest .
ian , london it seems ridiculous that it is being jeopardised by something so simple chris , brazil the shuttle has been up and down into space about 50 times before the columbia incident .
i can not believe that bits of foam from the fuel tank did n't come off during these trips .
are n't nasa being a bit super cautious about this problem ?
ca n't they encase the fuel tank in some sort of wire mesh in order to prevent the foam from breaking off ?
in such a high tech programme , it seems ridiculous that it is being jeopardised by something so simple .
chris , brazil what exactly are they doing out there that they have not had the chance to do before ?
first of all get a new ship and then go somewhere else than the moon !
that impressed my grand father , it will take more to impress me !
mathieu , gatineau , canada bits of foam have probably been falling off the shuttle since the first launch , but it 's only since a piece of that debris caused the destruction of columbia two years ago that anyone has noticed !
only now we have cameras watching every single part of the craft do we see what may well have been happening all along .
carry on as normal .
simon , peterborough , uk i remember watching the first ever shuttle flight as a kid .
i watched the launch the other day and got the exact same feelings of awe and excitement .
the shuttle launch is a wake up call to everyone .
sure the world has problems right now but despite those problems , look what we 're capable of !
my message to nasa , the esa and all the other agencies ?
keep going people .
take us there !
andrew k jones , wrexham , uk i watched the launch live on the internet and was overwhelmed .
we wo n't know of the mission 's success until 7 aug , but what surprises me is the us way of making everything big and the huge overhead costs .
it 's all show and little substance .
after having spent $ 1 billion and 2.5 years on the debris falling cause , they are back to square one and the shuttles are grounded again !
on the other hand the russians are making safe manned space missions with pinpoint accuracy every 3-6 months at a fraction of the cost .
rakesh , london uk without space exploration we would not have computers , hi-technology materials etc jim kirk , basildon i read once that spending on cosmetics in the usa dwarfs the nasa budget .
let 's get things in perspective .
without space exploration we would not have computers , hi-technology materials etc , all of which were a by-product .
if more is learned about our planet and its self-destructive population on each mission then we should keep it going .
come home safe guys !
jim kirk , basildon does anyone know why debris falls off a multi-million dollar spacecraft ?
ca n't some sort of outer layer be put around the fuel tank insulation to stop it disintegrating ?
i 'm not an engineer - i need someone else to explain it !
robert , sussex rather than risking the crew and the shuttle , if it is damaged , why do n't they leave it up there as service vehicle and bring the crew back in another shuttle at a later date ?
if nasa wants to survive they need to start making people believe in them again .
good luck discovery !
paul , london the space shuttle was under funded during its design and construction and the compromises mean it will never achieve its true potential .
the sooner it can be replaced with something newer and simpler the better .
david patrick , reading trying to make space exploration 100 % safe is just nonsense .
duncan , nottingham my heart sank when i heard the news that tiles had once again fallen off the space shuttle roger campbell , england my heart sank when i heard the news that tiles had once again fallen off the space shuttle .
if the cause of the tiles falling off is simply the vibration and air flow , then i wonder what will be the effect of the searing heat of re-entry .
roger campbell , england having watched the space shuttle launch on tv , it is good to see such a majestic craft finally back to what she was meant to do .
well done nasa for getting the space shuttle flying .
james , nottingham no-one made that big a deal when tiles were missing from the oms pods after columbia 's maiden flight in 1981 .
when designing this vehicle they must have made a risk assessment to determine safety parameters , and unfortunately the loss of columbia has made them refine these parameters further .
tim parker , edinburgh we watched the launch from our beach , about 90 miles away .
it was spectacular .
there are many more cameras watching the exterior shuttle craft than ever before which have alerted to the problems .
the engineers working for nasa are tireless and will get the current crew back safely one way or another .
the space programme will continue .
the only unknown is manned flights .
the mars rovers are still sending pictures and information long past when they were suppose to .
nasa will continue on and i believe has more government funding this year , or is due for an increase .
private companies are currently working on safe space travel for human passengers in the us and abroad i believe .
joan york , daytona beach , florida usa nasa 's team on the ground and the astronauts in the space are doing a great job for the mankind syed mateen , karachi , pakistan i have witnessed the launching of space shuttle discovery on television screen .
nasa 's team on the ground and the astronauts in the space are doing a great job for the mankind , as their experiences in the space will benefit the entire world .
i pray for the safe return of the astronauts and happy landing of the space shuttle .
as a human being , i am equally concerned about the debris which has fallen at the time of its blast , but hope that the space shuttle will not face the same problem as it did in the past .
the safe return of discovery will boost the moral of nasa 's team , who had worked day and night to make the space shuttle 's mission possible .
syed mateen , karachi , pakistan any country with ambitions to have manned missions to space would be more than happy to have a craft as good as the space shuttle .
if there is a cheaper way to break away from earth than i am all for it but i am not sure how much safer it will be .
exploration has always been a dangerous business .
erik , ft .
collins , u.s.a. manned space flight is a dangerous and expensive anachronism .
look at the success of hubble , the mars rovers and the cassini / huygens mission .
you can do 10 times as much real science for half the cost and no risk to life by concentrating on unmanned space exploration .
and tell me , were n't the pictures of titan far more exciting than anything the crew of the shuttle are likely to get up to ?
max , abu dhabi , uae i read some of the comments here with disbelief .
yes , we all know that there are problems in some areas of the world , it does n't however mean that everything has to stop because of that .
i can think of a lot more things which are more of a waste than space exploration .
i 'll bet half the people complaining about nasa being wasteful drive gas guzzlers and do n't bother to recycle .
the shuttle mission is vital to all areas of science and i 'm glad it is flying again .
the space shuttle is not an old machine ; discovery has only flown 30 times before .
most commercial airlines fly that often in a week !
dave , slough , uk many congratulations to nasa .
as a teacher i teach children who are fascinated by space .
it is good that the space missions continue .
it allows children to hope and dream that they might reach the stars themselves , one day !
michelle , birmingham we all know that it costs millions of dollars to support the space program .
one could argue that money could be better spent elsewhere .
the fact is we as human beings need to understand in order to learn new technologies and space exploration is just one of many things that need to be understood and conquered .
there will always be many arguments for and against the space program .
all i can say right now is well done to nasa and my best wishes for a truly successful return to space flight for discovery .
andrew howlett , cape town , south africa good luck and a safe landings to the crew of the discovery .
there are some here that would have the usa quit funding the space program until all the worlds ' problems are solved .
will you tell your children to wait for that day before pursuing their dreams ?
michael rosenbaum , san francisco , usa a plane crash or 9/11 does not stop air travel , so why should the columbia 2003 disaster stop space exploration ?
i 'm sure discovery will make it back safe and the astronauts will be given a well-deserved pat on the back .
jack , london / memphis the shuttle might be old but it still works , and has done the world a huge service towards on earth and in space exploration .
those who complain are clearly members of the flat earth society , and yet i bet they use technology every day ?
someone has to push the envelope .
go nasa go !
phil w , uk good launch .
let 's just hope she comes back in one piece .
ricardo , brazil the shuttles are aged dinosaurs that need to be " moth balled " before more lives are lost due to fragmenting styrofoam .
perhaps we should all consider shifting funding away from nasa and put it towards alternative fuel sources .
it would be revenue better spent .
kurt stuchell , cambridge , usa scuttle the shuttle gordon , auckland nz scuttle the shuttle !
obsolete equipment supplying a pointless lab .
much fanfare about increasing aid to africa by $ 25b but us military budget $ 400b makes you ill !
gordon , auckland nz i can not stand the mentality of myopic people who would rather we abandon the natural impulse to explore our surroundings , and instead focus on futile efforts to tackle every mundane earthbound problem .
surely , the sight of the shuttle blasting off into orbit is the most poignant statement of mankind 's destiny .
kevin , charlotte , north carolina , usa with so much bad news in the media : terrorism , war , poverty ... it 's wonderful to see what we as human beings can achieve , when we put our minds to something positive .
we have the potential to achieve great things .
the crew of this shuttle mission are from different countries , cultures and backgrounds ; proof that if we work together , we can produce something that makes us all proud .
charlie , newcastle , uk to all those who claim the space programme has helped advance medicine and technology . think how much further along in those fields we could be if all the money wasted at nasa went into development . let alone feeding the poor .
shameful waste of resources .
i do n't want my tax dollar to be spent this way .
p. o 'donnell , rotorua , n.z. there are always small-minded people who are terrified of exploration digby knight , henley-on-thames , uk there are always small-minded people who are terrified of exploration .
if we had their way , we 'd still be living in trees afraid of the dangerous savannah !
thankfully we 've always had a few who have done their best to pioneer new territories and worlds .
digby knight , henley-on-thames , uk i would argue that nasa is somewhat of an anachronism .
the " glory days " of the space race with russia are over .
instead , space exploration should be run by the national science foundation .
there , private and public money can be better organized to fund missions .
the nsf already runs most of the science stations here on earth .
why should space be any different ?
greg , alexandria , va space exploration * is * a waste of money .
had the billions been invested directly in more down-to-earth technologies , we would have seen the same spin-offs in medicine , it , and transport .
anonymous i ca n't believe the childish reactions to space exploration from folks like mike and anon , uk .
grow up , guys .
space exploration represents humanity at its most amazing .
you 're obviously just bitter because the us is leading the way .
typical .
shawn , washington , dc , usa exploration , of all kinds , has always helped man push the boundaries of technology .
the space programme is no different .
for this reason alone it is invaluable .
jason , detroit , usa despite all the delays and expert checks , something still fell off it on take off dan , yateley , uk looking at the shuttle i am always reminded of those creaking old 50 's and 60 's airliners you still see rattling around developing countries .
good in their day , but now so ropey and tired that they just scream " death trap " .
it says it all about the shuttle that despite all the delays and expert checks , something still fell off it on take off .
it 's high time this heap was scrapped , and a replacement worthy of the 21st century was introduced in its place .
dan , yateley , uk so the new ufos are unidentified falling objects ?
phil jones , frangy , france if you watch the film of the launch the piece of debris that falls off after the booster rocket drops off does not come from the shuttle it comes from the giant fuel tank , which is ' disposable ' anyway .
john nichols , brackley , nnorthants , uk how would brits feel if americans were talking about how britain should spend its money ?
michelle , raleigh , nc i think that nasa is still too hurried in launching the shuttle when the debris problem still exists .
maybe they should solve out the problem wholly before doing any thing else .
but the fact still shows that nasa has succeeded in launching the shuttle into space .
maybe that 's an incredible luck , although we still do n't know about the return of it .
but i believe it will succeed , too .
god 's will give luck to the crew .
nguyen hoang giang , hanoi , vietnam i just pray she makes it back down ok seun , london uk it was an excellent feeling seeing discovery go like that yesterday .
i am really happy for nasa and i just pray she makes it back down ok , that will be the icing on the cake .
seun , london uk oh dear !
the usa are off again trying to show how they can spend billions on space exploration , meanwhile trying to flex its muscles all around the world causing chaos- unbelievable !
mike , uk mankind is not content with polluting the earth !
it now wants to pollute space as well !
how sad !
millions starve while the usa burns dollars - what for ?
it truly is a sick world we live in these days !
anon , uk to anon , uk - the fuel is clean and non polluting - just water produced .
and as for waste of money - tell me about the dome and the london olympics .
longer term , i know what is more valuable !
george , chelmsford i 'm so glad to see the space programme resume shuttle launches .
space research is costly , but it 's like buying a lottery ticket - you never know what you 're going to get back from it , but once you go out there , there 's a chance you might win big .
and we already have - people have cited the benefits that have come from the space programme .
here 's to more exploration outside our atmosphere !
tony , london , uk i felt privileged to have been in florida for the launch .
it went off on time and from what i gather from reports , was perfect .
it 's something to tell the grandkids one day .
marylyn , london space travel fires the imagination !
tim goodchild , surrey space travel fires the imagination !
to all those that criticise that the shuttle is old and the fact that its had two failures should perhaps think again the next time they board a 747 on route to their holiday destination .
tim goodchild , surrey absolutely fantastic pictures from discovery , especially when the external fuel tank was detached from the shuttle with the curvature of the earth in the background .
overall great launch , well done nasa .
paul , coventry , uk the american space programme is a great achievement and it is important that it continues .
the human race is capable of great things and it is not in our nature to keep still .
terry , crewe , cheshire my gosh !
the people saying the space program is a waste of money ? !
the commercial products used now as a result of nasa are staggering .
cat scans , dialysis machines , materials in your athletic shoes , water purification technology , cordless power tools , cool suits for firefighters , physical therapy equipment .
the list goes on .
the program is invaluable !
eric , usa i think its well worth the effort and money to sustain humans in space carl lennon , northampton , uk most of the people on here with negative comments do not realise how much space has done for humanity .
many medical experiments have been conducted in space which was the only place that it could be done .
the results of these experiments have saved thousands if not millions of lives .
i think its well worth the effort and money to sustain humans in space .
carl lennon , northampton , uk although america has proven itself to be the world 's best engineers , nasa is living on past glory .
many of its best scientists and engineers have left , it is no longer in the public limelight unless it has a disaster , and it is grossly underfunded .
america should reinvigorate the program with major new investment and ambitious new goals or shut it down .
as the eu space agency has recently learned , you ca n't explore space on the cheap .
this old technology and this antiquated worn out hardware needs to be retired along with the mediocre management which has taken over .
mark , usa what a novel way to distract your nation from the real problems at home and abroad .
the cost does n't matter since the nation is paying the bill .
ed , canada there are those who say space exploration is a waste of money .
on the contrary , space travel forces society to stretch and reach further in order to solve highly complex problems associated with putting man into space .
the solutions to these problems are broad and serve mankind in many ways .
the space program enables us to move forward faster than we otherwise would .
without such large goals our advancement slows and we become lazy .
david , philadelphia , usa come on people , of course sending people into space is dangerous and expensive .
that does n't mean we should n't do it though .
even if space exploration did not lead to technical advances and practical application , it would still be worth it .
why ?
because it 's cool .
we put a man on the moon , that 's pretty impressive considering just prior to wwi a man could only travel as far as a horse could take him .
stu , st paul , usa the view from the fuel tank at over 14000mph was fantastic !
rod aries , glasgow the view from the fuel tank at over 14000mph was fantastic !
why are n't other space agencies doing this for the public ?
engage us !
rod aries , glasgow every time i see a rocket launch i think that newton made it possible ; his equations are still used to calculate the orbit .
how many other things in use today were invented over 300 years ago ?
vic , uk a sense of pride mixed with concern .
i live near the johnson space center and have relatives that have worked in the program as far back as gemini and apollo .
the space program is much more than a news story to us .
to those who think the space program is a waste of money : there is so much innovation and research that goes on behind the scenes that you 'd change your opinion if you took the time to look at what nasa has accomplished over the years and continues to accomplish today .
paul , houston , tx well , i 'm relieved it 's up there .
but they still seem to have this gung-ho attitude to safety .
i could n't believe that after killing two crews they are still happy to launch with a known serious fault .
chris hann , bay area , ca , usa congratulations to nasa on a successful launch .
i 'm glad to see that some nations still recognise the value of dreaming and aspiring to do great things and inspire their young people .
the money spent of spaceflight is miniscule compared to the many benefits .
it 's sad here in the uk that people are so ignorant and short-sighted with regards to space exploration that we ca n't see the good that can from it - and then we wonder the younger generations are n't interested in science , medicine and technology .
victor , birmingham , england this launch showed the world what can be accomplished with great teamwork , ambition and determination d soni , nuneaton , uk i watched the launch and was overcome with pride .
all the people involved in this great feat have overcome extreme obstacles .
this launch showed the world what can be accomplished with great teamwork , ambition and determination .
congratulations discovery !
d soni , nuneaton , uk mankind needs a vision .
interplanetary travel is necessary to achieve that end .
stuart haines , calgary , alberta , canada it 's time to junk the space shuttle and perhaps " rethink " this whole business of manned space flight for the time being .
think about it , other than as a showy display of national pride , what benefits do any nations get at this time from sending humans into space ?
perhaps in the future when we have real goals and reliable " safe " transportation we can start wasting our time and money with such " propaganda flights " , but now is n't the time and place for such foolishness .
charlie , niagara falls new york people always complain that space programs are too expensive , but do people appreciate how much safer the planet is with them ?
we can monitor dangerous weather , asteroids , and send tv , radio , and telephone signals via satellites .
space programs really have helped the planet excel in a positive way , and i 'm glad the discovery is finally continuing what has already been a remarkable feat of engineering .
tim hunt -lrb- 16 -rrb- , plymouth , england in these days darkened by the spectre of global terrorism , we seek hope and strength in many places .
the fog of war and the wind that whispers the question of " why are we fighting in the middle east ? ' diminish our confidence in our government .
today 's launch of the shuttle discovery renews our hope and faith in our abilities to overcome tragedy and defy adversity .
we owe the entire nasa family a debt of gratitude for restoring our faith in the human spirit .
paul telfer , franceville , gabon we need a new way of going to the stars clive , dartford , uk i wish the crew well on the mission , but the shuttle is old and just like any aircraft , it has its life expectancy and this bird has reached it .
we need a new way of going to the stars and to ditch the big firework approach to it .
clive , dartford , uk sure , okay .
maybe the shuttle programme is old .
maybe it should be scrapped for something better .
but , it is all we have at the moment .
and to all of you here who keep telling us to get rid of it , i have n't heard one of you say anything about putting up any money with us to fund a new programme .
jon , atlanta , usa what nasa needs is a real life scotty character to sort these technical issues out .
paul collier , london , uk the truth is that the shuttle concept has proved to be too expensive and technically complex to be the way forward in space .
i am pro-space exploration but the shuttle has slowed this to a crawl , and all the best work has been done by probes boosted by rockets e.g. mars landers , titan probes etc .
andy , uk " space is expensive ! " cry the critics .
i wish they would angle their criticism at a truly scandalous target .
the entire space programme to date has cost less than what the world spends on arms every year .
i know which i think is better value for money .
bernard o. quinn , barcelona , catalonia the exploration of space will continue with us or without us scott westwood , port orchard , wa , usa the shuttle is expensive , outdated and despite nasa 's assurances , its safety is still uncertain ; but it 's the only game in town .
the exploration of space will continue with us or without us ; to sit on the sidelines and watch others go up would be unthinkable for an america that prides itself on being a superpower .
scott westwood , port orchard , wa , usa space exploration is essential for the future of all humans .
flying over the atlantic was at first a risky endeavour and now it is done by millions every year without a thought for the early pioneers and the planes that never arrived .
colin , croydon , uk i do not understand all these people saying that america should scrap the shuttle , and spend it on ' the world ' .
the us is already the single largest contributor of foreign aid .
the us space program has helped everyday life for billions of people around the world , and churned out invention after invention for the world .
bill zimmer , seattle , wa congratulations to all those involved in discovery 's return to space !
to all the naysayers , next time you are browsing the internet on your pc , take a moment to find out what drove the development of semiconductors that power your pc .
yes , the space exploration that you think is a waste of money !
roger , london tears came to my eyes and i held my breath colleen , orlando , fl usa we were in the parking lot facing east , waiting and whispering to each other .
the first person to see the shuttle clearing the trees threw up their hand to point it out and some of the men started yelling , " go , baby , go ! " and cheering .
tears came to my eyes and i held my breath .
the space program has done so much to improve our lives in the fields of health and science , they further our knowledge of our environment and how our magnificent planet works .
colleen , orlando , fl usa go discovery !
the future of humanity is in space .
as an american living abroad , the lift-off of discovery is the first event that makes me proud to be american since leaving my country .
i hope that this success will lead to the completion of the iss and the continued exploration of space .
daniel valenti , canberra , australia people forget that we belong to this planet earth , in that our physical bodies are perfectly adapted to survive only on the earth .
we could never survive on other planets without extensive artificial aids .
as many have already pointed out , there are many , many more pressing needs requiring resolution and funds should be redirected where they are most needed for our survival on our home planet .

the crew on board the space shuttle have conducted inspections of discovery 's belly and repairs to the shuttle have also been carried out .
stephen robinson has begun a unique spacewalk , going under the orbiter 's belly to remove two ceramic strips sticking out between heatshield tiles .
nasa engineers are concerned the strips would cause part of discovery to overheat as it re-enters the earth 's atmosphere .
discovery had been due to return to earth on 7 august , but nasa has decided to extend the mission by an extra day .
what do you think of the mission so far ?
how do you feel about the mission being extended ?
what do you think about the repairs ?

read a selection of your comments below .
click here to read a second page of your comments the following comments reflect the balance of opinion we have received so far : the money that is spent by the american government on space exploration could be much better spent on healthcare and education .
this would be much more beneficial to the american people than discovery 's mission .
carolynne burkholder , vancouver , british columbia " i can not believe that the crew had to cobble together a hacksaw " norman west , truro , cornwall i can not believe that the crew had to cobble together a hacksaw .
a small box of tools from any diy shop would have done the job .
also removing a gap filler between the tiles exposes a gap .
surely the wind can get in and potentially lift a tile causing a fatal problem .
norman west , truro , cornwall whilst i can see that advances may be made through this work , i saw two items on the news last night - one about children dying because they have n't got a few quid , the other about spending millions on keeping the shuttles going in and out of space .
priority check please .
mark , didcot , england space travel is dangerous , pioneers are going to die , but it is worthwhile .
what is needed now are new spaceships to let us travel between planets .
at the moment all our eggs are in one basket , we need to find other homes on other worlds .
we have made this one nearly uninhabitable .
i would go into space whatever the risk .
ruth , walsall maybe if all the countries stopped being so petty and pooled their resources , we 'd have superior technology and fewer incidents like this .
we do n't need to race against each other anymore to try and prove who 's superior ; instead we should look to a future of co-operation .
gaz , cardiff , uk " i will never understand why we waste so much money on primitive space stations " john gearing , st. helens , uk i will never understand why we waste so much money on primitive space stations and shuttles which clearly have no function for the human race at this time .
i do n't know why we do n't get all our experts and fund them in coming up with unmanned technologies and technology in shuttles that could take us to planets not to a tin can in the sky which is over expensive and serves no function to the mass population .
john gearing , st. helens , uk fascinating a brit would ask the question why the us is sending people into space .
as the brit , george mallory said in 1924 , " because its there " .
mt everest killed mallory and we remember him for his quest .
in a similar quest , the us will continue to go into space - because its there .
john b , windermere , florida do some of these contributors have no soul ?
what could be more magnificent than seeing human beings taking risks to explore the unknown ; triumphing over the problems they meet along the way ; opening up new horizons for the rest of us ?
yes let 's invest in a new space transportation system , and more manned flights , and unmanned probes and a bigger , better space station .
but to claim that stopping the current flights is sensible shows no faith in the species at all .
stop looking down at the ground and start looking up at the stars .
john r smith , uk please , armchair scientists , let the experts at nasa do their job making the risk calculations .
they 've got the know-how and the tools to make the decisions .
not you or me .
joe , usa this is the most ridiculous expenditure of precious funds in a time of great national travail .
nasa is an anachronism , a patronistic pet rock that has no justification whatsoever , especially in the current environment in which civilized societies are fighting for their mere existence .
the irresponsibility in launching this mission in the face of known deficiencies is appalling .
c. a. la varre , newport , ri usa " the media paints such a doom and gloom picture of what is happening above us " phil , hampshire , uk why-oh-why does the media take such a negative view to what the men and women on sts114 are doing .
the media paints such a doom and gloom picture of what is happening above us .
we as a united world should watch and praise these people who are up there performing the most fantastic things known to mankind .
yes there is a difficult time coming on returning to earth but the crew at this time seem very positive about it .
may i suggest that you all watch nasa tv on the web for real live happenings .
phil , hampshire , uk nasa is undergoing drastic changes .
i think the us should pause and take stock of what 's happening to their space missions .
give it a break , sort out problems and return 10years later .
i wonder how the us ever landed man on the moon ?
did they really ?
i wonder !
errol , dubai , uae space flight is still in its infancy .
so the fact that an astronaut was able to make a repair to the shuttle in space is a great triumph .
nasa should look on this feat in a positive light , not a negative one .
we know in the days of sailing ships as they travelled the globe to discover new lands , there were many times when sailors had to climb up masts in storms to make repairs , so is repairing space craft in flight any different ?
leon aarons , petach israel another piece of space theatre , justifying manned flight .
unmanned craft can put payloads into orbit much more cheaply , as well as exploring other planets .
martin , dubai , uae i 've just seen a picture of the tool , held together with strong tape that the astronauts used .
it 's great to imagine that a billion-dollar aircraft can be saved by a bit of strong tape and some elbow grease !
it 's that sort of thinking that 's saved astronauts in the past .
good luck to them , hope humans carry on going into space for many more years .
dave , manchester , uk this spacewalk and repair demonstrates two things .
firstly , the courage and initiative of the astronauts , secondly , the importance of retiring the ageing shuttle fleet and building a modern spacecraft .
electronics and materials technology have advanced tremendously in the past 30 years , but the shuttle is still using outdated technology .
gordon mcstraun , uk so , the offending piece if gap filler from between a couple of heat shields .
i 'm no nasa expert , but does n't this mean that the is now a gap between these tiles ?
michael , bucks , uk " the astronauts are all volunteers , they know the risks involved , and that is why i praise and thank them " kirsty , cambridge , uk i think it is fantastic that discovery has launched and its mission is going well .
a lesson has been learnt from colombia , and indeed , challenger .
the astronauts are all volunteers , they know the risks involved , and that is why i praise and thank them .
they are incredible people .
kirsty , cambridge , uk so what if the filler problem has to be fixed with a jerry-rigged hacksaw ?
this type of ingenuity has been saving lives since the age of tall ships and can only reflect well on the tenacity of the nasa engineers and astronauts .
remember when the progress hit mir ?
apollo 13 ?
we need the experience of these problems to give us the know-how to survive in space and give us the confidence in our ability to solve problems on longer , bolder voyages .
tim parker , edinburgh , scotland i work with remote operated vehicles in the oil and gas industry .
i am amazed that the crew of the discovery need to cobble together a makeshift hacksaw to carry out a job on the tiles .
the shuttles are old and things will go wrong so you would expect a decent tool kit to be onboard .
james , paderne , portugal why are the americans still sending people into space ?
if they want to explore they should be thinking of unmanned flights with intelligent technology which can spend decades in space .
this should help the ozone layer repair itself .
more is needed to be done to explore and catalogue this planet and its systems , this will be of more benefit to mankind and our home than space travel .
haz , nottingham , uk is going up in the shuttle much more dangerous than sailing unknown oceans a few hundred years ago in wooden ships ?
thank goodness that throughout history not everyone has wanted to sit at home in comfort in their own small world .
simon , manchester , uk with so many comings and goings to and from iss , would it not be sensible for just the bare minimum of crew to return in this shuttle and send up a half-empty shuttle to collect the rest of them ?
why take unnecessary risks ?
fraser irving , sheffield , uk until now , the shuttle missions have been routine , like taking a walk in the park .
but the reality of danger with the loss of two shuttles has almost brought the space program to its knees .
should it continue ?
of course it must go on because too much is at stake .
closing the space station , and not looking into space is the worst we can do .
life on earth is becoming dangerous .
we must look to the stars if humanity is to survive .
walter , chapel hill , nc i think - and hope - this flight is one of the safest ever .
my guess is the problems have appeared simply because they have been looking for them far more carefully than before .
however , there 's no doubt a replacement spacecraft is needed .
the private " space ship one " has a slow re-entry , avoiding thermal problems .
is this possible from orbit ?
and a separate , unmanned cargo vehicle seems a " no-brainer " .
simon , bristol " it must be frightening for the astronauts but the space programme must prevail " anya , london pioneers always take risks so that everyone else can eventually follow .
it must be frightening for the astronauts but the space programme must prevail .
updated technology is definitely needed .
unmanned missions are a good idea , but ultimately there is no substitute for human actions and reactions .
anya , london interesting to note that the two shuttle losses have not been due to design or engineering flaws in the shuttle themselves , but rather the propulsion system .
for 30 year old vehicles , i think the shuttles are doing pretty well , and i am sure they will continue for a long time .
matt , bristol space exploration is dangerous and the crew knows this better than any of us - and they still volunteered for it .
my view is that we need to continue to explore space and the shuttle repair should be seen as an experience that needs to be faced at some time .
let 's not be weak about this .
george , chelmsford what nasa has done is simply awesome .
nasa is the adventurer of our era , looking at and investigating things that are far bigger than us .
i say ground the space shuttles , but do not skimp on quickly building bigger , better , and safer spacecraft to replace them .
sk , ithaca , ny " space technology is too integrated in our daily lives now " peter byrd , worcester the few people who mock space projects should not use anything connected with space technology as a protest !
i bet hardly anyone would manage it or really want to .
space technology is too integrated in our daily lives now ; we all enjoy the advantages we get from it .
nasa tv via the net alone shows me how wonderful space is .
peter byrd , worcester i have just returned from florida where i was privileged enough to witness the breathtaking launch first hand .
it seems as though there are increasing difficulties using these shuttles .
are the lives of 7 astronauts each time it takes off a risk that is worth taking ?
matt , london given the loss of columbia and the uncertainty of this mission , nasa should scrap the shuttle programme .
luck prevented previous disasters and it would appear nasa 's luck has run out .
what makes them feel confident that they can repair in space what they failed to repair in two years on the ground ?
my thoughts are with the families of those on the iss .
phil , bracknell , uk the problems with discovery must have been encountered with all the previous shuttle flights .
it appears that each time it took off , it was russian roulette as to whether it would return safely .
this program should be abandoned until a new and safer means of transporting the shuttle into space can be developed .
chris , brazil " will the resulting depression between the tiles create a possibility of a chink in the armour ? "
k chowksey , bangalore , india even if the pieces sticking out are pulled or hacked , will the resulting depression between the tiles create a possibility of a chink in the armour ?
even a depression can alter the aerodynamic behaviour -lrb- as in golf balls -rrb- .
this will create uneven heat distribution .
k chowksey , bangalore , india from the idealists point of view we really should not be thinking about costs here .
space exploration is vital , not only to our technological development as a species , but also in terms of our wider understanding of the universe .
the whole nasa infrastructure is quite frankly awesome .
every endeavour has its risks and we 've seen the tragic consequences of those risks with the previous accidents .
chris , bracknell we need to explore space ; when you go to hospital and have a cat scan or an mri , that technology has come from the space program .
there is nothing wrong with the shuttle - the problem is with the way it is maintained .
they need to do better , i do n't know why do n't they paint it again , and seal the foam .
carol , pa , usa the saddest thing for me about this mission is that the next time the iss is visible from england on august 11th , the shuttle will have already left .
hopefully we 'll get to see the shuttle during the next mission .
after the moon , the iss is the brightest object in the night sky .
john airey , peterborough " i looked at the images of the underside of the shuttle and thought that it looked like really bad bathroom tiling " rob , spain major advances need to be made to the whole concept of effective re-entry heat-shield technology .
even before lift-off , i looked at the images of the underside of the shuttle and thought that it looked like really bad bathroom tiling .
initially , i expected it to be a smooth , seamless surface , but it was a patchwork of light and dark areas with patches that looked more raised than others .
i assume that tiles are the best option at the moment , but in future this issue needs to be solved completely .
rob , spain if nasa has decided to just rip out the relatively small strips protruding from between the heat shield tiles , then why ca n't they ask astronaut steve robinson to take his experimental repair kit out with him and fill the gaps with the mastic gum that they used to ' fix ' the tiles in their earlier experiments ?
paul greer , gothenburg , sweden i worked as an engineer on skylab in the 70s and i consider this nasa debacle a disgrace .
unknown risk is one thing , but gambling with lives on known problems with solutions is unacceptable .
i say : bring some crew home in russian capsule , leave the rest of the crew up there , fix the foam on atlantis -lrb- and everything else possible -rrb- and then send a rescue mission .
then ground the antiques and use modern technology to build new spacecraft .
rich dusek , orchard lake , mi , us bruce from huntsville says it 's not a trivial engineering problem and he 's probably right .
but that does n't alter the documented fact that nasa has sent people into space against the advice of contractors who have told them that certain aspects are n't safe .
if shuttles are prone to bits falling off then they should n't be flying .
david , chelmsford uk " nasa do n't build all the parts and therefore an outside company may be partly responsible " james , uk why do people expect space travel to be perfectly safe ?
look at any picture of launch and remember the orange tank is full of fuel and both white rockets once started ca n't be stopped .
man in space is an essential part of our future .
the earth can not sustain us forever particularly its natural resources .
i also think people should recognise that nasa do n't build all the parts and therefore an outside company may be partly responsible .
james , uk the problems with the space transportation system are a classic example of what happens when whole-life costs are not taken into account during early design phases of the system .
congress chose to buy shuttle on the cheap , opting for solid fuel boosters and a disposable fuel tank instead of spending extra money upfront to design a fully-reusable fly-back first stage to take the orbiter into space .
the result has been far higher operating costs and , tragically , the loss of fourteen astronauts .
will it be too much to hope that senior agency managers and politicians will learn these lessons in defining our future access to space ?
in europe as well as the usa .
phil , bath , uk so far this particular mission has been very worrying for relatives of the discovery crew .
any venture into space is a risk , but this one seems to have gone ahead knowing this risk factor was much higher than usual .
why are these missions so important ?
the risk factor is too great to risk innocent lives .
stop them now .
jose a holmes , loughborough , england i wish the crew a safe return but am sorry to see resources wasted on a manned flight with little real value for essentially political and pr reasons while much more scientifically valuable unmanned work is scaled back to pay for it .
this is all about the advancement of the usa , not science .
julian , london , uk the debris issue has been present in the shuttle programme from day one .
the tiles themselves are so fragile you can break them with one hand .
the space shuttle is a wonderful vehicle , but sadly owing to it 's bizarre design , is inherently dangerous and needs to be replaced soon .
as richard feynman said after the challenger disaster , " for a successful technology , reality must take precedence over public relations , for nature can not be fooled . "
chris dyer , bristol , england " the immediate future of the space program will be best served by robot missions " dr malcolm fairbairn , uk / sweden i , like most people connected with astrophysics , think that the immediate future of the space program will be best served by robot missions for at least the next twenty years .
it 's not taking a step backwards ; it 's about developing and testing new technologies which will eventually be applied to human spaceflight .
for the same amount of money you get much more science done with robotic missions because you do n't have to worry about the fragile humans .
dr malcolm fairbairn , uk / sweden as an aerospace engineer , in this particular instance i am not worried about discovery .
all indications are that the debris did no damage .
long term , though , it could be a problem .
the space shuttle has never fulfilled the promises that were made for it .
it is an expensive vehicle of very limited utility .
it consumes resources which could be better used elsewhere in the us space program .
andrew ogilvie , modesto , california , usa robert heinlein said it : " the earth is too small and fragile a basket for humanity to keep all its eggs in . "
the only safe place to be when disaster comes -lrb- an asteroid for example -rrb- is somewhere else .
well done , discovery .
keep it up .
john fielder , workington , uk there are a lot of negative comments on here by people who really have not done their research .
there are so many inventions that have come to be due to space travel most are indirect , technology passed to the public after it has been created to aid nasa and the like in various projects .
adam ransom , birmingham " space flight is one of the things that most excites me " jehuda arieh veenman , haifa , israel space flight is one of the things that most excites me .
it breaks my heart that foam broke off the insulation again .
apparently , the design has a basic flaw ; the vulnerable heat shield is exposed to a bombardment of debris falling of during take off .
in the more old fashioned designs , the heat shields were protected during take off .
jehuda arieh veenman , haifa , israel it seems to me that the logical fix for the launch system would be to mount the shuttle higher relative to the fuel tank .
the coldness of the fuel is always going to be a problem in causing freezing of water and air in and around the foam insulation .
since that is the nature of the beast , get the shuttle out of harms way above the possible falling debris nigel dandridge-perry , los angeles ca , usa good luck discovery , i look forward to seeing a safe flight back to earth .
mark , dorset there is no progress with manned missions .
it 's more of the same .
while unmanned missions are discovering lakes of water on mars , landing on distant moons and exploring planets , the manned missions are trying to work out how to stop foam falling off the fuel tank .
leave floating around in orbit to the chinese and get exploring .
matt , amsterdam , the netherlands -lrb- ex .
uk -rrb- " the shuttle programme shows the greatness the human race can achieve when we focus " d ward , portsmouth those who fly orbiters know the risks and accept the challenge .
the shuttle programme shows the greatness the human race can achieve when we focus .
a commitment should be made to give it whatever financial support it needs to continue .
nasa tv shows discovery 's latest mission is gripping .
we owe it to those astronauts who have lost their lives in space exploration , to carry on the work that they could n't finish .
d ward , portsmouth i have become addicted to nasa tv over the last few days , and find myself staring into space , thinking of discovery up there somewhere ... looking back on our little planet from a distance .
i am surely concerned about the debris ; remember nasa did not think this would be a problem for the ill-fated columbia crew either .
they have spent two years and thousands of dollars on this problem - so yes , i think we should be concerned , not only about the debris ' implications , but also that nasa got it wrong again .
verity worthington , bewdley , worcestershire hundreds of years ago people were afraid that they could sail off the edges of the earth .
thank heavens there were brave sailors then willing to push the limits of courage and technology , and thank heavens we still have them today .
i 'm also grateful that there are still those willing to fund such expeditions .
rob g. , kansas city , usa the disaster 2 years ago , and these recent problems with the shuttle show that nasa really need to get on with developing the next generation of re-useable shuttles .
technology has moved on so much in the nearly 30 years since it was developed with computer technology and new lightweight materials .
if they do n't , then the private space firms will take over , while nasa keeps flogging a dead horse .
tane piper , edinburgh , uk we are all with you , looking forward for success .
god be with you .
no surrender no retreat .
martin madulu , moshi - tanzania i am more worried about the apparent loss of a tile than the foam .
if any of the tiles were damaged , the mission is in jeopardy .
after the columbia disaster , i read an article published in 1980 calling the shuttles ' death traps ' .
considering that we 've already lost half the fleet , i think it is high time nasa invested in a different , more robust technology .
istvan , detroit , usa " the safety of the crew should be of utmost importance , not launch schedules " ss , usa my family and i were vacationing in florida at the time of the launch .
we saw it speeding skyward from the car on our way back home .
i am an aerospace design engineer specializing in flight dynamics .
my concern really lies with the inadequacy with which nasa has dealt with the foam / tile problem .
the safety of the crew should be of utmost importance , not launch schedules .
ss , usa only those at nasa who have looked at the images of debris falling will have the best idea .
the crew 's safe return is just our concern but it 's their mission .
venkat maruthamuthu , urbana , il , usa why was this problem not resolved after columbia two years ago ?
it is very wrong to send yet more people up there without being absolutely sure that it 's safe .
perhaps space travel should wait until we have progressed far enough that we are not relying on tiles that can just fall off ?
catherine , cheshunt , herts great to see the shuttle soar again .
our future lies not on earth but out there somewhere .
no matter how you argue it , in the future this planet will die and so will all those life forms still on it .
if the human species is to survive , then it must do so elsewhere and this sort of technology is the first step towards that ultimate goal .
ian jordan , wokingham " the foam formulation was changed in 1996 ... most of the foam issues started after this change " bruce g , huntsville , usa this is not a trivial engineering problem as some have implied .
there are two types of foam : a lightweight foam covering the large areas of the tank and a dense ablator foam covering areas exposed to aerodynamic heating .
the foam is exposed to supersonic airflow at about 27000 km / h -lrb- 17000 mph -rrb- during launch .
there are shock cones coming from the orbiter , the connecting struts and solid boosters which impinge on the tank .
there is also a lot of vibration .
the foam formulation was changed in 1996 to comply with the montreal protocol and eliminate the freon propellant .
most of the foam issues started after this change and may or may not be associated with it .
the shuttle is due to be retired in 2010 and solving this problem is important for future spacecraft design .
bruce g , huntsville , usa why ca n't the return module be encased within the main take off rocket ?
this would prevent bits flying off from damaging it .
tony lee , telford we were on vacation in orlando , and had tickets for the astronaut hall of fame to watch the original scheduled lift-off on 13 july .
we had such a good view , but with about an hour or so to go , the launch was cancelled .
we were gutted to have missed such a spectacular sight !
we watched it on television back here in ireland , but felt we had a special bond with sts 114 - return to flight .
we just hope now for the safe return of the shuttle and its crew on 7 august .
good luck to them .
hutch family , ireland one day when someone is sipping cocktails on saturn 's lunar resort , whilst looking back at the earth and the distant sun , they 'll thank these brave people for risking their lives .
let 's keep our nerve , and not look back .
chris phillips , chelmsford , essex " it is an inherent part of our nature to explore " caroline , edinburgh , uk i used to work at one of the nasa centres -lrb- in maryland -rrb- and i hope that space exploration continues .
as a scientist it is an inherent part of our nature to explore , discover and find out about the unknown .
i was overjoyed to see the launch of discovery and hope , beyond all hope , that they make it safely home .
as nasa have said - " exploring space is not for the faint hearted ' - it 's a huge undertaking " .
the astronauts know that , we all know that .
these are very brave people and i wish them , and nasa , well with their endeavours .
caroline , edinburgh , uk watching this made me feel giddy .
now hopefully we can complete the iss and get on with the business of colonising space .
the spirit of adventure lives on with discovery and her crew .
david mills , ballymena , uk we were very privileged to be able to see discovery launch when it flew mission 105 and the impression it left us with was ' it was amazing to see ' .
we believe that the crew and the engineers will be able to work together and face the challenge of bringing back this magnificent ship .
instead of shrinking from the challenge we should rise up to it just as they did in 1970 for apollo 13 , it is only by stretching our knowledge such as in times of emergencies that we reach beyond our capabilities .
good luck and best wishes to the crew and engineers .
julie and robert , manchester , england " i would like to see the shuttle retired and replaced with a newer fleet " scott , edinburgh congratulations to nasa on another successful launch .
however , i would like to see the shuttle retired and replaced with a newer and more capable fleet of vehicles .
not only will it be safer and hugely beneficial to space exploration , the project would provide thousands of jobs , contracts to companies and benefit the global economy .
scott , edinburgh people seem to forget that manned space travel is still very dangerous and those brave astronauts know the risks .
foam has been falling off fuel tanks for nearly 25 years now .
perhaps money should now be invested in developing better glue and a more efficient reusable manned space travel system .
john ellis , nottingham statistically , if commercial flights carried the same risks as spaceflight , there would be about 500 airliner crashes per day .
one therefore has to applaud the courage and determination of those people who accept this degree of risk in pursuit of our quest for knowledge .
we are an inquisitive species , in this case pushing the boundaries of what is possible .
i wish those seven brave souls a safe return .
bob , cheshire i 've been following the ' space race ' since sputnik and the mercury missions , and i ca n't think of anything more exciting than a successful launch .
but why do n't we stop racing against each other and form stronger international collaborations to make space travel safer ?
j forman , los angeles , usa " if nasa says the shuttle is safe to fly , it 's safe to fly " james , los angeles , usa it amazes me how many observers believe they are more of an expert on shuttle safety and capability than the engineers at nasa .
the fact is , the men and women who work at nasa are at the top of their field .
if they say the shuttle is safe to fly , it 's safe to fly .
james , los angeles , usa it was a beautiful launch .
the space shuttle program has been remarkably successful despite the previous disaster .
nobody can engineer absolute perfection , but this was very close .
h neil , south texas , usa i am very concerned about the damaged tiles on discovery , especially in light of nasa 's apparent slowness in acknowledging that the take-off incident with columbia caused the disaster upon return .
there is an option for the crew of discovery - to wait on the space station for rescue .
how can we even contemplate risking their lives ?
if the problem is serious enough to ground the fleet , discovery too should be ' grounded ' immediately .
sharon , dallas , texas i once saw a presentation on how the challenger disaster came to happen and how it could have been prevented and it made my blood run cold .
suffice it to say , i have nothing but the most profound admiration for the courage of the crews of the shuttle .
i 'm not a religious man , but i just hope to god they all get back safely .
steve , chesham tragic as the columbia accident was , the astronauts died doing what they loved - exploring space , a privilege only the select few get to do .
they also died at the end of their trip so they got to enjoy being in space , unlike the challenger crew .
before the columbia accident , i would expect that the shuttles got through intact in much worse condition than discovery .
i am not that concerned , although i will follow the investigations with great interest .
ian , london " it seems ridiculous that it is being jeopardised by something so simple " chris , brazil the shuttle has been up and down into space about 50 times before the columbia incident .
i can not believe that bits of foam from the fuel tank did n't come off during these trips .
are n't nasa being a bit super cautious about this problem ?
ca n't they encase the fuel tank in some sort of wire mesh in order to prevent the foam from breaking off ?
in such a high tech programme , it seems ridiculous that it is being jeopardised by something so simple .
chris , brazil what exactly are they doing out there that they have not had the chance to do before ?
first of all get a new ship and then go somewhere else than the moon !
that impressed my grand father , it will take more to impress me !
mathieu , gatineau , canada bits of foam have probably been falling off the shuttle since the first launch , but it 's only since a piece of that debris caused the destruction of columbia two years ago that anyone has noticed !
only now we have cameras watching every single part of the craft do we see what may well have been happening all along .
carry on as normal .
simon , peterborough , uk i remember watching the first ever shuttle flight as a kid .
i watched the launch the other day and got the exact same feelings of awe and excitement .
the shuttle launch is a wake up call to everyone .
sure the world has problems right now but despite those problems , look what we 're capable of !
my message to nasa , the esa and all the other agencies ?
keep going people .
take us there !
andrew k jones , wrexham , uk i watched the launch live on the internet and was overwhelmed .
we wo n't know of the mission 's success until 7 aug , but what surprises me is the us way of making everything big and the huge overhead costs .
it 's all show and little substance .
after having spent $ 1 billion and 2.5 years on the debris falling cause , they are back to square one and the shuttles are grounded again !
on the other hand the russians are making safe manned space missions with pinpoint accuracy every 3-6 months at a fraction of the cost .
rakesh , london uk " without space exploration we would not have computers , hi-technology materials etc " jim kirk , basildon i read once that spending on cosmetics in the usa dwarfs the nasa budget .
let 's get things in perspective .
without space exploration we would not have computers , hi-technology materials etc , all of which were a by-product .
if more is learned about our planet and its self-destructive population on each mission then we should keep it going .
come home safe guys !
jim kirk , basildon does anyone know why debris falls off a multi-million dollar spacecraft ?
ca n't some sort of outer layer be put around the fuel tank insulation to stop it disintegrating ?
i 'm not an engineer - i need someone else to explain it !
robert , sussex rather than risking the crew and the shuttle , if it is damaged , why do n't they leave it up there as service vehicle and bring the crew back in another shuttle at a later date ?
if nasa wants to survive they need to start making people believe in them again .
good luck discovery !
paul , london the space shuttle was under funded during its design and construction and the compromises mean it will never achieve its true potential .
the sooner it can be replaced with something newer and simpler the better .
david patrick , reading trying to make space exploration 100 % safe is just nonsense .
duncan , nottingham " my heart sank when i heard the news that tiles had once again fallen off the space shuttle " roger campbell , england my heart sank when i heard the news that tiles had once again fallen off the space shuttle .
if the cause of the tiles falling off is simply the vibration and air flow , then i wonder what will be the effect of the searing heat of re-entry .
roger campbell , england having watched the space shuttle launch on tv , it is good to see such a majestic craft finally back to what she was meant to do .
well done nasa for getting the space shuttle flying .
james , nottingham no-one made that big a deal when tiles were missing from the oms pods after columbia 's maiden flight in 1981 .
when designing this vehicle they must have made a risk assessment to determine safety parameters , and unfortunately the loss of columbia has made them refine these parameters further .
tim parker , edinburgh we watched the launch from our beach , about 90 miles away .
it was spectacular .
there are many more cameras watching the exterior shuttle craft than ever before which have alerted to the problems .
the engineers working for nasa are tireless and will get the current crew back safely one way or another .
the space programme will continue .
the only unknown is manned flights .
the mars rovers are still sending pictures and information long past when they were suppose to .
nasa will continue on and i believe has more government funding this year , or is due for an increase .
private companies are currently working on safe space travel for human passengers in the us and abroad i believe .
joan york , daytona beach , florida usa " nasa 's team on the ground and the astronauts in the space are doing a great job for the mankind " syed mateen , karachi , pakistan i have witnessed the launching of space shuttle discovery on television screen .
nasa 's team on the ground and the astronauts in the space are doing a great job for the mankind , as their experiences in the space will benefit the entire world .
i pray for the safe return of the astronauts and happy landing of the space shuttle .
as a human being , i am equally concerned about the debris which has fallen at the time of its blast , but hope that the space shuttle will not face the same problem as it did in the past .
the safe return of discovery will boost the moral of nasa 's team , who had worked day and night to make the space shuttle 's mission possible .
syed mateen , karachi , pakistan any country with ambitions to have manned missions to space would be more than happy to have a craft as good as the space shuttle .
if there is a cheaper way to break away from earth than i am all for it but i am not sure how much safer it will be .
exploration has always been a dangerous business .
erik , ft .
collins , u.s.a. manned space flight is a dangerous and expensive anachronism .
look at the success of hubble , the mars rovers and the cassini / huygens mission .
you can do 10 times as much real science for half the cost and no risk to life by concentrating on unmanned space exploration .
and tell me , were n't the pictures of titan far more exciting than anything the crew of the shuttle are likely to get up to ?
max , abu dhabi , uae i read some of the comments here with disbelief .
yes , we all know that there are problems in some areas of the world , it does n't however mean that everything has to stop because of that .
i can think of a lot more things which are more of a waste than space exploration .
i 'll bet half the people complaining about nasa being wasteful drive gas guzzlers and do n't bother to recycle .
the shuttle mission is vital to all areas of science and i 'm glad it is flying again .
the space shuttle is not an old machine ; discovery has only flown 30 times before .
most commercial airlines fly that often in a week !
dave , slough , uk many congratulations to nasa .
as a teacher i teach children who are fascinated by space .
it is good that the space missions continue .
it allows children to hope and dream that they might reach the stars themselves , one day !
michelle , birmingham we all know that it costs millions of dollars to support the space program .
one could argue that money could be better spent elsewhere .
the fact is we as human beings need to understand in order to learn new technologies and space exploration is just one of many things that need to be understood and conquered .
there will always be many arguments for and against the space program .
all i can say right now is well done to nasa and my best wishes for a truly successful return to space flight for discovery .
andrew howlett , cape town , south africa good luck and a safe landings to the crew of the discovery .
there are some here that would have the usa quit funding the space program until all the worlds ' problems are solved .
will you tell your children to wait for that day before pursuing their dreams ?
michael rosenbaum , san francisco , usa a plane crash or 9/11 does not stop air travel , so why should the columbia 2003 disaster stop space exploration ?
i 'm sure discovery will make it back safe and the astronauts will be given a well-deserved pat on the back .
jack , london / memphis the shuttle might be old but it still works , and has done the world a huge service towards on earth and in space exploration .
those who complain are clearly members of the flat earth society , and yet i bet they use technology every day ?
someone has to push the envelope .
go nasa go !
phil w , uk good launch .
let 's just hope she comes back in one piece .
ricardo , brazil the shuttles are aged dinosaurs that need to be " moth balled " before more lives are lost due to fragmenting styrofoam .
perhaps we should all consider shifting funding away from nasa and put it towards alternative fuel sources .
it would be revenue better spent .
kurt stuchell , cambridge , usa " scuttle the shuttle " gordon , auckland nz scuttle the shuttle !
obsolete equipment supplying a pointless lab .
much fanfare about increasing aid to africa by $ 25b but us military budget $ 400b makes you ill !
gordon , auckland nz i can not stand the mentality of myopic people who would rather we abandon the natural impulse to explore our surroundings , and instead focus on futile efforts to tackle every mundane earthbound problem .
surely , the sight of the shuttle blasting off into orbit is the most poignant statement of mankind 's destiny .
kevin , charlotte , north carolina , usa with so much bad news in the media : terrorism , war , poverty ... it 's wonderful to see what we as human beings can achieve , when we put our minds to something positive .
we have the potential to achieve great things .
the crew of this shuttle mission are from different countries , cultures and backgrounds ; proof that if we work together , we can produce something that makes us all proud .
charlie , newcastle , uk to all those who claim the space programme has helped advance medicine and technology . think how much further along in those fields we could be if all the money wasted at nasa went into development . let alone feeding the poor .
shameful waste of resources .
i do n't want my tax dollar to be spent this way .
p. o 'donnell , rotorua , n.z. "
there are always small-minded people who are terrified of exploration " digby knight , henley-on-thames , uk there are always small-minded people who are terrified of exploration .
if we had their way , we 'd still be living in trees afraid of the dangerous savannah !
thankfully we 've always had a few who have done their best to pioneer new territories and worlds .
digby knight , henley-on-thames , uk i would argue that nasa is somewhat of an anachronism .
the " glory days " of the space race with russia are over .
instead , space exploration should be run by the national science foundation .
there , private and public money can be better organized to fund missions .
the nsf already runs most of the science stations here on earth .
why should space be any different ?
greg , alexandria , va space exploration * is * a waste of money .
had the billions been invested directly in more down-to-earth technologies , we would have seen the same spin-offs in medicine , it , and transport .
anonymous i ca n't believe the childish reactions to space exploration from folks like mike and anon , uk .
grow up , guys .
space exploration represents humanity at its most amazing .
you 're obviously just bitter because the us is leading the way .
typical .
shawn , washington , dc , usa exploration , of all kinds , has always helped man push the boundaries of technology .
the space programme is no different .
for this reason alone it is invaluable .
jason , detroit , usa " despite all the delays and expert checks , something still fell off it on take off " dan , yateley , uk looking at the shuttle i am always reminded of those creaking old 50 's and 60 's airliners you still see rattling around developing countries .
good in their day , but now so ropey and tired that they just scream " death trap " .
it says it all about the shuttle that despite all the delays and expert checks , something still fell off it on take off .
it 's high time this heap was scrapped , and a replacement worthy of the 21st century was introduced in its place .
dan , yateley , uk so the new ufos are unidentified falling objects ?
phil jones , frangy , france if you watch the film of the launch the piece of debris that falls off after the booster rocket drops off does not come from the shuttle it comes from the giant fuel tank , which is ' disposable ' anyway .
john nichols , brackley , nnorthants , uk how would brits feel if americans were talking about how britain should spend its money ?
michelle , raleigh , nc i think that nasa is still too hurried in launching the shuttle when the debris problem still exists .
maybe they should solve out the problem wholly before doing any thing else .
but the fact still shows that nasa has succeeded in launching the shuttle into space .
maybe that 's an incredible luck , although we still do n't know about the return of it .
but i believe it will succeed , too .
god 's will give luck to the crew .
nguyen hoang giang , hanoi , vietnam " i just pray she makes it back down ok " seun , london uk it was an excellent feeling seeing discovery go like that yesterday .
i am really happy for nasa and i just pray she makes it back down ok , that will be the icing on the cake .
seun , london uk oh dear !
the usa are off again trying to show how they can spend billions on space exploration , meanwhile trying to flex its muscles all around the world causing chaos- unbelievable !
mike , uk mankind is not content with polluting the earth !
it now wants to pollute space as well !
how sad !
millions starve while the usa burns dollars - what for ?
it truly is a sick world we live in these days !
anon , uk to anon , uk - the fuel is clean and non polluting - just water produced .
and as for waste of money - tell me about the dome and the london olympics .
longer term , i know what is more valuable !
george , chelmsford i 'm so glad to see the space programme resume shuttle launches .
space research is costly , but it 's like buying a lottery ticket - you never know what you 're going to get back from it , but once you go out there , there 's a chance you might win big .
and we already have - people have cited the benefits that have come from the space programme .
here 's to more exploration outside our atmosphere !
tony , london , uk i felt privileged to have been in florida for the launch .
it went off on time and from what i gather from reports , was perfect .
it 's something to tell the grandkids one day .
marylyn , london " space travel fires the imagination ! "
tim goodchild , surrey space travel fires the imagination !
to all those that criticise that the shuttle is old and the fact that its had two failures should perhaps think again the next time they board a 747 on route to their holiday destination .
tim goodchild , surrey absolutely fantastic pictures from discovery , especially when the external fuel tank was detached from the shuttle with the curvature of the earth in the background .
overall great launch , well done nasa .
paul , coventry , uk the american space programme is a great achievement and it is important that it continues .
the human race is capable of great things and it is not in our nature to keep still .
terry , crewe , cheshire my gosh !
the people saying the space program is a waste of money ? !
the commercial products used now as a result of nasa are staggering .
cat scans , dialysis machines , materials in your athletic shoes , water purification technology , cordless power tools , cool suits for firefighters , physical therapy equipment .
the list goes on .
the program is invaluable !
eric , usa " i think its well worth the effort and money to sustain humans in space " carl lennon , northampton , uk most of the people on here with negative comments do not realise how much space has done for humanity .
many medical experiments have been conducted in space which was the only place that it could be done .
the results of these experiments have saved thousands if not millions of lives .
i think its well worth the effort and money to sustain humans in space .
carl lennon , northampton , uk although america has proven itself to be the world 's best engineers , nasa is living on past glory .
many of its best scientists and engineers have left , it is no longer in the public limelight unless it has a disaster , and it is grossly underfunded .
america should reinvigorate the program with major new investment and ambitious new goals or shut it down .
as the eu space agency has recently learned , you ca n't explore space on the cheap .
this old technology and this antiquated worn out hardware needs to be retired along with the mediocre management which has taken over .
mark , usa what a novel way to distract your nation from the real problems at home and abroad .
the cost does n't matter since the nation is paying the bill .
ed , canada there are those who say space exploration is a waste of money .
on the contrary , space travel forces society to stretch and reach further in order to solve highly complex problems associated with putting man into space .
the solutions to these problems are broad and serve mankind in many ways .
the space program enables us to move forward faster than we otherwise would .
without such large goals our advancement slows and we become lazy .
david , philadelphia , usa come on people , of course sending people into space is dangerous and expensive .
that does n't mean we should n't do it though .
even if space exploration did not lead to technical advances and practical application , it would still be worth it .
why ?
because it 's cool .
we put a man on the moon , that 's pretty impressive considering just prior to wwi a man could only travel as far as a horse could take him .
stu , st paul , usa " the view from the fuel tank at over 14000mph was fantastic ! "
rod aries , glasgow the view from the fuel tank at over 14000mph was fantastic !
why are n't other space agencies doing this for the public ?
engage us !
rod aries , glasgow every time i see a rocket launch i think that newton made it possible ; his equations are still used to calculate the orbit .
how many other things in use today were invented over 300 years ago ?
vic , uk a sense of pride mixed with concern .
i live near the johnson space center and have relatives that have worked in the program as far back as gemini and apollo .
the space program is much more than a news story to us .
to those who think the space program is a waste of money : there is so much innovation and research that goes on behind the scenes that you 'd change your opinion if you took the time to look at what nasa has accomplished over the years and continues to accomplish today .
paul , houston , tx well , i 'm relieved it 's up there .
but they still seem to have this gung-ho attitude to safety .
i could n't believe that after killing two crews they are still happy to launch with a known serious fault .
chris hann , bay area , ca , usa congratulations to nasa on a successful launch .
i 'm glad to see that some nations still recognise the value of dreaming and aspiring to do great things and inspire their young people .
the money spent of spaceflight is miniscule compared to the many benefits .
it 's sad here in the uk that people are so ignorant and short-sighted with regards to space exploration that we ca n't see the good that can from it - and then we wonder the younger generations are n't interested in science , medicine and technology .
victor , birmingham , england " this launch showed the world what can be accomplished with great teamwork , ambition and determination " d soni , nuneaton , uk i watched the launch and was overcome with pride .
all the people involved in this great feat have overcome extreme obstacles .
this launch showed the world what can be accomplished with great teamwork , ambition and determination .
congratulations discovery !
d soni , nuneaton , uk mankind needs a vision .
interplanetary travel is necessary to achieve that end .
stuart haines , calgary , alberta , canada it 's time to junk the space shuttle and perhaps " rethink " this whole business of manned space flight for the time being .
think about it , other than as a showy display of national pride , what benefits do any nations get at this time from sending humans into space ?
perhaps in the future when we have real goals and reliable " safe " transportation we can start wasting our time and money with such " propaganda flights " , but now is n't the time and place for such foolishness .
charlie , niagara falls new york people always complain that space programs are too expensive , but do people appreciate how much safer the planet is with them ?
we can monitor dangerous weather , asteroids , and send tv , radio , and telephone signals via satellites .
space programs really have helped the planet excel in a positive way , and i 'm glad the discovery is finally continuing what has already been a remarkable feat of engineering .
tim hunt -lrb- 16 -rrb- , plymouth , england in these days darkened by the spectre of global terrorism , we seek hope and strength in many places .
the fog of war and the wind that whispers the question of " why are we fighting in the middle east ? ' diminish our confidence in our governmen

washington believes the sahara desert is a vast ungoverned wasteland and , hence , a haven for terrorists .
but critics say the us is exaggerating the threat and fomenting trouble .
up to 1,000 us personnel and the armed forces of seven countries in the region took part in flintlock 2005 , a counter-terrorism training operation .
the exercise 's fictional scenario involved a terrorist group being chased across national borders from mauritania in the west , through to mali , niger and finally chad .
" we 've already had terrorism in the sahel , it 's a matter of how bad it could get , " says charles wald , the us general responsible for putting the sahara on the map as a new front in the war on terror .
dangerous myth for centuries , the sahara , stretching from mauritania to the red sea , has been criss-crossed by men carrying goods and ideas .
but in the western imagination , its dunes and planes remain a mysterious and dangerous region .
this is a myth which many say is now being exploited with disastrous consequences .
" for those who say it 's overestimated , if you 're one of the dead people in mauritania , i do n't think you 've overestimated anything , " says gen wald .
days before the americans arrived in the region , 15 mauritanian soldiers were killed in an attack on an army base on the north-east border with algeria and mali , which has been blamed on islamic insurgents .
the gspc , or salafist group for preaching and combat , claimed responsibility for the attack via a website .
they boasted that they " planned an ambush for the mauritanian apostate and puppet army , destroying seven vehicles and many members of satan 's army " .
gspc , which formed in 1998 , has its roots in algeria 's seven-year civil war and is suspected of having links with al-qaeda .
estimates of numbers of gspc members vary widely from a few hundred to as many as 4,000 .
destabilisation jeremy keenan , a uk expert on the sahara , says the gspc website proves nothing .
he does not think the group is responsible for the mauritania border attack .
" pretty well everyone in the sahara does n't believe the gspc have done it , " he says .
" the coincidence with flintlock starting the day before is just too great . "
mr keenan claims the algerians have used the gspc as a way of seducing the us into the region .
" probably 90 % of the saharan population just knows that the gspc is just a pseudonym for the algerian security services , and there 's a lot of truth in that . "
he says convincing the us of a terrorist threat in the sahara has allowed the algerians to shake off their pariah status and to obtain previously withheld military equipment from the us .
wherever the americans are , whether it 's iraq or wherever , an islamic resistance rises up moussa ould ham editor , le calame us ambassador richard roth in dakar , senegal , said the us and algeria have been co-operating on economic , military and intelligence issues for many years .
" i do n't see it as an opportunistic attempt by the algerians to use the world focus on terrorism as a means of strengthening that relationship , " he said .
two years ago , another incident occurred linked to the gspc .
it was the first time they emerged as a terrorist group in the sahara .
thirty-two european tourists were kidnapped in the algerian desert and held for several months .
the algerians helped secure their release , both by negotiation and by force .
but these two so-called terrorist incidents - the tourist kidnapping and the attack on the mauritanian army base - have been called into question .
and yet these are the two single most important pieces of evidence put forward by the us to justify the flintlock exercise .
mohamed fall ould oumere , editor of la tribune , one of mauritania 's leading independent newspapers , says the gspc has never attacked mauritanian interests .
" why ?
because mauritania is a refuge for its members , " he says .
moussa ould ham , editor of le calame , another independent paper , is convinced a new strand of the gspc , not focussed on regime change in algeria , carried out the attack .
" wherever the americans are , whether it 's iraq or wherever , an islamic resistance rises up , and perhaps it 's this islamic resistance that we are seeing appearing in mauritania today . "

washington believes the sahara desert is a vast ungoverned wasteland and , hence , a haven for terrorists .
but critics say the us is exaggerating the threat and fomenting trouble .
up to 1,000 us personnel and the armed forces of seven countries in the region took part in flintlock 2005 , a counter-terrorism training operation .
the exercise 's fictional scenario involved a terrorist group being chased across national borders from mauritania in the west , through to mali , niger and finally chad .
" we 've already had terrorism in the sahel , it 's a matter of how bad it could get , " says charles wald , the us general responsible for putting the sahara on the map as a new front in the war on terror .
dangerous myth for centuries , the sahara , stretching from mauritania to the red sea , has been criss-crossed by men carrying goods and ideas .
but in the western imagination , its dunes and planes remain a mysterious and dangerous region .
this is a myth which many say is now being exploited with disastrous consequences .
" for those who say it 's overestimated , if you 're one of the dead people in mauritania , i do n't think you 've overestimated anything , " says gen wald .
days before the americans arrived in the region , 15 mauritanian soldiers were killed in an attack on an army base on the north-east border with algeria and mali , which has been blamed on islamic insurgents .
the gspc , or salafist group for preaching and combat , claimed responsibility for the attack via a website .
they boasted that they " planned an ambush for the mauritanian apostate and puppet army , destroying seven vehicles and many members of satan 's army " .
gspc , which formed in 1998 , has its roots in algeria 's seven-year civil war and is suspected of having links with al-qaeda .
estimates of numbers of gspc members vary widely from a few hundred to as many as 4,000 .
destabilisation jeremy keenan , a uk expert on the sahara , says the gspc website proves nothing .
he does not think the group is responsible for the mauritania border attack .
" pretty well everyone in the sahara does n't believe the gspc have done it , " he says .
" the coincidence with flintlock starting the day before is just too great . "
mr keenan claims the algerians have used the gspc as a way of seducing the us into the region .
" probably 90 % of the saharan population just knows that the gspc is just a pseudonym for the algerian security services , and there 's a lot of truth in that . "
he says convincing the us of a terrorist threat in the sahara has allowed the algerians to shake off their pariah status and to obtain previously withheld military equipment from the us .
wherever the americans are , whether it 's iraq or wherever , an islamic resistance rises up moussa ould ham editor , le calame us ambassador richard roth in dakar , senegal , said the us and algeria have been co-operating on economic , military and intelligence issues for many years .
" i do n't see it as an opportunistic attempt by the algerians to use the world focus on terrorism as a means of strengthening that relationship , " he said .
two years ago , another incident occurred linked to the gspc .
it was the first time they emerged as a terrorist group in the sahara .
thirty-two european tourists were kidnapped in the algerian desert and held for several months .
the algerians helped secure their release , both by negotiation and by force .
but these two so-called terrorist incidents - the tourist kidnapping and the attack on the mauritanian army base - have been called into question .
and yet these are the two single most important pieces of evidence put forward by the us to justify the flintlock exercise .
mohamed fall ould oumere , editor of la tribune , one of mauritania 's leading independent newspapers , says the gspc has never attacked mauritanian interests .
" why ?
because mauritania is a refuge for its members , " he says .
moussa ould ham , editor of le calame , another independent paper , is convinced a new strand of the gspc , not focussed on regime change in algeria , carried out the attack .

the charity said the animal is the third most popular pet in the uk after dogs and cats but that they were the most neglected .
rspca inspectors responded to 574 cruelty complaints about rabbits in wales and the west of england in 2004 but believe more may be suffering .
three people are due in court in august to face charges of neglecting rabbits .
the rspca said many animals starved to death alone , forgotten about in hutches at the bottom of gardens .
five rabbit facts rabbits need as much exercise as a small dog they should not kept alone but should be neutered to prevent breeding rabbits can forget their companions after a few hours so should not be separated their teeth never stop growing so they need grinding down on food a rabbit 's diet should contain 80-90 % hay in february 2005 , an rspca inspector rescued 21 rabbits which had been dumped in a field in bangor in a cardboard box .
it was thought the owners had dumped the lop-eared bunnies because two had bred to create the 21 and they could not cope .
in 2002 , a couple from cardiff were convicted of causing unnecessary suffering to their rabbit because they did not know it could not eat the straw they were trying to feed it .
a vet involved in the case said the rabbit , which had starved to death , had probably suffered for at least eight days beforehand .
the owners were fined £ 200 and banned from keeping animals for five years .
the charity hopes its campaign with highlight what people need to do to improve the lives of hundreds of rabbits .
rspca regional superintendent martyn hubbard said : " whilst there are many caring and responsible rabbit owners , many take on a rabbit on a whim and are ignorant of the animal 's needs and requirements .
" the rspca collects hundreds of rabbits every year that have simply been discarded .
" the point of this campaign is to make people aware of the time , commitment , money and specific care that rabbits require and deserve . "

cheam channy , a member of the opposition sam rainsy party , was arrested in february after being stripped of his parliamentary immunity .
he could face up to 20 years in jail if found guilty by the military court .
the leader of the party , sam rainsy , and another mp , chea poch , were also stripped of their immunity in february and immediately left the country .
human rights activists have strongly criticised cheam channy 's trial , which is widely seen as a move by the government to stifle political dissent .
" many people already have in mind which direction the outcome might take .
it is unlikely they will acquit him , " his lawyer ket khy told the associated press .
the judge will announce the verdict of the one-day trail on tuesday .
fraud charges " the military court would like to announce the opening of a public trial to try cheam channy and khom piseth , who have been charged by the military court with forming an illegal rebel group and cheating , " judge ney thol is quoted as saying at the beginning of monday 's court session .
khom phisith , another member of the sam rainsy party , is being charged in absentia .
sam rainsy has been an outspoken government critic the prosecution also added a charge of fraud against cheam channy , saying he collected fees from recruits to his rebel group .
" i have never recruited or appointed anyone in an army structure , nor have i taken money from anyone , " cheam channy told the court , according to the associated press .
" i am pleading with the court to set me free .
i have never done anything even close to what the charges against me say , " he said .
but prosecutor prum sun thol claimed cheam channy 's actions " could affect national security " .
speaking to the associated press , sam rainsy said on monday that if cheam channy received a severe sentence , " the trend will be very worrying " .
sam rainsy himself faces three lawsuits charging him of defamation and slander , which stem from his claims that the government plotted to kill its political rivals , and that coalition partner prince ranariddh took bribes to join the government .
he fled to paris after he , too , was stripped of parliamentary immunity earlier this year .

seven men spent some 76 hours in the naval mini-submarine in the pacific , with a dwindling air supply .
the russians thanked a uk team whose underwater robot cut nets and antenna cables which had snagged the craft .
the sub 's crew had written farewell notes as they endured cold , hunger and thirst on the seabed .
but when the sub resurfaced the men were able to climb out unaided .
they are now recovering in hospital and their health is reported to be satisfactory .

russian efforts to rescue the sub 's crew , which included looping a cable onto the vessel to drag it to higher waters , had failed earlier .
meagre supplies during their ordeal the crew had just a few gulps of water a day to drink and just a few biscuits to eat , russian media report .
congratulating the uk team , defence minister sergei ivanov presented them with watches and also promised awards for the rescued crew .
he had witnessed the rescue operation off kamchatka .

russian defence ministry sources quoted by the daily kommersant on monday say the commander of the russian navy , admiral vladimir kuroyedov , will be sent into retirement soon .
he had also seen his navy embarrassed on 30 july by the near sinking of a flagship vessel during an exercise in st petersburg on the eve of russian navy day .
the mini-submarine got into trouble on thursday there had still been no public word from or appearance by president vladimir putin by the time the rescued men went ashore on sunday , three days after the ordeal began .
the bbc 's sarah rainsford in moscow says that questions are now being asked , including : why russia still has no modern deep-sea rescue equipment , five years after the sinking of the kursk nuclear submarine in which 118 sailors perished why information on this accident from the navy was again late in coming and then deeply contradictory .
pinned to the seabed the submersible was snagged in vast fishing nets and in a network of underwater antennae forming part of a military coastal surveillance system , russian officials said .
the network was described as a two-tier antennae lattice covering an area of 750 sq m and held in place by 60-ton anchors .
the british scorpio craft involved in the rescue was flown to kamchatka and taken out to sea on a russian vessel .
the managing director of a british firm involved in the rescue - rumic - told the bbc the operation had taken several hours .
" there were a lot of fishing nets which we had to cut away , but there were no steel cables , although some of it did look like steel .
initial reports could have suggested there were steel rather than nylon nets , " roger chapman told the bbc .
according to the commander of the pacific fleet , admiral viktor fyodorov , fishermen had violated the navy 's rules in the bay , abandoning nets which had got caught on the underwater surveillance system .
they had not informed the navy about it , he said .

russian defence ministry sources quoted by the daily kommersant on monday say the commander of the russian navy , admiral vladimir kuroyedov , will be sent into retirement soon .

pinned to the seabed the submersible was snagged in vast fishing nets and in a network of underwater antennae forming part of a military coastal surveillance system , russian officials said .
the network was described as a two-tier antennae lattice covering an area of 750 sq m and held in place by 60-ton anchors .
the british scorpio craft involved in the rescue was flown to kamchatka and taken out to sea on a russian vessel .
the managing director of a british firm involved in the rescue - rumic - told the bbc the operation had taken several hours .
" there were a lot of fishing nets which we had to cut away , but there were no steel cables , although some of it did look like steel .
initial reports could have suggested there were steel rather than nylon nets , " roger chapman told the bbc .
according to the commander of the pacific fleet , admiral viktor fyodorov , fishermen had violated the navy 's rules in the bay , abandoning nets which had got caught on the underwater surveillance system .
they had not informed the navy about it , he said .

last week an austrian programmer published examples of malicious code that exploits a microsoft command shell technology currently under development .
but the software giant has said the technology targeted will not be part of the next version of windows .
" these reports pose no risk for microsoft customers , " said the firm 's stephen toulouse in a blog posting .
vista , previously codenamed longhorn , is due for release towards the end of 2006 , half a decade after windows xp .
no threat the malicious code affects a microsoft command shell technology called msh .
the viruses do not attempt to exploit a software vulnerability and do not encompass a new method of attack stephen toulouse , microsoft this could replace the simple command shell used in windows .
a command shell lets users enter text-based commands , as in the predecessor to windows , dos .
