pfahls , who served as state secretary for defense from 1987 to 1992 , insisted that he had not done anything in return for the money .
presiding judge maximilian hofmeister said that while pfahls may have greased the wheels for the deal , he had not directly violated the duties of his office . " you accepted money without being corrupt , " hofmeister told the defendant while reading the verdict .
" you were working on commission . "
kohl exonerated pfahls bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german chancellor helmut kohl in court during the pfahls trial on aug .
3 several highest-ranking former government officials , including former chancellor helmut kohl and former foreign minister hans-dietrich genscher , had testified during the trial that pfahls had not influenced a controversial sale of tanks to saudi arabia during the 1991 gulf war .
after five years on the run , pfahls was arrested in paris by french and german police in july 2004 and extradited to germany in january .
he could be released as early as september because his time in french and german custody will be counted against the sentence .
when half the sentence has been served , the judges may convert the rest of the prison time to a suspended sentence . the sentence was in line with an agreement between the prosecution , the defense and the court ahead of the trial that limited his total jail time to two years and three months if nothing during the trial contradicted the admission he made . because kohl confirmed that the defendant had had no political influence over the armored vehicles deal , the prosecution dropped the more serious corruption charge the day of the former chancellor 's testimony . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de kohl takes heat off former minister pfahls the corruption trial of holger pfahls took a key turn on wednesday with the testimony of ex-chancellor helmut kohl , who effectively cleared the former junior defense minister of suspicions of bribery .

his comments on eastern voters are being linked to the conservatives ' slide in the polls . merkel was in damage-control mode as the week ended after stoiber 's remarks on eastern voters appeared to be seriously damaging her campaign .
stoiber provoked controversy earlier in the week after he characterized voters in the east as " frustrated " and questioned their judgment before general elections next month . merkel herself comes from eastern germany , but despite this , her party , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , is currently performing worse in the east than in the west . in an interview with zdf television late on thursday , merkel spoke of the 35 years she spent living under communism in east germany , and stressed that she understood the concerns of the people in the region .
she added that she wanted to be chancellor of all germans . " we will fight for every vote , but we definitely don ’ t need to insult voters , " merkel said .
" every move - intentional or not - which splits rather than unites germany is totally counterproductive . " slipping in the polls only a few weeks ago , the campaign for merkel and the cdu looked like clear sailing , with the conservatives enjoying a sizeable lead over chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- . but that lead has shrunk , leaving the cdu and their likely coalition partner , the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , defending a slim majority of 49 percent , barely ahead of the combined vote of the other parties strong enough to enter parliament . eastern voters could be forgiven for feeling slighted by the conservatives .

and it may end up helping schröder , who is bidding for a third term for his coalition of social democrats and greens . " his remark is not only tasteless , but shows a lack of democratic respect , " said schröder .
" stoiber 's comment cements division and insults people who have had to live under harder conditions than we in the west .

his comments on eastern voters are being linked to the conservatives ' slide in the polls . merkel was in damage-control mode as the week ended after stoiber 's remarks on eastern voters appeared to be seriously damaging her campaign .
stoiber provoked controversy earlier in the week after he characterized voters in the east as " frustrated " and questioned their judgment before general elections next month . merkel herself comes from eastern germany , but despite this , her party , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , is currently performing worse in the east than in the west . in an interview with zdf television late on thursday , merkel spoke of the 35 years she spent living under communism in east germany , and stressed that she understood the concerns of the people in the region .
she added that she wanted to be chancellor of all germans . " we will fight for every vote , but we definitely don ’ t need to insult voters , " merkel said .
" every move - intentional or not - which splits rather than unites germany is totally counterproductive . " slipping in the polls only a few weeks ago , the campaign for merkel and the cdu looked like clear sailing , with the conservatives enjoying a sizeable lead over chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- . but that lead has shrunk , leaving the cdu and their likely coalition partner , the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , defending a slim majority of 49 percent , barely ahead of the combined vote of the other parties strong enough to enter parliament . eastern voters could be forgiven for feeling slighted by the conservatives .
commenting last week on the shocking case of a german woman from the east charged with murdering nine of her newborn babies , senior conservative jörg schönbohm said the east german dictatorship had left easterners lacking in a sense of responsibility and morality . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder hopes to profit from the conservatives ' mistakes stoiber 's comment this week that " those who are frustrated ca n't be allowed to determine the fate of germany " only added insult to injury .
and it may end up helping schröder , who is bidding for a third term for his coalition of social democrats and greens . " his remark is not only tasteless , but shows a lack of democratic respect , " said schröder .
" stoiber 's comment cements division and insults people who have had to live under harder conditions than we in the west . " the left party , led by the charismatic former finance minister oskar lafontaine , may also profit from the conservatives ' gaffes , seeing as this new party is currently leading the polls in the east with more than 30 percent . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de conservative gaffe enrages east germans germany 's first chancellor candidate from the east , angela merkel , ran into fresh electoral problems in the crucial ex-communist states thursday after a key ally bashed the region 's " frustrated " voters .

renate künast champions made in germany the green party 's renate künast was accused of protectionism after her opening statements of the election campaign urged voters to buy german products .
in reality , quality rather than origin matters most to consumers . in germany , the social democrat-green coalition is fighting for its political life in the coming federal election .
some politicians are championing unusual policies in their attempts to boost their parties ' popularity with the electorate .
consumer protection minister renate künast is one . künast has positioned herself on the side of german manufacturers and by doing so has also placed herself in the cross hairs of the media .
proclaiming her allegiance and support for german products , the green party minister appeared in the popular sunday newspaper bild am sonntag to urge her compatriots to buy domestically produced goods and help protect the jobs of fellow germans . the move backfired and künast was accused of protectionism .
in an attempt to calm the stormy waters , a government statement attempted to spin the story into something a little more palatable .
künast was not calling for a boycott of foreign goods , it claimed , but for an environment where workers ' rights are upheld and child labor abroad is not rewarded . but what do the consumers of germany think about künast 's rallying call to " buy german ? " cheap goods flooding german market bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : digging deeper past the ill-conceived initial rant , one finds a central argument to the minister 's call , one which has been a matter of debate for years : the trend toward discount products , especially food .
the no-frills product ranges have come under fire mainly due to the fact that they are produced in other countries where labor costs are cheaper but sold in germany . but does the consumer really have the choice to support german products ? in the bonn branch of the nationwide department store chain kaufhof , an investigation into the country of origin of most of the clothing available there reveals an overwhelmingly international trend .
labels on trousers , t-shirts , belts and hats disclose many different origins : made in china , made in bangladesh , made in turkey and made in romania .
not one says made in germany . moving to another floor , the story is the same .
even the world famous steiff animals , cuddly toys associated with high-quality german manufacturing processes , carry the label : " produced in china under quality control of steiff germany " . " made in germany " not the whole story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the consumer generally does not have the possibility to find out where the product has been produced , " says holger brackemann from german standards watchdog stiftung warentest .
" the famous ' made in germany ' label , that they may find on textiles and other products , may not be the whole truth , that it may not have been produced here from the first through to the last manufacturing step . " the government 's statement that künast was looking to prevent worker exploitation and child labor in foreign countries by urging germans to buy locally produced , in theory , is a good example of trying to kill two birds with one stone .
on the one hand , promoting german goods is a tick for trying to protect jobs at home while trying to put pressure on countries that use child labor is stab at promoting an ethical foreign policy . german consumers want quality items bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but do german consumers know about the origins of their products or whether ethical practices were used in their production ?
do they even care ? when asked if she takes any notice of where products are produced , one shopper in bonn replied : " no , not at all . "
another added : " i shop for quality .
quality goods not only come from germany .
and germany makes a lot of rubbish as well . " another shopper said : " i look first at the quality and then at the price , and then if i decide if buying this is worthwhile , then i get it .
the country of origin does n't really feature . " " the argument about child labor is an important one , " says one man .
" but they must also earn their money .

consumer protection minister renate künast is one . künast has positioned herself on the side of german manufacturers and by doing so has also placed herself in the cross hairs of the media .
proclaiming her allegiance and support for german products , the green party minister appeared in the popular sunday newspaper bild am sonntag to urge her compatriots to buy domestically produced goods and help protect the jobs of fellow germans . the move backfired and künast was accused of protectionism .
in an attempt to calm the stormy waters , a government statement attempted to spin the story into something a little more palatable .
künast was not calling for a boycott of foreign goods , it claimed , but for an environment where workers ' rights are upheld and child labor abroad is not rewarded . but what do the consumers of germany think about künast 's rallying call to " buy german ? " cheap goods flooding german market bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : digging deeper past the ill-conceived initial rant , one finds a central argument to the minister 's call , one which has been a matter of debate for years : the trend toward discount products , especially food .
the no-frills product ranges have come under fire mainly due to the fact that they are produced in other countries where labor costs are cheaper but sold in germany . but does the consumer really have the choice to support german products ? in the bonn branch of the nationwide department store chain kaufhof , an investigation into the country of origin of most of the clothing available there reveals an overwhelmingly international trend .
labels on trousers , t-shirts , belts and hats disclose many different origins : made in china , made in bangladesh , made in turkey and made in romania .
not one says made in germany . moving to another floor , the story is the same .
even the world famous steiff animals , cuddly toys associated with high-quality german manufacturing processes , carry the label : " produced in china under quality control of steiff germany " . " made in germany " not the whole story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the consumer generally does not have the possibility to find out where the product has been produced , " says holger brackemann from german standards watchdog stiftung warentest .
" the famous ' made in germany ' label , that they may find on textiles and other products , may not be the whole truth , that it may not have been produced here from the first through to the last manufacturing step . " the government 's statement that künast was looking to prevent worker exploitation and child labor in foreign countries by urging germans to buy locally produced , in theory , is a good example of trying to kill two birds with one stone .
on the one hand , promoting german goods is a tick for trying to protect jobs at home while trying to put pressure on countries that use child labor is stab at promoting an ethical foreign policy . german consumers want quality items bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but do german consumers know about the origins of their products or whether ethical practices were used in their production ?

dw-world : how is germa n y doi n g i n your opi n io n ?
peter murphy : i believe that germany is still in a relatively strong economic position .
the challenges being faced by many countries of unemployment continue to cause pressures for the government - a situation that does not seem to be likely to improve in the short term .
i believe that there is a need for a critical review of how the economy can be stimulated .
with a willingness to be flexible and more responsive to " external forces , " i believe there is room for the types of change that would lead to an increase in social and economic stability .
when recruiting internationally , i often hear of germany being referred to as a " hardship assignment country " - an image that i do not share , but see as a major challenge to be addressed by future governments .
globalization is not a concept that can be ignored in the hope that one day it will go away .
what n eeds to happe n i n germa n y to help speed up the cou n try 's recovery ?
i would hope that the elected government would use their wisdom to create a better , fairer , more sustainable society for us all to live in .
i would hope to see tolerance and support for groups and individuals less fortunate than ourselves put more significantly on the agenda .
i would like young and old alike to feel that the future had something to offer and that they had something to contribute - a sense of worth .
societies are , in my opinion , successful when people feel that they have something to contribute .
high levels of unemployment , uncertainties about the future , worries about coping in retirement do not lead to economic growth and development .

dw-world : how is germa n y doi n g i n your opi n io n ?
peter murphy : i believe that germany is still in a relatively strong economic position .
the challenges being faced by many countries of unemployment continue to cause pressures for the government - a situation that does not seem to be likely to improve in the short term .
i believe that there is a need for a critical review of how the economy can be stimulated .
with a willingness to be flexible and more responsive to " external forces , " i believe there is room for the types of change that would lead to an increase in social and economic stability .
when recruiting internationally , i often hear of germany being referred to as a " hardship assignment country " - an image that i do not share , but see as a major challenge to be addressed by future governments .
globalization is not a concept that can be ignored in the hope that one day it will go away .
what n eeds to happe n i n germa n y to help speed up the cou n try 's recovery ?
i would hope that the elected government would use their wisdom to create a better , fairer , more sustainable society for us all to live in .
i would hope to see tolerance and support for groups and individuals less fortunate than ourselves put more significantly on the agenda .
i would like young and old alike to feel that the future had something to offer and that they had something to contribute - a sense of worth .
societies are , in my opinion , successful when people feel that they have something to contribute .
high levels of unemployment , uncertainties about the future , worries about coping in retirement do not lead to economic growth and development .
the government has a challenge to make change attractive and the norm .

"
renate künast champions made in germany the green party 's renate künast was accused of protectionism after her opening statements of the election campaign urged voters to buy german products .
in reality , quality rather than origin matters most to consumers . in germany , the social democrat-green coalition is fighting for its political life in the coming federal election .
some politicians are championing unusual policies in their attempts to boost their parties ' popularity with the electorate .
consumer protection minister renate künast is one . künast has positioned herself on the side of german manufacturers and by doing so has also placed herself in the cross hairs of the media .
proclaiming her allegiance and support for german products , the green party minister appeared in the popular sunday newspaper bild am sonntag to urge her compatriots to buy domestically produced goods and help protect the jobs of fellow germans . the move backfired and künast was accused of protectionism .
in an attempt to calm the stormy waters , a government statement attempted to spin the story into something a little more palatable .
künast was not calling for a boycott of foreign goods , it claimed , but for an environment where workers ' rights are upheld and child labor abroad is not rewarded . but what do the consumers of germany think about künast 's rallying call to " buy german ? " cheap goods flooding german market bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : digging deeper past the ill-conceived initial rant , one finds a central argument to the minister 's call , one which has been a matter of debate for years : the trend toward discount products , especially food .
the no-frills product ranges have come under fire mainly due to the fact that they are produced in other countries where labor costs are cheaper but sold in germany . but does the consumer really have the choice to support german products ? in the bonn branch of the nationwide department store chain kaufhof , an investigation into the country of origin of most of the clothing available there reveals an overwhelmingly international trend .
labels on trousers , t-shirts , belts and hats disclose many different origins : made in china , made in bangladesh , made in turkey and made in romania .
not one says made in germany . moving to another floor , the story is the same .
even the world famous steiff animals , cuddly toys associated with high-quality german manufacturing processes , carry the label : " produced in china under quality control of steiff germany " . " made in germany " not the whole story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the consumer generally does not have the possibility to find out where the product has been produced , " says holger brackemann from german standards watchdog stiftung warentest .
" the famous ' made in germany ' label , that they may find on textiles and other products , may not be the whole truth , that it may not have been produced here from the first through to the last manufacturing step . " the government 's statement that künast was looking to prevent worker exploitation and child labor in foreign countries by urging germans to buy locally produced , in theory , is a good example of trying to kill two birds with one stone .

the ruhr valley will be transfixed by dortmund 's clash with rivals schalke .
in nearby leverkusen , champions bayern munich face bayer 04 . ever since germans first took a leather ball and started booting it into a net , the two ruhr valley clubs , dortmund and schalke from neighboring gelsenkirchen have displayed their disdain for each other on the pitch .
the two ruhrpott rivals have met 126 times in total , 66 of those in the bundesliga .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : being a borussia dortmund fan is n't just a run-of-the-mill hobby fans in bvb yellow and schalke royal blue live to see this game . and the passion always makes its way from the terraces to the pitch .
schalke coach ralf rangnick 's troop must play in the unfriendly confines of the westfalen stadium but their fortunes there have been particularly good in the recent past .
schalke have not lost in the last six encounters in front of a regularly sold out 70,000 capacity in dortmund 's cauldron arena .
" in the last few years we have looked pretty good in dortmund .
i am assuming that this time it will be the same , " schalke goalkeeper frank rost told sport bild .
in the arena aufschalke on may 14 , dortmund broke a 12-game winless streak , topping off a tremendous comeback in the second half of the season .
both clubs value the rivalry and use it as a catapult for success in the bundesliga .
bvb need the boost more than schalke , coming away with a tie in their first match and having not reached the uefa cup after crashing out of the intertoto cup in the summer .
bayern meets bayer coach felix magath probably has a bone to pick with leverkusen .
last season in his first appearance as munich coach in the bayarena , his team got pasted 4-1 .
naturally , it was just a small hurdle in their march to the league championship .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two bayern players -lrb- red -rrb- clamp down on a gladbach opponent in the first week revenge may be on magath 's mind , but only far , far at the back .
the big controversy for the team , and there is almost always one at bayern munich , is the storm surrounding midfielder michael ballack .
there 's no lack of column inches being devoted to the subject of whether the germany captain is out of favor or not .
magath , not a man of many words , has been quiet , saying that all 23 men on the squad are both starters and substitutes .
words that might confuse some soccer players - but it 's doubtful that michael ballack thinks he is a substitute .
leverkusen started their campaign with an impressive effort against frankfurt last week , cruising to a 4-1 victory .
and could that be repeated ?
" we have the quality , " bayer midfielder bernd schneider told kicker magazine .
the contenders with easier assignments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg 's rafael van der vaart should lead with his head one of the dark horses in the bundesliga this season must be hamburg .

the bielefeld defense resembled a sieve in a 5-2 defeat against bremen , holes that must be stopped soon or coach thomas von heesen will be battling against a rapdly sinking ship .
hertha berlin face the new boys from frankfurt .
soccer followers always expect a lot from the capital city team , but berlin has on the whole been disappointing .

the ruhr valley will be transfixed by dortmund 's clash with rivals schalke .
in nearby leverkusen , champions bayern munich face bayer 04 . ever since germans first took a leather ball and started booting it into a net , the two ruhr valley clubs , dortmund and schalke from neighboring gelsenkirchen have displayed their disdain for each other on the pitch .
the two ruhrpott rivals have met 126 times in total , 66 of those in the bundesliga .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : being a borussia dortmund fan is n't just a run-of-the-mill hobby fans in bvb yellow and schalke royal blue live to see this game . and the passion always makes its way from the terraces to the pitch .
schalke coach ralf rangnick 's troop must play in the unfriendly confines of the westfalen stadium but their fortunes there have been particularly good in the recent past .
schalke have not lost in the last six encounters in front of a regularly sold out 70,000 capacity in dortmund 's cauldron arena .
" in the last few years we have looked pretty good in dortmund .
i am assuming that this time it will be the same , " schalke goalkeeper frank rost told sport bild .
in the arena aufschalke on may 14 , dortmund broke a 12-game winless streak , topping off a tremendous comeback in the second half of the season .
both clubs value the rivalry and use it as a catapult for success in the bundesliga .
bvb need the boost more than schalke , coming away with a tie in their first match and having not reached the uefa cup after crashing out of the intertoto cup in the summer .
bayern meets bayer coach felix magath probably has a bone to pick with leverkusen .

the big controversy for the team , and there is almost always one at bayern munich , is the storm surrounding midfielder michael ballack .
there 's no lack of column inches being devoted to the subject of whether the germany captain is out of favor or not .
magath , not a man of many words , has been quiet , saying that all 23 men on the squad are both starters and substitutes .
words that might confuse some soccer players - but it 's doubtful that michael ballack thinks he is a substitute .
leverkusen started their campaign with an impressive effort against frankfurt last week , cruising to a 4-1 victory .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 12.08.2005 european cities face future heatwaves großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as temperatures soar in future , europeans will struggle to keep cool a new study by the wwf environmental organization shows that temperatures in european cities are on the rise with more extreme weather predicted in the increasingly sticky future . although many europeans are wearing jumpers in august this year , the fact remains that temperatures across central europe are continuing to rise .
according to a study by the environmental organization wwf , european cities are set to sizzle in the future . in terms of summer temperature increases , madrid is number one .
no other city in europe has seen such dramatic rises than the spanish capital over the last 30 years .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 12.08.2005 european cities face future heatwaves großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as temperatures soar in future , europeans will struggle to keep cool a new study by the wwf environmental organization shows that temperatures in european cities are on the rise with more extreme weather predicted in the increasingly sticky future . although many europeans are wearing jumpers in august this year , the fact remains that temperatures across central europe are continuing to rise .
according to a study by the environmental organization wwf , european cities are set to sizzle in the future . in terms of summer temperature increases , madrid is number one .
no other city in europe has seen such dramatic rises than the spanish capital over the last 30 years .
on average , madrid has seen temperatures climb by 2.2 degrees celsius -lrb- 35.96 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- in the last three decades .
trailing , and sweating , not so far behind come london , lisbon , luxembourg and athens . for londoners , more used to the " pea soup " mists rolling down the thames with a foggy chill , the rise in temperature may initially be gratefully received . that is until global temperatures rise to such an extent that the polar ice caps melt ; either causing sea levels to rise which in turn could lead to the thames flooding or a dilution of the gulf stream by fresh water which would eventually stop the warm flow to the british isles leading to a possible ice age . spain and portugal facing droughts , crop failures while the long term effect on london could be potentially disastrous , both madrid and lisbon are experiencing problems , although less apocalyptic , right now .
summers in the spanish and portuguese cities have been getting hotter and hotter leading to droughts and water shortages . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the reservoirs are empty , many fields and crops have dried up and forest areas are tinder-box dry , leading to increasingly common seasonal infernos .
both countries have requested help from the eu as crop start to fail . climatologists have been warning for years that europe must prepare for more and more extreme weather conditions and events such as drought , violent storms and floods . human industrialization to blame , says wwf martin hiller , climate spokesperson for the wwf , dismisses claims by some that these conditions are caused by variations in natural habitats around the globe .
" the majority of scientists agree that humans play the determining role , " he said . " in more than 200 years of industrialization , the co2 level in the atmosphere has increased by a third of its original value .
this is caused by humans , there is no natural process . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while humans are reaping what they sow in terms of increased heat and its effects , fauna and flora are suffering too and in many cases are being hardest hit .
the melting of the arctic ice flows are reducing the natural habitat and hunting grounds of polar bears while soaring temperatures could demand too much of fragile ecological systems like coral reefs . but the human population is also starting to see devastating effects .
" for example , at the heat wave of 2003 , " martin hiller warned .
" altogether around 40,000 people died as a result . " the future 's bright , the future 's scorching in the last century , the worldwide average temperature rose by about 0.6 degrees celsius ; in europe by about 1 degree .
scientists believe that the human race has seen nothing yet and that the biggest hike in temperatures is yet to come . scientists at the un 's intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- predict that we can expect a rise of between 1.4 to 5.8 degrees celsius . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this will lead to more intense summers for european cities and , according to the wwf , not only more dramatic environmental effects but also economic ones .

pfahls , who served as state secretary for defense from 1987 to 1992 , insisted that he had not done anything in return for the money .
presiding judge maximilian hofmeister said that while pfahls may have greased the wheels for the deal , he had not directly violated the duties of his office . " you accepted money without being corrupt , " hofmeister told the defendant while reading the verdict .
" you were working on commission . "
kohl exonerated pfahls bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german chancellor helmut kohl in court during the pfahls trial on aug .
3 several highest-ranking former government officials , including former chancellor helmut kohl and former foreign minister hans-dietrich genscher , had testified during the trial that pfahls had not influenced a controversial sale of tanks to saudi arabia during the 1991 gulf war .
after five years on the run , pfahls was arrested in paris by french and german police in july 2004 and extradited to germany in january .
he could be released as early as september because his time in french and german custody will be counted against the sentence .
when half the sentence has been served , the judges may convert the rest of the prison time to a suspended sentence . the sentence was in line with an agreement between the prosecution , the defense and the court ahead of the trial that limited his total jail time to two years and three months if nothing during the trial contradicted the admission he made . because kohl confirmed that the defendant had had no political influence over the armored vehicles deal , the prosecution dropped the more serious corruption charge the day of the former chancellor 's testimony . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de kohl takes heat off former minister pfahls the corruption trial of holger pfahls took a key turn on wednesday with the testimony of ex-chancellor helmut kohl , who effectively cleared the former junior defense minister of suspicions of bribery .

his comments on eastern voters are being linked to the conservatives ' slide in the polls . merkel was in damage-control mode as the week ended after stoiber 's remarks on eastern voters appeared to be seriously damaging her campaign .
stoiber provoked controversy earlier in the week after he characterized voters in the east as " frustrated " and questioned their judgment before general elections next month . merkel herself comes from eastern germany , but despite this , her party , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , is currently performing worse in the east than in the west . in an interview with zdf television late on thursday , merkel spoke of the 35 years she spent living under communism in east germany , and stressed that she understood the concerns of the people in the region .
she added that she wanted to be chancellor of all germans . " we will fight for every vote , but we definitely don ’ t need to insult voters , " merkel said .
" every move - intentional or not - which splits rather than unites germany is totally counterproductive . " slipping in the polls only a few weeks ago , the campaign for merkel and the cdu looked like clear sailing , with the conservatives enjoying a sizeable lead over chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- . but that lead has shrunk , leaving the cdu and their likely coalition partner , the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , defending a slim majority of 49 percent , barely ahead of the combined vote of the other parties strong enough to enter parliament . eastern voters could be forgiven for feeling slighted by the conservatives .

the elegant limestone figure dating from 1347 bc was removed from its plinth in 1939 to protect it from bombing .
during the division of the city during the cold war , it was displayed in a museum at the schloss charlottenburg palace in west berlin .
overnight friday , the world-famous bust returned to the museum island complex in the east of the reunified capital ahead of the opening of a special exhibition of egyptian artifacts at the city 's old museum on saturday .
then in 2009 , nefertiti will move into the neighboring , freshly renovated new museum .
cairo and berlin have frequently crossed swords over the beautiful nefertiti , which was unearthed by german archaeologist ludwig borchardt and removed from the country .
germany has based its claim to the work on a 1913 agreement which granted nefertiti and a number of other important artifacts to their discoverers . dw-world.de berlin prepares for top drawer art shows after the monumental moma show , berlin 's museums are gearing up for further art highlights in 2005 : from german artist menzel , spanish master goya , the bust of nefertiti to the 60th anniversary of the end of wwii .

pfahls , who served as state secretary for defense from 1987 to 1992 , insisted that he had not done anything in return for the money .

renate künast champions made in germany the green party 's renate künast was accused of protectionism after her opening statements of the election campaign urged voters to buy german products .
in reality , quality rather than origin matters most to consumers . in germany , the social democrat-green coalition is fighting for its political life in the coming federal election .
some politicians are championing unusual policies in their attempts to boost their parties ' popularity with the electorate .
consumer protection minister renate künast is one . künast has positioned herself on the side of german manufacturers and by doing so has also placed herself in the cross hairs of the media .
proclaiming her allegiance and support for german products , the green party minister appeared in the popular sunday newspaper bild am sonntag to urge her compatriots to buy domestically produced goods and help protect the jobs of fellow germans . the move backfired and künast was accused of protectionism .
in an attempt to calm the stormy waters , a government statement attempted to spin the story into something a little more palatable .
künast was not calling for a boycott of foreign goods , it claimed , but for an environment where workers ' rights are upheld and child labor abroad is not rewarded . but what do the consumers of germany think about künast 's rallying call to " buy german ? " cheap goods flooding german market bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : digging deeper past the ill-conceived initial rant , one finds a central argument to the minister 's call , one which has been a matter of debate for years : the trend toward discount products , especially food .
the no-frills product ranges have come under fire mainly due to the fact that they are produced in other countries where labor costs are cheaper but sold in germany . but does the consumer really have the choice to support german products ? in the bonn branch of the nationwide department store chain kaufhof , an investigation into the country of origin of most of the clothing available there reveals an overwhelmingly international trend .
labels on trousers , t-shirts , belts and hats disclose many different origins : made in china , made in bangladesh , made in turkey and made in romania .
not one says made in germany . moving to another floor , the story is the same .
even the world famous steiff animals , cuddly toys associated with high-quality german manufacturing processes , carry the label : " produced in china under quality control of steiff germany " . " made in germany " not the whole story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the consumer generally does not have the possibility to find out where the product has been produced , " says holger brackemann from german standards watchdog stiftung warentest .
" the famous ' made in germany ' label , that they may find on textiles and other products , may not be the whole truth , that it may not have been produced here from the first through to the last manufacturing step . " the government 's statement that künast was looking to prevent worker exploitation and child labor in foreign countries by urging germans to buy locally produced , in theory , is a good example of trying to kill two birds with one stone .
on the one hand , promoting german goods is a tick for trying to protect jobs at home while trying to put pressure on countries that use child labor is stab at promoting an ethical foreign policy . german consumers want quality items bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but do german consumers know about the origins of their products or whether ethical practices were used in their production ?
do they even care ? when asked if she takes any notice of where products are produced , one shopper in bonn replied : " no , not at all . "
another added : " i shop for quality .
quality goods not only come from germany .
and germany makes a lot of rubbish as well . " another shopper said : " i look first at the quality and then at the price , and then if i decide if buying this is worthwhile , then i get it .

pfahls , who served as state secretary for defense from 1987 to 1992 , insisted that he had not done anything in return for the money .
presiding judge maximilian hofmeister said that while pfahls may have greased the wheels for the deal , he had not directly violated the duties of his office . " you accepted money without being corrupt , " hofmeister told the defendant while reading the verdict .
" you were working on commission . "
kohl exonerated pfahls bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german chancellor helmut kohl in court during the pfahls trial on aug .
3 several highest-ranking former government officials , including former chancellor helmut kohl and former foreign minister hans-dietrich genscher , had testified during the trial that pfahls had not influenced a controversial sale of tanks to saudi arabia during the 1991 gulf war .
after five years on the run , pfahls was arrested in paris by french and german police in july 2004 and extradited to germany in january .

according to a study by the environmental organization wwf , european cities are set to sizzle in the future . in terms of summer temperature increases , madrid is number one .
no other city in europe has seen such dramatic rises than the spanish capital over the last 30 years .
on average , madrid has seen temperatures climb by 2.2 degrees celsius -lrb- 35.96 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- in the last three decades .
trailing , and sweating , not so far behind come london , lisbon , luxembourg and athens . for londoners , more used to the " pea soup " mists rolling down the thames with a foggy chill , the rise in temperature may initially be gratefully received . that is until global temperatures rise to such an extent that the polar ice caps melt ; either causing sea levels to rise which in turn could lead to the thames flooding or a dilution of the gulf stream by fresh water which would eventually stop the warm flow to the british isles leading to a possible ice age . spain and portugal facing droughts , crop failures while the long term effect on london could be potentially disastrous , both madrid and lisbon are experiencing problems , although less apocalyptic , right now .
summers in the spanish and portuguese cities have been getting hotter and hotter leading to droughts and water shortages . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the reservoirs are empty , many fields and crops have dried up and forest areas are tinder-box dry , leading to increasingly common seasonal infernos .
both countries have requested help from the eu as crop start to fail . climatologists have been warning for years that europe must prepare for more and more extreme weather conditions and events such as drought , violent storms and floods . human industrialization to blame , says wwf martin hiller , climate spokesperson for the wwf , dismisses claims by some that these conditions are caused by variations in natural habitats around the globe .
" the majority of scientists agree that humans play the determining role , " he said . " in more than 200 years of industrialization , the co2 level in the atmosphere has increased by a third of its original value .
this is caused by humans , there is no natural process . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while humans are reaping what they sow in terms of increased heat and its effects , fauna and flora are suffering too and in many cases are being hardest hit .
the melting of the arctic ice flows are reducing the natural habitat and hunting grounds of polar bears while soaring temperatures could demand too much of fragile ecological systems like coral reefs . but the human population is also starting to see devastating effects .
" for example , at the heat wave of 2003 , " martin hiller warned .
" altogether around 40,000 people died as a result . " the future 's bright , the future 's scorching in the last century , the worldwide average temperature rose by about 0.6 degrees celsius ; in europe by about 1 degree .
scientists believe that the human race has seen nothing yet and that the biggest hike in temperatures is yet to come . scientists at the un 's intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- predict that we can expect a rise of between 1.4 to 5.8 degrees celsius . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this will lead to more intense summers for european cities and , according to the wwf , not only more dramatic environmental effects but also economic ones .
as the heat rises , more people will turn to their fans and air-conditioning systems to cope . it seems to be a vicious circle : more heat , more power consumption , more greenhouse gas and again more heat . alternative power to break the cycle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the answer could lie with renewable energy sources like wind , water and biomass , something electricity companies must consider in the future , the wwf demands .
while such alternatives are not entirely innocent in regards to climate change , they do , however , create less greenhouse gases than coal or oil . change can begin at home , martin hiller says , a fact that is often overlooked .
one could simply save up to 30 percent more energy by using electrical devices more wisely .
also , modern devices such as computers and air-conditioning systems need much less energy than their older incarnations . this , at least , would be the first step in breaking the vicious circle of climate change . johannes beck -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the cost of environmental pollution germany may be an eco-friendly place , but support for the environment does come at a price - a fact that some organizations are trying to disprove .

according to a study by the environmental organization wwf , european cities are set to sizzle in the future . in terms of summer temperature increases , madrid is number one .
no other city in europe has seen such dramatic rises than the spanish capital over the last 30 years .
on average , madrid has seen temperatures climb by 2.2 degrees celsius -lrb- 35.96 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- in the last three decades .
trailing , and sweating , not so far behind come london , lisbon , luxembourg and athens . for londoners , more used to the " pea soup " mists rolling down the thames with a foggy chill , the rise in temperature may initially be gratefully received . that is until global temperatures rise to such an extent that the polar ice caps melt ; either causing sea levels to rise which in turn could lead to the thames flooding or a dilution of the gulf stream by fresh water which would eventually stop the warm flow to the british isles leading to a possible ice age . spain and portugal facing droughts , crop failures while the long term effect on london could be potentially disastrous , both madrid and lisbon are experiencing problems , although less apocalyptic , right now .
summers in the spanish and portuguese cities have been getting hotter and hotter leading to droughts and water shortages . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the reservoirs are empty , many fields and crops have dried up and forest areas are tinder-box dry , leading to increasingly common seasonal infernos .
both countries have requested help from the eu as crop start to fail . climatologists have been warning for years that europe must prepare for more and more extreme weather conditions and events such as drought , violent storms and floods . human industrialization to blame , says wwf martin hiller , climate spokesperson for the wwf , dismisses claims by some that these conditions are caused by variations in natural habitats around the globe .
" the majority of scientists agree that humans play the determining role , " he said . " in more than 200 years of industrialization , the co2 level in the atmosphere has increased by a third of its original value .
this is caused by humans , there is no natural process . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while humans are reaping what they sow in terms of increased heat and its effects , fauna and flora are suffering too and in many cases are being hardest hit .
the melting of the arctic ice flows are reducing the natural habitat and hunting grounds of polar bears while soaring temperatures could demand too much of fragile ecological systems like coral reefs . but the human population is also starting to see devastating effects .
" for example , at the heat wave of 2003 , " martin hiller warned .
" altogether around 40,000 people died as a result . " the future 's bright , the future 's scorching in the last century , the worldwide average temperature rose by about 0.6 degrees celsius ; in europe by about 1 degree .
scientists believe that the human race has seen nothing yet and that the biggest hike in temperatures is yet to come . scientists at the un 's intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- predict that we can expect a rise of between 1.4 to 5.8 degrees celsius . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this will lead to more intense summers for european cities and , according to the wwf , not only more dramatic environmental effects but also economic ones .
as the heat rises , more people will turn to their fans and air-conditioning systems to cope . it seems to be a vicious circle : more heat , more power consumption , more greenhouse gas and again more heat . alternative power to break the cycle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the answer could lie with renewable energy sources like wind , water and biomass , something electricity companies must consider in the future , the wwf demands .
while such alternatives are not entirely innocent in regards to climate change , they do , however , create less greenhouse gases than coal or oil . change can begin at home , martin hiller says , a fact that is often overlooked .
one could simply save up to 30 percent more energy by using electrical devices more wisely .
also , modern devices such as computers and air-conditioning systems need much less energy than their older incarnations . this , at least , would be the first step in breaking the vicious circle of climate change . johannes beck -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the cost of environmental pollution germany may be an eco-friendly place , but support for the environment does come at a price - a fact that some organizations are trying to disprove .

on average , madrid has seen temperatures climb by 2.2 degrees celsius -lrb- 35.96 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- in the last three decades .
trailing , and sweating , not so far behind come london , lisbon , luxembourg and athens . for londoners , more used to the " pea soup " mists rolling down the thames with a foggy chill , the rise in temperature may initially be gratefully received . that is until global temperatures rise to such an extent that the polar ice caps melt ; either causing sea levels to rise which in turn could lead to the thames flooding or a dilution of the gulf stream by fresh water which would eventually stop the warm flow to the british isles leading to a possible ice age . spain and portugal facing droughts , crop failures while the long term effect on london could be potentially disastrous , both madrid and lisbon are experiencing problems , although less apocalyptic , right now .
summers in the spanish and portuguese cities have been getting hotter and hotter leading to droughts and water shortages . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the reservoirs are empty , many fields and crops have dried up and forest areas are tinder-box dry , leading to increasingly common seasonal infernos .
both countries have requested help from the eu as crop start to fail . climatologists have been warning for years that europe must prepare for more and more extreme weather conditions and events such as drought , violent storms and floods . human industrialization to blame , says wwf martin hiller , climate spokesperson for the wwf , dismisses claims by some that these conditions are caused by variations in natural habitats around the globe .
" the majority of scientists agree that humans play the determining role , " he said . " in more than 200 years of industrialization , the co2 level in the atmosphere has increased by a third of its original value .
this is caused by humans , there is no natural process . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while humans are reaping what they sow in terms of increased heat and its effects , fauna and flora are suffering too and in many cases are being hardest hit .
the melting of the arctic ice flows are reducing the natural habitat and hunting grounds of polar bears while soaring temperatures could demand too much of fragile ecological systems like coral reefs . but the human population is also starting to see devastating effects .
" for example , at the heat wave of 2003 , " martin hiller warned .
" altogether around 40,000 people died as a result . " the future 's bright , the future 's scorching in the last century , the worldwide average temperature rose by about 0.6 degrees celsius ; in europe by about 1 degree .
scientists believe that the human race has seen nothing yet and that the biggest hike in temperatures is yet to come . scientists at the un 's intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- predict that we can expect a rise of between 1.4 to 5.8 degrees celsius . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this will lead to more intense summers for european cities and , according to the wwf , not only more dramatic environmental effects but also economic ones .
as the heat rises , more people will turn to their fans and air-conditioning systems to cope . it seems to be a vicious circle : more heat , more power consumption , more greenhouse gas and again more heat . alternative power to break the cycle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the answer could lie with renewable energy sources like wind , water and biomass , something electricity companies must consider in the future , the wwf demands .
while such alternatives are not entirely innocent in regards to climate change , they do , however , create less greenhouse gases than coal or oil . change can begin at home , martin hiller says , a fact that is often overlooked .
one could simply save up to 30 percent more energy by using electrical devices more wisely .
also , modern devices such as computers and air-conditioning systems need much less energy than their older incarnations . this , at least , would be the first step in breaking the vicious circle of climate change . johannes beck -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the cost of environmental pollution germany may be an eco-friendly place , but support for the environment does come at a price - a fact that some organizations are trying to disprove .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de election 2005 -pipe- 12.08.2005 merkel aims to win back eastern voters großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : his comments are hurting her campaign chancellor candidate angela merkel sought to distance herself from remarks made by her key ally in bavaria , edmund stoiber .
his comments on eastern voters are being linked to the conservatives ' slide in the polls . merkel was in damage-control mode as the week ended after stoiber 's remarks on eastern voters appeared to be seriously damaging her campaign .
stoiber provoked controversy earlier in the week after he characterized voters in the east as " frustrated " and questioned their judgment before general elections next month . merkel herself comes from eastern germany , but despite this , her party , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , is currently performing worse in the east than in the west . in an interview with zdf television late on thursday , merkel spoke of the 35 years she spent living under communism in east germany , and stressed that she understood the concerns of the people in the region .
she added that she wanted to be chancellor of all germans . " we will fight for every vote , but we definitely don ’ t need to insult voters , " merkel said .
" every move - intentional or not - which splits rather than unites germany is totally counterproductive . " slipping in the polls only a few weeks ago , the campaign for merkel and the cdu looked like clear sailing , with the conservatives enjoying a sizeable lead over chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- . but that lead has shrunk , leaving the cdu and their likely coalition partner , the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , defending a slim majority of 49 percent , barely ahead of the combined vote of the other parties strong enough to enter parliament . eastern voters could be forgiven for feeling slighted by the conservatives .
commenting last week on the shocking case of a german woman from the east charged with murdering nine of her newborn babies , senior conservative jörg schönbohm said the east german dictatorship had left easterners lacking in a sense of responsibility and morality . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder hopes to profit from the conservatives ' mistakes stoiber 's comment this week that " those who are frustrated ca n't be allowed to determine the fate of germany " only added insult to injury .
and it may end up helping schröder , who is bidding for a third term for his coalition of social democrats and greens . " his remark is not only tasteless , but shows a lack of democratic respect , " said schröder .
" stoiber 's comment cements division and insults people who have had to live under harder conditions than we in the west . " the left party , led by the charismatic former finance minister oskar lafontaine , may also profit from the conservatives ' gaffes , seeing as this new party is currently leading the polls in the east with more than 30 percent . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de conservative gaffe enrages east germans germany 's first chancellor candidate from the east , angela merkel , ran into fresh electoral problems in the crucial ex-communist states thursday after a key ally bashed the region 's " frustrated " voters .

according to a study by the environmental organization wwf , european cities are set to sizzle in the future . in terms of summer temperature increases , madrid is number one .
no other city in europe has seen such dramatic rises than the spanish capital over the last 30 years .
on average , madrid has seen temperatures climb by 2.2 degrees celsius -lrb- 35.96 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- in the last three decades .
trailing , and sweating , not so far behind come london , lisbon , luxembourg and athens . for londoners , more used to the " pea soup " mists rolling down the thames with a foggy chill , the rise in temperature may initially be gratefully received . that is until global temperatures rise to such an extent that the polar ice caps melt ; either causing sea levels to rise which in turn could lead to the thames flooding or a dilution of the gulf stream by fresh water which would eventually stop the warm flow to the british isles leading to a possible ice age . spain and portugal facing droughts , crop failures while the long term effect on london could be potentially disastrous , both madrid and lisbon are experiencing problems , although less apocalyptic , right now .
summers in the spanish and portuguese cities have been getting hotter and hotter leading to droughts and water shortages . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the reservoirs are empty , many fields and crops have dried up and forest areas are tinder-box dry , leading to increasingly common seasonal infernos .
both countries have requested help from the eu as crop start to fail . climatologists have been warning for years that europe must prepare for more and more extreme weather conditions and events such as drought , violent storms and floods . human industrialization to blame , says wwf martin hiller , climate spokesperson for the wwf , dismisses claims by some that these conditions are caused by variations in natural habitats around the globe .
" the majority of scientists agree that humans play the determining role , " he said . " in more than 200 years of industrialization , the co2 level in the atmosphere has increased by a third of its original value .
this is caused by humans , there is no natural process . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while humans are reaping what they sow in terms of increased heat and its effects , fauna and flora are suffering too and in many cases are being hardest hit .
the melting of the arctic ice flows are reducing the natural habitat and hunting grounds of polar bears while soaring temperatures could demand too much of fragile ecological systems like coral reefs . but the human population is also starting to see devastating effects .
" for example , at the heat wave of 2003 , " martin hiller warned .
" altogether around 40,000 people died as a result . " the future 's bright , the future 's scorching in the last century , the worldwide average temperature rose by about 0.6 degrees celsius ; in europe by about 1 degree .
scientists believe that the human race has seen nothing yet and that the biggest hike in temperatures is yet to come . scientists at the un 's intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- predict that we can expect a rise of between 1.4 to 5.8 degrees celsius . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this will lead to more intense summers for european cities and , according to the wwf , not only more dramatic environmental effects but also economic ones .
as the heat rises , more people will turn to their fans and air-conditioning systems to cope . it seems to be a vicious circle : more heat , more power consumption , more greenhouse gas and again more heat . alternative power to break the cycle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the answer could lie with renewable energy sources like wind , water and biomass , something electricity companies must consider in the future , the wwf demands .
while such alternatives are not entirely innocent in regards to climate change , they do , however , create less greenhouse gases than coal or oil . change can begin at home , martin hiller says , a fact that is often overlooked .
one could simply save up to 30 percent more energy by using electrical devices more wisely .
also , modern devices such as computers and air-conditioning systems need much less energy than their older incarnations . this , at least , would be the first step in breaking the vicious circle of climate change . johannes beck -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the cost of environmental pollution germany may be an eco-friendly place , but support for the environment does come at a price - a fact that some organizations are trying to disprove .

his comments on eastern voters are being linked to the conservatives ' slide in the polls . merkel was in damage-control mode as the week ended after stoiber 's remarks on eastern voters appeared to be seriously damaging her campaign .
stoiber provoked controversy earlier in the week after he characterized voters in the east as " frustrated " and questioned their judgment before general elections next month . merkel herself comes from eastern germany , but despite this , her party , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , is currently performing worse in the east than in the west . in an interview with zdf television late on thursday , merkel spoke of the 35 years she spent living under communism in east germany , and stressed that she understood the concerns of the people in the region .
she added that she wanted to be chancellor of all germans . " we will fight for every vote , but we definitely don ’ t need to insult voters , " merkel said .
" every move - intentional or not - which splits rather than unites germany is totally counterproductive . " slipping in the polls only a few weeks ago , the campaign for merkel and the cdu looked like clear sailing , with the conservatives enjoying a sizeable lead over chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- . but that lead has shrunk , leaving the cdu and their likely coalition partner , the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , defending a slim majority of 49 percent , barely ahead of the combined vote of the other parties strong enough to enter parliament . eastern voters could be forgiven for feeling slighted by the conservatives .
commenting last week on the shocking case of a german woman from the east charged with murdering nine of her newborn babies , senior conservative jörg schönbohm said the east german dictatorship had left easterners lacking in a sense of responsibility and morality . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder hopes to profit from the conservatives ' mistakes stoiber 's comment this week that " those who are frustrated ca n't be allowed to determine the fate of germany " only added insult to injury .
and it may end up helping schröder , who is bidding for a third term for his coalition of social democrats and greens . " his remark is not only tasteless , but shows a lack of democratic respect , " said schröder .
" stoiber 's comment cements division and insults people who have had to live under harder conditions than we in the west . " the left party , led by the charismatic former finance minister oskar lafontaine , may also profit from the conservatives ' gaffes , seeing as this new party is currently leading the polls in the east with more than 30 percent . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de conservative gaffe enrages east germans germany 's first chancellor candidate from the east , angela merkel , ran into fresh electoral problems in the crucial ex-communist states thursday after a key ally bashed the region 's " frustrated " voters .

renate künast champions made in germany the green party 's renate künast was accused of protectionism after her opening statements of the election campaign urged voters to buy german products .
in reality , quality rather than origin matters most to consumers . in germany , the social democrat-green coalition is fighting for its political life in the coming federal election .
some politicians are championing unusual policies in their attempts to boost their parties ' popularity with the electorate .
consumer protection minister renate künast is one . künast has positioned herself on the side of german manufacturers and by doing so has also placed herself in the cross hairs of the media .
proclaiming her allegiance and support for german products , the green party minister appeared in the popular sunday newspaper bild am sonntag to urge her compatriots to buy domestically produced goods and help protect the jobs of fellow germans . the move backfired and künast was accused of protectionism .
in an attempt to calm the stormy waters , a government statement attempted to spin the story into something a little more palatable .
künast was not calling for a boycott of foreign goods , it claimed , but for an environment where workers ' rights are upheld and child labor abroad is not rewarded . but what do the consumers of germany think about künast 's rallying call to " buy german ? " cheap goods flooding german market bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : digging deeper past the ill-conceived initial rant , one finds a central argument to the minister 's call , one which has been a matter of debate for years : the trend toward discount products , especially food .
the no-frills product ranges have come under fire mainly due to the fact that they are produced in other countries where labor costs are cheaper but sold in germany . but does the consumer really have the choice to support german products ? in the bonn branch of the nationwide department store chain kaufhof , an investigation into the country of origin of most of the clothing available there reveals an overwhelmingly international trend .
labels on trousers , t-shirts , belts and hats disclose many different origins : made in china , made in bangladesh , made in turkey and made in romania .
not one says made in germany . moving to another floor , the story is the same .
even the world famous steiff animals , cuddly toys associated with high-quality german manufacturing processes , carry the label : " produced in china under quality control of steiff germany " . " made in germany " not the whole story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the consumer generally does not have the possibility to find out where the product has been produced , " says holger brackemann from german standards watchdog stiftung warentest .
" the famous ' made in germany ' label , that they may find on textiles and other products , may not be the whole truth , that it may not have been produced here from the first through to the last manufacturing step . " the government 's statement that künast was looking to prevent worker exploitation and child labor in foreign countries by urging germans to buy locally produced , in theory , is a good example of trying to kill two birds with one stone .
on the one hand , promoting german goods is a tick for trying to protect jobs at home while trying to put pressure on countries that use child labor is stab at promoting an ethical foreign policy . german consumers want quality items bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but do german consumers know about the origins of their products or whether ethical practices were used in their production ?

another added : " i shop for quality .
quality goods not only come from germany .

the elegant limestone figure dating from 1347 bc was removed from its plinth in 1939 to protect it from bombing .
during the division of the city during the cold war , it was displayed in a museum at the schloss charlottenburg palace in west berlin .
overnight friday , the world-famous bust returned to the museum island complex in the east of the reunified capital ahead of the opening of a special exhibition of egyptian artifacts at the city 's old museum on saturday .
then in 2009 , nefertiti will move into the neighboring , freshly renovated new museum .
cairo and berlin have frequently crossed swords over the beautiful nefertiti , which was unearthed by german archaeologist ludwig borchardt and removed from the country .
germany has based its claim to the work on a 1913 agreement which granted nefertiti and a number of other important artifacts to their discoverers . dw-world.de berlin prepares for top drawer art shows after the monumental moma show , berlin 's museums are gearing up for further art highlights in 2005 : from german artist menzel , spanish master goya , the bust of nefertiti to the 60th anniversary of the end of wwii .

"
in late november , she 'll be back in the capital with a christmas show at a cabaret tent that sits right next to the federal chancellery .
" we 'll see who 's in there when i get there , " she said . dw-world : how is germa n y doi n g i n your opi n io n ? gayle tufts : poor germany 's having a hard time right now .
it 's holding its head down like a sad sack .
it 's a shame when bad things happen to good people .
the country 's just gotten over the trauma of the war - it really worked hard on that .
people have done their verga n ge n heitsbewältigu n g -lrb- eds : dealing with the past -rrb- .
they got through reunification - who would have ever thought that reunification would have gone so well in a country that 's so regimented .
of course it 's shocking and the reality of it is now catching up with germans .
maybe unification with luxembourg or italy would have been easier , because people there are more flexible .
germans like things to go the way they 're supposed to go .
they like their trains to run on time .
what n eeds to happe n i n germa n y to help speed up the cou n try 's recovery ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a politician that 's more to tufts ' liking the situation here reminds me of my older brother , who lives in boston and has been unemployed for four years .
i tell him , " you should have gone to college when you had the chance , you should n't have drunk so much beer , hanging out with friends , watching baseball . "
unfortunately , something has to change .
you ca n't live in a country with this much unemployment .
somebody is going to break the unions that are so strong here .
it 's not going to be possible in the global world to have this kind of protection that workers have here .
the hope is that there will be people who can do it in a human enough fashion .
people want things to be perfect , but it 's not going to be perfect .
the challenge for leaders will be to find a way to make the best of an imperfect situation .
gerhard schröder or angela merkel ?
who is your perso n al choice for cha n cellor ?
why ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dancing with berlin 's mayor , klaus wowereit i ca n't vote here , so i kind of tend to stay out of it .
but i hope people vote , i hope that people who are a bit cynical about what the spd and the greens have achieved still go out and vote and do n't say , " it does n't matter . " i 'm for schröder .
he 's a good guy .
he 's human .
i 'm all for the me n schliche ka n didate n -lrb- human candidates -rrb- .
my favorites are -lrb- german foreign minister -rrb- joschka fischer and -lrb- berlin mayor klaus -rrb- wowereit .
i do n't know much about -lrb- merkel -rrb- , but i do n't see her as a very warm person .
it 's as if she fulfills all the criteria - she 's a woman , she 's from the east , but does that mean that she 's the right person ?
on the other hand - the poor woman : there are more things written about her hair than her agenda .
i would not want to be in her shoes , whatever they may be .
what do you like about germa n y ? i like the honesty .
germans can be incredibly honest and everything is very deep .
there are stupid things on television , but the next day you have 12 commentaries in the newspaper and everybody 's talking about it .
people like to chew things over .
i have personally profited from it , it has made me take myself more seriously . what do you dislike about germa n y ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gayle tufts this seriousness sometimes makes me crazy .
i want to tell people : " lighten up !
be a little more friendly ! "
i miss the kind of laid-back american " how you doin ' ? "
i do n't like that people always say " no " first if it does n't fit into the plan .
it first has got to be thought about .
i see it in theater .
you have to let them know five months ahead that you want a certain type of microphone - that 's the kind of lack of spontaneity that makes me crazy . mathis winkler interviewed gayle tufts send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dealing with denglish click here for dw-world 's dossier on mixing german with english .

economics minister wolfgang clement called zimmermann 's suggestion " infeasible and excessive . "
he said he supports the suggestion made by a special government commission of experts , which would see the retirement age gradually raised to 67 . such suggestions have caused some older spd supporters to switch their allegiance to the left party , the new alliance of the reformed communist party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- and left-wing groups .

" all of these developments , which resulted from compromises made during the committee stage , were frequently laid at the door of the spd , and we have to explain that and tell people how it really happened , " said hermann bokelmann of the spd 's 60-plus group . there has been no talk of cutting pensions in the election campaigns as yet , but it 's clear that future generations of pensioners will receive barely more than the level of social welfare from the government .
in comparison to those future generations , today 's pensioners are well-off .

he previously worked in a number of state schools in britain before coming to bonn in the mid-1990s , where he has been a member of the senior management at the school since it opened in 1997 .
dw-world : how is germa n y doi n g i n your opi n io n ?
peter murphy : i believe that germany is still in a relatively strong economic position .
the challenges being faced by many countries of unemployment continue to cause pressures for the government - a situation that does not seem to be likely to improve in the short term .
i believe that there is a need for a critical review of how the economy can be stimulated .
with a willingness to be flexible and more responsive to " external forces , " i believe there is room for the types of change that would lead to an increase in social and economic stability .
when recruiting internationally , i often hear of germany being referred to as a " hardship assignment country " - an image that i do not share , but see as a major challenge to be addressed by future governments .
globalization is not a concept that can be ignored in the hope that one day it will go away .
what n eeds to happe n i n germa n y to help speed up the cou n try 's recovery ?
i would hope that the elected government would use their wisdom to create a better , fairer , more sustainable society for us all to live in .
i would hope to see tolerance and support for groups and individuals less fortunate than ourselves put more significantly on the agenda .
i would like young and old alike to feel that the future had something to offer and that they had something to contribute - a sense of worth .
societies are , in my opinion , successful when people feel that they have something to contribute .
high levels of unemployment , uncertainties about the future , worries about coping in retirement do not lead to economic growth and development .
the government has a challenge to make change attractive and the norm .
gerhard schröder or a n gela merkel ?
who is your perso n al choice for cha n cellor ?
why ?
i would like to see a change , and believe that angela merkel would bring an interesting perspective to a still very male-dominated culture .
what do you like about germa n y ?
in the context of education policies , it 's positive that there is a recognition that something needs to change .
what do you dislike about germa n y ?
the lack of critically challenging debate about what needs to change perhaps due to the difficulties in pushing through major social reform . ranty islam interviewed peter murphy send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de focus on education click here for dw-world 's collection of in-depth stories on education issues in germany .

"
renate künast champions made in germany the green party 's renate künast was accused of protectionism after her opening statements of the election campaign urged voters to buy german products .
in reality , quality rather than origin matters most to consumers . in germany , the social democrat-green coalition is fighting for its political life in the coming federal election .
some politicians are championing unusual policies in their attempts to boost their parties ' popularity with the electorate .
consumer protection minister renate künast is one . künast has positioned herself on the side of german manufacturers and by doing so has also placed herself in the cross hairs of the media .
proclaiming her allegiance and support for german products , the green party minister appeared in the popular sunday newspaper bild am sonntag to urge her compatriots to buy domestically produced goods and help protect the jobs of fellow germans . the move backfired and künast was accused of protectionism .
in an attempt to calm the stormy waters , a government statement attempted to spin the story into something a little more palatable .
künast was not calling for a boycott of foreign goods , it claimed , but for an environment where workers ' rights are upheld and child labor abroad is not rewarded . but what do the consumers of germany think about künast 's rallying call to " buy german ? " cheap goods flooding german market bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : digging deeper past the ill-conceived initial rant , one finds a central argument to the minister 's call , one which has been a matter of debate for years : the trend toward discount products , especially food .
the no-frills product ranges have come under fire mainly due to the fact that they are produced in other countries where labor costs are cheaper but sold in germany . but does the consumer really have the choice to support german products ? in the bonn branch of the nationwide department store chain kaufhof , an investigation into the country of origin of most of the clothing available there reveals an overwhelmingly international trend .
labels on trousers , t-shirts , belts and hats disclose many different origins : made in china , made in bangladesh , made in turkey and made in romania .
not one says made in germany . moving to another floor , the story is the same .
even the world famous steiff animals , cuddly toys associated with high-quality german manufacturing processes , carry the label : " produced in china under quality control of steiff germany " . " made in germany " not the whole story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the consumer generally does not have the possibility to find out where the product has been produced , " says holger brackemann from german standards watchdog stiftung warentest .
" the famous ' made in germany ' label , that they may find on textiles and other products , may not be the whole truth , that it may not have been produced here from the first through to the last manufacturing step . " the government 's statement that künast was looking to prevent worker exploitation and child labor in foreign countries by urging germans to buy locally produced , in theory , is a good example of trying to kill two birds with one stone .
on the one hand , promoting german goods is a tick for trying to protect jobs at home while trying to put pressure on countries that use child labor is stab at promoting an ethical foreign policy . german consumers want quality items bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but do german consumers know about the origins of their products or whether ethical practices were used in their production ?
do they even care ? when asked if she takes any notice of where products are produced , one shopper in bonn replied : " no , not at all . "
another added : " i shop for quality .
quality goods not only come from germany .
and germany makes a lot of rubbish as well . " another shopper said : " i look first at the quality and then at the price , and then if i decide if buying this is worthwhile , then i get it .
the country of origin does n't really feature . " " the argument about child labor is an important one , " says one man .
" but they must also earn their money .
not buying the products may actually endanger that . " it seems that in this election year , the issue will not be where the products come from but whether or not consumers will have enough money in their pockets to buy anything . christoph hasselbach -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de is " made in germany " losing its luster ?

the ruhr valley will be transfixed by dortmund 's clash with rivals schalke .
in nearby leverkusen , champions bayern munich face bayer 04 . ever since germans first took a leather ball and started booting it into a net , the two ruhr valley clubs , dortmund and schalke from neighboring gelsenkirchen have displayed their disdain for each other on the pitch .
the two ruhrpott rivals have met 126 times in total , 66 of those in the bundesliga .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : being a borussia dortmund fan is n't just a run-of-the-mill hobby fans in bvb yellow and schalke royal blue live to see this game . and the passion always makes its way from the terraces to the pitch .
schalke coach ralf rangnick 's troop must play in the unfriendly confines of the westfalen stadium but their fortunes there have been particularly good in the recent past .
schalke have not lost in the last six encounters in front of a regularly sold out 70,000 capacity in dortmund 's cauldron arena .
" in the last few years we have looked pretty good in dortmund .
i am assuming that this time it will be the same , " schalke goalkeeper frank rost told sport bild .
in the arena aufschalke on may 14 , dortmund broke a 12-game winless streak , topping off a tremendous comeback in the second half of the season .
both clubs value the rivalry and use it as a catapult for success in the bundesliga .
bvb need the boost more than schalke , coming away with a tie in their first match and having not reached the uefa cup after crashing out of the intertoto cup in the summer .
bayern meets bayer coach felix magath probably has a bone to pick with leverkusen .
last season in his first appearance as munich coach in the bayarena , his team got pasted 4-1 .
naturally , it was just a small hurdle in their march to the league championship .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two bayern players -lrb- red -rrb- clamp down on a gladbach opponent in the first week revenge may be on magath 's mind , but only far , far at the back .
the big controversy for the team , and there is almost always one at bayern munich , is the storm surrounding midfielder michael ballack .
there 's no lack of column inches being devoted to the subject of whether the germany captain is out of favor or not .
magath , not a man of many words , has been quiet , saying that all 23 men on the squad are both starters and substitutes .
words that might confuse some soccer players - but it 's doubtful that michael ballack thinks he is a substitute .
leverkusen started their campaign with an impressive effort against frankfurt last week , cruising to a 4-1 victory .
and could that be repeated ?
" we have the quality , " bayer midfielder bernd schneider told kicker magazine .
the contenders with easier assignments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg 's rafael van der vaart should lead with his head one of the dark horses in the bundesliga this season must be hamburg .
they have brought in quality personnel , most notably dutch international rafael van der vaart and on saturday , thomas doll 's club gets the pleasure of travelling to bielefeld , the one side they have had the most success against in their history .
the bielefeld defense resembled a sieve in a 5-2 defeat against bremen , holes that must be stopped soon or coach thomas von heesen will be battling against a rapdly sinking ship .
hertha berlin face the new boys from frankfurt .
soccer followers always expect a lot from the capital city team , but berlin has on the whole been disappointing .
a home match against frankfurt , where they score two goals on average , should be an easy assignment for falko götz ' squad led by brazilian extraordinaire marcelinho . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dfb wants turkish prodigy for germany when 16-year old nuri sahin took to the field on saturday for borussia dortmund , he became the youngest ever bundesliga player .

his comments on eastern voters are being linked to the conservatives ' slide in the polls . merkel was in damage-control mode as the week ended after stoiber 's remarks on eastern voters appeared to be seriously damaging her campaign .
stoiber provoked controversy earlier in the week after he characterized voters in the east as " frustrated " and questioned their judgment before general elections next month . merkel herself comes from eastern germany , but despite this , her party , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , is currently performing worse in the east than in the west . in an interview with zdf television late on thursday , merkel spoke of the 35 years she spent living under communism in east germany , and stressed that she understood the concerns of the people in the region .
she added that she wanted to be chancellor of all germans . " we will fight for every vote , but we definitely don ’ t need to insult voters , " merkel said .
" every move - intentional or not - which splits rather than unites germany is totally counterproductive . " slipping in the polls only a few weeks ago , the campaign for merkel and the cdu looked like clear sailing , with the conservatives enjoying a sizeable lead over chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- . but that lead has shrunk , leaving the cdu and their likely coalition partner , the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , defending a slim majority of 49 percent , barely ahead of the combined vote of the other parties strong enough to enter parliament . eastern voters could be forgiven for feeling slighted by the conservatives .
commenting last week on the shocking case of a german woman from the east charged with murdering nine of her newborn babies , senior conservative jörg schönbohm said the east german dictatorship had left easterners lacking in a sense of responsibility and morality . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder hopes to profit from the conservatives ' mistakes stoiber 's comment this week that " those who are frustrated ca n't be allowed to determine the fate of germany " only added insult to injury .
and it may end up helping schröder , who is bidding for a third term for his coalition of social democrats and greens . " his remark is not only tasteless , but shows a lack of democratic respect , " said schröder .
" stoiber 's comment cements division and insults people who have had to live under harder conditions than we in the west .

his comments on eastern voters are being linked to the conservatives ' slide in the polls . merkel was in damage-control mode as the week ended after stoiber 's remarks on eastern voters appeared to be seriously damaging her campaign .
stoiber provoked controversy earlier in the week after he characterized voters in the east as " frustrated " and questioned their judgment before general elections next month . merkel herself comes from eastern germany , but despite this , her party , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , is currently performing worse in the east than in the west . in an interview with zdf television late on thursday , merkel spoke of the 35 years she spent living under communism in east germany , and stressed that she understood the concerns of the people in the region .
she added that she wanted to be chancellor of all germans . " we will fight for every vote , but we definitely don ’ t need to insult voters , " merkel said .
" every move - intentional or not - which splits rather than unites germany is totally counterproductive . " slipping in the polls only a few weeks ago , the campaign for merkel and the cdu looked like clear sailing , with the conservatives enjoying a sizeable lead over chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- . but that lead has shrunk , leaving the cdu and their likely coalition partner , the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , defending a slim majority of 49 percent , barely ahead of the combined vote of the other parties strong enough to enter parliament . eastern voters could be forgiven for feeling slighted by the conservatives .
commenting last week on the shocking case of a german woman from the east charged with murdering nine of her newborn babies , senior conservative jörg schönbohm said the east german dictatorship had left easterners lacking in a sense of responsibility and morality . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder hopes to profit from the conservatives ' mistakes stoiber 's comment this week that " those who are frustrated ca n't be allowed to determine the fate of germany " only added insult to injury .
and it may end up helping schröder , who is bidding for a third term for his coalition of social democrats and greens . " his remark is not only tasteless , but shows a lack of democratic respect , " said schröder .

and from the choices on view , shopaholic pilgrims will have no problem sating their appetites . the estimated 800,000 pilgrims flocking to cologne and the surrounding areas for the world youth day celebrations may be there to save souls but it 's unlikely that they will be saving any money .
the merchandising bandwagon is in full swing a week in advance of the main event and items are flying off the shelves . " we 've already had to restock on key chains , " said volunteer christine meyer above the din of a frantic crowd clamoring for goodies at the info point opposite cologne 's main station .
" they selling very well and so are the wristbands . "
as if to emphasise the point , a group of japanese girls snap up a handful of the popular rubber bands , one of each color . the fashion conscious catholic could run up a hefty bill if he or she were to stock up on all the available official world youth day products available .
the apparently desirable key chains retail at a reasonable 3.60 euros -lrb- $ 4.47 -rrb- while the wristbands go for 1.20 euros a pop . extensive shopping list could break the bank bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things start to add up , however , when wanting to complement your various hanging items with festival attire .
imagine the sun breaks out from behind the clouds while taking part in the open air mass .
a rather fetching official baseball cap or sunhat would be needed to keep off those powerful rays .
each will cost the uv aware pilgrim 8.50 euros . the unexpected heat may require a change of clothes .
luckily there 's a choice of either a current or former pope t-shirt -lrb- 12.90 euros -rrb- .
and just to make sure you wo n't be late for a papal pot roast down by the rhine with your friends , you 'll need a world youth day watch which can be purchased for 11.99 euros . amazingly still able to converse under the weight of her extensive collection of memorabilia , corina ribiero from brazil said that money was no question in relation to the bigger picture and the memories she hopes she will take back with her to sao paulo . " my experiences here will be worth more than anything , " she said .
" many of the things i have bought are for my family but also for me .
they will remind me of the beautiful time i had in germany .

spd presents election manifesto germany -pipe- 12.08.2005 getting the gray vote großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a powerful target group senior citizens make up a third of the german electorate and are being wooed by all the parties .
but when it comes to one of the issues that concerns them - pensions - they do n't think any one party has the answers . the elderly are an important target group in september 's election , but none of the parties have easy answers for the issues they 're most concerned about - pensions and the rising cost of health care and medication . the current government coalition of social democrats and greens introduced tough reforms which have also affected pensioners , but given germany 's massive public debt , the opposition parties would also have to make cutbacks if they came to power . raising the retirement age bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the discussion about the difficulty in funding germany 's pension system in future again took center stage this week following a suggestion by the president of the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- , klaus f. zimmermann , to raise the age of retirement to 70 from its current 65 . political parties , unions and pension insurers have all heaped criticism on the idea .
economics minister wolfgang clement called zimmermann 's suggestion " infeasible and excessive . "
he said he supports the suggestion made by a special government commission of experts , which would see the retirement age gradually raised to 67 . such suggestions have caused some older spd supporters to switch their allegiance to the left party , the new alliance of the reformed communist party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- and left-wing groups .
two-thirds of left party members are over 60 .
the senior citizens ' working groups meet regularly and carry authority .
their main recruits are elderly people in eastern germany . left party gaining senior support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left party is attracting senior voters " i believe that a very specific problem for older people in the east is that not only do they have the impression that the contributions they have made to society are not valued , but there is also proof that it is so , " said ernst bienert of the left party 's senior citizens group . seniors who remain loyal to the spd are also hitting the campaign trail , in part to refute the notion that only the spd is to blame for the pensions crisis and other social crises facing the country . " all of these developments , which resulted from compromises made during the committee stage , were frequently laid at the door of the spd , and we have to explain that and tell people how it really happened , " said hermann bokelmann of the spd 's 60-plus group . there has been no talk of cutting pensions in the election campaigns as yet , but it 's clear that future generations of pensioners will receive barely more than the level of social welfare from the government .
in comparison to those future generations , today 's pensioners are well-off .
nevertheless , opinion polls suggest that most pensioners want to see a change in government . up to 60 percent plan to vote for the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , even though they do n't believe that leader angela merkel has the answers to their problems . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de east germans disappointed by reunification east germany in 1989 was in the midst of a peaceful revolution .

a long-time mcdonald 's employee , he bought his first two restaurants in regensburg in 1987 and has since opened 10 more in the region . the 59-year-old says he has only " 21 more years until retirement . "

if you look at the economy , it 's performing , i think , at the last place in europe .
i think it 's pretty frustrating for everybody - for the entrepreneurs , the workers and the people who , who are retired .
i think it 's frightening for the people who are still learning or studying and getting ready to go into the work force . what needs to happen in germany to help speed up the country 's recovery ? hartz -lrb- eds : germany 's social welfare reforms -rrb- is a step in the right direction , but it 's not far enough along .
we need more straight talk , more honest talk .
if we do n't get this thing straightened out , the perception of democracy gets weaker and weaker .
we just have to get it going .
the reform of the tax system is one of most important things that have to get done .
it 's ridiculous that not all ways of making money are taxed .
we need to get rid of subsidies .
we have more people working as civil servants , i think , than almost anywhere else in the world .
the problem is that everybody is relying too much on the state .
you ca n't expect the state to provide for you when you 're old . chancellor gerhard schröder or challenger angela merkel ?
who is your personal choice for chancellor ?
why ? schröder has totally failed .
he made promises and he has n't performed .
i think he 's disqualified himself .
of course merkel would be better .
at the same time , she has to be a margaret thatcher , she has to make the hard decisions .
she ca n't be the most popular person , but somebody 's gotta do it .
i think the combination of conservatives and the -lrb- free-market liberal -rrb- fdp is very good .
the fdp has the best ideas , they will be able to influence what 's going on . what do you like about germany ?
i love germany , think that it 's a great country with a great culture and the nicest people in the world .
i 'm a german myself , i choose to live here .
i love the way germans keep their things in order .
it 's very pleasant to look at . what do you dislike about germany ? i dislike that the people who are responsible are not telling the truth .
maybe some people are going to be shocked , but at least they 'd know where they stand .

"
in late november , she 'll be back in the capital with a christmas show at a cabaret tent that sits right next to the federal chancellery .
" we 'll see who 's in there when i get there , " she said . dw-world : how is germa n y doi n g i n your opi n io n ? gayle tufts : poor germany 's having a hard time right now .
it 's holding its head down like a sad sack .
it 's a shame when bad things happen to good people .
the country 's just gotten over the trauma of the war - it really worked hard on that .
people have done their verga n ge n heitsbewältigu n g -lrb- eds : dealing with the past -rrb- .
they got through reunification - who would have ever thought that reunification would have gone so well in a country that 's so regimented .
of course it 's shocking and the reality of it is now catching up with germans .
maybe unification with luxembourg or italy would have been easier , because people there are more flexible .
germans like things to go the way they 're supposed to go .
they like their trains to run on time .
what n eeds to happe n i n germa n y to help speed up the cou n try 's recovery ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a politician that 's more to tufts ' liking the situation here reminds me of my older brother , who lives in boston and has been unemployed for four years .
i tell him , " you should have gone to college when you had the chance , you should n't have drunk so much beer , hanging out with friends , watching baseball . "
unfortunately , something has to change .
you ca n't live in a country with this much unemployment .
somebody is going to break the unions that are so strong here .
it 's not going to be possible in the global world to have this kind of protection that workers have here .
the hope is that there will be people who can do it in a human enough fashion .
people want things to be perfect , but it 's not going to be perfect .
the challenge for leaders will be to find a way to make the best of an imperfect situation .
gerhard schröder or angela merkel ?
who is your perso n al choice for cha n cellor ?
why ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dancing with berlin 's mayor , klaus wowereit i ca n't vote here , so i kind of tend to stay out of it .
but i hope people vote , i hope that people who are a bit cynical about what the spd and the greens have achieved still go out and vote and do n't say , " it does n't matter . " i 'm for schröder .
he 's a good guy .
he 's human .
i 'm all for the me n schliche ka n didate n -lrb- human candidates -rrb- .
my favorites are -lrb- german foreign minister -rrb- joschka fischer and -lrb- berlin mayor klaus -rrb- wowereit .
i do n't know much about -lrb- merkel -rrb- , but i do n't see her as a very warm person .
it 's as if she fulfills all the criteria - she 's a woman , she 's from the east , but does that mean that she 's the right person ?
on the other hand - the poor woman : there are more things written about her hair than her agenda .
i would not want to be in her shoes , whatever they may be .
what do you like about germa n y ? i like the honesty .
germans can be incredibly honest and everything is very deep .
there are stupid things on television , but the next day you have 12 commentaries in the newspaper and everybody 's talking about it .
people like to chew things over .
i have personally profited from it , it has made me take myself more seriously . what do you dislike about germa n y ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gayle tufts this seriousness sometimes makes me crazy .
i want to tell people : " lighten up !
be a little more friendly ! "
i miss the kind of laid-back american " how you doin ' ? "
i do n't like that people always say " no " first if it does n't fit into the plan .
it first has got to be thought about .
i see it in theater .
you have to let them know five months ahead that you want a certain type of microphone - that 's the kind of lack of spontaneity that makes me crazy . mathis winkler interviewed gayle tufts send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dealing with denglish click here for dw-world 's dossier on mixing german with english .
the players dw-world takes a detailed look at each party 's top candidates , where they 've been and where they could be going .
opinion : what germany needs as germany heads toward early elections this fall , voters will decide whether they want chancellor gerhard schröder or opposition leader angela merkel .
but dw-world 's marc young is n't sure if germans know what they need .

dw-world : how is germa n y doi n g i n your opi n io n ?
peter murphy : i believe that germany is still in a relatively strong economic position .
the challenges being faced by many countries of unemployment continue to cause pressures for the government - a situation that does not seem to be likely to improve in the short term .
i believe that there is a need for a critical review of how the economy can be stimulated .
with a willingness to be flexible and more responsive to " external forces , " i believe there is room for the types of change that would lead to an increase in social and economic stability .

what n eeds to happe n i n germa n y to help speed up the cou n try 's recovery ?
i would hope that the elected government would use their wisdom to create a better , fairer , more sustainable society for us all to live in .
i would hope to see tolerance and support for groups and individuals less fortunate than ourselves put more significantly on the agenda .
i would like young and old alike to feel that the future had something to offer and that they had something to contribute - a sense of worth .
societies are , in my opinion , successful when people feel that they have something to contribute .
high levels of unemployment , uncertainties about the future , worries about coping in retirement do not lead to economic growth and development .
the government has a challenge to make change attractive and the norm .

economics minister wolfgang clement called zimmermann 's suggestion " infeasible and excessive . "
he said he supports the suggestion made by a special government commission of experts , which would see the retirement age gradually raised to 67 . such suggestions have caused some older spd supporters to switch their allegiance to the left party , the new alliance of the reformed communist party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- and left-wing groups .

he previously worked in a number of state schools in britain before coming to bonn in the mid-1990s , where he has been a member of the senior management at the school since it opened in 1997 .
dw-world : how is germa n y doi n g i n your opi n io n ?
peter murphy : i believe that germany is still in a relatively strong economic position .
the challenges being faced by many countries of unemployment continue to cause pressures for the government - a situation that does not seem to be likely to improve in the short term .
i believe that there is a need for a critical review of how the economy can be stimulated .
with a willingness to be flexible and more responsive to " external forces , " i believe there is room for the types of change that would lead to an increase in social and economic stability .
when recruiting internationally , i often hear of germany being referred to as a " hardship assignment country " - an image that i do not share , but see as a major challenge to be addressed by future governments .
globalization is not a concept that can be ignored in the hope that one day it will go away .
what n eeds to happe n i n germa n y to help speed up the cou n try 's recovery ?
i would hope that the elected government would use their wisdom to create a better , fairer , more sustainable society for us all to live in .
i would hope to see tolerance and support for groups and individuals less fortunate than ourselves put more significantly on the agenda .
i would like young and old alike to feel that the future had something to offer and that they had something to contribute - a sense of worth .
societies are , in my opinion , successful when people feel that they have something to contribute .
high levels of unemployment , uncertainties about the future , worries about coping in retirement do not lead to economic growth and development .
the government has a challenge to make change attractive and the norm .
gerhard schröder or a n gela merkel ?
who is your perso n al choice for cha n cellor ?
why ?
i would like to see a change , and believe that angela merkel would bring an interesting perspective to a still very male-dominated culture .
what do you like about germa n y ?
in the context of education policies , it 's positive that there is a recognition that something needs to change .
what do you dislike about germa n y ?

"
in late november , she 'll be back in the capital with a christmas show at a cabaret tent that sits right next to the federal chancellery .
" we 'll see who 's in there when i get there , " she said . dw-world : how is germa n y doi n g i n your opi n io n ? gayle tufts : poor germany 's having a hard time right now .
it 's holding its head down like a sad sack .
it 's a shame when bad things happen to good people .
the country 's just gotten over the trauma of the war - it really worked hard on that .
people have done their verga n ge n heitsbewältigu n g -lrb- eds : dealing with the past -rrb- .
they got through reunification - who would have ever thought that reunification would have gone so well in a country that 's so regimented .
of course it 's shocking and the reality of it is now catching up with germans .
maybe unification with luxembourg or italy would have been easier , because people there are more flexible .
germans like things to go the way they 're supposed to go .
they like their trains to run on time .
what n eeds to happe n i n germa n y to help speed up the cou n try 's recovery ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a politician that 's more to tufts ' liking the situation here reminds me of my older brother , who lives in boston and has been unemployed for four years .
i tell him , " you should have gone to college when you had the chance , you should n't have drunk so much beer , hanging out with friends , watching baseball . "
unfortunately , something has to change .
you ca n't live in a country with this much unemployment .
somebody is going to break the unions that are so strong here .
it 's not going to be possible in the global world to have this kind of protection that workers have here .
the hope is that there will be people who can do it in a human enough fashion .
people want things to be perfect , but it 's not going to be perfect .
the challenge for leaders will be to find a way to make the best of an imperfect situation .
gerhard schröder or angela merkel ?
who is your perso n al choice for cha n cellor ?
why ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dancing with berlin 's mayor , klaus wowereit i ca n't vote here , so i kind of tend to stay out of it .
but i hope people vote , i hope that people who are a bit cynical about what the spd and the greens have achieved still go out and vote and do n't say , " it does n't matter . " i 'm for schröder .
he 's a good guy .
he 's human .
i 'm all for the me n schliche ka n didate n -lrb- human candidates -rrb- .
my favorites are -lrb- german foreign minister -rrb- joschka fischer and -lrb- berlin mayor klaus -rrb- wowereit .
i do n't know much about -lrb- merkel -rrb- , but i do n't see her as a very warm person .
it 's as if she fulfills all the criteria - she 's a woman , she 's from the east , but does that mean that she 's the right person ?
on the other hand - the poor woman : there are more things written about her hair than her agenda .
i would not want to be in her shoes , whatever they may be .
what do you like about germa n y ? i like the honesty .
germans can be incredibly honest and everything is very deep .
there are stupid things on television , but the next day you have 12 commentaries in the newspaper and everybody 's talking about it .
people like to chew things over .
i have personally profited from it , it has made me take myself more seriously . what do you dislike about germa n y ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gayle tufts this seriousness sometimes makes me crazy .
i want to tell people : " lighten up !
be a little more friendly ! "
i miss the kind of laid-back american " how you doin ' ? "
i do n't like that people always say " no " first if it does n't fit into the plan .
it first has got to be thought about .
i see it in theater .
you have to let them know five months ahead that you want a certain type of microphone - that 's the kind of lack of spontaneity that makes me crazy . mathis winkler interviewed gayle tufts send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dealing with denglish click here for dw-world 's dossier on mixing german with english .
the players dw-world takes a detailed look at each party 's top candidates , where they 've been and where they could be going .
opinion : what germany needs as germany heads toward early elections this fall , voters will decide whether they want chancellor gerhard schröder or opposition leader angela merkel .
but dw-world 's marc young is n't sure if germans know what they need .

spd presents election manifesto germany -pipe- 12.08.2005 getting the gray vote großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a powerful target group senior citizens make up a third of the german electorate and are being wooed by all the parties .
but when it comes to one of the issues that concerns them - pensions - they do n't think any one party has the answers . the elderly are an important target group in september 's election , but none of the parties have easy answers for the issues they 're most concerned about - pensions and the rising cost of health care and medication . the current government coalition of social democrats and greens introduced tough reforms which have also affected pensioners , but given germany 's massive public debt , the opposition parties would also have to make cutbacks if they came to power . raising the retirement age bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the discussion about the difficulty in funding germany 's pension system in future again took center stage this week following a suggestion by the president of the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- , klaus f. zimmermann , to raise the age of retirement to 70 from its current 65 . political parties , unions and pension insurers have all heaped criticism on the idea .
economics minister wolfgang clement called zimmermann 's suggestion " infeasible and excessive . "
he said he supports the suggestion made by a special government commission of experts , which would see the retirement age gradually raised to 67 . such suggestions have caused some older spd supporters to switch their allegiance to the left party , the new alliance of the reformed communist party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- and left-wing groups .
two-thirds of left party members are over 60 .
the senior citizens ' working groups meet regularly and carry authority .
their main recruits are elderly people in eastern germany . left party gaining senior support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left party is attracting senior voters " i believe that a very specific problem for older people in the east is that not only do they have the impression that the contributions they have made to society are not valued , but there is also proof that it is so , " said ernst bienert of the left party 's senior citizens group . seniors who remain loyal to the spd are also hitting the campaign trail , in part to refute the notion that only the spd is to blame for the pensions crisis and other social crises facing the country . " all of these developments , which resulted from compromises made during the committee stage , were frequently laid at the door of the spd , and we have to explain that and tell people how it really happened , " said hermann bokelmann of the spd 's 60-plus group . there has been no talk of cutting pensions in the election campaigns as yet , but it 's clear that future generations of pensioners will receive barely more than the level of social welfare from the government .
in comparison to those future generations , today 's pensioners are well-off .
nevertheless , opinion polls suggest that most pensioners want to see a change in government . up to 60 percent plan to vote for the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , even though they do n't believe that leader angela merkel has the answers to their problems . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de east germans disappointed by reunification east germany in 1989 was in the midst of a peaceful revolution .

each will cost the uv aware pilgrim 8.50 euros . the unexpected heat may require a change of clothes .
luckily there 's a choice of either a current or former pope t-shirt -lrb- 12.90 euros -rrb- .
and just to make sure you wo n't be late for a papal pot roast down by the rhine with your friends , you 'll need a world youth day watch which can be purchased for 11.99 euros . amazingly still able to converse under the weight of her extensive collection of memorabilia , corina ribiero from brazil said that money was no question in relation to the bigger picture and the memories she hopes she will take back with her to sao paulo .

and with the former cardinal ratzinger a native of the host country , every souvenir stand , book store and tourist shop in the area has been stocking up on official and not-so-official papal treats . for those not willing to shell out for the event sponsored t-shirt , there are plenty of cheaper alternatives featuring the beaming visage of the holy father .
for example , a rock festival-esque black number sporting a saluting ratzi could be yours for 9.95 euros , denim waistcoat not included . world youth day meets free enterprise not all outlets selling merchandise , however , could be called reputable . " he is our pope and we want to commemorate his return , " said one street vendor who did not wish to be named .
when asked if he felt any pangs of guilt offering bootleg merchandise to pilgrims , the man added : " any christian will tell you that one of god 's greatest gifts was the gift of free will .
they can choose if they want to buy my t-shirts or someone else 's . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is certainly no dearth in possible alternatives .
radiating out from the cologne cathedral there are numerous stores displaying posters , postcards , candles , lollipops and all manner of reading material all featuring the star of the show . many items , despite the fact that the pope wo n't be in cologne for a week , already feature the holy father in various poses around the city . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just in case it proves difficult getting a snapshot of benedict xvi while he 's in cologne , there is a wide range of postcards already on sale that has the pope relaxing by the rhine , receiving adulation in front of the cathedral and enjoying a break from blessing the faithful . from the sublime to the ridiculous , it certainly seems that religon sells and that world youth day - and the first visit to germany of the new pope - is big business . nick amies , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cashing in on christianity in cologne come next week , the german city of cologne will be bursting at the seams as it plays host to some 800,000 pilgrims in town for world youth day .

he previously worked in a number of state schools in britain before coming to bonn in the mid-1990s , where he has been a member of the senior management at the school since it opened in 1997 .
dw-world : how is germa n y doi n g i n your opi n io n ?
peter murphy : i believe that germany is still in a relatively strong economic position .
the challenges being faced by many countries of unemployment continue to cause pressures for the government - a situation that does not seem to be likely to improve in the short term .
i believe that there is a need for a critical review of how the economy can be stimulated .
with a willingness to be flexible and more responsive to " external forces , " i believe there is room for the types of change that would lead to an increase in social and economic stability .
when recruiting internationally , i often hear of germany being referred to as a " hardship assignment country " - an image that i do not share , but see as a major challenge to be addressed by future governments .
globalization is not a concept that can be ignored in the hope that one day it will go away .
what n eeds to happe n i n germa n y to help speed up the cou n try 's recovery ?
i would hope that the elected government would use their wisdom to create a better , fairer , more sustainable society for us all to live in .
i would hope to see tolerance and support for groups and individuals less fortunate than ourselves put more significantly on the agenda .
i would like young and old alike to feel that the future had something to offer and that they had something to contribute - a sense of worth .
societies are , in my opinion , successful when people feel that they have something to contribute .
high levels of unemployment , uncertainties about the future , worries about coping in retirement do not lead to economic growth and development .
the government has a challenge to make change attractive and the norm .
gerhard schröder or a n gela merkel ?
who is your perso n al choice for cha n cellor ?
why ?
i would like to see a change , and believe that angela merkel would bring an interesting perspective to a still very male-dominated culture .
what do you like about germa n y ?
in the context of education policies , it 's positive that there is a recognition that something needs to change .
what do you dislike about germa n y ?
the lack of critically challenging debate about what needs to change perhaps due to the difficulties in pushing through major social reform . ranty islam interviewed peter murphy send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de focus on education click here for dw-world 's collection of in-depth stories on education issues in germany .

spd presents election manifesto germany -pipe- 12.08.2005 getting the gray vote großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a powerful target group senior citizens make up a third of the german electorate and are being wooed by all the parties .
but when it comes to one of the issues that concerns them - pensions - they do n't think any one party has the answers . the elderly are an important target group in september 's election , but none of the parties have easy answers for the issues they 're most concerned about - pensions and the rising cost of health care and medication . the current government coalition of social democrats and greens introduced tough reforms which have also affected pensioners , but given germany 's massive public debt , the opposition parties would also have to make cutbacks if they came to power . raising the retirement age bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the discussion about the difficulty in funding germany 's pension system in future again took center stage this week following a suggestion by the president of the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- , klaus f. zimmermann , to raise the age of retirement to 70 from its current 65 . political parties , unions and pension insurers have all heaped criticism on the idea .
economics minister wolfgang clement called zimmermann 's suggestion " infeasible and excessive . "
he said he supports the suggestion made by a special government commission of experts , which would see the retirement age gradually raised to 67 . such suggestions have caused some older spd supporters to switch their allegiance to the left party , the new alliance of the reformed communist party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- and left-wing groups .
two-thirds of left party members are over 60 .
the senior citizens ' working groups meet regularly and carry authority .
their main recruits are elderly people in eastern germany . left party gaining senior support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left party is attracting senior voters " i believe that a very specific problem for older people in the east is that not only do they have the impression that the contributions they have made to society are not valued , but there is also proof that it is so , " said ernst bienert of the left party 's senior citizens group . seniors who remain loyal to the spd are also hitting the campaign trail , in part to refute the notion that only the spd is to blame for the pensions crisis and other social crises facing the country . " all of these developments , which resulted from compromises made during the committee stage , were frequently laid at the door of the spd , and we have to explain that and tell people how it really happened , " said hermann bokelmann of the spd 's 60-plus group . there has been no talk of cutting pensions in the election campaigns as yet , but it 's clear that future generations of pensioners will receive barely more than the level of social welfare from the government .
in comparison to those future generations , today 's pensioners are well-off .
nevertheless , opinion polls suggest that most pensioners want to see a change in government . up to 60 percent plan to vote for the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , even though they do n't believe that leader angela merkel has the answers to their problems . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de east germans disappointed by reunification east germany in 1989 was in the midst of a peaceful revolution .

and from the choices on view , shopaholic pilgrims will have no problem sating their appetites . the estimated 800,000 pilgrims flocking to cologne and the surrounding areas for the world youth day celebrations may be there to save souls but it 's unlikely that they will be saving any money .
the merchandising bandwagon is in full swing a week in advance of the main event and items are flying off the shelves . " we 've already had to restock on key chains , " said volunteer christine meyer above the din of a frantic crowd clamoring for goodies at the info point opposite cologne 's main station .
" they selling very well and so are the wristbands . "
as if to emphasise the point , a group of japanese girls snap up a handful of the popular rubber bands , one of each color . the fashion conscious catholic could run up a hefty bill if he or she were to stock up on all the available official world youth day products available .
the apparently desirable key chains retail at a reasonable 3.60 euros -lrb- $ 4.47 -rrb- while the wristbands go for 1.20 euros a pop . extensive shopping list could break the bank bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things start to add up , however , when wanting to complement your various hanging items with festival attire .
imagine the sun breaks out from behind the clouds while taking part in the open air mass .
a rather fetching official baseball cap or sunhat would be needed to keep off those powerful rays .
each will cost the uv aware pilgrim 8.50 euros . the unexpected heat may require a change of clothes .
luckily there 's a choice of either a current or former pope t-shirt -lrb- 12.90 euros -rrb- .
and just to make sure you wo n't be late for a papal pot roast down by the rhine with your friends , you 'll need a world youth day watch which can be purchased for 11.99 euros . amazingly still able to converse under the weight of her extensive collection of memorabilia , corina ribiero from brazil said that money was no question in relation to the bigger picture and the memories she hopes she will take back with her to sao paulo . " my experiences here will be worth more than anything , " she said .
" many of the things i have bought are for my family but also for me .
they will remind me of the beautiful time i had in germany . " pope sideline doing a roaring trade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if the official range of products is not enough to get the international congregation parting with its money , there also seems to be a profitable sideline in pope merchandise running in tandem with the officially sponsored items . the arrival of benedict xvi on august 18 has been anticipated ever since he was named as successor to the late john paul ii .
and with the former cardinal ratzinger a native of the host country , every souvenir stand , book store and tourist shop in the area has been stocking up on official and not-so-official papal treats . for those not willing to shell out for the event sponsored t-shirt , there are plenty of cheaper alternatives featuring the beaming visage of the holy father .
for example , a rock festival-esque black number sporting a saluting ratzi could be yours for 9.95 euros , denim waistcoat not included . world youth day meets free enterprise not all outlets selling merchandise , however , could be called reputable . " he is our pope and we want to commemorate his return , " said one street vendor who did not wish to be named .
when asked if he felt any pangs of guilt offering bootleg merchandise to pilgrims , the man added : " any christian will tell you that one of god 's greatest gifts was the gift of free will .
they can choose if they want to buy my t-shirts or someone else 's . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is certainly no dearth in possible alternatives .
radiating out from the cologne cathedral there are numerous stores displaying posters , postcards , candles , lollipops and all manner of reading material all featuring the star of the show . many items , despite the fact that the pope wo n't be in cologne for a week , already feature the holy father in various poses around the city . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just in case it proves difficult getting a snapshot of benedict xvi while he 's in cologne , there is a wide range of postcards already on sale that has the pope relaxing by the rhine , receiving adulation in front of the cathedral and enjoying a break from blessing the faithful . from the sublime to the ridiculous , it certainly seems that religon sells and that world youth day - and the first visit to germany of the new pope - is big business . nick amies , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cashing in on christianity in cologne come next week , the german city of cologne will be bursting at the seams as it plays host to some 800,000 pilgrims in town for world youth day .

he previously worked in a number of state schools in britain before coming to bonn in the mid-1990s , where he has been a member of the senior management at the school since it opened in 1997 .
dw-world : how is germa n y doi n g i n your opi n io n ?
peter murphy : i believe that germany is still in a relatively strong economic position .
the challenges being faced by many countries of unemployment continue to cause pressures for the government - a situation that does not seem to be likely to improve in the short term .
i believe that there is a need for a critical review of how the economy can be stimulated .
with a willingness to be flexible and more responsive to " external forces , " i believe there is room for the types of change that would lead to an increase in social and economic stability .
when recruiting internationally , i often hear of germany being referred to as a " hardship assignment country " - an image that i do not share , but see as a major challenge to be addressed by future governments .
globalization is not a concept that can be ignored in the hope that one day it will go away .
what n eeds to happe n i n germa n y to help speed up the cou n try 's recovery ?
i would hope that the elected government would use their wisdom to create a better , fairer , more sustainable society for us all to live in .
i would hope to see tolerance and support for groups and individuals less fortunate than ourselves put more significantly on the agenda .
i would like young and old alike to feel that the future had something to offer and that they had something to contribute - a sense of worth .
societies are , in my opinion , successful when people feel that they have something to contribute .
high levels of unemployment , uncertainties about the future , worries about coping in retirement do not lead to economic growth and development .
the government has a challenge to make change attractive and the norm .
gerhard schröder or a n gela merkel ?

dw-world : how is germa n y doi n g i n your opi n io n ?
peter murphy : i believe that germany is still in a relatively strong economic position .
the challenges being faced by many countries of unemployment continue to cause pressures for the government - a situation that does not seem to be likely to improve in the short term .
i believe that there is a need for a critical review of how the economy can be stimulated .
with a willingness to be flexible and more responsive to " external forces , " i believe there is room for the types of change that would lead to an increase in social and economic stability .
when recruiting internationally , i often hear of germany being referred to as a " hardship assignment country " - an image that i do not share , but see as a major challenge to be addressed by future governments .
globalization is not a concept that can be ignored in the hope that one day it will go away .
what n eeds to happe n i n germa n y to help speed up the cou n try 's recovery ?
i would hope that the elected government would use their wisdom to create a better , fairer , more sustainable society for us all to live in .
i would hope to see tolerance and support for groups and individuals less fortunate than ourselves put more significantly on the agenda .
i would like young and old alike to feel that the future had something to offer and that they had something to contribute - a sense of worth .
societies are , in my opinion , successful when people feel that they have something to contribute .
high levels of unemployment , uncertainties about the future , worries about coping in retirement do not lead to economic growth and development .
the government has a challenge to make change attractive and the norm .

spd presents election manifesto germany -pipe- 12.08.2005 getting the gray vote großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a powerful target group senior citizens make up a third of the german electorate and are being wooed by all the parties .
but when it comes to one of the issues that concerns them - pensions - they do n't think any one party has the answers . the elderly are an important target group in september 's election , but none of the parties have easy answers for the issues they 're most concerned about - pensions and the rising cost of health care and medication . the current government coalition of social democrats and greens introduced tough reforms which have also affected pensioners , but given germany 's massive public debt , the opposition parties would also have to make cutbacks if they came to power . raising the retirement age bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the discussion about the difficulty in funding germany 's pension system in future again took center stage this week following a suggestion by the president of the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- , klaus f. zimmermann , to raise the age of retirement to 70 from its current 65 . political parties , unions and pension insurers have all heaped criticism on the idea .
economics minister wolfgang clement called zimmermann 's suggestion " infeasible and excessive . "
he said he supports the suggestion made by a special government commission of experts , which would see the retirement age gradually raised to 67 . such suggestions have caused some older spd supporters to switch their allegiance to the left party , the new alliance of the reformed communist party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- and left-wing groups .
two-thirds of left party members are over 60 .
the senior citizens ' working groups meet regularly and carry authority .
their main recruits are elderly people in eastern germany . left party gaining senior support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left party is attracting senior voters " i believe that a very specific problem for older people in the east is that not only do they have the impression that the contributions they have made to society are not valued , but there is also proof that it is so , " said ernst bienert of the left party 's senior citizens group . seniors who remain loyal to the spd are also hitting the campaign trail , in part to refute the notion that only the spd is to blame for the pensions crisis and other social crises facing the country . " all of these developments , which resulted from compromises made during the committee stage , were frequently laid at the door of the spd , and we have to explain that and tell people how it really happened , " said hermann bokelmann of the spd 's 60-plus group . there has been no talk of cutting pensions in the election campaigns as yet , but it 's clear that future generations of pensioners will receive barely more than the level of social welfare from the government .

economics minister wolfgang clement called zimmermann 's suggestion " infeasible and excessive . "
he said he supports the suggestion made by a special government commission of experts , which would see the retirement age gradually raised to 67 . such suggestions have caused some older spd supporters to switch their allegiance to the left party , the new alliance of the reformed communist party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- and left-wing groups .

" all of these developments , which resulted from compromises made during the committee stage , were frequently laid at the door of the spd , and we have to explain that and tell people how it really happened , " said hermann bokelmann of the spd 's 60-plus group . there has been no talk of cutting pensions in the election campaigns as yet , but it 's clear that future generations of pensioners will receive barely more than the level of social welfare from the government .

pfahls , who served as state secretary for defense from 1987 to 1992 , insisted that he had not done anything in return for the money .
presiding judge maximilian hofmeister said that while pfahls may have greased the wheels for the deal , he had not directly violated the duties of his office . " you accepted money without being corrupt , " hofmeister told the defendant while reading the verdict .

according to a study by the environmental organization wwf , european cities are set to sizzle in the future . in terms of summer temperature increases , madrid is number one .
no other city in europe has seen such dramatic rises than the spanish capital over the last 30 years .
on average , madrid has seen temperatures climb by 2.2 degrees celsius -lrb- 35.96 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- in the last three decades .
trailing , and sweating , not so far behind come london , lisbon , luxembourg and athens . for londoners , more used to the " pea soup " mists rolling down the thames with a foggy chill , the rise in temperature may initially be gratefully received . that is until global temperatures rise to such an extent that the polar ice caps melt ; either causing sea levels to rise which in turn could lead to the thames flooding or a dilution of the gulf stream by fresh water which would eventually stop the warm flow to the british isles leading to a possible ice age . spain and portugal facing droughts , crop failures while the long term effect on london could be potentially disastrous , both madrid and lisbon are experiencing problems , although less apocalyptic , right now .
summers in the spanish and portuguese cities have been getting hotter and hotter leading to droughts and water shortages . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the reservoirs are empty , many fields and crops have dried up and forest areas are tinder-box dry , leading to increasingly common seasonal infernos .
both countries have requested help from the eu as crop start to fail . climatologists have been warning for years that europe must prepare for more and more extreme weather conditions and events such as drought , violent storms and floods . human industrialization to blame , says wwf martin hiller , climate spokesperson for the wwf , dismisses claims by some that these conditions are caused by variations in natural habitats around the globe .
" the majority of scientists agree that humans play the determining role , " he said . " in more than 200 years of industrialization , the co2 level in the atmosphere has increased by a third of its original value .
this is caused by humans , there is no natural process . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while humans are reaping what they sow in terms of increased heat and its effects , fauna and flora are suffering too and in many cases are being hardest hit .
the melting of the arctic ice flows are reducing the natural habitat and hunting grounds of polar bears while soaring temperatures could demand too much of fragile ecological systems like coral reefs . but the human population is also starting to see devastating effects .
" for example , at the heat wave of 2003 , " martin hiller warned .
" altogether around 40,000 people died as a result . " the future 's bright , the future 's scorching in the last century , the worldwide average temperature rose by about 0.6 degrees celsius ; in europe by about 1 degree .
scientists believe that the human race has seen nothing yet and that the biggest hike in temperatures is yet to come . scientists at the un 's intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- predict that we can expect a rise of between 1.4 to 5.8 degrees celsius . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this will lead to more intense summers for european cities and , according to the wwf , not only more dramatic environmental effects but also economic ones .
as the heat rises , more people will turn to their fans and air-conditioning systems to cope . it seems to be a vicious circle : more heat , more power consumption , more greenhouse gas and again more heat . alternative power to break the cycle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the answer could lie with renewable energy sources like wind , water and biomass , something electricity companies must consider in the future , the wwf demands .
while such alternatives are not entirely innocent in regards to climate change , they do , however , create less greenhouse gases than coal or oil . change can begin at home , martin hiller says , a fact that is often overlooked .
one could simply save up to 30 percent more energy by using electrical devices more wisely .
also , modern devices such as computers and air-conditioning systems need much less energy than their older incarnations . this , at least , would be the first step in breaking the vicious circle of climate change . johannes beck -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the cost of environmental pollution germany may be an eco-friendly place , but support for the environment does come at a price - a fact that some organizations are trying to disprove .

the ruhr valley will be transfixed by dortmund 's clash with rivals schalke .
in nearby leverkusen , champions bayern munich face bayer 04 . ever since germans first took a leather ball and started booting it into a net , the two ruhr valley clubs , dortmund and schalke from neighboring gelsenkirchen have displayed their disdain for each other on the pitch .
the two ruhrpott rivals have met 126 times in total , 66 of those in the bundesliga .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : being a borussia dortmund fan is n't just a run-of-the-mill hobby fans in bvb yellow and schalke royal blue live to see this game . and the passion always makes its way from the terraces to the pitch .
schalke coach ralf rangnick 's troop must play in the unfriendly confines of the westfalen stadium but their fortunes there have been particularly good in the recent past .
schalke have not lost in the last six encounters in front of a regularly sold out 70,000 capacity in dortmund 's cauldron arena .
" in the last few years we have looked pretty good in dortmund .
i am assuming that this time it will be the same , " schalke goalkeeper frank rost told sport bild .
in the arena aufschalke on may 14 , dortmund broke a 12-game winless streak , topping off a tremendous comeback in the second half of the season .
both clubs value the rivalry and use it as a catapult for success in the bundesliga .
bvb need the boost more than schalke , coming away with a tie in their first match and having not reached the uefa cup after crashing out of the intertoto cup in the summer .
bayern meets bayer coach felix magath probably has a bone to pick with leverkusen .
last season in his first appearance as munich coach in the bayarena , his team got pasted 4-1 .
naturally , it was just a small hurdle in their march to the league championship .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two bayern players -lrb- red -rrb- clamp down on a gladbach opponent in the first week revenge may be on magath 's mind , but only far , far at the back .
the big controversy for the team , and there is almost always one at bayern munich , is the storm surrounding midfielder michael ballack .
there 's no lack of column inches being devoted to the subject of whether the germany captain is out of favor or not .
magath , not a man of many words , has been quiet , saying that all 23 men on the squad are both starters and substitutes .
words that might confuse some soccer players - but it 's doubtful that michael ballack thinks he is a substitute .
leverkusen started their campaign with an impressive effort against frankfurt last week , cruising to a 4-1 victory .
and could that be repeated ?
" we have the quality , " bayer midfielder bernd schneider told kicker magazine .
the contenders with easier assignments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg 's rafael van der vaart should lead with his head one of the dark horses in the bundesliga this season must be hamburg .
they have brought in quality personnel , most notably dutch international rafael van der vaart and on saturday , thomas doll 's club gets the pleasure of travelling to bielefeld , the one side they have had the most success against in their history .
the bielefeld defense resembled a sieve in a 5-2 defeat against bremen , holes that must be stopped soon or coach thomas von heesen will be battling against a rapdly sinking ship .
hertha berlin face the new boys from frankfurt .
soccer followers always expect a lot from the capital city team , but berlin has on the whole been disappointing .
a home match against frankfurt , where they score two goals on average , should be an easy assignment for falko götz ' squad led by brazilian extraordinaire marcelinho . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dfb wants turkish prodigy for germany when 16-year old nuri sahin took to the field on saturday for borussia dortmund , he became the youngest ever bundesliga player .

some politicians are championing unusual policies in their attempts to boost their parties ' popularity with the electorate .
consumer protection minister renate künast is one . künast has positioned herself on the side of german manufacturers and by doing so has also placed herself in the cross hairs of the media .
proclaiming her allegiance and support for german products , the green party minister appeared in the popular sunday newspaper bild am sonntag to urge her compatriots to buy domestically produced goods and help protect the jobs of fellow germans . the move backfired and künast was accused of protectionism .
in an attempt to calm the stormy waters , a government statement attempted to spin the story into something a little more palatable .
künast was not calling for a boycott of foreign goods , it claimed , but for an environment where workers ' rights are upheld and child labor abroad is not rewarded . but what do the consumers of germany think about künast 's rallying call to " buy german ? " cheap goods flooding german market bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : digging deeper past the ill-conceived initial rant , one finds a central argument to the minister 's call , one which has been a matter of debate for years : the trend toward discount products , especially food .
the no-frills product ranges have come under fire mainly due to the fact that they are produced in other countries where labor costs are cheaper but sold in germany . but does the consumer really have the choice to support german products ? in the bonn branch of the nationwide department store chain kaufhof , an investigation into the country of origin of most of the clothing available there reveals an overwhelmingly international trend .
labels on trousers , t-shirts , belts and hats disclose many different origins : made in china , made in bangladesh , made in turkey and made in romania .
not one says made in germany . moving to another floor , the story is the same .
even the world famous steiff animals , cuddly toys associated with high-quality german manufacturing processes , carry the label : " produced in china under quality control of steiff germany " . " made in germany " not the whole story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the consumer generally does not have the possibility to find out where the product has been produced , " says holger brackemann from german standards watchdog stiftung warentest .
" the famous ' made in germany ' label , that they may find on textiles and other products , may not be the whole truth , that it may not have been produced here from the first through to the last manufacturing step . " the government 's statement that künast was looking to prevent worker exploitation and child labor in foreign countries by urging germans to buy locally produced , in theory , is a good example of trying to kill two birds with one stone .
on the one hand , promoting german goods is a tick for trying to protect jobs at home while trying to put pressure on countries that use child labor is stab at promoting an ethical foreign policy . german consumers want quality items bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but do german consumers know about the origins of their products or whether ethical practices were used in their production ?
do they even care ? when asked if she takes any notice of where products are produced , one shopper in bonn replied : " no , not at all . "
another added : " i shop for quality .
quality goods not only come from germany .
and germany makes a lot of rubbish as well . " another shopper said : " i look first at the quality and then at the price , and then if i decide if buying this is worthwhile , then i get it .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de election 2005 -pipe- 12.08.2005 merkel aims to win back eastern voters großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : his comments are hurting her campaign chancellor candidate angela merkel sought to distance herself from remarks made by her key ally in bavaria , edmund stoiber .
his comments on eastern voters are being linked to the conservatives ' slide in the polls . merkel was in damage-control mode as the week ended after stoiber 's remarks on eastern voters appeared to be seriously damaging her campaign .
stoiber provoked controversy earlier in the week after he characterized voters in the east as " frustrated " and questioned their judgment before general elections next month . merkel herself comes from eastern germany , but despite this , her party , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , is currently performing worse in the east than in the west . in an interview with zdf television late on thursday , merkel spoke of the 35 years she spent living under communism in east germany , and stressed that she understood the concerns of the people in the region .
she added that she wanted to be chancellor of all germans . " we will fight for every vote , but we definitely don ’ t need to insult voters , " merkel said .
" every move - intentional or not - which splits rather than unites germany is totally counterproductive . " slipping in the polls only a few weeks ago , the campaign for merkel and the cdu looked like clear sailing , with the conservatives enjoying a sizeable lead over chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- . but that lead has shrunk , leaving the cdu and their likely coalition partner , the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , defending a slim majority of 49 percent , barely ahead of the combined vote of the other parties strong enough to enter parliament . eastern voters could be forgiven for feeling slighted by the conservatives .
commenting last week on the shocking case of a german woman from the east charged with murdering nine of her newborn babies , senior conservative jörg schönbohm said the east german dictatorship had left easterners lacking in a sense of responsibility and morality . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder hopes to profit from the conservatives ' mistakes stoiber 's comment this week that " those who are frustrated ca n't be allowed to determine the fate of germany " only added insult to injury .
and it may end up helping schröder , who is bidding for a third term for his coalition of social democrats and greens . " his remark is not only tasteless , but shows a lack of democratic respect , " said schröder .
" stoiber 's comment cements division and insults people who have had to live under harder conditions than we in the west . " the left party , led by the charismatic former finance minister oskar lafontaine , may also profit from the conservatives ' gaffes , seeing as this new party is currently leading the polls in the east with more than 30 percent . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de conservative gaffe enrages east germans germany 's first chancellor candidate from the east , angela merkel , ran into fresh electoral problems in the crucial ex-communist states thursday after a key ally bashed the region 's " frustrated " voters .

his comments on eastern voters are being linked to the conservatives ' slide in the polls . merkel was in damage-control mode as the week ended after stoiber 's remarks on eastern voters appeared to be seriously damaging her campaign .
stoiber provoked controversy earlier in the week after he characterized voters in the east as " frustrated " and questioned their judgment before general elections next month . merkel herself comes from eastern germany , but despite this , her party , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , is currently performing worse in the east than in the west . in an interview with zdf television late on thursday , merkel spoke of the 35 years she spent living under communism in east germany , and stressed that she understood the concerns of the people in the region .

a long-time mcdonald 's employee , he bought his first two restaurants in regensburg in 1987 and has since opened 10 more in the region . the 59-year-old says he has only " 21 more years until retirement . "

if you look at the economy , it 's performing , i think , at the last place in europe .
i think it 's pretty frustrating for everybody - for the entrepreneurs , the workers and the people who , who are retired .
i think it 's frightening for the people who are still learning or studying and getting ready to go into the work force . what needs to happen in germany to help speed up the country 's recovery ? hartz -lrb- eds : germany 's social welfare reforms -rrb- is a step in the right direction , but it 's not far enough along .

why ? schröder has totally failed .

i think he 's disqualified himself .
of course merkel would be better .
at the same time , she has to be a margaret thatcher , she has to make the hard decisions .
she ca n't be the most popular person , but somebody 's gotta do it .
i think the combination of conservatives and the -lrb- free-market liberal -rrb- fdp is very good .
the fdp has the best ideas , they will be able to influence what 's going on . what do you like about germany ?
i love germany , think that it 's a great country with a great culture and the nicest people in the world .
i 'm a german myself , i choose to live here .
i love the way germans keep their things in order .
it 's very pleasant to look at . what do you dislike about germany ? i dislike that the people who are responsible are not telling the truth .

a long-time mcdonald 's employee , he bought his first two restaurants in regensburg in 1987 and has since opened 10 more in the region . the 59-year-old says he has only " 21 more years until retirement . "
if he does n't make it until then , his biggest wish is to die in a mcdonald 's , he said .
mosher , who has become a german citizen , shares his views on the country 's state and future before the election . dw-world : how is germany doing in your opinion ? frank mosher : my feeling is that germany is doing very poorly at the present time .
if you look at the economy , it 's performing , i think , at the last place in europe .
i think it 's pretty frustrating for everybody - for the entrepreneurs , the workers and the people who , who are retired .
i think it 's frightening for the people who are still learning or studying and getting ready to go into the work force . what needs to happen in germany to help speed up the country 's recovery ? hartz -lrb- eds : germany 's social welfare reforms -rrb- is a step in the right direction , but it 's not far enough along .
we need more straight talk , more honest talk .
if we do n't get this thing straightened out , the perception of democracy gets weaker and weaker .
we just have to get it going .
the reform of the tax system is one of most important things that have to get done .
it 's ridiculous that not all ways of making money are taxed .
we need to get rid of subsidies .
we have more people working as civil servants , i think , than almost anywhere else in the world .
the problem is that everybody is relying too much on the state .
you ca n't expect the state to provide for you when you 're old . chancellor gerhard schröder or challenger angela merkel ?
who is your personal choice for chancellor ?
why ? schröder has totally failed .
he made promises and he has n't performed .
i think he 's disqualified himself .
of course merkel would be better .
at the same time , she has to be a margaret thatcher , she has to make the hard decisions .
she ca n't be the most popular person , but somebody 's gotta do it .
i think the combination of conservatives and the -lrb- free-market liberal -rrb- fdp is very good .
the fdp has the best ideas , they will be able to influence what 's going on . what do you like about germany ?
i love germany , think that it 's a great country with a great culture and the nicest people in the world .
i 'm a german myself , i choose to live here .
i love the way germans keep their things in order .
it 's very pleasant to look at . what do you dislike about germany ? i dislike that the people who are responsible are not telling the truth .

in nearby leverkusen , champions bayern munich face bayer 04 . ever since germans first took a leather ball and started booting it into a net , the two ruhr valley clubs , dortmund and schalke from neighboring gelsenkirchen have displayed their disdain for each other on the pitch .
the two ruhrpott rivals have met 126 times in total , 66 of those in the bundesliga .

schalke coach ralf rangnick 's troop must play in the unfriendly confines of the westfalen stadium but their fortunes there have been particularly good in the recent past .

magath , not a man of many words , has been quiet , saying that all 23 men on the squad are both starters and substitutes .
words that might confuse some soccer players - but it 's doubtful that michael ballack thinks he is a substitute .
leverkusen started their campaign with an impressive effort against frankfurt last week , cruising to a 4-1 victory .

the ruhr valley will be transfixed by dortmund 's clash with rivals schalke .
in nearby leverkusen , champions bayern munich face bayer 04 . ever since germans first took a leather ball and started booting it into a net , the two ruhr valley clubs , dortmund and schalke from neighboring gelsenkirchen have displayed their disdain for each other on the pitch .
the two ruhrpott rivals have met 126 times in total , 66 of those in the bundesliga .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : being a borussia dortmund fan is n't just a run-of-the-mill hobby fans in bvb yellow and schalke royal blue live to see this game . and the passion always makes its way from the terraces to the pitch .
schalke coach ralf rangnick 's troop must play in the unfriendly confines of the westfalen stadium but their fortunes there have been particularly good in the recent past .
schalke have not lost in the last six encounters in front of a regularly sold out 70,000 capacity in dortmund 's cauldron arena .
" in the last few years we have looked pretty good in dortmund .
i am assuming that this time it will be the same , " schalke goalkeeper frank rost told sport bild .
in the arena aufschalke on may 14 , dortmund broke a 12-game winless streak , topping off a tremendous comeback in the second half of the season .
both clubs value the rivalry and use it as a catapult for success in the bundesliga .
bvb need the boost more than schalke , coming away with a tie in their first match and having not reached the uefa cup after crashing out of the intertoto cup in the summer .
bayern meets bayer coach felix magath probably has a bone to pick with leverkusen .
last season in his first appearance as munich coach in the bayarena , his team got pasted 4-1 .
naturally , it was just a small hurdle in their march to the league championship .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two bayern players -lrb- red -rrb- clamp down on a gladbach opponent in the first week revenge may be on magath 's mind , but only far , far at the back .
the big controversy for the team , and there is almost always one at bayern munich , is the storm surrounding midfielder michael ballack .
there 's no lack of column inches being devoted to the subject of whether the germany captain is out of favor or not .
magath , not a man of many words , has been quiet , saying that all 23 men on the squad are both starters and substitutes .
words that might confuse some soccer players - but it 's doubtful that michael ballack thinks he is a substitute .
leverkusen started their campaign with an impressive effort against frankfurt last week , cruising to a 4-1 victory .
and could that be repeated ?
" we have the quality , " bayer midfielder bernd schneider told kicker magazine .

after a nominal appearance against bayern in the first week , he wants to prove he can carry , or at least help carry , coach horst köppel to success .
the coach should play him against wolfsburg .
the striker has scored 11 times in 11 matches against the northern german side .
an even dozen would look nicer .
wolfsburg coach , holger fach , gets to return to the club that fired him last season .

this week , they can make kaiserlautern 's michael henke second game as a head coach as sour as the first one .
henke , longtime assistant to ottmar hitzfeld during his reign at bayern munich , has acquired a side in turmoil and watched in frustration as lautern surrendered a 1-0 lead to schalke , eventually losing 2-1 .
in hanover , ewald lienen led the squad to an outstanding 2004-05 campaign .
last week , they showed it was n't a fluke coming down from 2-0 deficit to tie with berlin .
they must travel south to nuremberg where they have had little success , only winning twice in ten matches .
for nuremberg , bad starts are the norm , having lost 3-0 to hamburg .
they have additional motivation this week with the 70th birthday of club president michael a. roth .
will that be enough though ?
sunday games feature top clubs against question marks current first-place side bremen face a nemesis in mainz .
it hardly seems likely that mainz , only in their second season ever in the bundesliga , would present problems for the northern germans , but last year bremen lost once and tied once against jürgen klopp 's " fun " soccer club .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a diamond in the rough , werder bremen bremen gave a desolate performance against basle in a champions league qualifier this week .
" i expect that we 'll come out much differently against mainz , " said team director klaus allofs .
cologne started their campaign after a one-year absence from the top division with a victory at home .
this week , they go on the road to stuttgart .

renate künast champions made in germany the green party 's renate künast was accused of protectionism after her opening statements of the election campaign urged voters to buy german products .
in reality , quality rather than origin matters most to consumers . in germany , the social democrat-green coalition is fighting for its political life in the coming federal election .
some politicians are championing unusual policies in their attempts to boost their parties ' popularity with the electorate .
consumer protection minister renate künast is one . künast has positioned herself on the side of german manufacturers and by doing so has also placed herself in the cross hairs of the media .
proclaiming her allegiance and support for german products , the green party minister appeared in the popular sunday newspaper bild am sonntag to urge her compatriots to buy domestically produced goods and help protect the jobs of fellow germans . the move backfired and künast was accused of protectionism .
in an attempt to calm the stormy waters , a government statement attempted to spin the story into something a little more palatable .
künast was not calling for a boycott of foreign goods , it claimed , but for an environment where workers ' rights are upheld and child labor abroad is not rewarded . but what do the consumers of germany think about künast 's rallying call to " buy german ? " cheap goods flooding german market bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : digging deeper past the ill-conceived initial rant , one finds a central argument to the minister 's call , one which has been a matter of debate for years : the trend toward discount products , especially food .
the no-frills product ranges have come under fire mainly due to the fact that they are produced in other countries where labor costs are cheaper but sold in germany . but does the consumer really have the choice to support german products ? in the bonn branch of the nationwide department store chain kaufhof , an investigation into the country of origin of most of the clothing available there reveals an overwhelmingly international trend .
labels on trousers , t-shirts , belts and hats disclose many different origins : made in china , made in bangladesh , made in turkey and made in romania .
not one says made in germany . moving to another floor , the story is the same .
even the world famous steiff animals , cuddly toys associated with high-quality german manufacturing processes , carry the label : " produced in china under quality control of steiff germany " . " made in germany " not the whole story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the consumer generally does not have the possibility to find out where the product has been produced , " says holger brackemann from german standards watchdog stiftung warentest .
" the famous ' made in germany ' label , that they may find on textiles and other products , may not be the whole truth , that it may not have been produced here from the first through to the last manufacturing step . " the government 's statement that künast was looking to prevent worker exploitation and child labor in foreign countries by urging germans to buy locally produced , in theory , is a good example of trying to kill two birds with one stone .
on the one hand , promoting german goods is a tick for trying to protect jobs at home while trying to put pressure on countries that use child labor is stab at promoting an ethical foreign policy . german consumers want quality items bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but do german consumers know about the origins of their products or whether ethical practices were used in their production ?
do they even care ? when asked if she takes any notice of where products are produced , one shopper in bonn replied : " no , not at all . "
another added : " i shop for quality .
quality goods not only come from germany .
and germany makes a lot of rubbish as well . " another shopper said : " i look first at the quality and then at the price , and then if i decide if buying this is worthwhile , then i get it .
the country of origin does n't really feature . " " the argument about child labor is an important one , " says one man .
" but they must also earn their money .
not buying the products may actually endanger that .

renate künast champions made in germany the green party 's renate künast was accused of protectionism after her opening statements of the election campaign urged voters to buy german products .
in reality , quality rather than origin matters most to consumers . in germany , the social democrat-green coalition is fighting for its political life in the coming federal election .
some politicians are championing unusual policies in their attempts to boost their parties ' popularity with the electorate .
consumer protection minister renate künast is one . künast has positioned herself on the side of german manufacturers and by doing so has also placed herself in the cross hairs of the media .
proclaiming her allegiance and support for german products , the green party minister appeared in the popular sunday newspaper bild am sonntag to urge her compatriots to buy domestically produced goods and help protect the jobs of fellow germans . the move backfired and künast was accused of protectionism .
in an attempt to calm the stormy waters , a government statement attempted to spin the story into something a little more palatable .
künast was not calling for a boycott of foreign goods , it claimed , but for an environment where workers ' rights are upheld and child labor abroad is not rewarded . but what do the consumers of germany think about künast 's rallying call to " buy german ? " cheap goods flooding german market bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : digging deeper past the ill-conceived initial rant , one finds a central argument to the minister 's call , one which has been a matter of debate for years : the trend toward discount products , especially food .
the no-frills product ranges have come under fire mainly due to the fact that they are produced in other countries where labor costs are cheaper but sold in germany . but does the consumer really have the choice to support german products ? in the bonn branch of the nationwide department store chain kaufhof , an investigation into the country of origin of most of the clothing available there reveals an overwhelmingly international trend .
labels on trousers , t-shirts , belts and hats disclose many different origins : made in china , made in bangladesh , made in turkey and made in romania .
not one says made in germany . moving to another floor , the story is the same .
even the world famous steiff animals , cuddly toys associated with high-quality german manufacturing processes , carry the label : " produced in china under quality control of steiff germany " . " made in germany " not the whole story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the consumer generally does not have the possibility to find out where the product has been produced , " says holger brackemann from german standards watchdog stiftung warentest .
" the famous ' made in germany ' label , that they may find on textiles and other products , may not be the whole truth , that it may not have been produced here from the first through to the last manufacturing step . " the government 's statement that künast was looking to prevent worker exploitation and child labor in foreign countries by urging germans to buy locally produced , in theory , is a good example of trying to kill two birds with one stone .
on the one hand , promoting german goods is a tick for trying to protect jobs at home while trying to put pressure on countries that use child labor is stab at promoting an ethical foreign policy . german consumers want quality items bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but do german consumers know about the origins of their products or whether ethical practices were used in their production ?
do they even care ? when asked if she takes any notice of where products are produced , one shopper in bonn replied : " no , not at all . "
another added : " i shop for quality .
quality goods not only come from germany .
and germany makes a lot of rubbish as well . " another shopper said : " i look first at the quality and then at the price , and then if i decide if buying this is worthwhile , then i get it .

his comments on eastern voters are being linked to the conservatives ' slide in the polls . merkel was in damage-control mode as the week ended after stoiber 's remarks on eastern voters appeared to be seriously damaging her campaign .
stoiber provoked controversy earlier in the week after he characterized voters in the east as " frustrated " and questioned their judgment before general elections next month . merkel herself comes from eastern germany , but despite this , her party , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , is currently performing worse in the east than in the west . in an interview with zdf television late on thursday , merkel spoke of the 35 years she spent living under communism in east germany , and stressed that she understood the concerns of the people in the region .
she added that she wanted to be chancellor of all germans . " we will fight for every vote , but we definitely don ’ t need to insult voters , " merkel said .
" every move - intentional or not - which splits rather than unites germany is totally counterproductive . " slipping in the polls only a few weeks ago , the campaign for merkel and the cdu looked like clear sailing , with the conservatives enjoying a sizeable lead over chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- . but that lead has shrunk , leaving the cdu and their likely coalition partner , the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , defending a slim majority of 49 percent , barely ahead of the combined vote of the other parties strong enough to enter parliament . eastern voters could be forgiven for feeling slighted by the conservatives .
commenting last week on the shocking case of a german woman from the east charged with murdering nine of her newborn babies , senior conservative jörg schönbohm said the east german dictatorship had left easterners lacking in a sense of responsibility and morality . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder hopes to profit from the conservatives ' mistakes stoiber 's comment this week that " those who are frustrated ca n't be allowed to determine the fate of germany " only added insult to injury .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de election 2005 -pipe- 12.08.2005 merkel aims to win back eastern voters großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : his comments are hurting her campaign chancellor candidate angela merkel sought to distance herself from remarks made by her key ally in bavaria , edmund stoiber .
his comments on eastern voters are being linked to the conservatives ' slide in the polls . merkel was in damage-control mode as the week ended after stoiber 's remarks on eastern voters appeared to be seriously damaging her campaign .
stoiber provoked controversy earlier in the week after he characterized voters in the east as " frustrated " and questioned their judgment before general elections next month . merkel herself comes from eastern germany , but despite this , her party , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , is currently performing worse in the east than in the west . in an interview with zdf television late on thursday , merkel spoke of the 35 years she spent living under communism in east germany , and stressed that she understood the concerns of the people in the region .
she added that she wanted to be chancellor of all germans . " we will fight for every vote , but we definitely don ’ t need to insult voters , " merkel said .
" every move - intentional or not - which splits rather than unites germany is totally counterproductive . " slipping in the polls only a few weeks ago , the campaign for merkel and the cdu looked like clear sailing , with the conservatives enjoying a sizeable lead over chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- . but that lead has shrunk , leaving the cdu and their likely coalition partner , the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , defending a slim majority of 49 percent , barely ahead of the combined vote of the other parties strong enough to enter parliament . eastern voters could be forgiven for feeling slighted by the conservatives .
commenting last week on the shocking case of a german woman from the east charged with murdering nine of her newborn babies , senior conservative jörg schönbohm said the east german dictatorship had left easterners lacking in a sense of responsibility and morality . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder hopes to profit from the conservatives ' mistakes stoiber 's comment this week that " those who are frustrated ca n't be allowed to determine the fate of germany " only added insult to injury .
and it may end up helping schröder , who is bidding for a third term for his coalition of social democrats and greens . " his remark is not only tasteless , but shows a lack of democratic respect , " said schröder .
" stoiber 's comment cements division and insults people who have had to live under harder conditions than we in the west . " the left party , led by the charismatic former finance minister oskar lafontaine , may also profit from the conservatives ' gaffes , seeing as this new party is currently leading the polls in the east with more than 30 percent . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de conservative gaffe enrages east germans germany 's first chancellor candidate from the east , angela merkel , ran into fresh electoral problems in the crucial ex-communist states thursday after a key ally bashed the region 's " frustrated " voters .

pfahls , who served as state secretary for defense from 1987 to 1992 , insisted that he had not done anything in return for the money .

his comments on eastern voters are being linked to the conservatives ' slide in the polls . merkel was in damage-control mode as the week ended after stoiber 's remarks on eastern voters appeared to be seriously damaging her campaign .
stoiber provoked controversy earlier in the week after he characterized voters in the east as " frustrated " and questioned their judgment before general elections next month . merkel herself comes from eastern germany , but despite this , her party , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , is currently performing worse in the east than in the west . in an interview with zdf television late on thursday , merkel spoke of the 35 years she spent living under communism in east germany , and stressed that she understood the concerns of the people in the region .
she added that she wanted to be chancellor of all germans . " we will fight for every vote , but we definitely don ’ t need to insult voters , " merkel said .
" every move - intentional or not - which splits rather than unites germany is totally counterproductive . " slipping in the polls only a few weeks ago , the campaign for merkel and the cdu looked like clear sailing , with the conservatives enjoying a sizeable lead over chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- . but that lead has shrunk , leaving the cdu and their likely coalition partner , the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , defending a slim majority of 49 percent , barely ahead of the combined vote of the other parties strong enough to enter parliament . eastern voters could be forgiven for feeling slighted by the conservatives .
commenting last week on the shocking case of a german woman from the east charged with murdering nine of her newborn babies , senior conservative jörg schönbohm said the east german dictatorship had left easterners lacking in a sense of responsibility and morality . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder hopes to profit from the conservatives ' mistakes stoiber 's comment this week that " those who are frustrated ca n't be allowed to determine the fate of germany " only added insult to injury .
and it may end up helping schröder , who is bidding for a third term for his coalition of social democrats and greens . " his remark is not only tasteless , but shows a lack of democratic respect , " said schröder .
" stoiber 's comment cements division and insults people who have had to live under harder conditions than we in the west . " the left party , led by the charismatic former finance minister oskar lafontaine , may also profit from the conservatives ' gaffes , seeing as this new party is currently leading the polls in the east with more than 30 percent . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de conservative gaffe enrages east germans germany 's first chancellor candidate from the east , angela merkel , ran into fresh electoral problems in the crucial ex-communist states thursday after a key ally bashed the region 's " frustrated " voters .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 12.08.2005 european cities face future heatwaves großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as temperatures soar in future , europeans will struggle to keep cool a new study by the wwf environmental organization shows that temperatures in european cities are on the rise with more extreme weather predicted in the increasingly sticky future . although many europeans are wearing jumpers in august this year , the fact remains that temperatures across central europe are continuing to rise .
according to a study by the environmental organization wwf , european cities are set to sizzle in the future . in terms of summer temperature increases , madrid is number one .
no other city in europe has seen such dramatic rises than the spanish capital over the last 30 years .
on average , madrid has seen temperatures climb by 2.2 degrees celsius -lrb- 35.96 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- in the last three decades .
trailing , and sweating , not so far behind come london , lisbon , luxembourg and athens . for londoners , more used to the " pea soup " mists rolling down the thames with a foggy chill , the rise in temperature may initially be gratefully received . that is until global temperatures rise to such an extent that the polar ice caps melt ; either causing sea levels to rise which in turn could lead to the thames flooding or a dilution of the gulf stream by fresh water which would eventually stop the warm flow to the british isles leading to a possible ice age . spain and portugal facing droughts , crop failures while the long term effect on london could be potentially disastrous , both madrid and lisbon are experiencing problems , although less apocalyptic , right now .
summers in the spanish and portuguese cities have been getting hotter and hotter leading to droughts and water shortages . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the reservoirs are empty , many fields and crops have dried up and forest areas are tinder-box dry , leading to increasingly common seasonal infernos .
both countries have requested help from the eu as crop start to fail . climatologists have been warning for years that europe must prepare for more and more extreme weather conditions and events such as drought , violent storms and floods . human industrialization to blame , says wwf martin hiller , climate spokesperson for the wwf , dismisses claims by some that these conditions are caused by variations in natural habitats around the globe .
" the majority of scientists agree that humans play the determining role , " he said . " in more than 200 years of industrialization , the co2 level in the atmosphere has increased by a third of its original value .
this is caused by humans , there is no natural process . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while humans are reaping what they sow in terms of increased heat and its effects , fauna and flora are suffering too and in many cases are being hardest hit .
the melting of the arctic ice flows are reducing the natural habitat and hunting grounds of polar bears while soaring temperatures could demand too much of fragile ecological systems like coral reefs . but the human population is also starting to see devastating effects .

according to a study by the environmental organization wwf , european cities are set to sizzle in the future . in terms of summer temperature increases , madrid is number one .
no other city in europe has seen such dramatic rises than the spanish capital over the last 30 years .
on average , madrid has seen temperatures climb by 2.2 degrees celsius -lrb- 35.96 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- in the last three decades .
trailing , and sweating , not so far behind come london , lisbon , luxembourg and athens . for londoners , more used to the " pea soup " mists rolling down the thames with a foggy chill , the rise in temperature may initially be gratefully received . that is until global temperatures rise to such an extent that the polar ice caps melt ; either causing sea levels to rise which in turn could lead to the thames flooding or a dilution of the gulf stream by fresh water which would eventually stop the warm flow to the british isles leading to a possible ice age . spain and portugal facing droughts , crop failures while the long term effect on london could be potentially disastrous , both madrid and lisbon are experiencing problems , although less apocalyptic , right now .
summers in the spanish and portuguese cities have been getting hotter and hotter leading to droughts and water shortages . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the reservoirs are empty , many fields and crops have dried up and forest areas are tinder-box dry , leading to increasingly common seasonal infernos .
both countries have requested help from the eu as crop start to fail . climatologists have been warning for years that europe must prepare for more and more extreme weather conditions and events such as drought , violent storms and floods . human industrialization to blame , says wwf martin hiller , climate spokesperson for the wwf , dismisses claims by some that these conditions are caused by variations in natural habitats around the globe .
" the majority of scientists agree that humans play the determining role , " he said . " in more than 200 years of industrialization , the co2 level in the atmosphere has increased by a third of its original value .
this is caused by humans , there is no natural process . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while humans are reaping what they sow in terms of increased heat and its effects , fauna and flora are suffering too and in many cases are being hardest hit .
the melting of the arctic ice flows are reducing the natural habitat and hunting grounds of polar bears while soaring temperatures could demand too much of fragile ecological systems like coral reefs . but the human population is also starting to see devastating effects .
" for example , at the heat wave of 2003 , " martin hiller warned .
" altogether around 40,000 people died as a result . " the future 's bright , the future 's scorching in the last century , the worldwide average temperature rose by about 0.6 degrees celsius ; in europe by about 1 degree .
scientists believe that the human race has seen nothing yet and that the biggest hike in temperatures is yet to come . scientists at the un 's intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- predict that we can expect a rise of between 1.4 to 5.8 degrees celsius . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this will lead to more intense summers for european cities and , according to the wwf , not only more dramatic environmental effects but also economic ones .
as the heat rises , more people will turn to their fans and air-conditioning systems to cope . it seems to be a vicious circle : more heat , more power consumption , more greenhouse gas and again more heat . alternative power to break the cycle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the answer could lie with renewable energy sources like wind , water and biomass , something electricity companies must consider in the future , the wwf demands .

the ruhr valley will be transfixed by dortmund 's clash with rivals schalke .
in nearby leverkusen , champions bayern munich face bayer 04 . ever since germans first took a leather ball and started booting it into a net , the two ruhr valley clubs , dortmund and schalke from neighboring gelsenkirchen have displayed their disdain for each other on the pitch .
the two ruhrpott rivals have met 126 times in total , 66 of those in the bundesliga .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : being a borussia dortmund fan is n't just a run-of-the-mill hobby fans in bvb yellow and schalke royal blue live to see this game . and the passion always makes its way from the terraces to the pitch .
schalke coach ralf rangnick 's troop must play in the unfriendly confines of the westfalen stadium but their fortunes there have been particularly good in the recent past .
schalke have not lost in the last six encounters in front of a regularly sold out 70,000 capacity in dortmund 's cauldron arena .
" in the last few years we have looked pretty good in dortmund .
i am assuming that this time it will be the same , " schalke goalkeeper frank rost told sport bild .
in the arena aufschalke on may 14 , dortmund broke a 12-game winless streak , topping off a tremendous comeback in the second half of the season .
both clubs value the rivalry and use it as a catapult for success in the bundesliga .
bvb need the boost more than schalke , coming away with a tie in their first match and having not reached the uefa cup after crashing out of the intertoto cup in the summer .
bayern meets bayer coach felix magath probably has a bone to pick with leverkusen .
last season in his first appearance as munich coach in the bayarena , his team got pasted 4-1 .
naturally , it was just a small hurdle in their march to the league championship .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two bayern players -lrb- red -rrb- clamp down on a gladbach opponent in the first week revenge may be on magath 's mind , but only far , far at the back .
the big controversy for the team , and there is almost always one at bayern munich , is the storm surrounding midfielder michael ballack .
there 's no lack of column inches being devoted to the subject of whether the germany captain is out of favor or not .
magath , not a man of many words , has been quiet , saying that all 23 men on the squad are both starters and substitutes .
words that might confuse some soccer players - but it 's doubtful that michael ballack thinks he is a substitute .
leverkusen started their campaign with an impressive effort against frankfurt last week , cruising to a 4-1 victory .
and could that be repeated ?
" we have the quality , " bayer midfielder bernd schneider told kicker magazine .

"
renate künast champions made in germany the green party 's renate künast was accused of protectionism after her opening statements of the election campaign urged voters to buy german products .
in reality , quality rather than origin matters most to consumers . in germany , the social democrat-green coalition is fighting for its political life in the coming federal election .
some politicians are championing unusual policies in their attempts to boost their parties ' popularity with the electorate .
consumer protection minister renate künast is one . künast has positioned herself on the side of german manufacturers and by doing so has also placed herself in the cross hairs of the media .
proclaiming her allegiance and support for german products , the green party minister appeared in the popular sunday newspaper bild am sonntag to urge her compatriots to buy domestically produced goods and help protect the jobs of fellow germans . the move backfired and künast was accused of protectionism .
in an attempt to calm the stormy waters , a government statement attempted to spin the story into something a little more palatable .
künast was not calling for a boycott of foreign goods , it claimed , but for an environment where workers ' rights are upheld and child labor abroad is not rewarded . but what do the consumers of germany think about künast 's rallying call to " buy german ? " cheap goods flooding german market bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : digging deeper past the ill-conceived initial rant , one finds a central argument to the minister 's call , one which has been a matter of debate for years : the trend toward discount products , especially food .
the no-frills product ranges have come under fire mainly due to the fact that they are produced in other countries where labor costs are cheaper but sold in germany . but does the consumer really have the choice to support german products ? in the bonn branch of the nationwide department store chain kaufhof , an investigation into the country of origin of most of the clothing available there reveals an overwhelmingly international trend .
labels on trousers , t-shirts , belts and hats disclose many different origins : made in china , made in bangladesh , made in turkey and made in romania .
not one says made in germany . moving to another floor , the story is the same .
even the world famous steiff animals , cuddly toys associated with high-quality german manufacturing processes , carry the label : " produced in china under quality control of steiff germany " . " made in germany " not the whole story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the consumer generally does not have the possibility to find out where the product has been produced , " says holger brackemann from german standards watchdog stiftung warentest .
" the famous ' made in germany ' label , that they may find on textiles and other products , may not be the whole truth , that it may not have been produced here from the first through to the last manufacturing step . " the government 's statement that künast was looking to prevent worker exploitation and child labor in foreign countries by urging germans to buy locally produced , in theory , is a good example of trying to kill two birds with one stone .
on the one hand , promoting german goods is a tick for trying to protect jobs at home while trying to put pressure on countries that use child labor is stab at promoting an ethical foreign policy . german consumers want quality items bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but do german consumers know about the origins of their products or whether ethical practices were used in their production ?
do they even care ? when asked if she takes any notice of where products are produced , one shopper in bonn replied : " no , not at all . "
another added : " i shop for quality .
quality goods not only come from germany .
and germany makes a lot of rubbish as well . " another shopper said : " i look first at the quality and then at the price , and then if i decide if buying this is worthwhile , then i get it .
the country of origin does n't really feature . " " the argument about child labor is an important one , " says one man .
" but they must also earn their money .
not buying the products may actually endanger that . " it seems that in this election year , the issue will not be where the products come from but whether or not consumers will have enough money in their pockets to buy anything . christoph hasselbach -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de is " made in germany " losing its luster ?

after a nominal appearance against bayern in the first week , he wants to prove he can carry , or at least help carry , coach horst köppel to success .

the striker has scored 11 times in 11 matches against the northern german side .

this week , they can make kaiserlautern 's michael henke second game as a head coach as sour as the first one .
henke , longtime assistant to ottmar hitzfeld during his reign at bayern munich , has acquired a side in turmoil and watched in frustration as lautern surrendered a 1-0 lead to schalke , eventually losing 2-1 .
in hanover , ewald lienen led the squad to an outstanding 2004-05 campaign .
last week , they showed it was n't a fluke coming down from 2-0 deficit to tie with berlin .
they must travel south to nuremberg where they have had little success , only winning twice in ten matches .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 12.08.2005 european cities face future heatwaves großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as temperatures soar in future , europeans will struggle to keep cool a new study by the wwf environmental organization shows that temperatures in european cities are on the rise with more extreme weather predicted in the increasingly sticky future . although many europeans are wearing jumpers in august this year , the fact remains that temperatures across central europe are continuing to rise .
according to a study by the environmental organization wwf , european cities are set to sizzle in the future . in terms of summer temperature increases , madrid is number one .
no other city in europe has seen such dramatic rises than the spanish capital over the last 30 years .
on average , madrid has seen temperatures climb by 2.2 degrees celsius -lrb- 35.96 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- in the last three decades .
trailing , and sweating , not so far behind come london , lisbon , luxembourg and athens . for londoners , more used to the " pea soup " mists rolling down the thames with a foggy chill , the rise in temperature may initially be gratefully received . that is until global temperatures rise to such an extent that the polar ice caps melt ; either causing sea levels to rise which in turn could lead to the thames flooding or a dilution of the gulf stream by fresh water which would eventually stop the warm flow to the british isles leading to a possible ice age . spain and portugal facing droughts , crop failures while the long term effect on london could be potentially disastrous , both madrid and lisbon are experiencing problems , although less apocalyptic , right now .
summers in the spanish and portuguese cities have been getting hotter and hotter leading to droughts and water shortages . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the reservoirs are empty , many fields and crops have dried up and forest areas are tinder-box dry , leading to increasingly common seasonal infernos .
both countries have requested help from the eu as crop start to fail . climatologists have been warning for years that europe must prepare for more and more extreme weather conditions and events such as drought , violent storms and floods . human industrialization to blame , says wwf martin hiller , climate spokesperson for the wwf , dismisses claims by some that these conditions are caused by variations in natural habitats around the globe .
" the majority of scientists agree that humans play the determining role , " he said . " in more than 200 years of industrialization , the co2 level in the atmosphere has increased by a third of its original value .
this is caused by humans , there is no natural process . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while humans are reaping what they sow in terms of increased heat and its effects , fauna and flora are suffering too and in many cases are being hardest hit .
the melting of the arctic ice flows are reducing the natural habitat and hunting grounds of polar bears while soaring temperatures could demand too much of fragile ecological systems like coral reefs . but the human population is also starting to see devastating effects .
" for example , at the heat wave of 2003 , " martin hiller warned .
" altogether around 40,000 people died as a result . " the future 's bright , the future 's scorching in the last century , the worldwide average temperature rose by about 0.6 degrees celsius ; in europe by about 1 degree .
scientists believe that the human race has seen nothing yet and that the biggest hike in temperatures is yet to come . scientists at the un 's intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- predict that we can expect a rise of between 1.4 to 5.8 degrees celsius . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this will lead to more intense summers for european cities and , according to the wwf , not only more dramatic environmental effects but also economic ones .
as the heat rises , more people will turn to their fans and air-conditioning systems to cope . it seems to be a vicious circle : more heat , more power consumption , more greenhouse gas and again more heat . alternative power to break the cycle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the answer could lie with renewable energy sources like wind , water and biomass , something electricity companies must consider in the future , the wwf demands .
while such alternatives are not entirely innocent in regards to climate change , they do , however , create less greenhouse gases than coal or oil . change can begin at home , martin hiller says , a fact that is often overlooked .
one could simply save up to 30 percent more energy by using electrical devices more wisely .
also , modern devices such as computers and air-conditioning systems need much less energy than their older incarnations . this , at least , would be the first step in breaking the vicious circle of climate change . johannes beck -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the cost of environmental pollution germany may be an eco-friendly place , but support for the environment does come at a price - a fact that some organizations are trying to disprove .

spd presents election manifesto germany -pipe- 12.08.2005 getting the gray vote großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a powerful target group senior citizens make up a third of the german electorate and are being wooed by all the parties .
but when it comes to one of the issues that concerns them - pensions - they do n't think any one party has the answers . the elderly are an important target group in september 's election , but none of the parties have easy answers for the issues they 're most concerned about - pensions and the rising cost of health care and medication . the current government coalition of social democrats and greens introduced tough reforms which have also affected pensioners , but given germany 's massive public debt , the opposition parties would also have to make cutbacks if they came to power . raising the retirement age bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the discussion about the difficulty in funding germany 's pension system in future again took center stage this week following a suggestion by the president of the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- , klaus f. zimmermann , to raise the age of retirement to 70 from its current 65 . political parties , unions and pension insurers have all heaped criticism on the idea .
economics minister wolfgang clement called zimmermann 's suggestion " infeasible and excessive . "
he said he supports the suggestion made by a special government commission of experts , which would see the retirement age gradually raised to 67 . such suggestions have caused some older spd supporters to switch their allegiance to the left party , the new alliance of the reformed communist party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- and left-wing groups .
two-thirds of left party members are over 60 .
the senior citizens ' working groups meet regularly and carry authority .
their main recruits are elderly people in eastern germany . left party gaining senior support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left party is attracting senior voters " i believe that a very specific problem for older people in the east is that not only do they have the impression that the contributions they have made to society are not valued , but there is also proof that it is so , " said ernst bienert of the left party 's senior citizens group . seniors who remain loyal to the spd are also hitting the campaign trail , in part to refute the notion that only the spd is to blame for the pensions crisis and other social crises facing the country . " all of these developments , which resulted from compromises made during the committee stage , were frequently laid at the door of the spd , and we have to explain that and tell people how it really happened , " said hermann bokelmann of the spd 's 60-plus group . there has been no talk of cutting pensions in the election campaigns as yet , but it 's clear that future generations of pensioners will receive barely more than the level of social welfare from the government .
in comparison to those future generations , today 's pensioners are well-off .
nevertheless , opinion polls suggest that most pensioners want to see a change in government . up to 60 percent plan to vote for the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , even though they do n't believe that leader angela merkel has the answers to their problems . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de east germans disappointed by reunification east germany in 1989 was in the midst of a peaceful revolution .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 12.08.2005 european cities face future heatwaves großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as temperatures soar in future , europeans will struggle to keep cool a new study by the wwf environmental organization shows that temperatures in european cities are on the rise with more extreme weather predicted in the increasingly sticky future . although many europeans are wearing jumpers in august this year , the fact remains that temperatures across central europe are continuing to rise .
according to a study by the environmental organization wwf , european cities are set to sizzle in the future . in terms of summer temperature increases , madrid is number one .
no other city in europe has seen such dramatic rises than the spanish capital over the last 30 years .
on average , madrid has seen temperatures climb by 2.2 degrees celsius -lrb- 35.96 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- in the last three decades .
trailing , and sweating , not so far behind come london , lisbon , luxembourg and athens . for londoners , more used to the " pea soup " mists rolling down the thames with a foggy chill , the rise in temperature may initially be gratefully received . that is until global temperatures rise to such an extent that the polar ice caps melt ; either causing sea levels to rise which in turn could lead to the thames flooding or a dilution of the gulf stream by fresh water which would eventually stop the warm flow to the british isles leading to a possible ice age . spain and portugal facing droughts , crop failures while the long term effect on london could be potentially disastrous , both madrid and lisbon are experiencing problems , although less apocalyptic , right now .
summers in the spanish and portuguese cities have been getting hotter and hotter leading to droughts and water shortages . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the reservoirs are empty , many fields and crops have dried up and forest areas are tinder-box dry , leading to increasingly common seasonal infernos .
both countries have requested help from the eu as crop start to fail . climatologists have been warning for years that europe must prepare for more and more extreme weather conditions and events such as drought , violent storms and floods . human industrialization to blame , says wwf martin hiller , climate spokesperson for the wwf , dismisses claims by some that these conditions are caused by variations in natural habitats around the globe .
" the majority of scientists agree that humans play the determining role , " he said . " in more than 200 years of industrialization , the co2 level in the atmosphere has increased by a third of its original value .
this is caused by humans , there is no natural process . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while humans are reaping what they sow in terms of increased heat and its effects , fauna and flora are suffering too and in many cases are being hardest hit .
the melting of the arctic ice flows are reducing the natural habitat and hunting grounds of polar bears while soaring temperatures could demand too much of fragile ecological systems like coral reefs . but the human population is also starting to see devastating effects .
" for example , at the heat wave of 2003 , " martin hiller warned .
" altogether around 40,000 people died as a result . " the future 's bright , the future 's scorching in the last century , the worldwide average temperature rose by about 0.6 degrees celsius ; in europe by about 1 degree .
scientists believe that the human race has seen nothing yet and that the biggest hike in temperatures is yet to come . scientists at the un 's intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- predict that we can expect a rise of between 1.4 to 5.8 degrees celsius . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this will lead to more intense summers for european cities and , according to the wwf , not only more dramatic environmental effects but also economic ones .
as the heat rises , more people will turn to their fans and air-conditioning systems to cope . it seems to be a vicious circle : more heat , more power consumption , more greenhouse gas and again more heat . alternative power to break the cycle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the answer could lie with renewable energy sources like wind , water and biomass , something electricity companies must consider in the future , the wwf demands .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 12.08.2005 european cities face future heatwaves großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as temperatures soar in future , europeans will struggle to keep cool a new study by the wwf environmental organization shows that temperatures in european cities are on the rise with more extreme weather predicted in the increasingly sticky future . although many europeans are wearing jumpers in august this year , the fact remains that temperatures across central europe are continuing to rise .
according to a study by the environmental organization wwf , european cities are set to sizzle in the future . in terms of summer temperature increases , madrid is number one .
no other city in europe has seen such dramatic rises than the spanish capital over the last 30 years .
on average , madrid has seen temperatures climb by 2.2 degrees celsius -lrb- 35.96 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- in the last three decades .
trailing , and sweating , not so far behind come london , lisbon , luxembourg and athens . for londoners , more used to the " pea soup " mists rolling down the thames with a foggy chill , the rise in temperature may initially be gratefully received . that is until global temperatures rise to such an extent that the polar ice caps melt ; either causing sea levels to rise which in turn could lead to the thames flooding or a dilution of the gulf stream by fresh water which would eventually stop the warm flow to the british isles leading to a possible ice age . spain and portugal facing droughts , crop failures while the long term effect on london could be potentially disastrous , both madrid and lisbon are experiencing problems , although less apocalyptic , right now .
summers in the spanish and portuguese cities have been getting hotter and hotter leading to droughts and water shortages . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the reservoirs are empty , many fields and crops have dried up and forest areas are tinder-box dry , leading to increasingly common seasonal infernos .
both countries have requested help from the eu as crop start to fail . climatologists have been warning for years that europe must prepare for more and more extreme weather conditions and events such as drought , violent storms and floods . human industrialization to blame , says wwf martin hiller , climate spokesperson for the wwf , dismisses claims by some that these conditions are caused by variations in natural habitats around the globe .
" the majority of scientists agree that humans play the determining role , " he said . " in more than 200 years of industrialization , the co2 level in the atmosphere has increased by a third of its original value .
this is caused by humans , there is no natural process . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while humans are reaping what they sow in terms of increased heat and its effects , fauna and flora are suffering too and in many cases are being hardest hit .
the melting of the arctic ice flows are reducing the natural habitat and hunting grounds of polar bears while soaring temperatures could demand too much of fragile ecological systems like coral reefs . but the human population is also starting to see devastating effects .
" for example , at the heat wave of 2003 , " martin hiller warned .
" altogether around 40,000 people died as a result . " the future 's bright , the future 's scorching in the last century , the worldwide average temperature rose by about 0.6 degrees celsius ; in europe by about 1 degree .
scientists believe that the human race has seen nothing yet and that the biggest hike in temperatures is yet to come . scientists at the un 's intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- predict that we can expect a rise of between 1.4 to 5.8 degrees celsius . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this will lead to more intense summers for european cities and , according to the wwf , not only more dramatic environmental effects but also economic ones .
as the heat rises , more people will turn to their fans and air-conditioning systems to cope . it seems to be a vicious circle : more heat , more power consumption , more greenhouse gas and again more heat . alternative power to break the cycle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the answer could lie with renewable energy sources like wind , water and biomass , something electricity companies must consider in the future , the wwf demands .
while such alternatives are not entirely innocent in regards to climate change , they do , however , create less greenhouse gases than coal or oil . change can begin at home , martin hiller says , a fact that is often overlooked .
one could simply save up to 30 percent more energy by using electrical devices more wisely .

renate künast champions made in germany the green party 's renate künast was accused of protectionism after her opening statements of the election campaign urged voters to buy german products .
in reality , quality rather than origin matters most to consumers . in germany , the social democrat-green coalition is fighting for its political life in the coming federal election .
some politicians are championing unusual policies in their attempts to boost their parties ' popularity with the electorate .
consumer protection minister renate künast is one . künast has positioned herself on the side of german manufacturers and by doing so has also placed herself in the cross hairs of the media .
proclaiming her allegiance and support for german products , the green party minister appeared in the popular sunday newspaper bild am sonntag to urge her compatriots to buy domestically produced goods and help protect the jobs of fellow germans . the move backfired and künast was accused of protectionism .
in an attempt to calm the stormy waters , a government statement attempted to spin the story into something a little more palatable .
künast was not calling for a boycott of foreign goods , it claimed , but for an environment where workers ' rights are upheld and child labor abroad is not rewarded . but what do the consumers of germany think about künast 's rallying call to " buy german ? " cheap goods flooding german market bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : digging deeper past the ill-conceived initial rant , one finds a central argument to the minister 's call , one which has been a matter of debate for years : the trend toward discount products , especially food .
the no-frills product ranges have come under fire mainly due to the fact that they are produced in other countries where labor costs are cheaper but sold in germany . but does the consumer really have the choice to support german products ? in the bonn branch of the nationwide department store chain kaufhof , an investigation into the country of origin of most of the clothing available there reveals an overwhelmingly international trend .
labels on trousers , t-shirts , belts and hats disclose many different origins : made in china , made in bangladesh , made in turkey and made in romania .
not one says made in germany . moving to another floor , the story is the same .
even the world famous steiff animals , cuddly toys associated with high-quality german manufacturing processes , carry the label : " produced in china under quality control of steiff germany " . " made in germany " not the whole story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the consumer generally does not have the possibility to find out where the product has been produced , " says holger brackemann from german standards watchdog stiftung warentest .
" the famous ' made in germany ' label , that they may find on textiles and other products , may not be the whole truth , that it may not have been produced here from the first through to the last manufacturing step . " the government 's statement that künast was looking to prevent worker exploitation and child labor in foreign countries by urging germans to buy locally produced , in theory , is a good example of trying to kill two birds with one stone .
on the one hand , promoting german goods is a tick for trying to protect jobs at home while trying to put pressure on countries that use child labor is stab at promoting an ethical foreign policy . german consumers want quality items bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but do german consumers know about the origins of their products or whether ethical practices were used in their production ?
do they even care ? when asked if she takes any notice of where products are produced , one shopper in bonn replied : " no , not at all . "
another added : " i shop for quality .
quality goods not only come from germany .
and germany makes a lot of rubbish as well . " another shopper said : " i look first at the quality and then at the price , and then if i decide if buying this is worthwhile , then i get it .
the country of origin does n't really feature . " " the argument about child labor is an important one , " says one man .
" but they must also earn their money .
not buying the products may actually endanger that .

the ruhr valley will be transfixed by dortmund 's clash with rivals schalke .
in nearby leverkusen , champions bayern munich face bayer 04 . ever since germans first took a leather ball and started booting it into a net , the two ruhr valley clubs , dortmund and schalke from neighboring gelsenkirchen have displayed their disdain for each other on the pitch .
the two ruhrpott rivals have met 126 times in total , 66 of those in the bundesliga .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : being a borussia dortmund fan is n't just a run-of-the-mill hobby fans in bvb yellow and schalke royal blue live to see this game . and the passion always makes its way from the terraces to the pitch .
schalke coach ralf rangnick 's troop must play in the unfriendly confines of the westfalen stadium but their fortunes there have been particularly good in the recent past .
schalke have not lost in the last six encounters in front of a regularly sold out 70,000 capacity in dortmund 's cauldron arena .
" in the last few years we have looked pretty good in dortmund .
i am assuming that this time it will be the same , " schalke goalkeeper frank rost told sport bild .
in the arena aufschalke on may 14 , dortmund broke a 12-game winless streak , topping off a tremendous comeback in the second half of the season .
both clubs value the rivalry and use it as a catapult for success in the bundesliga .
bvb need the boost more than schalke , coming away with a tie in their first match and having not reached the uefa cup after crashing out of the intertoto cup in the summer .
bayern meets bayer coach felix magath probably has a bone to pick with leverkusen .
last season in his first appearance as munich coach in the bayarena , his team got pasted 4-1 .
naturally , it was just a small hurdle in their march to the league championship .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two bayern players -lrb- red -rrb- clamp down on a gladbach opponent in the first week revenge may be on magath 's mind , but only far , far at the back .
the big controversy for the team , and there is almost always one at bayern munich , is the storm surrounding midfielder michael ballack .
there 's no lack of column inches being devoted to the subject of whether the germany captain is out of favor or not .
magath , not a man of many words , has been quiet , saying that all 23 men on the squad are both starters and substitutes .
words that might confuse some soccer players - but it 's doubtful that michael ballack thinks he is a substitute .
leverkusen started their campaign with an impressive effort against frankfurt last week , cruising to a 4-1 victory .
and could that be repeated ?
" we have the quality , " bayer midfielder bernd schneider told kicker magazine .
the contenders with easier assignments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg 's rafael van der vaart should lead with his head one of the dark horses in the bundesliga this season must be hamburg .
they have brought in quality personnel , most notably dutch international rafael van der vaart and on saturday , thomas doll 's club gets the pleasure of travelling to bielefeld , the one side they have had the most success against in their history .
the bielefeld defense resembled a sieve in a 5-2 defeat against bremen , holes that must be stopped soon or coach thomas von heesen will be battling against a rapdly sinking ship .
hertha berlin face the new boys from frankfurt .
soccer followers always expect a lot from the capital city team , but berlin has on the whole been disappointing .

proclaiming her allegiance and support for german products , the green party minister appeared in the popular sunday newspaper bild am sonntag to urge her compatriots to buy domestically produced goods and help protect the jobs of fellow germans . the move backfired and künast was accused of protectionism .
in an attempt to calm the stormy waters , a government statement attempted to spin the story into something a little more palatable .
künast was not calling for a boycott of foreign goods , it claimed , but for an environment where workers ' rights are upheld and child labor abroad is not rewarded . but what do the consumers of germany think about künast 's rallying call to " buy german ? " cheap goods flooding german market bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : digging deeper past the ill-conceived initial rant , one finds a central argument to the minister 's call , one which has been a matter of debate for years : the trend toward discount products , especially food .
the no-frills product ranges have come under fire mainly due to the fact that they are produced in other countries where labor costs are cheaper but sold in germany . but does the consumer really have the choice to support german products ? in the bonn branch of the nationwide department store chain kaufhof , an investigation into the country of origin of most of the clothing available there reveals an overwhelmingly international trend .
labels on trousers , t-shirts , belts and hats disclose many different origins : made in china , made in bangladesh , made in turkey and made in romania .
not one says made in germany . moving to another floor , the story is the same .
even the world famous steiff animals , cuddly toys associated with high-quality german manufacturing processes , carry the label : " produced in china under quality control of steiff germany " . " made in germany " not the whole story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the consumer generally does not have the possibility to find out where the product has been produced , " says holger brackemann from german standards watchdog stiftung warentest .
" the famous ' made in germany ' label , that they may find on textiles and other products , may not be the whole truth , that it may not have been produced here from the first through to the last manufacturing step . " the government 's statement that künast was looking to prevent worker exploitation and child labor in foreign countries by urging germans to buy locally produced , in theory , is a good example of trying to kill two birds with one stone .
on the one hand , promoting german goods is a tick for trying to protect jobs at home while trying to put pressure on countries that use child labor is stab at promoting an ethical foreign policy . german consumers want quality items bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but do german consumers know about the origins of their products or whether ethical practices were used in their production ?
do they even care ? when asked if she takes any notice of where products are produced , one shopper in bonn replied : " no , not at all . "
another added : " i shop for quality .
quality goods not only come from germany .
and germany makes a lot of rubbish as well . " another shopper said : " i look first at the quality and then at the price , and then if i decide if buying this is worthwhile , then i get it .
the country of origin does n't really feature . " " the argument about child labor is an important one , " says one man .
" but they must also earn their money .
not buying the products may actually endanger that . " it seems that in this election year , the issue will not be where the products come from but whether or not consumers will have enough money in their pockets to buy anything . christoph hasselbach -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de is " made in germany " losing its luster ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 12.08.2005 european cities face future heatwaves großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as temperatures soar in future , europeans will struggle to keep cool a new study by the wwf environmental organization shows that temperatures in european cities are on the rise with more extreme weather predicted in the increasingly sticky future . although many europeans are wearing jumpers in august this year , the fact remains that temperatures across central europe are continuing to rise .
according to a study by the environmental organization wwf , european cities are set to sizzle in the future . in terms of summer temperature increases , madrid is number one .
no other city in europe has seen such dramatic rises than the spanish capital over the last 30 years .
on average , madrid has seen temperatures climb by 2.2 degrees celsius -lrb- 35.96 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- in the last three decades .
trailing , and sweating , not so far behind come london , lisbon , luxembourg and athens . for londoners , more used to the " pea soup " mists rolling down the thames with a foggy chill , the rise in temperature may initially be gratefully received . that is until global temperatures rise to such an extent that the polar ice caps melt ; either causing sea levels to rise which in turn could lead to the thames flooding or a dilution of the gulf stream by fresh water which would eventually stop the warm flow to the british isles leading to a possible ice age . spain and portugal facing droughts , crop failures while the long term effect on london could be potentially disastrous , both madrid and lisbon are experiencing problems , although less apocalyptic , right now .
summers in the spanish and portuguese cities have been getting hotter and hotter leading to droughts and water shortages . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the reservoirs are empty , many fields and crops have dried up and forest areas are tinder-box dry , leading to increasingly common seasonal infernos .
both countries have requested help from the eu as crop start to fail . climatologists have been warning for years that europe must prepare for more and more extreme weather conditions and events such as drought , violent storms and floods . human industrialization to blame , says wwf martin hiller , climate spokesperson for the wwf , dismisses claims by some that these conditions are caused by variations in natural habitats around the globe .
" the majority of scientists agree that humans play the determining role , " he said . " in more than 200 years of industrialization , the co2 level in the atmosphere has increased by a third of its original value .
this is caused by humans , there is no natural process . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while humans are reaping what they sow in terms of increased heat and its effects , fauna and flora are suffering too and in many cases are being hardest hit .
the melting of the arctic ice flows are reducing the natural habitat and hunting grounds of polar bears while soaring temperatures could demand too much of fragile ecological systems like coral reefs . but the human population is also starting to see devastating effects .
" for example , at the heat wave of 2003 , " martin hiller warned .
" altogether around 40,000 people died as a result . " the future 's bright , the future 's scorching in the last century , the worldwide average temperature rose by about 0.6 degrees celsius ; in europe by about 1 degree .
scientists believe that the human race has seen nothing yet and that the biggest hike in temperatures is yet to come . scientists at the un 's intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- predict that we can expect a rise of between 1.4 to 5.8 degrees celsius . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this will lead to more intense summers for european cities and , according to the wwf , not only more dramatic environmental effects but also economic ones .
as the heat rises , more people will turn to their fans and air-conditioning systems to cope . it seems to be a vicious circle : more heat , more power consumption , more greenhouse gas and again more heat . alternative power to break the cycle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the answer could lie with renewable energy sources like wind , water and biomass , something electricity companies must consider in the future , the wwf demands .
while such alternatives are not entirely innocent in regards to climate change , they do , however , create less greenhouse gases than coal or oil . change can begin at home , martin hiller says , a fact that is often overlooked .
one could simply save up to 30 percent more energy by using electrical devices more wisely .
also , modern devices such as computers and air-conditioning systems need much less energy than their older incarnations . this , at least , would be the first step in breaking the vicious circle of climate change . johannes beck -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the cost of environmental pollution germany may be an eco-friendly place , but support for the environment does come at a price - a fact that some organizations are trying to disprove .

his comments on eastern voters are being linked to the conservatives ' slide in the polls . merkel was in damage-control mode as the week ended after stoiber 's remarks on eastern voters appeared to be seriously damaging her campaign .
stoiber provoked controversy earlier in the week after he characterized voters in the east as " frustrated " and questioned their judgment before general elections next month . merkel herself comes from eastern germany , but despite this , her party , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , is currently performing worse in the east than in the west . in an interview with zdf television late on thursday , merkel spoke of the 35 years she spent living under communism in east germany , and stressed that she understood the concerns of the people in the region .
she added that she wanted to be chancellor of all germans . " we will fight for every vote , but we definitely don ’ t need to insult voters , " merkel said .
" every move - intentional or not - which splits rather than unites germany is totally counterproductive . " slipping in the polls only a few weeks ago , the campaign for merkel and the cdu looked like clear sailing , with the conservatives enjoying a sizeable lead over chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- . but that lead has shrunk , leaving the cdu and their likely coalition partner , the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , defending a slim majority of 49 percent , barely ahead of the combined vote of the other parties strong enough to enter parliament . eastern voters could be forgiven for feeling slighted by the conservatives .
commenting last week on the shocking case of a german woman from the east charged with murdering nine of her newborn babies , senior conservative jörg schönbohm said the east german dictatorship had left easterners lacking in a sense of responsibility and morality . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder hopes to profit from the conservatives ' mistakes stoiber 's comment this week that " those who are frustrated ca n't be allowed to determine the fate of germany " only added insult to injury .
and it may end up helping schröder , who is bidding for a third term for his coalition of social democrats and greens . " his remark is not only tasteless , but shows a lack of democratic respect , " said schröder .
" stoiber 's comment cements division and insults people who have had to live under harder conditions than we in the west . " the left party , led by the charismatic former finance minister oskar lafontaine , may also profit from the conservatives ' gaffes , seeing as this new party is currently leading the polls in the east with more than 30 percent . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de conservative gaffe enrages east germans germany 's first chancellor candidate from the east , angela merkel , ran into fresh electoral problems in the crucial ex-communist states thursday after a key ally bashed the region 's " frustrated " voters .

after a nominal appearance against bayern in the first week , he wants to prove he can carry , or at least help carry , coach horst köppel to success .
the coach should play him against wolfsburg .
the striker has scored 11 times in 11 matches against the northern german side .
an even dozen would look nicer .
wolfsburg coach , holger fach , gets to return to the club that fired him last season .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : duisburg -lrb- stripes -rrb- made life tough for stuttgart last week promoted-side duisburg ruined the return of giovanni trapattoni to the bundesliga as coach , pulling off a 1-1 draw against stuttgart .
this week , they can make kaiserlautern 's michael henke second game as a head coach as sour as the first one .
henke , longtime assistant to ottmar hitzfeld during his reign at bayern munich , has acquired a side in turmoil and watched in frustration as lautern surrendered a 1-0 lead to schalke , eventually losing 2-1 .
in hanover , ewald lienen led the squad to an outstanding 2004-05 campaign .
last week , they showed it was n't a fluke coming down from 2-0 deficit to tie with berlin .
they must travel south to nuremberg where they have had little success , only winning twice in ten matches .
for nuremberg , bad starts are the norm , having lost 3-0 to hamburg .
they have additional motivation this week with the 70th birthday of club president michael a. roth .
will that be enough though ?
sunday games feature top clubs against question marks current first-place side bremen face a nemesis in mainz .
it hardly seems likely that mainz , only in their second season ever in the bundesliga , would present problems for the northern germans , but last year bremen lost once and tied once against jürgen klopp 's " fun " soccer club .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a diamond in the rough , werder bremen bremen gave a desolate performance against basle in a champions league qualifier this week .
" i expect that we 'll come out much differently against mainz , " said team director klaus allofs .
cologne started their campaign after a one-year absence from the top division with a victory at home .
this week , they go on the road to stuttgart .
coach uwe rapolder has player problems due to injuries .

the ruhr valley will be transfixed by dortmund 's clash with rivals schalke .
in nearby leverkusen , champions bayern munich face bayer 04 . ever since germans first took a leather ball and started booting it into a net , the two ruhr valley clubs , dortmund and schalke from neighboring gelsenkirchen have displayed their disdain for each other on the pitch .
the two ruhrpott rivals have met 126 times in total , 66 of those in the bundesliga .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : being a borussia dortmund fan is n't just a run-of-the-mill hobby fans in bvb yellow and schalke royal blue live to see this game . and the passion always makes its way from the terraces to the pitch .
schalke coach ralf rangnick 's troop must play in the unfriendly confines of the westfalen stadium but their fortunes there have been particularly good in the recent past .
schalke have not lost in the last six encounters in front of a regularly sold out 70,000 capacity in dortmund 's cauldron arena .
" in the last few years we have looked pretty good in dortmund .
i am assuming that this time it will be the same , " schalke goalkeeper frank rost told sport bild .
in the arena aufschalke on may 14 , dortmund broke a 12-game winless streak , topping off a tremendous comeback in the second half of the season .
both clubs value the rivalry and use it as a catapult for success in the bundesliga .
bvb need the boost more than schalke , coming away with a tie in their first match and having not reached the uefa cup after crashing out of the intertoto cup in the summer .
bayern meets bayer coach felix magath probably has a bone to pick with leverkusen .
last season in his first appearance as munich coach in the bayarena , his team got pasted 4-1 .
naturally , it was just a small hurdle in their march to the league championship .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two bayern players -lrb- red -rrb- clamp down on a gladbach opponent in the first week revenge may be on magath 's mind , but only far , far at the back .
the big controversy for the team , and there is almost always one at bayern munich , is the storm surrounding midfielder michael ballack .
there 's no lack of column inches being devoted to the subject of whether the germany captain is out of favor or not .
magath , not a man of many words , has been quiet , saying that all 23 men on the squad are both starters and substitutes .
words that might confuse some soccer players - but it 's doubtful that michael ballack thinks he is a substitute .
leverkusen started their campaign with an impressive effort against frankfurt last week , cruising to a 4-1 victory .
and could that be repeated ?
" we have the quality , " bayer midfielder bernd schneider told kicker magazine .
the contenders with easier assignments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg 's rafael van der vaart should lead with his head one of the dark horses in the bundesliga this season must be hamburg .
they have brought in quality personnel , most notably dutch international rafael van der vaart and on saturday , thomas doll 's club gets the pleasure of travelling to bielefeld , the one side they have had the most success against in their history .
the bielefeld defense resembled a sieve in a 5-2 defeat against bremen , holes that must be stopped soon or coach thomas von heesen will be battling against a rapdly sinking ship .
hertha berlin face the new boys from frankfurt .
soccer followers always expect a lot from the capital city team , but berlin has on the whole been disappointing .
a home match against frankfurt , where they score two goals on average , should be an easy assignment for falko götz ' squad led by brazilian extraordinaire marcelinho . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dfb wants turkish prodigy for germany when 16-year old nuri sahin took to the field on saturday for borussia dortmund , he became the youngest ever bundesliga player .

his comments on eastern voters are being linked to the conservatives ' slide in the polls . merkel was in damage-control mode as the week ended after stoiber 's remarks on eastern voters appeared to be seriously damaging her campaign .
stoiber provoked controversy earlier in the week after he characterized voters in the east as " frustrated " and questioned their judgment before general elections next month . merkel herself comes from eastern germany , but despite this , her party , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , is currently performing worse in the east than in the west . in an interview with zdf television late on thursday , merkel spoke of the 35 years she spent living under communism in east germany , and stressed that she understood the concerns of the people in the region .
she added that she wanted to be chancellor of all germans . " we will fight for every vote , but we definitely don ’ t need to insult voters , " merkel said .
" every move - intentional or not - which splits rather than unites germany is totally counterproductive . " slipping in the polls only a few weeks ago , the campaign for merkel and the cdu looked like clear sailing , with the conservatives enjoying a sizeable lead over chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- . but that lead has shrunk , leaving the cdu and their likely coalition partner , the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , defending a slim majority of 49 percent , barely ahead of the combined vote of the other parties strong enough to enter parliament . eastern voters could be forgiven for feeling slighted by the conservatives .
commenting last week on the shocking case of a german woman from the east charged with murdering nine of her newborn babies , senior conservative jörg schönbohm said the east german dictatorship had left easterners lacking in a sense of responsibility and morality . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder hopes to profit from the conservatives ' mistakes stoiber 's comment this week that " those who are frustrated ca n't be allowed to determine the fate of germany " only added insult to injury .

" slipping in the polls only a few weeks ago , the campaign for merkel and the cdu looked like clear sailing , with the conservatives enjoying a sizeable lead over chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- . but that lead has shrunk , leaving the cdu and their likely coalition partner , the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , defending a slim majority of 49 percent , barely ahead of the combined vote of the other parties strong enough to enter parliament . eastern voters could be forgiven for feeling slighted by the conservatives .

and it may end up helping schröder , who is bidding for a third term for his coalition of social democrats and greens . " his remark is not only tasteless , but shows a lack of democratic respect , " said schröder .
" stoiber 's comment cements division and insults people who have had to live under harder conditions than we in the west . " the left party , led by the charismatic former finance minister oskar lafontaine , may also profit from the conservatives ' gaffes , seeing as this new party is currently leading the polls in the east with more than 30 percent . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de conservative gaffe enrages east germans germany 's first chancellor candidate from the east , angela merkel , ran into fresh electoral problems in the crucial ex-communist states thursday after a key ally bashed the region 's " frustrated " voters .

the elegant limestone figure dating from 1347 bc was removed from its plinth in 1939 to protect it from bombing .
during the division of the city during the cold war , it was displayed in a museum at the schloss charlottenburg palace in west berlin .

then in 2009 , nefertiti will move into the neighboring , freshly renovated new museum .
cairo and berlin have frequently crossed swords over the beautiful nefertiti , which was unearthed by german archaeologist ludwig borchardt and removed from the country .

he previously worked in a number of state schools in britain before coming to bonn in the mid-1990s , where he has been a member of the senior management at the school since it opened in 1997 .
dw-world : how is germa n y doi n g i n your opi n io n ?
peter murphy : i believe that germany is still in a relatively strong economic position .
the challenges being faced by many countries of unemployment continue to cause pressures for the government - a situation that does not seem to be likely to improve in the short term .
i believe that there is a need for a critical review of how the economy can be stimulated .
with a willingness to be flexible and more responsive to " external forces , " i believe there is room for the types of change that would lead to an increase in social and economic stability .
when recruiting internationally , i often hear of germany being referred to as a " hardship assignment country " - an image that i do not share , but see as a major challenge to be addressed by future governments .
globalization is not a concept that can be ignored in the hope that one day it will go away .
what n eeds to happe n i n germa n y to help speed up the cou n try 's recovery ?
i would hope that the elected government would use their wisdom to create a better , fairer , more sustainable society for us all to live in .
i would hope to see tolerance and support for groups and individuals less fortunate than ourselves put more significantly on the agenda .
i would like young and old alike to feel that the future had something to offer and that they had something to contribute - a sense of worth .
societies are , in my opinion , successful when people feel that they have something to contribute .
high levels of unemployment , uncertainties about the future , worries about coping in retirement do not lead to economic growth and development .
the government has a challenge to make change attractive and the norm .
gerhard schröder or a n gela merkel ?
who is your perso n al choice for cha n cellor ?
why ?
i would like to see a change , and believe that angela merkel would bring an interesting perspective to a still very male-dominated culture .
what do you like about germa n y ?
in the context of education policies , it 's positive that there is a recognition that something needs to change .
what do you dislike about germa n y ?
the lack of critically challenging debate about what needs to change perhaps due to the difficulties in pushing through major social reform . ranty islam interviewed peter murphy send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de focus on education click here for dw-world 's collection of in-depth stories on education issues in germany .

the elegant limestone figure dating from 1347 bc was removed from its plinth in 1939 to protect it from bombing .
during the division of the city during the cold war , it was displayed in a museum at the schloss charlottenburg palace in west berlin .
overnight friday , the world-famous bust returned to the museum island complex in the east of the reunified capital ahead of the opening of a special exhibition of egyptian artifacts at the city 's old museum on saturday .
then in 2009 , nefertiti will move into the neighboring , freshly renovated new museum .
cairo and berlin have frequently crossed swords over the beautiful nefertiti , which was unearthed by german archaeologist ludwig borchardt and removed from the country .
germany has based its claim to the work on a 1913 agreement which granted nefertiti and a number of other important artifacts to their discoverers . dw-world.de berlin prepares for top drawer art shows after the monumental moma show , berlin 's museums are gearing up for further art highlights in 2005 : from german artist menzel , spanish master goya , the bust of nefertiti to the 60th anniversary of the end of wwii .

he previously worked in a number of state schools in britain before coming to bonn in the mid-1990s , where he has been a member of the senior management at the school since it opened in 1997 .
dw-world : how is germa n y doi n g i n your opi n io n ?
peter murphy : i believe that germany is still in a relatively strong economic position .
the challenges being faced by many countries of unemployment continue to cause pressures for the government - a situation that does not seem to be likely to improve in the short term .
i believe that there is a need for a critical review of how the economy can be stimulated .
with a willingness to be flexible and more responsive to " external forces , " i believe there is room for the types of change that would lead to an increase in social and economic stability .
when recruiting internationally , i often hear of germany being referred to as a " hardship assignment country " - an image that i do not share , but see as a major challenge to be addressed by future governments .
globalization is not a concept that can be ignored in the hope that one day it will go away .
what n eeds to happe n i n germa n y to help speed up the cou n try 's recovery ?
i would hope that the elected government would use their wisdom to create a better , fairer , more sustainable society for us all to live in .
i would hope to see tolerance and support for groups and individuals less fortunate than ourselves put more significantly on the agenda .
i would like young and old alike to feel that the future had something to offer and that they had something to contribute - a sense of worth .
societies are , in my opinion , successful when people feel that they have something to contribute .
high levels of unemployment , uncertainties about the future , worries about coping in retirement do not lead to economic growth and development .
the government has a challenge to make change attractive and the norm .
gerhard schröder or a n gela merkel ?
who is your perso n al choice for cha n cellor ?
why ?
i would like to see a change , and believe that angela merkel would bring an interesting perspective to a still very male-dominated culture .
what do you like about germa n y ?
in the context of education policies , it 's positive that there is a recognition that something needs to change .
what do you dislike about germa n y ?
the lack of critically challenging debate about what needs to change perhaps due to the difficulties in pushing through major social reform . ranty islam interviewed peter murphy send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de focus on education click here for dw-world 's collection of in-depth stories on education issues in germany .

spd presents election manifesto germany -pipe- 12.08.2005 getting the gray vote großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a powerful target group senior citizens make up a third of the german electorate and are being wooed by all the parties .
but when it comes to one of the issues that concerns them - pensions - they do n't think any one party has the answers . the elderly are an important target group in september 's election , but none of the parties have easy answers for the issues they 're most concerned about - pensions and the rising cost of health care and medication . the current government coalition of social democrats and greens introduced tough reforms which have also affected pensioners , but given germany 's massive public debt , the opposition parties would also have to make cutbacks if they came to power . raising the retirement age bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the discussion about the difficulty in funding germany 's pension system in future again took center stage this week following a suggestion by the president of the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- , klaus f. zimmermann , to raise the age of retirement to 70 from its current 65 . political parties , unions and pension insurers have all heaped criticism on the idea .
economics minister wolfgang clement called zimmermann 's suggestion " infeasible and excessive . "
he said he supports the suggestion made by a special government commission of experts , which would see the retirement age gradually raised to 67 . such suggestions have caused some older spd supporters to switch their allegiance to the left party , the new alliance of the reformed communist party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- and left-wing groups .
two-thirds of left party members are over 60 .
the senior citizens ' working groups meet regularly and carry authority .
their main recruits are elderly people in eastern germany . left party gaining senior support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left party is attracting senior voters " i believe that a very specific problem for older people in the east is that not only do they have the impression that the contributions they have made to society are not valued , but there is also proof that it is so , " said ernst bienert of the left party 's senior citizens group . seniors who remain loyal to the spd are also hitting the campaign trail , in part to refute the notion that only the spd is to blame for the pensions crisis and other social crises facing the country . " all of these developments , which resulted from compromises made during the committee stage , were frequently laid at the door of the spd , and we have to explain that and tell people how it really happened , " said hermann bokelmann of the spd 's 60-plus group . there has been no talk of cutting pensions in the election campaigns as yet , but it 's clear that future generations of pensioners will receive barely more than the level of social welfare from the government .
in comparison to those future generations , today 's pensioners are well-off .
nevertheless , opinion polls suggest that most pensioners want to see a change in government . up to 60 percent plan to vote for the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , even though they do n't believe that leader angela merkel has the answers to their problems . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de east germans disappointed by reunification east germany in 1989 was in the midst of a peaceful revolution .

schalke coach ralf rangnick 's troop must play in the unfriendly confines of the westfalen stadium but their fortunes there have been particularly good in the recent past .
schalke have not lost in the last six encounters in front of a regularly sold out 70,000 capacity in dortmund 's cauldron arena .
" in the last few years we have looked pretty good in dortmund .
i am assuming that this time it will be the same , " schalke goalkeeper frank rost told sport bild .
in the arena aufschalke on may 14 , dortmund broke a 12-game winless streak , topping off a tremendous comeback in the second half of the season .
both clubs value the rivalry and use it as a catapult for success in the bundesliga .
bvb need the boost more than schalke , coming away with a tie in their first match and having not reached the uefa cup after crashing out of the intertoto cup in the summer .
bayern meets bayer coach felix magath probably has a bone to pick with leverkusen .
last season in his first appearance as munich coach in the bayarena , his team got pasted 4-1 .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two bayern players -lrb- red -rrb- clamp down on a gladbach opponent in the first week revenge may be on magath 's mind , but only far , far at the back .
the big controversy for the team , and there is almost always one at bayern munich , is the storm surrounding midfielder michael ballack .
there 's no lack of column inches being devoted to the subject of whether the germany captain is out of favor or not .
magath , not a man of many words , has been quiet , saying that all 23 men on the squad are both starters and substitutes .
words that might confuse some soccer players - but it 's doubtful that michael ballack thinks he is a substitute .
leverkusen started their campaign with an impressive effort against frankfurt last week , cruising to a 4-1 victory .
and could that be repeated ?
" we have the quality , " bayer midfielder bernd schneider told kicker magazine .
the contenders with easier assignments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg 's rafael van der vaart should lead with his head one of the dark horses in the bundesliga this season must be hamburg .
they have brought in quality personnel , most notably dutch international rafael van der vaart and on saturday , thomas doll 's club gets the pleasure of travelling to bielefeld , the one side they have had the most success against in their history .
the bielefeld defense resembled a sieve in a 5-2 defeat against bremen , holes that must be stopped soon or coach thomas von heesen will be battling against a rapdly sinking ship .
hertha berlin face the new boys from frankfurt .
soccer followers always expect a lot from the capital city team , but berlin has on the whole been disappointing .

dw-world : how is germa n y doi n g i n your opi n io n ?
peter murphy : i believe that germany is still in a relatively strong economic position .
the challenges being faced by many countries of unemployment continue to cause pressures for the government - a situation that does not seem to be likely to improve in the short term .
i believe that there is a need for a critical review of how the economy can be stimulated .
with a willingness to be flexible and more responsive to " external forces , " i believe there is room for the types of change that would lead to an increase in social and economic stability .
when recruiting internationally , i often hear of germany being referred to as a " hardship assignment country " - an image that i do not share , but see as a major challenge to be addressed by future governments .
globalization is not a concept that can be ignored in the hope that one day it will go away .
what n eeds to happe n i n germa n y to help speed up the cou n try 's recovery ?
i would hope that the elected government would use their wisdom to create a better , fairer , more sustainable society for us all to live in .
i would hope to see tolerance and support for groups and individuals less fortunate than ourselves put more significantly on the agenda .
i would like young and old alike to feel that the future had something to offer and that they had something to contribute - a sense of worth .
societies are , in my opinion , successful when people feel that they have something to contribute .
high levels of unemployment , uncertainties about the future , worries about coping in retirement do not lead to economic growth and development .
the government has a challenge to make change attractive and the norm .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 12.08.2005 european cities face future heatwaves großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as temperatures soar in future , europeans will struggle to keep cool a new study by the wwf environmental organization shows that temperatures in european cities are on the rise with more extreme weather predicted in the increasingly sticky future . although many europeans are wearing jumpers in august this year , the fact remains that temperatures across central europe are continuing to rise .
according to a study by the environmental organization wwf , european cities are set to sizzle in the future . in terms of summer temperature increases , madrid is number one .
no other city in europe has seen such dramatic rises than the spanish capital over the last 30 years .
on average , madrid has seen temperatures climb by 2.2 degrees celsius -lrb- 35.96 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- in the last three decades .
trailing , and sweating , not so far behind come london , lisbon , luxembourg and athens . for londoners , more used to the " pea soup " mists rolling down the thames with a foggy chill , the rise in temperature may initially be gratefully received . that is until global temperatures rise to such an extent that the polar ice caps melt ; either causing sea levels to rise which in turn could lead to the thames flooding or a dilution of the gulf stream by fresh water which would eventually stop the warm flow to the british isles leading to a possible ice age . spain and portugal facing droughts , crop failures while the long term effect on london could be potentially disastrous , both madrid and lisbon are experiencing problems , although less apocalyptic , right now .
summers in the spanish and portuguese cities have been getting hotter and hotter leading to droughts and water shortages . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the reservoirs are empty , many fields and crops have dried up and forest areas are tinder-box dry , leading to increasingly common seasonal infernos .
both countries have requested help from the eu as crop start to fail . climatologists have been warning for years that europe must prepare for more and more extreme weather conditions and events such as drought , violent storms and floods . human industrialization to blame , says wwf martin hiller , climate spokesperson for the wwf , dismisses claims by some that these conditions are caused by variations in natural habitats around the globe .
" the majority of scientists agree that humans play the determining role , " he said . " in more than 200 years of industrialization , the co2 level in the atmosphere has increased by a third of its original value .
this is caused by humans , there is no natural process . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while humans are reaping what they sow in terms of increased heat and its effects , fauna and flora are suffering too and in many cases are being hardest hit .
the melting of the arctic ice flows are reducing the natural habitat and hunting grounds of polar bears while soaring temperatures could demand too much of fragile ecological systems like coral reefs . but the human population is also starting to see devastating effects .
" for example , at the heat wave of 2003 , " martin hiller warned .
" altogether around 40,000 people died as a result . " the future 's bright , the future 's scorching in the last century , the worldwide average temperature rose by about 0.6 degrees celsius ; in europe by about 1 degree .
scientists believe that the human race has seen nothing yet and that the biggest hike in temperatures is yet to come . scientists at the un 's intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- predict that we can expect a rise of between 1.4 to 5.8 degrees celsius . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this will lead to more intense summers for european cities and , according to the wwf , not only more dramatic environmental effects but also economic ones .
as the heat rises , more people will turn to their fans and air-conditioning systems to cope . it seems to be a vicious circle : more heat , more power consumption , more greenhouse gas and again more heat . alternative power to break the cycle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the answer could lie with renewable energy sources like wind , water and biomass , something electricity companies must consider in the future , the wwf demands .
while such alternatives are not entirely innocent in regards to climate change , they do , however , create less greenhouse gases than coal or oil . change can begin at home , martin hiller says , a fact that is often overlooked .
one could simply save up to 30 percent more energy by using electrical devices more wisely .
also , modern devices such as computers and air-conditioning systems need much less energy than their older incarnations . this , at least , would be the first step in breaking the vicious circle of climate change . johannes beck -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the cost of environmental pollution germany may be an eco-friendly place , but support for the environment does come at a price - a fact that some organizations are trying to disprove .

pfahls , who served as state secretary for defense from 1987 to 1992 , insisted that he had not done anything in return for the money .
presiding judge maximilian hofmeister said that while pfahls may have greased the wheels for the deal , he had not directly violated the duties of his office . " you accepted money without being corrupt , " hofmeister told the defendant while reading the verdict .

kohl exonerated pfahls bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german chancellor helmut kohl in court during the pfahls trial on aug .
3 several highest-ranking former government officials , including former chancellor helmut kohl and former foreign minister hans-dietrich genscher , had testified during the trial that pfahls had not influenced a controversial sale of tanks to saudi arabia during the 1991 gulf war .
after five years on the run , pfahls was arrested in paris by french and german police in july 2004 and extradited to germany in january .
he could be released as early as september because his time in french and german custody will be counted against the sentence .
when half the sentence has been served , the judges may convert the rest of the prison time to a suspended sentence . the sentence was in line with an agreement between the prosecution , the defense and the court ahead of the trial that limited his total jail time to two years and three months if nothing during the trial contradicted the admission he made . because kohl confirmed that the defendant had had no political influence over the armored vehicles deal , the prosecution dropped the more serious corruption charge the day of the former chancellor 's testimony . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de kohl takes heat off former minister pfahls the corruption trial of holger pfahls took a key turn on wednesday with the testimony of ex-chancellor helmut kohl , who effectively cleared the former junior defense minister of suspicions of bribery .

he previously worked in a number of state schools in britain before coming to bonn in the mid-1990s , where he has been a member of the senior management at the school since it opened in 1997 .
dw-world : how is germa n y doi n g i n your opi n io n ?
peter murphy : i believe that germany is still in a relatively strong economic position .
the challenges being faced by many countries of unemployment continue to cause pressures for the government - a situation that does not seem to be likely to improve in the short term .
i believe that there is a need for a critical review of how the economy can be stimulated .
with a willingness to be flexible and more responsive to " external forces , " i believe there is room for the types of change that would lead to an increase in social and economic stability .
when recruiting internationally , i often hear of germany being referred to as a " hardship assignment country " - an image that i do not share , but see as a major challenge to be addressed by future governments .
globalization is not a concept that can be ignored in the hope that one day it will go away .
what n eeds to happe n i n germa n y to help speed up the cou n try 's recovery ?
i would hope that the elected government would use their wisdom to create a better , fairer , more sustainable society for us all to live in .
i would hope to see tolerance and support for groups and individuals less fortunate than ourselves put more significantly on the agenda .
i would like young and old alike to feel that the future had something to offer and that they had something to contribute - a sense of worth .
societies are , in my opinion , successful when people feel that they have something to contribute .
high levels of unemployment , uncertainties about the future , worries about coping in retirement do not lead to economic growth and development .
the government has a challenge to make change attractive and the norm .
gerhard schröder or a n gela merkel ?
who is your perso n al choice for cha n cellor ?
why ?
i would like to see a change , and believe that angela merkel would bring an interesting perspective to a still very male-dominated culture .
what do you like about germa n y ?
in the context of education policies , it 's positive that there is a recognition that something needs to change .
what do you dislike about germa n y ?
the lack of critically challenging debate about what needs to change perhaps due to the difficulties in pushing through major social reform . ranty islam interviewed peter murphy send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de focus on education click here for dw-world 's collection of in-depth stories on education issues in germany .

spd presents election manifesto germany -pipe- 12.08.2005 getting the gray vote großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a powerful target group senior citizens make up a third of the german electorate and are being wooed by all the parties .
but when it comes to one of the issues that concerns them - pensions - they do n't think any one party has the answers . the elderly are an important target group in september 's election , but none of the parties have easy answers for the issues they 're most concerned about - pensions and the rising cost of health care and medication . the current government coalition of social democrats and greens introduced tough reforms which have also affected pensioners , but given germany 's massive public debt , the opposition parties would also have to make cutbacks if they came to power . raising the retirement age bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the discussion about the difficulty in funding germany 's pension system in future again took center stage this week following a suggestion by the president of the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- , klaus f. zimmermann , to raise the age of retirement to 70 from its current 65 . political parties , unions and pension insurers have all heaped criticism on the idea .
economics minister wolfgang clement called zimmermann 's suggestion " infeasible and excessive . "
he said he supports the suggestion made by a special government commission of experts , which would see the retirement age gradually raised to 67 . such suggestions have caused some older spd supporters to switch their allegiance to the left party , the new alliance of the reformed communist party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- and left-wing groups .
two-thirds of left party members are over 60 .
the senior citizens ' working groups meet regularly and carry authority .
their main recruits are elderly people in eastern germany . left party gaining senior support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left party is attracting senior voters " i believe that a very specific problem for older people in the east is that not only do they have the impression that the contributions they have made to society are not valued , but there is also proof that it is so , " said ernst bienert of the left party 's senior citizens group . seniors who remain loyal to the spd are also hitting the campaign trail , in part to refute the notion that only the spd is to blame for the pensions crisis and other social crises facing the country . " all of these developments , which resulted from compromises made during the committee stage , were frequently laid at the door of the spd , and we have to explain that and tell people how it really happened , " said hermann bokelmann of the spd 's 60-plus group . there has been no talk of cutting pensions in the election campaigns as yet , but it 's clear that future generations of pensioners will receive barely more than the level of social welfare from the government .
in comparison to those future generations , today 's pensioners are well-off .
nevertheless , opinion polls suggest that most pensioners want to see a change in government . up to 60 percent plan to vote for the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , even though they do n't believe that leader angela merkel has the answers to their problems . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de east germans disappointed by reunification east germany in 1989 was in the midst of a peaceful revolution .

but when it comes to one of the issues that concerns them - pensions - they do n't think any one party has the answers . the elderly are an important target group in september 's election , but none of the parties have easy answers for the issues they 're most concerned about - pensions and the rising cost of health care and medication . the current government coalition of social democrats and greens introduced tough reforms which have also affected pensioners , but given germany 's massive public debt , the opposition parties would also have to make cutbacks if they came to power . raising the retirement age bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the discussion about the difficulty in funding germany 's pension system in future again took center stage this week following a suggestion by the president of the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- , klaus f. zimmermann , to raise the age of retirement to 70 from its current 65 . political parties , unions and pension insurers have all heaped criticism on the idea .
economics minister wolfgang clement called zimmermann 's suggestion " infeasible and excessive . "
he said he supports the suggestion made by a special government commission of experts , which would see the retirement age gradually raised to 67 . such suggestions have caused some older spd supporters to switch their allegiance to the left party , the new alliance of the reformed communist party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- and left-wing groups .

" all of these developments , which resulted from compromises made during the committee stage , were frequently laid at the door of the spd , and we have to explain that and tell people how it really happened , " said hermann bokelmann of the spd 's 60-plus group . there has been no talk of cutting pensions in the election campaigns as yet , but it 's clear that future generations of pensioners will receive barely more than the level of social welfare from the government .
in comparison to those future generations , today 's pensioners are well-off .

"
renate künast champions made in germany the green party 's renate künast was accused of protectionism after her opening statements of the election campaign urged voters to buy german products .
in reality , quality rather than origin matters most to consumers . in germany , the social democrat-green coalition is fighting for its political life in the coming federal election .
some politicians are championing unusual policies in their attempts to boost their parties ' popularity with the electorate .
consumer protection minister renate künast is one . künast has positioned herself on the side of german manufacturers and by doing so has also placed herself in the cross hairs of the media .
proclaiming her allegiance and support for german products , the green party minister appeared in the popular sunday newspaper bild am sonntag to urge her compatriots to buy domestically produced goods and help protect the jobs of fellow germans . the move backfired and künast was accused of protectionism .
in an attempt to calm the stormy waters , a government statement attempted to spin the story into something a little more palatable .
künast was not calling for a boycott of foreign goods , it claimed , but for an environment where workers ' rights are upheld and child labor abroad is not rewarded . but what do the consumers of germany think about künast 's rallying call to " buy german ? " cheap goods flooding german market bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : digging deeper past the ill-conceived initial rant , one finds a central argument to the minister 's call , one which has been a matter of debate for years : the trend toward discount products , especially food .
the no-frills product ranges have come under fire mainly due to the fact that they are produced in other countries where labor costs are cheaper but sold in germany . but does the consumer really have the choice to support german products ? in the bonn branch of the nationwide department store chain kaufhof , an investigation into the country of origin of most of the clothing available there reveals an overwhelmingly international trend .
labels on trousers , t-shirts , belts and hats disclose many different origins : made in china , made in bangladesh , made in turkey and made in romania .
not one says made in germany . moving to another floor , the story is the same .
even the world famous steiff animals , cuddly toys associated with high-quality german manufacturing processes , carry the label : " produced in china under quality control of steiff germany " . " made in germany " not the whole story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the consumer generally does not have the possibility to find out where the product has been produced , " says holger brackemann from german standards watchdog stiftung warentest .
" the famous ' made in germany ' label , that they may find on textiles and other products , may not be the whole truth , that it may not have been produced here from the first through to the last manufacturing step . " the government 's statement that künast was looking to prevent worker exploitation and child labor in foreign countries by urging germans to buy locally produced , in theory , is a good example of trying to kill two birds with one stone .
on the one hand , promoting german goods is a tick for trying to protect jobs at home while trying to put pressure on countries that use child labor is stab at promoting an ethical foreign policy . german consumers want quality items bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but do german consumers know about the origins of their products or whether ethical practices were used in their production ?
do they even care ? when asked if she takes any notice of where products are produced , one shopper in bonn replied : " no , not at all . "
another added : " i shop for quality .
quality goods not only come from germany .
and germany makes a lot of rubbish as well . " another shopper said : " i look first at the quality and then at the price , and then if i decide if buying this is worthwhile , then i get it .
the country of origin does n't really feature . " " the argument about child labor is an important one , " says one man .
" but they must also earn their money .
not buying the products may actually endanger that . " it seems that in this election year , the issue will not be where the products come from but whether or not consumers will have enough money in their pockets to buy anything . christoph hasselbach -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de is " made in germany " losing its luster ?

"
in late november , she 'll be back in the capital with a christmas show at a cabaret tent that sits right next to the federal chancellery .
" we 'll see who 's in there when i get there , " she said . dw-world : how is germa n y doi n g i n your opi n io n ? gayle tufts : poor germany 's having a hard time right now .
it 's holding its head down like a sad sack .
it 's a shame when bad things happen to good people .
the country 's just gotten over the trauma of the war - it really worked hard on that .
people have done their verga n ge n heitsbewältigu n g -lrb- eds : dealing with the past -rrb- .
they got through reunification - who would have ever thought that reunification would have gone so well in a country that 's so regimented .
of course it 's shocking and the reality of it is now catching up with germans .
maybe unification with luxembourg or italy would have been easier , because people there are more flexible .
germans like things to go the way they 're supposed to go .
they like their trains to run on time .
what n eeds to happe n i n germa n y to help speed up the cou n try 's recovery ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a politician that 's more to tufts ' liking the situation here reminds me of my older brother , who lives in boston and has been unemployed for four years .
i tell him , " you should have gone to college when you had the chance , you should n't have drunk so much beer , hanging out with friends , watching baseball . "
unfortunately , something has to change .
you ca n't live in a country with this much unemployment .
somebody is going to break the unions that are so strong here .
it 's not going to be possible in the global world to have this kind of protection that workers have here .
the hope is that there will be people who can do it in a human enough fashion .
people want things to be perfect , but it 's not going to be perfect .
the challenge for leaders will be to find a way to make the best of an imperfect situation .

it 's as if she fulfills all the criteria - she 's a woman , she 's from the east , but does that mean that she 's the right person ?
on the other hand - the poor woman : there are more things written about her hair than her agenda .
i would not want to be in her shoes , whatever they may be .
what do you like about germa n y ? i like the honesty .
germans can be incredibly honest and everything is very deep .
there are stupid things on television , but the next day you have 12 commentaries in the newspaper and everybody 's talking about it .
people like to chew things over .
i have personally profited from it , it has made me take myself more seriously . what do you dislike about germa n y ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gayle tufts this seriousness sometimes makes me crazy .

after a nominal appearance against bayern in the first week , he wants to prove he can carry , or at least help carry , coach horst köppel to success .
the coach should play him against wolfsburg .
the striker has scored 11 times in 11 matches against the northern german side .
an even dozen would look nicer .
wolfsburg coach , holger fach , gets to return to the club that fired him last season .

this week , they can make kaiserlautern 's michael henke second game as a head coach as sour as the first one .
henke , longtime assistant to ottmar hitzfeld during his reign at bayern munich , has acquired a side in turmoil and watched in frustration as lautern surrendered a 1-0 lead to schalke , eventually losing 2-1 .
in hanover , ewald lienen led the squad to an outstanding 2004-05 campaign .
last week , they showed it was n't a fluke coming down from 2-0 deficit to tie with berlin .
they must travel south to nuremberg where they have had little success , only winning twice in ten matches .
for nuremberg , bad starts are the norm , having lost 3-0 to hamburg .
they have additional motivation this week with the 70th birthday of club president michael a. roth .
will that be enough though ?
sunday games feature top clubs against question marks current first-place side bremen face a nemesis in mainz .
it hardly seems likely that mainz , only in their second season ever in the bundesliga , would present problems for the northern germans , but last year bremen lost once and tied once against jürgen klopp 's " fun " soccer club .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a diamond in the rough , werder bremen bremen gave a desolate performance against basle in a champions league qualifier this week .
" i expect that we 'll come out much differently against mainz , " said team director klaus allofs .
cologne started their campaign after a one-year absence from the top division with a victory at home .
this week , they go on the road to stuttgart .
coach uwe rapolder has player problems due to injuries .

schalke coach ralf rangnick 's troop must play in the unfriendly confines of the westfalen stadium but their fortunes there have been particularly good in the recent past .

there 's no lack of column inches being devoted to the subject of whether the germany captain is out of favor or not .
magath , not a man of many words , has been quiet , saying that all 23 men on the squad are both starters and substitutes .
words that might confuse some soccer players - but it 's doubtful that michael ballack thinks he is a substitute .
leverkusen started their campaign with an impressive effort against frankfurt last week , cruising to a 4-1 victory .

and from the choices on view , shopaholic pilgrims will have no problem sating their appetites . the estimated 800,000 pilgrims flocking to cologne and the surrounding areas for the world youth day celebrations may be there to save souls but it 's unlikely that they will be saving any money .
the merchandising bandwagon is in full swing a week in advance of the main event and items are flying off the shelves . " we 've already had to restock on key chains , " said volunteer christine meyer above the din of a frantic crowd clamoring for goodies at the info point opposite cologne 's main station .
" they selling very well and so are the wristbands . "
as if to emphasise the point , a group of japanese girls snap up a handful of the popular rubber bands , one of each color . the fashion conscious catholic could run up a hefty bill if he or she were to stock up on all the available official world youth day products available .
the apparently desirable key chains retail at a reasonable 3.60 euros -lrb- $ 4.47 -rrb- while the wristbands go for 1.20 euros a pop . extensive shopping list could break the bank bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things start to add up , however , when wanting to complement your various hanging items with festival attire .
imagine the sun breaks out from behind the clouds while taking part in the open air mass .
a rather fetching official baseball cap or sunhat would be needed to keep off those powerful rays .
each will cost the uv aware pilgrim 8.50 euros . the unexpected heat may require a change of clothes .
luckily there 's a choice of either a current or former pope t-shirt -lrb- 12.90 euros -rrb- .
and just to make sure you wo n't be late for a papal pot roast down by the rhine with your friends , you 'll need a world youth day watch which can be purchased for 11.99 euros . amazingly still able to converse under the weight of her extensive collection of memorabilia , corina ribiero from brazil said that money was no question in relation to the bigger picture and the memories she hopes she will take back with her to sao paulo . " my experiences here will be worth more than anything , " she said .
" many of the things i have bought are for my family but also for me .
they will remind me of the beautiful time i had in germany . " pope sideline doing a roaring trade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if the official range of products is not enough to get the international congregation parting with its money , there also seems to be a profitable sideline in pope merchandise running in tandem with the officially sponsored items . the arrival of benedict xvi on august 18 has been anticipated ever since he was named as successor to the late john paul ii .
and with the former cardinal ratzinger a native of the host country , every souvenir stand , book store and tourist shop in the area has been stocking up on official and not-so-official papal treats . for those not willing to shell out for the event sponsored t-shirt , there are plenty of cheaper alternatives featuring the beaming visage of the holy father .
for example , a rock festival-esque black number sporting a saluting ratzi could be yours for 9.95 euros , denim waistcoat not included . world youth day meets free enterprise not all outlets selling merchandise , however , could be called reputable . " he is our pope and we want to commemorate his return , " said one street vendor who did not wish to be named .
when asked if he felt any pangs of guilt offering bootleg merchandise to pilgrims , the man added : " any christian will tell you that one of god 's greatest gifts was the gift of free will .
they can choose if they want to buy my t-shirts or someone else 's . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is certainly no dearth in possible alternatives .
radiating out from the cologne cathedral there are numerous stores displaying posters , postcards , candles , lollipops and all manner of reading material all featuring the star of the show . many items , despite the fact that the pope wo n't be in cologne for a week , already feature the holy father in various poses around the city . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just in case it proves difficult getting a snapshot of benedict xvi while he 's in cologne , there is a wide range of postcards already on sale that has the pope relaxing by the rhine , receiving adulation in front of the cathedral and enjoying a break from blessing the faithful . from the sublime to the ridiculous , it certainly seems that religon sells and that world youth day - and the first visit to germany of the new pope - is big business . nick amies , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cashing in on christianity in cologne come next week , the german city of cologne will be bursting at the seams as it plays host to some 800,000 pilgrims in town for world youth day .

according to a study by the environmental organization wwf , european cities are set to sizzle in the future . in terms of summer temperature increases , madrid is number one .
no other city in europe has seen such dramatic rises than the spanish capital over the last 30 years .
on average , madrid has seen temperatures climb by 2.2 degrees celsius -lrb- 35.96 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- in the last three decades .
trailing , and sweating , not so far behind come london , lisbon , luxembourg and athens . for londoners , more used to the " pea soup " mists rolling down the thames with a foggy chill , the rise in temperature may initially be gratefully received . that is until global temperatures rise to such an extent that the polar ice caps melt ; either causing sea levels to rise which in turn could lead to the thames flooding or a dilution of the gulf stream by fresh water which would eventually stop the warm flow to the british isles leading to a possible ice age . spain and portugal facing droughts , crop failures while the long term effect on london could be potentially disastrous , both madrid and lisbon are experiencing problems , although less apocalyptic , right now .
summers in the spanish and portuguese cities have been getting hotter and hotter leading to droughts and water shortages . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the reservoirs are empty , many fields and crops have dried up and forest areas are tinder-box dry , leading to increasingly common seasonal infernos .
both countries have requested help from the eu as crop start to fail . climatologists have been warning for years that europe must prepare for more and more extreme weather conditions and events such as drought , violent storms and floods . human industrialization to blame , says wwf martin hiller , climate spokesperson for the wwf , dismisses claims by some that these conditions are caused by variations in natural habitats around the globe .
" the majority of scientists agree that humans play the determining role , " he said . " in more than 200 years of industrialization , the co2 level in the atmosphere has increased by a third of its original value .
this is caused by humans , there is no natural process . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while humans are reaping what they sow in terms of increased heat and its effects , fauna and flora are suffering too and in many cases are being hardest hit .
the melting of the arctic ice flows are reducing the natural habitat and hunting grounds of polar bears while soaring temperatures could demand too much of fragile ecological systems like coral reefs . but the human population is also starting to see devastating effects .
" for example , at the heat wave of 2003 , " martin hiller warned .
" altogether around 40,000 people died as a result . " the future 's bright , the future 's scorching in the last century , the worldwide average temperature rose by about 0.6 degrees celsius ; in europe by about 1 degree .
scientists believe that the human race has seen nothing yet and that the biggest hike in temperatures is yet to come . scientists at the un 's intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- predict that we can expect a rise of between 1.4 to 5.8 degrees celsius . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this will lead to more intense summers for european cities and , according to the wwf , not only more dramatic environmental effects but also economic ones .
as the heat rises , more people will turn to their fans and air-conditioning systems to cope . it seems to be a vicious circle : more heat , more power consumption , more greenhouse gas and again more heat . alternative power to break the cycle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the answer could lie with renewable energy sources like wind , water and biomass , something electricity companies must consider in the future , the wwf demands .
while such alternatives are not entirely innocent in regards to climate change , they do , however , create less greenhouse gases than coal or oil . change can begin at home , martin hiller says , a fact that is often overlooked .
one could simply save up to 30 percent more energy by using electrical devices more wisely .
also , modern devices such as computers and air-conditioning systems need much less energy than their older incarnations . this , at least , would be the first step in breaking the vicious circle of climate change . johannes beck -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the cost of environmental pollution germany may be an eco-friendly place , but support for the environment does come at a price - a fact that some organizations are trying to disprove .

the elegant limestone figure dating from 1347 bc was removed from its plinth in 1939 to protect it from bombing .
during the division of the city during the cold war , it was displayed in a museum at the schloss charlottenburg palace in west berlin .
overnight friday , the world-famous bust returned to the museum island complex in the east of the reunified capital ahead of the opening of a special exhibition of egyptian artifacts at the city 's old museum on saturday .
then in 2009 , nefertiti will move into the neighboring , freshly renovated new museum .
cairo and berlin have frequently crossed swords over the beautiful nefertiti , which was unearthed by german archaeologist ludwig borchardt and removed from the country .
germany has based its claim to the work on a 1913 agreement which granted nefertiti and a number of other important artifacts to their discoverers . dw-world.de berlin prepares for top drawer art shows after the monumental moma show , berlin 's museums are gearing up for further art highlights in 2005 : from german artist menzel , spanish master goya , the bust of nefertiti to the 60th anniversary of the end of wwii .

according to a study by the environmental organization wwf , european cities are set to sizzle in the future . in terms of summer temperature increases , madrid is number one .
no other city in europe has seen such dramatic rises than the spanish capital over the last 30 years .
on average , madrid has seen temperatures climb by 2.2 degrees celsius -lrb- 35.96 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- in the last three decades .
trailing , and sweating , not so far behind come london , lisbon , luxembourg and athens . for londoners , more used to the " pea soup " mists rolling down the thames with a foggy chill , the rise in temperature may initially be gratefully received . that is until global temperatures rise to such an extent that the polar ice caps melt ; either causing sea levels to rise which in turn could lead to the thames flooding or a dilution of the gulf stream by fresh water which would eventually stop the warm flow to the british isles leading to a possible ice age . spain and portugal facing droughts , crop failures while the long term effect on london could be potentially disastrous , both madrid and lisbon are experiencing problems , although less apocalyptic , right now .

" the majority of scientists agree that humans play the determining role , " he said . " in more than 200 years of industrialization , the co2 level in the atmosphere has increased by a third of its original value .
this is caused by humans , there is no natural process . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while humans are reaping what they sow in terms of increased heat and its effects , fauna and flora are suffering too and in many cases are being hardest hit .
the melting of the arctic ice flows are reducing the natural habitat and hunting grounds of polar bears while soaring temperatures could demand too much of fragile ecological systems like coral reefs . but the human population is also starting to see devastating effects .

investigators from the bavarian state police found two unexploded bombs on the terrace of the german-turk 's home and one in the garage of the would-be attacker in the nearby state capital munich .

one of the bombs was destroyed in a controlled explosion where it was found .

"
renate künast champions made in germany the green party 's renate künast was accused of protectionism after her opening statements of the election campaign urged voters to buy german products .
in reality , quality rather than origin matters most to consumers . in germany , the social democrat-green coalition is fighting for its political life in the coming federal election .
some politicians are championing unusual policies in their attempts to boost their parties ' popularity with the electorate .
consumer protection minister renate künast is one . künast has positioned herself on the side of german manufacturers and by doing so has also placed herself in the cross hairs of the media .
proclaiming her allegiance and support for german products , the green party minister appeared in the popular sunday newspaper bild am sonntag to urge her compatriots to buy domestically produced goods and help protect the jobs of fellow germans . the move backfired and künast was accused of protectionism .
in an attempt to calm the stormy waters , a government statement attempted to spin the story into something a little more palatable .
künast was not calling for a boycott of foreign goods , it claimed , but for an environment where workers ' rights are upheld and child labor abroad is not rewarded . but what do the consumers of germany think about künast 's rallying call to " buy german ? " cheap goods flooding german market bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : digging deeper past the ill-conceived initial rant , one finds a central argument to the minister 's call , one which has been a matter of debate for years : the trend toward discount products , especially food .
the no-frills product ranges have come under fire mainly due to the fact that they are produced in other countries where labor costs are cheaper but sold in germany . but does the consumer really have the choice to support german products ? in the bonn branch of the nationwide department store chain kaufhof , an investigation into the country of origin of most of the clothing available there reveals an overwhelmingly international trend .
labels on trousers , t-shirts , belts and hats disclose many different origins : made in china , made in bangladesh , made in turkey and made in romania .
not one says made in germany . moving to another floor , the story is the same .
even the world famous steiff animals , cuddly toys associated with high-quality german manufacturing processes , carry the label : " produced in china under quality control of steiff germany " . " made in germany " not the whole story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the consumer generally does not have the possibility to find out where the product has been produced , " says holger brackemann from german standards watchdog stiftung warentest .
" the famous ' made in germany ' label , that they may find on textiles and other products , may not be the whole truth , that it may not have been produced here from the first through to the last manufacturing step . " the government 's statement that künast was looking to prevent worker exploitation and child labor in foreign countries by urging germans to buy locally produced , in theory , is a good example of trying to kill two birds with one stone .
on the one hand , promoting german goods is a tick for trying to protect jobs at home while trying to put pressure on countries that use child labor is stab at promoting an ethical foreign policy . german consumers want quality items bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but do german consumers know about the origins of their products or whether ethical practices were used in their production ?
do they even care ? when asked if she takes any notice of where products are produced , one shopper in bonn replied : " no , not at all . "
another added : " i shop for quality .
quality goods not only come from germany .
and germany makes a lot of rubbish as well . " another shopper said : " i look first at the quality and then at the price , and then if i decide if buying this is worthwhile , then i get it .
the country of origin does n't really feature . " " the argument about child labor is an important one , " says one man .
" but they must also earn their money .
not buying the products may actually endanger that . " it seems that in this election year , the issue will not be where the products come from but whether or not consumers will have enough money in their pockets to buy anything . christoph hasselbach -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de is " made in germany " losing its luster ?

pfahls , who served as state secretary for defense from 1987 to 1992 , insisted that he had not done anything in return for the money .
presiding judge maximilian hofmeister said that while pfahls may have greased the wheels for the deal , he had not directly violated the duties of his office . " you accepted money without being corrupt , " hofmeister told the defendant while reading the verdict .

3 several highest-ranking former government officials , including former chancellor helmut kohl and former foreign minister hans-dietrich genscher , had testified during the trial that pfahls had not influenced a controversial sale of tanks to saudi arabia during the 1991 gulf war .
after five years on the run , pfahls was arrested in paris by french and german police in july 2004 and extradited to germany in january .
he could be released as early as september because his time in french and german custody will be counted against the sentence .
when half the sentence has been served , the judges may convert the rest of the prison time to a suspended sentence . the sentence was in line with an agreement between the prosecution , the defense and the court ahead of the trial that limited his total jail time to two years and three months if nothing during the trial contradicted the admission he made . because kohl confirmed that the defendant had had no political influence over the armored vehicles deal , the prosecution dropped the more serious corruption charge the day of the former chancellor 's testimony . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de kohl takes heat off former minister pfahls the corruption trial of holger pfahls took a key turn on wednesday with the testimony of ex-chancellor helmut kohl , who effectively cleared the former junior defense minister of suspicions of bribery .

a long-time mcdonald 's employee , he bought his first two restaurants in regensburg in 1987 and has since opened 10 more in the region . the 59-year-old says he has only " 21 more years until retirement . "
if he does n't make it until then , his biggest wish is to die in a mcdonald 's , he said .
mosher , who has become a german citizen , shares his views on the country 's state and future before the election . dw-world : how is germany doing in your opinion ? frank mosher : my feeling is that germany is doing very poorly at the present time .
if you look at the economy , it 's performing , i think , at the last place in europe .
i think it 's pretty frustrating for everybody - for the entrepreneurs , the workers and the people who , who are retired .
i think it 's frightening for the people who are still learning or studying and getting ready to go into the work force . what needs to happen in germany to help speed up the country 's recovery ? hartz -lrb- eds : germany 's social welfare reforms -rrb- is a step in the right direction , but it 's not far enough along .
we need more straight talk , more honest talk .
if we do n't get this thing straightened out , the perception of democracy gets weaker and weaker .
we just have to get it going .
the reform of the tax system is one of most important things that have to get done .
it 's ridiculous that not all ways of making money are taxed .
we need to get rid of subsidies .
we have more people working as civil servants , i think , than almost anywhere else in the world .
the problem is that everybody is relying too much on the state .
you ca n't expect the state to provide for you when you 're old . chancellor gerhard schröder or challenger angela merkel ?
who is your personal choice for chancellor ?
why ? schröder has totally failed .
he made promises and he has n't performed .
i think he 's disqualified himself .
of course merkel would be better .
at the same time , she has to be a margaret thatcher , she has to make the hard decisions .
she ca n't be the most popular person , but somebody 's gotta do it .

pfahls , who served as state secretary for defense from 1987 to 1992 , insisted that he had not done anything in return for the money .
presiding judge maximilian hofmeister said that while pfahls may have greased the wheels for the deal , he had not directly violated the duties of his office . " you accepted money without being corrupt , " hofmeister told the defendant while reading the verdict .
" you were working on commission . "
kohl exonerated pfahls bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german chancellor helmut kohl in court during the pfahls trial on aug .
3 several highest-ranking former government officials , including former chancellor helmut kohl and former foreign minister hans-dietrich genscher , had testified during the trial that pfahls had not influenced a controversial sale of tanks to saudi arabia during the 1991 gulf war .
after five years on the run , pfahls was arrested in paris by french and german police in july 2004 and extradited to germany in january .
he could be released as early as september because his time in french and german custody will be counted against the sentence .
when half the sentence has been served , the judges may convert the rest of the prison time to a suspended sentence . the sentence was in line with an agreement between the prosecution , the defense and the court ahead of the trial that limited his total jail time to two years and three months if nothing during the trial contradicted the admission he made . because kohl confirmed that the defendant had had no political influence over the armored vehicles deal , the prosecution dropped the more serious corruption charge the day of the former chancellor 's testimony . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de kohl takes heat off former minister pfahls the corruption trial of holger pfahls took a key turn on wednesday with the testimony of ex-chancellor helmut kohl , who effectively cleared the former junior defense minister of suspicions of bribery .

renate künast champions made in germany the green party 's renate künast was accused of protectionism after her opening statements of the election campaign urged voters to buy german products .
in reality , quality rather than origin matters most to consumers . in germany , the social democrat-green coalition is fighting for its political life in the coming federal election .
some politicians are championing unusual policies in their attempts to boost their parties ' popularity with the electorate .
consumer protection minister renate künast is one . künast has positioned herself on the side of german manufacturers and by doing so has also placed herself in the cross hairs of the media .
proclaiming her allegiance and support for german products , the green party minister appeared in the popular sunday newspaper bild am sonntag to urge her compatriots to buy domestically produced goods and help protect the jobs of fellow germans . the move backfired and künast was accused of protectionism .
in an attempt to calm the stormy waters , a government statement attempted to spin the story into something a little more palatable .
künast was not calling for a boycott of foreign goods , it claimed , but for an environment where workers ' rights are upheld and child labor abroad is not rewarded . but what do the consumers of germany think about künast 's rallying call to " buy german ? " cheap goods flooding german market bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : digging deeper past the ill-conceived initial rant , one finds a central argument to the minister 's call , one which has been a matter of debate for years : the trend toward discount products , especially food .
the no-frills product ranges have come under fire mainly due to the fact that they are produced in other countries where labor costs are cheaper but sold in germany . but does the consumer really have the choice to support german products ? in the bonn branch of the nationwide department store chain kaufhof , an investigation into the country of origin of most of the clothing available there reveals an overwhelmingly international trend .
labels on trousers , t-shirts , belts and hats disclose many different origins : made in china , made in bangladesh , made in turkey and made in romania .
not one says made in germany . moving to another floor , the story is the same .
even the world famous steiff animals , cuddly toys associated with high-quality german manufacturing processes , carry the label : " produced in china under quality control of steiff germany " . " made in germany " not the whole story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the consumer generally does not have the possibility to find out where the product has been produced , " says holger brackemann from german standards watchdog stiftung warentest .
" the famous ' made in germany ' label , that they may find on textiles and other products , may not be the whole truth , that it may not have been produced here from the first through to the last manufacturing step . " the government 's statement that künast was looking to prevent worker exploitation and child labor in foreign countries by urging germans to buy locally produced , in theory , is a good example of trying to kill two birds with one stone .
on the one hand , promoting german goods is a tick for trying to protect jobs at home while trying to put pressure on countries that use child labor is stab at promoting an ethical foreign policy . german consumers want quality items bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but do german consumers know about the origins of their products or whether ethical practices were used in their production ?
do they even care ? when asked if she takes any notice of where products are produced , one shopper in bonn replied : " no , not at all . "
another added : " i shop for quality .
quality goods not only come from germany .
and germany makes a lot of rubbish as well . " another shopper said : " i look first at the quality and then at the price , and then if i decide if buying this is worthwhile , then i get it .
the country of origin does n't really feature . " " the argument about child labor is an important one , " says one man .
" but they must also earn their money .
not buying the products may actually endanger that . " it seems that in this election year , the issue will not be where the products come from but whether or not consumers will have enough money in their pockets to buy anything . christoph hasselbach -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de is " made in germany " losing its luster ?

renate künast champions made in germany the green party 's renate künast was accused of protectionism after her opening statements of the election campaign urged voters to buy german products .
in reality , quality rather than origin matters most to consumers . in germany , the social democrat-green coalition is fighting for its political life in the coming federal election .
some politicians are championing unusual policies in their attempts to boost their parties ' popularity with the electorate .
consumer protection minister renate künast is one . künast has positioned herself on the side of german manufacturers and by doing so has also placed herself in the cross hairs of the media .
proclaiming her allegiance and support for german products , the green party minister appeared in the popular sunday newspaper bild am sonntag to urge her compatriots to buy domestically produced goods and help protect the jobs of fellow germans . the move backfired and künast was accused of protectionism .
in an attempt to calm the stormy waters , a government statement attempted to spin the story into something a little more palatable .
künast was not calling for a boycott of foreign goods , it claimed , but for an environment where workers ' rights are upheld and child labor abroad is not rewarded . but what do the consumers of germany think about künast 's rallying call to " buy german ? " cheap goods flooding german market bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : digging deeper past the ill-conceived initial rant , one finds a central argument to the minister 's call , one which has been a matter of debate for years : the trend toward discount products , especially food .
the no-frills product ranges have come under fire mainly due to the fact that they are produced in other countries where labor costs are cheaper but sold in germany . but does the consumer really have the choice to support german products ? in the bonn branch of the nationwide department store chain kaufhof , an investigation into the country of origin of most of the clothing available there reveals an overwhelmingly international trend .
labels on trousers , t-shirts , belts and hats disclose many different origins : made in china , made in bangladesh , made in turkey and made in romania .
not one says made in germany . moving to another floor , the story is the same .
even the world famous steiff animals , cuddly toys associated with high-quality german manufacturing processes , carry the label : " produced in china under quality control of steiff germany " . " made in germany " not the whole story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the consumer generally does not have the possibility to find out where the product has been produced , " says holger brackemann from german standards watchdog stiftung warentest .
" the famous ' made in germany ' label , that they may find on textiles and other products , may not be the whole truth , that it may not have been produced here from the first through to the last manufacturing step . " the government 's statement that künast was looking to prevent worker exploitation and child labor in foreign countries by urging germans to buy locally produced , in theory , is a good example of trying to kill two birds with one stone .
on the one hand , promoting german goods is a tick for trying to protect jobs at home while trying to put pressure on countries that use child labor is stab at promoting an ethical foreign policy . german consumers want quality items bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but do german consumers know about the origins of their products or whether ethical practices were used in their production ?

" the government 's statement that künast was looking to prevent worker exploitation and child labor in foreign countries by urging germans to buy locally produced , in theory , is a good example of trying to kill two birds with one stone .
on the one hand , promoting german goods is a tick for trying to protect jobs at home while trying to put pressure on countries that use child labor is stab at promoting an ethical foreign policy . german consumers want quality items bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but do german consumers know about the origins of their products or whether ethical practices were used in their production ?
do they even care ? when asked if she takes any notice of where products are produced , one shopper in bonn replied : " no , not at all . "
another added : " i shop for quality .
quality goods not only come from germany .
and germany makes a lot of rubbish as well . " another shopper said : " i look first at the quality and then at the price , and then if i decide if buying this is worthwhile , then i get it .
the country of origin does n't really feature . " " the argument about child labor is an important one , " says one man .
" but they must also earn their money .
not buying the products may actually endanger that . " it seems that in this election year , the issue will not be where the products come from but whether or not consumers will have enough money in their pockets to buy anything . christoph hasselbach -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de is " made in germany " losing its luster ?

economics minister wolfgang clement called zimmermann 's suggestion " infeasible and excessive . "
he said he supports the suggestion made by a special government commission of experts , which would see the retirement age gradually raised to 67 . such suggestions have caused some older spd supporters to switch their allegiance to the left party , the new alliance of the reformed communist party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- and left-wing groups .

spd presents election manifesto germany -pipe- 12.08.2005 getting the gray vote großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a powerful target group senior citizens make up a third of the german electorate and are being wooed by all the parties .
but when it comes to one of the issues that concerns them - pensions - they do n't think any one party has the answers . the elderly are an important target group in september 's election , but none of the parties have easy answers for the issues they 're most concerned about - pensions and the rising cost of health care and medication . the current government coalition of social democrats and greens introduced tough reforms which have also affected pensioners , but given germany 's massive public debt , the opposition parties would also have to make cutbacks if they came to power . raising the retirement age bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the discussion about the difficulty in funding germany 's pension system in future again took center stage this week following a suggestion by the president of the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- , klaus f. zimmermann , to raise the age of retirement to 70 from its current 65 . political parties , unions and pension insurers have all heaped criticism on the idea .
economics minister wolfgang clement called zimmermann 's suggestion " infeasible and excessive . "
he said he supports the suggestion made by a special government commission of experts , which would see the retirement age gradually raised to 67 . such suggestions have caused some older spd supporters to switch their allegiance to the left party , the new alliance of the reformed communist party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- and left-wing groups .
two-thirds of left party members are over 60 .
the senior citizens ' working groups meet regularly and carry authority .
their main recruits are elderly people in eastern germany . left party gaining senior support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left party is attracting senior voters " i believe that a very specific problem for older people in the east is that not only do they have the impression that the contributions they have made to society are not valued , but there is also proof that it is so , " said ernst bienert of the left party 's senior citizens group . seniors who remain loyal to the spd are also hitting the campaign trail , in part to refute the notion that only the spd is to blame for the pensions crisis and other social crises facing the country . " all of these developments , which resulted from compromises made during the committee stage , were frequently laid at the door of the spd , and we have to explain that and tell people how it really happened , " said hermann bokelmann of the spd 's 60-plus group . there has been no talk of cutting pensions in the election campaigns as yet , but it 's clear that future generations of pensioners will receive barely more than the level of social welfare from the government .
in comparison to those future generations , today 's pensioners are well-off .

he previously worked in a number of state schools in britain before coming to bonn in the mid-1990s , where he has been a member of the senior management at the school since it opened in 1997 .
dw-world : how is germa n y doi n g i n your opi n io n ?
peter murphy : i believe that germany is still in a relatively strong economic position .
the challenges being faced by many countries of unemployment continue to cause pressures for the government - a situation that does not seem to be likely to improve in the short term .
i believe that there is a need for a critical review of how the economy can be stimulated .
with a willingness to be flexible and more responsive to " external forces , " i believe there is room for the types of change that would lead to an increase in social and economic stability .
when recruiting internationally , i often hear of germany being referred to as a " hardship assignment country " - an image that i do not share , but see as a major challenge to be addressed by future governments .
globalization is not a concept that can be ignored in the hope that one day it will go away .
what n eeds to happe n i n germa n y to help speed up the cou n try 's recovery ?
i would hope that the elected government would use their wisdom to create a better , fairer , more sustainable society for us all to live in .
i would hope to see tolerance and support for groups and individuals less fortunate than ourselves put more significantly on the agenda .
i would like young and old alike to feel that the future had something to offer and that they had something to contribute - a sense of worth .
societies are , in my opinion , successful when people feel that they have something to contribute .
high levels of unemployment , uncertainties about the future , worries about coping in retirement do not lead to economic growth and development .
the government has a challenge to make change attractive and the norm .
gerhard schröder or a n gela merkel ?
who is your perso n al choice for cha n cellor ?
why ?
i would like to see a change , and believe that angela merkel would bring an interesting perspective to a still very male-dominated culture .
what do you like about germa n y ?
in the context of education policies , it 's positive that there is a recognition that something needs to change .
what do you dislike about germa n y ?
the lack of critically challenging debate about what needs to change perhaps due to the difficulties in pushing through major social reform . ranty islam interviewed peter murphy send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de focus on education click here for dw-world 's collection of in-depth stories on education issues in germany .
education and research goethe , einstein , nietzsche - germany was once called the nation of poets and philosophers .
today , the country is faced with some of the lowest education standards in europe .
what do the political parties propose to do ?
-lrb- july 26 , 2005 -rrb- east german school outshines competitors east germany discarded the socialist rule that all of its citizens were equal when it came to select schools .
only one such school remains .
could germany learn from it ?

he previously worked in a number of state schools in britain before coming to bonn in the mid-1990s , where he has been a member of the senior management at the school since it opened in 1997 .
dw-world : how is germa n y doi n g i n your opi n io n ?
peter murphy : i believe that germany is still in a relatively strong economic position .
the challenges being faced by many countries of unemployment continue to cause pressures for the government - a situation that does not seem to be likely to improve in the short term .
i believe that there is a need for a critical review of how the economy can be stimulated .
with a willingness to be flexible and more responsive to " external forces , " i believe there is room for the types of change that would lead to an increase in social and economic stability .
when recruiting internationally , i often hear of germany being referred to as a " hardship assignment country " - an image that i do not share , but see as a major challenge to be addressed by future governments .
globalization is not a concept that can be ignored in the hope that one day it will go away .
what n eeds to happe n i n germa n y to help speed up the cou n try 's recovery ?
i would hope that the elected government would use their wisdom to create a better , fairer , more sustainable society for us all to live in .
i would hope to see tolerance and support for groups and individuals less fortunate than ourselves put more significantly on the agenda .
i would like young and old alike to feel that the future had something to offer and that they had something to contribute - a sense of worth .
societies are , in my opinion , successful when people feel that they have something to contribute .
high levels of unemployment , uncertainties about the future , worries about coping in retirement do not lead to economic growth and development .
the government has a challenge to make change attractive and the norm .

dw-world : how is germa n y doi n g i n your opi n io n ?
peter murphy : i believe that germany is still in a relatively strong economic position .
the challenges being faced by many countries of unemployment continue to cause pressures for the government - a situation that does not seem to be likely to improve in the short term .
i believe that there is a need for a critical review of how the economy can be stimulated .
with a willingness to be flexible and more responsive to " external forces , " i believe there is room for the types of change that would lead to an increase in social and economic stability .
when recruiting internationally , i often hear of germany being referred to as a " hardship assignment country " - an image that i do not share , but see as a major challenge to be addressed by future governments .
globalization is not a concept that can be ignored in the hope that one day it will go away .
what n eeds to happe n i n germa n y to help speed up the cou n try 's recovery ?
i would hope that the elected government would use their wisdom to create a better , fairer , more sustainable society for us all to live in .
i would hope to see tolerance and support for groups and individuals less fortunate than ourselves put more significantly on the agenda .
i would like young and old alike to feel that the future had something to offer and that they had something to contribute - a sense of worth .

"
in late november , she 'll be back in the capital with a christmas show at a cabaret tent that sits right next to the federal chancellery .
" we 'll see who 's in there when i get there , " she said . dw-world : how is germa n y doi n g i n your opi n io n ? gayle tufts : poor germany 's having a hard time right now .
it 's holding its head down like a sad sack .
it 's a shame when bad things happen to good people .
the country 's just gotten over the trauma of the war - it really worked hard on that .
people have done their verga n ge n heitsbewältigu n g -lrb- eds : dealing with the past -rrb- .
they got through reunification - who would have ever thought that reunification would have gone so well in a country that 's so regimented .
of course it 's shocking and the reality of it is now catching up with germans .
maybe unification with luxembourg or italy would have been easier , because people there are more flexible .
germans like things to go the way they 're supposed to go .
they like their trains to run on time .
what n eeds to happe n i n germa n y to help speed up the cou n try 's recovery ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a politician that 's more to tufts ' liking the situation here reminds me of my older brother , who lives in boston and has been unemployed for four years .
i tell him , " you should have gone to college when you had the chance , you should n't have drunk so much beer , hanging out with friends , watching baseball . "
unfortunately , something has to change .
you ca n't live in a country with this much unemployment .
somebody is going to break the unions that are so strong here .
it 's not going to be possible in the global world to have this kind of protection that workers have here .
the hope is that there will be people who can do it in a human enough fashion .
people want things to be perfect , but it 's not going to be perfect .
the challenge for leaders will be to find a way to make the best of an imperfect situation .
gerhard schröder or angela merkel ?
who is your perso n al choice for cha n cellor ?
why ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dancing with berlin 's mayor , klaus wowereit i ca n't vote here , so i kind of tend to stay out of it .
but i hope people vote , i hope that people who are a bit cynical about what the spd and the greens have achieved still go out and vote and do n't say , " it does n't matter . " i 'm for schröder .
he 's a good guy .
he 's human .
i 'm all for the me n schliche ka n didate n -lrb- human candidates -rrb- .
my favorites are -lrb- german foreign minister -rrb- joschka fischer and -lrb- berlin mayor klaus -rrb- wowereit .
i do n't know much about -lrb- merkel -rrb- , but i do n't see her as a very warm person .
it 's as if she fulfills all the criteria - she 's a woman , she 's from the east , but does that mean that she 's the right person ?
on the other hand - the poor woman : there are more things written about her hair than her agenda .
i would not want to be in her shoes , whatever they may be .
what do you like about germa n y ? i like the honesty .
germans can be incredibly honest and everything is very deep .
there are stupid things on television , but the next day you have 12 commentaries in the newspaper and everybody 's talking about it .
people like to chew things over .
i have personally profited from it , it has made me take myself more seriously . what do you dislike about germa n y ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gayle tufts this seriousness sometimes makes me crazy .
i want to tell people : " lighten up !
be a little more friendly ! "
i miss the kind of laid-back american " how you doin ' ? "
i do n't like that people always say " no " first if it does n't fit into the plan .
it first has got to be thought about .
i see it in theater .
you have to let them know five months ahead that you want a certain type of microphone - that 's the kind of lack of spontaneity that makes me crazy . mathis winkler interviewed gayle tufts send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dealing with denglish click here for dw-world 's dossier on mixing german with english .
the players dw-world takes a detailed look at each party 's top candidates , where they 've been and where they could be going .
opinion : what germany needs as germany heads toward early elections this fall , voters will decide whether they want chancellor gerhard schröder or opposition leader angela merkel .
but dw-world 's marc young is n't sure if germans know what they need .

spd presents election manifesto germany -pipe- 12.08.2005 getting the gray vote großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a powerful target group senior citizens make up a third of the german electorate and are being wooed by all the parties .
but when it comes to one of the issues that concerns them - pensions - they do n't think any one party has the answers . the elderly are an important target group in september 's election , but none of the parties have easy answers for the issues they 're most concerned about - pensions and the rising cost of health care and medication . the current government coalition of social democrats and greens introduced tough reforms which have also affected pensioners , but given germany 's massive public debt , the opposition parties would also have to make cutbacks if they came to power . raising the retirement age bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the discussion about the difficulty in funding germany 's pension system in future again took center stage this week following a suggestion by the president of the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- , klaus f. zimmermann , to raise the age of retirement to 70 from its current 65 . political parties , unions and pension insurers have all heaped criticism on the idea .
economics minister wolfgang clement called zimmermann 's suggestion " infeasible and excessive . "
he said he supports the suggestion made by a special government commission of experts , which would see the retirement age gradually raised to 67 . such suggestions have caused some older spd supporters to switch their allegiance to the left party , the new alliance of the reformed communist party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- and left-wing groups .
two-thirds of left party members are over 60 .
the senior citizens ' working groups meet regularly and carry authority .
their main recruits are elderly people in eastern germany . left party gaining senior support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left party is attracting senior voters " i believe that a very specific problem for older people in the east is that not only do they have the impression that the contributions they have made to society are not valued , but there is also proof that it is so , " said ernst bienert of the left party 's senior citizens group . seniors who remain loyal to the spd are also hitting the campaign trail , in part to refute the notion that only the spd is to blame for the pensions crisis and other social crises facing the country . " all of these developments , which resulted from compromises made during the committee stage , were frequently laid at the door of the spd , and we have to explain that and tell people how it really happened , " said hermann bokelmann of the spd 's 60-plus group . there has been no talk of cutting pensions in the election campaigns as yet , but it 's clear that future generations of pensioners will receive barely more than the level of social welfare from the government .
in comparison to those future generations , today 's pensioners are well-off .
nevertheless , opinion polls suggest that most pensioners want to see a change in government . up to 60 percent plan to vote for the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , even though they do n't believe that leader angela merkel has the answers to their problems . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de east germans disappointed by reunification east germany in 1989 was in the midst of a peaceful revolution .

the elegant limestone figure dating from 1347 bc was removed from its plinth in 1939 to protect it from bombing .
during the division of the city during the cold war , it was displayed in a museum at the schloss charlottenburg palace in west berlin .
overnight friday , the world-famous bust returned to the museum island complex in the east of the reunified capital ahead of the opening of a special exhibition of egyptian artifacts at the city 's old museum on saturday .
then in 2009 , nefertiti will move into the neighboring , freshly renovated new museum .
cairo and berlin have frequently crossed swords over the beautiful nefertiti , which was unearthed by german archaeologist ludwig borchardt and removed from the country .
germany has based its claim to the work on a 1913 agreement which granted nefertiti and a number of other important artifacts to their discoverers . dw-world.de berlin prepares for top drawer art shows after the monumental moma show , berlin 's museums are gearing up for further art highlights in 2005 : from german artist menzel , spanish master goya , the bust of nefertiti to the 60th anniversary of the end of wwii .

traditionally the start of the season , the glorious twelfth , is usually marked with thousands taking to the moors .
but tick infestations and an outbreak of parasitic worms have led to bird stocks being reduced by as much as 50-90 % , the moorland association says .
as a result few shoots on upland estates in england and scotland are expected to get under way later . "
the breeding success of the grouse has been very poor in most areas " colin sheddon british association for shooting and conservation thousands of birds have died in the last three months due to an outbreak of parasitic worms in the birds ' guts .
as a consequence , shoots have been cancelled and rural communities which partly depend on the sport to attract visitors could lose vital income .
scottish director of the british association for shooting and conservation colin sheddon said that unseasonably cold and wet weather played a major part in the poor grouse numbers .
" in general we are looking at the worst year in perhaps the last 10 years , while in england they are saying it 's the worst in 50 .
" the breeding success of the grouse has been very poor in most areas and the general picture is that cold , wet weather at the end of may and beginning of june has had an adverse effect . "
' mixed bag ' high levels of ticks may be related to the warmer winter weather , he said .
" generally speaking , it was n't cold enough in the winter and it was too cold in may and june , " he added .
chairman of the moorland association simon bostock said some grouse counters had reported seeing fewer than 10 birds in areas where they would normally see more than 300 .
on the moors above hawnby in north yorkshire that flooded in june , it is thought that many birds would have been simply washed away .
' vulnerable ' south deeside and west perthshire are the worst hit areas in scotland , according to scottish director of the game conservancy trust ian mccoll .
he said : " we do grouse counts in sample areas from the middle of july and these two areas were the worst i 've counted in about 10 years . "
mr mccoll said hotels would feel the force of the blow , as fewer people came for the shoots , and that it would have a knock-on effect on " vulnerable communities " .
but mr mccoll also described this year 's season as a " very mixed bag " .
some estates boasted good numbers while their neighbours experience the opposite , he added .

a further five airlines have been affected by the disruption .
we simply can not mount a robust operation any earlier sir rod eddington ba chief executive watch the interview these are sri lankan airlines , finnair , gb airways , british mediterranean airlines and qantas , which are also serviced by ba ground staff .
earlier talks with the transport and general workers union aimed at reinstating 600 sacked staff from the caterers that serve ba flights , gate gourmet , broke down without agreement .
ba chief executive rod eddington apologised to passengers and called for more talks to begin urgently between the tgwu and gate gourmet .
the catering firm said the door was open , but the union said it could not see a way forward .
out of place sir rod said ba was forced to cancel so many flights because it did not have " sufficient airport staff to operate flights into or out of heathrow " .
some 70,000 passengers are affected by cancellations nearly 100 ba aircraft and 1,000 pilots and cabin crew are in the wrong places around the world , he said .
" we simply can not mount a robust operation any earlier .
" it is a matter of huge disappointment that we have become embroiled in an issue which is not a dispute with british airways and disrupted thousands of people who were about to take their hard-earned summer holidays .
he urged the tgwu to encourage its members " to put our customers first and go back to their work places " .
flights diverted the dispute began when gate gourmet dismissed 600 staff after an unofficial strike on wednesday over the company 's restructuring plans .

he urged passengers due to travel on friday not to turn up at the airport , but to contact the airline or their travel agent to arrange a refund or to rebook their travel plans .

research by the welsh edition of the times educational supplement says there is a backlog of repairs in more than half of all welsh local authorities .
it claims buildings at one in five secondary schools are below standard .
the assembly government said almost £ 630m had been spent on repairs and the shortfall should be cleared by 2010 .
the times educational supplement -lrb- tes cymru -rrb- survey found the repairs needed in 14 of wales ' 22 local authorities totalled £ 500m .
the other eight authorities did not contribute to the research but , by averaging out the figures , tes cymru has estimated the total bill for wales is £ 785m .
repairs backlog carmarthenshire : £ 20m gwynedd : £ 25m newport : £ 25m pembrokeshire : £ 25m denbighshire : £ 37m rhondda cynon taf : £ 55m powys : £ 60m cardiff : £ 67m vale of glamorgan : £ 87m wrexham : £ 90m monmouthshire : £ 130m the cost of building repairs to make schools " fit for purpose " ranged from £ 25m in pembrokeshire to £ 130m for monmouthshire .
the bill included adaptations and additions that local education authorities would need to make to their schools to comply with disability access laws .
the study comes after the 2005 report by the welsh schools inspection service , estyn , found the condition of secondary schools is ' good ' or ' very good ' in only a quarter of cases .
a welsh assembly government spokesperson said : " we were committed to invest £ 560m over the lifetime of this assembly to improve school buildings .
" this commitment has been more than met with investment already standing at £ 629m .
" all authorities in wales receive significant assembly support for improvements to buildings and associated facilities in schools .
" this level of investment is beginning to have an impact on the state of schools buildings , though there is still significant work to be done .
" over the autumn we will be reviewing the position with each authority against the 2010 target . "

repairs backlog carmarthenshire : £ 20m gwynedd : £ 25m newport : £ 25m pembrokeshire : £ 25m denbighshire : £ 37m rhondda cynon taf : £ 55m powys : £ 60m cardiff : £ 67m vale of glamorgan : £ 87m wrexham : £ 90m monmouthshire : £ 130m the cost of building repairs to make schools " fit for purpose " ranged from £ 25m in pembrokeshire to £ 130m for monmouthshire .
the bill included adaptations and additions that local education authorities would need to make to their schools to comply with disability access laws .
the study comes after the 2005 report by the welsh schools inspection service , estyn , found the condition of secondary schools is ' good ' or ' very good ' in only a quarter of cases .
a welsh assembly government spokesperson said : " we were committed to invest £ 560m over the lifetime of this assembly to improve school buildings .
" this commitment has been more than met with investment already standing at £ 629m .
" all authorities in wales receive significant assembly support for improvements to buildings and associated facilities in schools .
" this level of investment is beginning to have an impact on the state of schools buildings , though there is still significant work to be done .
" over the autumn we will be reviewing the position with each authority against the 2010 target . "

instead they are being asked to donate to the alternative giving campaign run by brighton and hove council which provides services to the homeless .
the charity aims to help beggars obtain treatment and get off the streets .
collection boxes will be placed across the sussex city including , shops , churchill square and brighton station .
' could be fatal ' posters displaying the message do n't kill with kindness will also appear on leaflets and posters throughout the city .
councillor ken bodfish said : " we appreciate that people often want to help beggars on the city 's streets .
" sadly , most have a drinking or drug addiction - and giving them money will feed that addiction , sometimes fatally .
" it 's far more useful to give that money to specialised charities which work to help them get away from begging into a safer environment and a more positive future . "
so far the council 's community safety team has achieved a 91 % reduction in the number of beggars in the city and the team hopes this latest campaign will reduce the number further .

a full year of growth would mark japan 's return to something approaching economic health .
2004 had begun and ended well , but had produced contraction between march and september .
several other indicators seem to point to better times ahead too , such as a reduction in the debt of companies going bankrupt by 16 % from the previous year , falling joblessness , and a rise in corporate investment and private consumption .
this last trend is seen as vital in a country where domestic demand , dogged by falling prices and a precarious employment market , has flagged for a decade or more .

a british medical journal paper criticised the press for their reliance on personal stories and blurring the lines between retention and donation .
researchers found donations to the uk tumour bank halved at the height of the alder hey scandal .
in 1999 it was revealed doctors at the liverpool children 's hospital had kept dead babies ' organs without consent .
the scandal was widely reported , reaching a peak when the official inquiry report was published at the beginning of 2001 .
other hospitals also got caught up in the retention scandal , which refers to the taking of a dead person 's organ without the consent of families , compared to donation which is when the patient or family agrees to having tissue samples or organs taken for research purposes .
before the news emerged , the tumour bank - which relies for its research on families of child cancer patients consenting to tissue samples being taken - was receiving more than 400 donations a year . "
i think scientists and health professionals find it difficult to communicate with the press " dr meryl aldridge , media expert in the last six months of 2001 donations dropped to under 100 , the study by nottingham , leicester and brunel universities and the institute of cancer research found .
the researchers , who also looked at other hospitals who got caught up in organ retention controversies , said the lines had become blurred between donation and retention .
that meant , they said , that anything to do with body parts and tissues had been associated with the scandal .
in one case , a story about the routine removal of thymus glands from children during heart surgery was depicted as repeating the errors of organ retention .
the study did not identify the paper responsible .
newspapers were also attacked for their use of individual stories to illustrate organ retention , citing a daily mail article in may 2000 which told the story of a burial .
but the study also suggested medical staff may have contributed to the drop in donations , saying anecdotal evidence indicated healthcare professionals were deterred from asking for donations during the scandal .
donation by 2004 the donation numbers had recovered to above their 1999 levels .
report co-author dr mary dixon-woods said : " newspaper coverage of organ retention scandals certainly hurt tissue donation , which is completely separate .
" i think this shows that media reporting of science can have important implications for those who conduct and regulate science . "
but dr meryl aldridge , a media expert at the university of nottingham , said medics should also accept some blame .
" i think scientists and health professionals find it difficult to communicate with the press .
they do not understand their needs and the way they work so sometimes they do n't get their point across . "
she also said it was unrealistic to expect the press not to use personal stories , but said problems emerged when the media used the " exceptional , to illustrate the typical " .

a british medical journal paper criticised the press for their reliance on personal stories and blurring the lines between retention and donation .
researchers found donations to the uk tumour bank halved at the height of the alder hey scandal .
in 1999 it was revealed doctors at the liverpool children 's hospital had kept dead babies ' organs without consent .
the scandal was widely reported , reaching a peak when the official inquiry report was published at the beginning of 2001 .
other hospitals also got caught up in the retention scandal , which refers to the taking of a dead person 's organ without the consent of families , compared to donation which is when the patient or family agrees to having tissue samples or organs taken for research purposes .
before the news emerged , the tumour bank - which relies for its research on families of child cancer patients consenting to tissue samples being taken - was receiving more than 400 donations a year .
i think scientists and health professionals find it difficult to communicate with the press dr meryl aldridge , media expert in the last six months of 2001 donations dropped to under 100 , the study by nottingham , leicester and brunel universities and the institute of cancer research found .
the researchers , who also looked at other hospitals who got caught up in organ retention controversies , said the lines had become blurred between donation and retention .
that meant , they said , that anything to do with body parts and tissues had been associated with the scandal .
in one case , a story about the routine removal of thymus glands from children during heart surgery was depicted as repeating the errors of organ retention .
the study did not identify the paper responsible .
newspapers were also attacked for their use of individual stories to illustrate organ retention , citing a daily mail article in may 2000 which told the story of a burial .
but the study also suggested medical staff may have contributed to the drop in donations , saying anecdotal evidence indicated healthcare professionals were deterred from asking for donations during the scandal .
donation by 2004 the donation numbers had recovered to above their 1999 levels .
report co-author dr mary dixon-woods said : " newspaper coverage of organ retention scandals certainly hurt tissue donation , which is completely separate .
" i think this shows that media reporting of science can have important implications for those who conduct and regulate science . "
but dr meryl aldridge , a media expert at the university of nottingham , said medics should also accept some blame .

the 8,000 jewish settlers will , according to the government , be moved from their homes into israel by force if necessary .
but among the settlers are a highly unusual group of approximately 250 people , originally from north-east india , who call themselves the bnei menashe .
they converted to judaism believing themselves to be descendants of one of the ancient lost tribes of israel - and moved to jewish settlements in gaza and the west bank .
they now face another move and an uncertain future .
conversion one of the bnei menashe is joshua benjamin . "
the people who know you over here in this place , they have a good hospitality towards you " joshua benjamin with his skull-cap and the ritual tassels on his belt worn by orthodox jews , he appears like many others in the religious settlement where he lives in gaza .
he shows off pictures of his life in israel - holidays with children and festivals with friends .
but his story is different from most here .
mr benjamin has come a long way from his original home in manipur , an area in north-east india , close to the border with burma .
" i do believe that i am the descendant of the lost tribe of bnei menashe .
on top of that , even if we were not that , i had gone under true conversion and with this conversion , i am a jew . "
the conversion was 10 years ago and mr benjamin came to israel with hundreds of other bnei menashe .
he believes that despite his asian features , his roots lie with the jewish people .
mr benjamin says at first the differences made them feel a little awkward .
" but then when you start living here about three or four years and studying judaism and live a jewish life , you feel as you always belongs here and the people who know you over here in this place , they have a good hospitality towards you . "
the bnei menashe are close-knit ; sharing a common experience and a common language , mizo .
the head of the 1,000-strong community in israel - some live in gaza , the rest in the west bank - is yoel ilan .
mr ilan says they feel particularly at home in these areas , where the people have " looked after us with warmth and have helped us with everything we have needed " .
testing time now the prospect of moving from gaza is casting a long shadow . "
-lsb- the bnei -rsb- say to me , you have parents and family here .
you have somewhere to stay .
we do n't " liana hirschtick , community worker in gaza liana hirschtick , who has worked for years assisting the community in gaza , says the move will affect the bnei menashe harder .
" their situation affects them much more .
they came here and integrated and underwent a process that was n't easy and now , they are being taken to another place and they face the same thing again .
" they say to me , you have parents and family here .
you have somewhere to stay .
we do n't . "
joshua benjamin is getting on with his routine as normal - going to work in a printing shop as he waits for the disengagement to take place .
" i grew up living as a jew and i had my conversion in israel when i came here , " he says .
" this israel is my home and it will be my home forever . "
the bnei menashe in gaza say this is a testing time but they say it will draw them closer to their faith and their roots .
