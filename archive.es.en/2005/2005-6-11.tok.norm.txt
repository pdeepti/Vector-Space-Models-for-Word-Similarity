the move is just one more example of how the new german capital moves away from its post-war past . an 18-month stand-off between supporters of a counter-culture project and city officials came to an end this week after police removed the 60 residents of a white tenement block in berlin 's kreuzberg district , dismantling on of the last alternative living projects that sprung up in post-world war west berlin . hundreds of people watched as police cleared out the " yorck 59 " building , as the squatter 's building has been known since 1989 .
later monday evening , hundreds demonstrated in a peaceful march through the neighborhood holding banners that read , " capitalism must go , " and " yorck street stays . " in reaction to the eviction , about 20 people took control of another kreuzberg building across the neighborhood to try to get yorck 59 back .
police successfully evicted them shortly after , officials said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a rebel still revered by some the name is taken after the address , yorckstrasse 59 , or 59 yorck street in a district that has been known for its student and left-wing subculture and became part of mainstream culture .
yorck 59 provided a roof for 60 residents including 10 children and alternative groups such as those fighting racism , globalization and economic reform . no amicable solution found in decades following the war , a number of alternative groups sprung up as left-wing radicalism , pacifism and even anarchism became a reaction to post-war prosperity and conservatism . many such alternative living arrangements died in the years following the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 as the city and private entrepreneurs bought up property and began gentrifying neighborhoods .
problems for the left-wing project started when a hamburg businessman bought the building in 2003 and raised the rent .
residents refused to pay the increase , saying they could n't afford it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clashes with police are rarely about buildings anymore city officials and residents tried to find a solution , including an alternative building but failed to come to an agreement . " there was no amicable solution found between the landlord and residents , " said berlin senator ehrhart körting . the city 's efforts were " inadequate , " resident jens schildmann told reuters . legal consequences and now , former residents and their supporters face legal consequences .
the owner of the building is suing those who barricaded themselves in the building for damages and rent totaling 90,000 euros -lrb- $ 110,000 -rrb- . similar alternative communities have been dismantled around germany and most famously , in neighboring denmark .
last year , denmark 's conservative government voted to dismantle the counterculture neighborhood of christiana , where hundreds of people have lived for free for decades - on 80 acres of prime real estate belong to the government .
now , the government wants to tear down existing buildings and use the property for luxury apartments . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans protest against corporate greed more than half a million people across germany on sunday took part in traditional labor day rallies to protest against large-scale unemployment and greedy managers .

agfa , once a top film company , is finding out that if it does not conform , it will only become a niche player in the photo industry . the stomachs of employees from agfaphoto must have turned a little uneasy when the eu commission announced its latest initiative in june : " the initiative i2010 should create new jobs in the it-branch and in the media . " while the word " digital " does not appear directly in the initiative , the concept is certainly included as the world becomes more and more digitalized .

" the photo industry has something for everybody .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 11.06.2005 dead by digital ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the agfa film company did n't recognize the digital trend digital photography is exerting more and more pressure on traditional celluloid film .
agfa , once a top film company , is finding out that if it does not conform , it will only become a niche player in the photo industry . the stomachs of employees from agfaphoto must have turned a little uneasy when the eu commission announced its latest initiative in june : " the initiative i2010 should create new jobs in the it-branch and in the media . " while the word " digital " does not appear directly in the initiative , the concept is certainly included as the world becomes more and more digitalized .
bits and bytes , software and hardware are now mainstays in most professional fields and in the photography industry it is no different .
2400 agfa workers , mostly in germany , have to wonder how much longer they will have a secure workplace . one thing is certain : agfa is bankrupt and creditors are now standing in line to receive payment . pressure growing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the digital craze is sweeping the world .
here a billboard in china the number of digital camera owners is expanding exponentially .
in the year 2004 alone , the german photo industry association -lrb- piv -rrb- reported that 7 million of the 8.43 million cameras sold in germany .
in 2001 it was just 1.2 of 4.7 million . the piv is not commenting on supposed " victims of digitalization . " " there are differing reports , " press spokeswoman constanze clauss said .
" the photo industry has something for everybody .
but the simple fact is that if a camera dealer does not sell any digital cameras , then he has lost touch with the times . " the numbers speak for themselves .
the marketing research company idc expects until 2008 , the number of digital photos will increase 35 percent annually . " up to 80 percent of our sales are directly digital or somehow related with digital photography , " said harald remsperger a camera dealer in frankfurt am main . pockets of resistance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : classic single reflex cameras work just as well not everyone is jumping on the digital bandwagon .
professional photographers , for example .
or the aficionados who are not satisfied with the mass-photo developing services online or that drug stores and supermarkets provide . " of course lots of small photo dealers have had to close shop , but those who have adapted to the new market are surviving , " remsperger said . the transitional status from analog to digital also persists .
many households have both a digital and a camera in the traditional sense - and use them .
one market , the single use camera , is even expanding .
users bought 5.5 million disposable devices in 2004 , a 25 percent increase over the previous year . yet agfa 's core business , the sale of classic film to consumers , is dwindling quickly .
in 2004 , they suffered a loss in film sales of 18 percent over 2003 . no matter what happens in that branch , photographers want their prints , be them digital or analog on paper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the quality of cell phone camera 's is also increasing " people want to have the tactile feeling of having a photo in their hands , " said rolf hollander , chairman of the board of cewe color , europe 's largest film developer . hobby photographers who work with slides might like to digitalize them but that does n't mean the old-fashioned slide should be tossed . " digitalize yes , but definitely keep the old slides and prints , " piv spokeswoman clauss said .

agfa , once a top film company , is finding out that if it does not conform , it will only become a niche player in the photo industry . the stomachs of employees from agfaphoto must have turned a little uneasy when the eu commission announced its latest initiative in june : " the initiative i2010 should create new jobs in the it-branch and in the media . " while the word " digital " does not appear directly in the initiative , the concept is certainly included as the world becomes more and more digitalized .
bits and bytes , software and hardware are now mainstays in most professional fields and in the photography industry it is no different .
2400 agfa workers , mostly in germany , have to wonder how much longer they will have a secure workplace . one thing is certain : agfa is bankrupt and creditors are now standing in line to receive payment . pressure growing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the digital craze is sweeping the world .
here a billboard in china the number of digital camera owners is expanding exponentially .
in the year 2004 alone , the german photo industry association -lrb- piv -rrb- reported that 7 million of the 8.43 million cameras sold in germany .
in 2001 it was just 1.2 of 4.7 million . the piv is not commenting on supposed " victims of digitalization . " " there are differing reports , " press spokeswoman constanze clauss said .
" the photo industry has something for everybody .
but the simple fact is that if a camera dealer does not sell any digital cameras , then he has lost touch with the times . " the numbers speak for themselves .
the marketing research company idc expects until 2008 , the number of digital photos will increase 35 percent annually . " up to 80 percent of our sales are directly digital or somehow related with digital photography , " said harald remsperger a camera dealer in frankfurt am main . pockets of resistance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : classic single reflex cameras work just as well not everyone is jumping on the digital bandwagon .
professional photographers , for example .
or the aficionados who are not satisfied with the mass-photo developing services online or that drug stores and supermarkets provide . " of course lots of small photo dealers have had to close shop , but those who have adapted to the new market are surviving , " remsperger said . the transitional status from analog to digital also persists .
many households have both a digital and a camera in the traditional sense - and use them .
one market , the single use camera , is even expanding .
users bought 5.5 million disposable devices in 2004 , a 25 percent increase over the previous year . yet agfa 's core business , the sale of classic film to consumers , is dwindling quickly .
in 2004 , they suffered a loss in film sales of 18 percent over 2003 . no matter what happens in that branch , photographers want their prints , be them digital or analog on paper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the quality of cell phone camera 's is also increasing " people want to have the tactile feeling of having a photo in their hands , " said rolf hollander , chairman of the board of cewe color , europe 's largest film developer . hobby photographers who work with slides might like to digitalize them but that does n't mean the old-fashioned slide should be tossed . " digitalize yes , but definitely keep the old slides and prints , " piv spokeswoman clauss said .

" although the payment is in one sense largely symbolic , it has made a difference for many elderly and in some cases very needy people , " he said . only now has the issue been resolved . " i think this is probably the last claims and compensation effort that we will have to work on as a result of world war ii , " he added . each victim of slave labor has received nearly 7,700 euros -lrb- $ 9,333 -rrb- .
the sum is not huge , but has been a lifeline to many people who barely have enough money to survive . freeing up the funds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : funds for the german foundation " remembrance , responsibility and future " were provided in equal parts by german industry and the german government . more than 1.6 million people in over 100 countries so far have received payments of over four billion euros .
as a partner , iom has already compensated more than 15,000 people for property loss under the nazi regime . gunter saathoff , director of payments for the foundation , said iom is only one of seven partners responsible for making payments to victims of nazi oppression .
these include jews , gypsies , homosexuals , forced laborers and victims of medical experiments . according to him , 98 percent of all the money has been paid out and whatever funds remain when the program ends in september 2006 must be returned to the german foundation . " if there is money over from our payment programs , our board has made a decision that this should be used for special programs for the victims , especially medical care programs , " saathoff said . a chapter that will never be closed the chairman of the german foundation , hans-otto brautigam , said these compensation payments are a recognition by both the german government and its people of the immense suffering and injustice inflicted on the victims of the nazi regime . he acknowledged that this recognition is long overdue , but hoped it is not too late . " in a political and in a moral sense , this chapter will never be closed , " he said .
" what is at stake here - and this is the responsibility of our generation and future generations - is to keep these very tragic events , these human rights violations firmly in the national memory . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pasa balter , fourth from left , stands among a group of children wearing concentration camp uniforms behind barbed wire fencing as they were liberated from the nazi concentration camp at auschwitz , poland , by russian soldiers in 1945 .

agfa , once a top film company , is finding out that if it does not conform , it will only become a niche player in the photo industry . the stomachs of employees from agfaphoto must have turned a little uneasy when the eu commission announced its latest initiative in june : " the initiative i2010 should create new jobs in the it-branch and in the media .

" june has always been our target , we have not given up .
we are confident that we have the two-third majority that we need but we 're also striving to have the largest possible support . " enlargement before september ? the general assembly of the united nations comprises 191 members , so a two-third majority is 128 votes .
the general assembly does not hold veto power , a privilege reserved for the five permanent members of the security council - china , the united states , france , britain and russia . " the schedule remains the end of june , there 's no change of that , " sen said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of the united nations general assembly will have to approve the enlargement the two diplomats affirmed that annan believes the enlargement of the security council should take place before the world summit in september , where participants are scheduled to adapt an ambitious reform program on the 60th anniversary of the creation of the world body . but since the draft resolutions began circulating , several countries including the united states have moved to put the brakes on it . " this particular issue is one we do n't want to have a deadline on , " a us diplomat who did not want to be identified told afp . us wary bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us secretary of state has not made a clear statement about whether her country would back other permanent members on the council the united states has publicly expressed support for japan 's candidacy but remains reserved about that of germany .
it has not yet taken a position on the g4 , merely repeating that they want reform to produce greater efficiency . china , for its part , is hostile to japan and firmly opposed to the g4 proposal , which it calls " dangerous , " likely to divide the un and derail reform . friday , pakistan 's ambassador munir akram echoed that stance .
asked by journalists what will happen if the g4 pushes for a vote at the end of the month , he said : " they 'll lose . " i think everybody is advising against a trainwreck happening , and that will happen if this draft is tabled and put to a vote , " he said .
" there will be a strong division here at the un , no matter who wins or loses .
so if you want to have that happen , divide the whole organization , derail the whole process , create tension , that 's the way to go .

" june has always been our target , we have not given up .
we are confident that we have the two-third majority that we need but we 're also striving to have the largest possible support . " enlargement before september ? the general assembly of the united nations comprises 191 members , so a two-third majority is 128 votes .
the general assembly does not hold veto power , a privilege reserved for the five permanent members of the security council - china , the united states , france , britain and russia .

it has not yet taken a position on the g4 , merely repeating that they want reform to produce greater efficiency . china , for its part , is hostile to japan and firmly opposed to the g4 proposal , which it calls " dangerous , " likely to divide the un and derail reform . friday , pakistan 's ambassador munir akram echoed that stance .
asked by journalists what will happen if the g4 pushes for a vote at the end of the month , he said : " they 'll lose . " i think everybody is advising against a trainwreck happening , and that will happen if this draft is tabled and put to a vote , " he said .
" there will be a strong division here at the un , no matter who wins or loses .
so if you want to have that happen , divide the whole organization , derail the whole process , create tension , that 's the way to go .

agfa , once a top film company , is finding out that if it does not conform , it will only become a niche player in the photo industry . the stomachs of employees from agfaphoto must have turned a little uneasy when the eu commission announced its latest initiative in june : " the initiative i2010 should create new jobs in the it-branch and in the media . " while the word " digital " does not appear directly in the initiative , the concept is certainly included as the world becomes more and more digitalized .
bits and bytes , software and hardware are now mainstays in most professional fields and in the photography industry it is no different .

" the photo industry has something for everybody .

agfa , once a top film company , is finding out that if it does not conform , it will only become a niche player in the photo industry . the stomachs of employees from agfaphoto must have turned a little uneasy when the eu commission announced its latest initiative in june : " the initiative i2010 should create new jobs in the it-branch and in the media . " while the word " digital " does not appear directly in the initiative , the concept is certainly included as the world becomes more and more digitalized .
bits and bytes , software and hardware are now mainstays in most professional fields and in the photography industry it is no different .
2400 agfa workers , mostly in germany , have to wonder how much longer they will have a secure workplace . one thing is certain : agfa is bankrupt and creditors are now standing in line to receive payment . pressure growing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the digital craze is sweeping the world .

in 2001 it was just 1.2 of 4.7 million . the piv is not commenting on supposed " victims of digitalization . " " there are differing reports , " press spokeswoman constanze clauss said .
" the photo industry has something for everybody .
but the simple fact is that if a camera dealer does not sell any digital cameras , then he has lost touch with the times . " the numbers speak for themselves .
the marketing research company idc expects until 2008 , the number of digital photos will increase 35 percent annually . " up to 80 percent of our sales are directly digital or somehow related with digital photography , " said harald remsperger a camera dealer in frankfurt am main . pockets of resistance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : classic single reflex cameras work just as well not everyone is jumping on the digital bandwagon .

or the aficionados who are not satisfied with the mass-photo developing services online or that drug stores and supermarkets provide . " of course lots of small photo dealers have had to close shop , but those who have adapted to the new market are surviving , " remsperger said . the transitional status from analog to digital also persists .
many households have both a digital and a camera in the traditional sense - and use them .
one market , the single use camera , is even expanding .
users bought 5.5 million disposable devices in 2004 , a 25 percent increase over the previous year . yet agfa 's core business , the sale of classic film to consumers , is dwindling quickly .
in 2004 , they suffered a loss in film sales of 18 percent over 2003 . no matter what happens in that branch , photographers want their prints , be them digital or analog on paper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the quality of cell phone camera 's is also increasing " people want to have the tactile feeling of having a photo in their hands , " said rolf hollander , chairman of the board of cewe color , europe 's largest film developer . hobby photographers who work with slides might like to digitalize them but that does n't mean the old-fashioned slide should be tossed . " digitalize yes , but definitely keep the old slides and prints , " piv spokeswoman clauss said .

the move is just one more example of how the new german capital moves away from its post-war past . an 18-month stand-off between supporters of a counter-culture project and city officials came to an end this week after police removed the 60 residents of a white tenement block in berlin 's kreuzberg district , dismantling on of the last alternative living projects that sprung up in post-world war west berlin . hundreds of people watched as police cleared out the " yorck 59 " building , as the squatter 's building has been known since 1989 .
later monday evening , hundreds demonstrated in a peaceful march through the neighborhood holding banners that read , " capitalism must go , " and " yorck street stays . " in reaction to the eviction , about 20 people took control of another kreuzberg building across the neighborhood to try to get yorck 59 back .
police successfully evicted them shortly after , officials said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a rebel still revered by some the name is taken after the address , yorckstrasse 59 , or 59 yorck street in a district that has been known for its student and left-wing subculture and became part of mainstream culture .
yorck 59 provided a roof for 60 residents including 10 children and alternative groups such as those fighting racism , globalization and economic reform . no amicable solution found in decades following the war , a number of alternative groups sprung up as left-wing radicalism , pacifism and even anarchism became a reaction to post-war prosperity and conservatism . many such alternative living arrangements died in the years following the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 as the city and private entrepreneurs bought up property and began gentrifying neighborhoods .
problems for the left-wing project started when a hamburg businessman bought the building in 2003 and raised the rent .
residents refused to pay the increase , saying they could n't afford it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clashes with police are rarely about buildings anymore city officials and residents tried to find a solution , including an alternative building but failed to come to an agreement . " there was no amicable solution found between the landlord and residents , " said berlin senator ehrhart körting . the city 's efforts were " inadequate , " resident jens schildmann told reuters . legal consequences and now , former residents and their supporters face legal consequences .
the owner of the building is suing those who barricaded themselves in the building for damages and rent totaling 90,000 euros -lrb- $ 110,000 -rrb- . similar alternative communities have been dismantled around germany and most famously , in neighboring denmark .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 11.06.2005 bidding farewell to berlin 's squatters großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin squatters have been protesting eviction for decades police this week evicted squatters of a famous tenement in berlin .
the move is just one more example of how the new german capital moves away from its post-war past . an 18-month stand-off between supporters of a counter-culture project and city officials came to an end this week after police removed the 60 residents of a white tenement block in berlin 's kreuzberg district , dismantling on of the last alternative living projects that sprung up in post-world war west berlin . hundreds of people watched as police cleared out the " yorck 59 " building , as the squatter 's building has been known since 1989 .
later monday evening , hundreds demonstrated in a peaceful march through the neighborhood holding banners that read , " capitalism must go , " and " yorck street stays . " in reaction to the eviction , about 20 people took control of another kreuzberg building across the neighborhood to try to get yorck 59 back .
police successfully evicted them shortly after , officials said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a rebel still revered by some the name is taken after the address , yorckstrasse 59 , or 59 yorck street in a district that has been known for its student and left-wing subculture and became part of mainstream culture .
yorck 59 provided a roof for 60 residents including 10 children and alternative groups such as those fighting racism , globalization and economic reform . no amicable solution found in decades following the war , a number of alternative groups sprung up as left-wing radicalism , pacifism and even anarchism became a reaction to post-war prosperity and conservatism . many such alternative living arrangements died in the years following the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 as the city and private entrepreneurs bought up property and began gentrifying neighborhoods .
problems for the left-wing project started when a hamburg businessman bought the building in 2003 and raised the rent .
residents refused to pay the increase , saying they could n't afford it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clashes with police are rarely about buildings anymore city officials and residents tried to find a solution , including an alternative building but failed to come to an agreement . " there was no amicable solution found between the landlord and residents , " said berlin senator ehrhart körting . the city 's efforts were " inadequate , " resident jens schildmann told reuters . legal consequences and now , former residents and their supporters face legal consequences .

" germany 's refusal to accept the dozen or so nazi war crimes suspects means that justice can not be fully carried out in their cases as us law does n't allow for them to be prosecuted for crimes committed outside the country .
they entered the united states illegally after the world war ii - illegally , because they claimed on their immigration forms that they were not collaborators with the nazi regime during the war . however , it was later shown in us courts that they were indeed involved . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inmates of the german kz buchenwald inside their barrack " by and large we 're talking about concentration camp guards , we 're talking about collaborators , people who were involved in indigenous police forces , that kind of thing , " said jonathan drimmer , the deputy director of the office of special investigations at the us department of justice , who has been following the cases . not enough proof ? germany , however , refuses to accept them .
asked by " monitor " reporters for the reason , german interior ministry officials said the us had not given enough proof that the suspects were war criminals , despite repeated requests from germany . deportation in such us court cases requires not criminal , but just civil , proceedings , with a burden of proof of " clear , convincing , and unequivocal evidence . " drimmer said that germany should accept the deportees , " pursuant to a written diplomatic promise that had been given in 1954 that people who had come into the united states illegally , who had misrepresented their nazi past to get into the united states , would be taken back by germany . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo-nazis in front of berlin 's brandenburg gate interior ministry officials in berlin countered that if germany accepted the deportees , they would be supported by the german social system and possibly would involve themselves in the extreme right or anti-semitic political activities .
the officials also said germany could n't accept the deportees because of concerns about how this might affect the development of germany 's jewish community . still , according to " monitor " staffers , there is a separate governmental office in germany which wants to go ahead with criminal proceedings against the suspects - the central office for the clarification of national socialist crimes , which is specifically responsible for coordinating prosecution of former nazis . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de belated recognition for forced laborers the international organization for migration has just completed final compensation payments to more than 80,000 survivors of slave and forced labor under the nazis in world war ii .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 11.06.2005 bidding farewell to berlin 's squatters großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin squatters have been protesting eviction for decades police this week evicted squatters of a famous tenement in berlin .
the move is just one more example of how the new german capital moves away from its post-war past . an 18-month stand-off between supporters of a counter-culture project and city officials came to an end this week after police removed the 60 residents of a white tenement block in berlin 's kreuzberg district , dismantling on of the last alternative living projects that sprung up in post-world war west berlin . hundreds of people watched as police cleared out the " yorck 59 " building , as the squatter 's building has been known since 1989 .
later monday evening , hundreds demonstrated in a peaceful march through the neighborhood holding banners that read , " capitalism must go , " and " yorck street stays . " in reaction to the eviction , about 20 people took control of another kreuzberg building across the neighborhood to try to get yorck 59 back .
police successfully evicted them shortly after , officials said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a rebel still revered by some the name is taken after the address , yorckstrasse 59 , or 59 yorck street in a district that has been known for its student and left-wing subculture and became part of mainstream culture .
yorck 59 provided a roof for 60 residents including 10 children and alternative groups such as those fighting racism , globalization and economic reform . no amicable solution found in decades following the war , a number of alternative groups sprung up as left-wing radicalism , pacifism and even anarchism became a reaction to post-war prosperity and conservatism . many such alternative living arrangements died in the years following the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 as the city and private entrepreneurs bought up property and began gentrifying neighborhoods .
problems for the left-wing project started when a hamburg businessman bought the building in 2003 and raised the rent .
residents refused to pay the increase , saying they could n't afford it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clashes with police are rarely about buildings anymore city officials and residents tried to find a solution , including an alternative building but failed to come to an agreement . " there was no amicable solution found between the landlord and residents , " said berlin senator ehrhart körting . the city 's efforts were " inadequate , " resident jens schildmann told reuters . legal consequences and now , former residents and their supporters face legal consequences .
the owner of the building is suing those who barricaded themselves in the building for damages and rent totaling 90,000 euros -lrb- $ 110,000 -rrb- . similar alternative communities have been dismantled around germany and most famously , in neighboring denmark .
last year , denmark 's conservative government voted to dismantle the counterculture neighborhood of christiana , where hundreds of people have lived for free for decades - on 80 acres of prime real estate belong to the government .
now , the government wants to tear down existing buildings and use the property for luxury apartments . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans protest against corporate greed more than half a million people across germany on sunday took part in traditional labor day rallies to protest against large-scale unemployment and greedy managers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 11.06.2005 dead by digital ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the agfa film company did n't recognize the digital trend digital photography is exerting more and more pressure on traditional celluloid film .
agfa , once a top film company , is finding out that if it does not conform , it will only become a niche player in the photo industry . the stomachs of employees from agfaphoto must have turned a little uneasy when the eu commission announced its latest initiative in june : " the initiative i2010 should create new jobs in the it-branch and in the media . " while the word " digital " does not appear directly in the initiative , the concept is certainly included as the world becomes more and more digitalized .
bits and bytes , software and hardware are now mainstays in most professional fields and in the photography industry it is no different .
2400 agfa workers , mostly in germany , have to wonder how much longer they will have a secure workplace . one thing is certain : agfa is bankrupt and creditors are now standing in line to receive payment . pressure growing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the digital craze is sweeping the world .
here a billboard in china the number of digital camera owners is expanding exponentially .
in the year 2004 alone , the german photo industry association -lrb- piv -rrb- reported that 7 million of the 8.43 million cameras sold in germany .
in 2001 it was just 1.2 of 4.7 million . the piv is not commenting on supposed " victims of digitalization . " " there are differing reports , " press spokeswoman constanze clauss said .
" the photo industry has something for everybody .
but the simple fact is that if a camera dealer does not sell any digital cameras , then he has lost touch with the times . " the numbers speak for themselves .
the marketing research company idc expects until 2008 , the number of digital photos will increase 35 percent annually . " up to 80 percent of our sales are directly digital or somehow related with digital photography , " said harald remsperger a camera dealer in frankfurt am main . pockets of resistance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : classic single reflex cameras work just as well not everyone is jumping on the digital bandwagon .
professional photographers , for example .
or the aficionados who are not satisfied with the mass-photo developing services online or that drug stores and supermarkets provide . " of course lots of small photo dealers have had to close shop , but those who have adapted to the new market are surviving , " remsperger said . the transitional status from analog to digital also persists .
many households have both a digital and a camera in the traditional sense - and use them .

" although the payment is in one sense largely symbolic , it has made a difference for many elderly and in some cases very needy people , " he said . only now has the issue been resolved . " i think this is probably the last claims and compensation effort that we will have to work on as a result of world war ii , " he added . each victim of slave labor has received nearly 7,700 euros -lrb- $ 9,333 -rrb- .
the sum is not huge , but has been a lifeline to many people who barely have enough money to survive . freeing up the funds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : funds for the german foundation " remembrance , responsibility and future " were provided in equal parts by german industry and the german government . more than 1.6 million people in over 100 countries so far have received payments of over four billion euros .
as a partner , iom has already compensated more than 15,000 people for property loss under the nazi regime . gunter saathoff , director of payments for the foundation , said iom is only one of seven partners responsible for making payments to victims of nazi oppression .
these include jews , gypsies , homosexuals , forced laborers and victims of medical experiments . according to him , 98 percent of all the money has been paid out and whatever funds remain when the program ends in september 2006 must be returned to the german foundation . " if there is money over from our payment programs , our board has made a decision that this should be used for special programs for the victims , especially medical care programs , " saathoff said . a chapter that will never be closed the chairman of the german foundation , hans-otto brautigam , said these compensation payments are a recognition by both the german government and its people of the immense suffering and injustice inflicted on the victims of the nazi regime . he acknowledged that this recognition is long overdue , but hoped it is not too late . " in a political and in a moral sense , this chapter will never be closed , " he said .
" what is at stake here - and this is the responsibility of our generation and future generations - is to keep these very tragic events , these human rights violations firmly in the national memory . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pasa balter , fourth from left , stands among a group of children wearing concentration camp uniforms behind barbed wire fencing as they were liberated from the nazi concentration camp at auschwitz , poland , by russian soldiers in 1945 .

the move is just one more example of how the new german capital moves away from its post-war past . an 18-month stand-off between supporters of a counter-culture project and city officials came to an end this week after police removed the 60 residents of a white tenement block in berlin 's kreuzberg district , dismantling on of the last alternative living projects that sprung up in post-world war west berlin . hundreds of people watched as police cleared out the " yorck 59 " building , as the squatter 's building has been known since 1989 .
later monday evening , hundreds demonstrated in a peaceful march through the neighborhood holding banners that read , " capitalism must go , " and " yorck street stays . " in reaction to the eviction , about 20 people took control of another kreuzberg building across the neighborhood to try to get yorck 59 back .
police successfully evicted them shortly after , officials said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a rebel still revered by some the name is taken after the address , yorckstrasse 59 , or 59 yorck street in a district that has been known for its student and left-wing subculture and became part of mainstream culture .
yorck 59 provided a roof for 60 residents including 10 children and alternative groups such as those fighting racism , globalization and economic reform . no amicable solution found in decades following the war , a number of alternative groups sprung up as left-wing radicalism , pacifism and even anarchism became a reaction to post-war prosperity and conservatism . many such alternative living arrangements died in the years following the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 as the city and private entrepreneurs bought up property and began gentrifying neighborhoods .
problems for the left-wing project started when a hamburg businessman bought the building in 2003 and raised the rent .
residents refused to pay the increase , saying they could n't afford it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clashes with police are rarely about buildings anymore city officials and residents tried to find a solution , including an alternative building but failed to come to an agreement . " there was no amicable solution found between the landlord and residents , " said berlin senator ehrhart körting . the city 's efforts were " inadequate , " resident jens schildmann told reuters . legal consequences and now , former residents and their supporters face legal consequences .
the owner of the building is suing those who barricaded themselves in the building for damages and rent totaling 90,000 euros -lrb- $ 110,000 -rrb- . similar alternative communities have been dismantled around germany and most famously , in neighboring denmark .
last year , denmark 's conservative government voted to dismantle the counterculture neighborhood of christiana , where hundreds of people have lived for free for decades - on 80 acres of prime real estate belong to the government .
now , the government wants to tear down existing buildings and use the property for luxury apartments . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans protest against corporate greed more than half a million people across germany on sunday took part in traditional labor day rallies to protest against large-scale unemployment and greedy managers .

" germany 's refusal to accept the dozen or so nazi war crimes suspects means that justice can not be fully carried out in their cases as us law does n't allow for them to be prosecuted for crimes committed outside the country .
they entered the united states illegally after the world war ii - illegally , because they claimed on their immigration forms that they were not collaborators with the nazi regime during the war . however , it was later shown in us courts that they were indeed involved . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inmates of the german kz buchenwald inside their barrack " by and large we 're talking about concentration camp guards , we 're talking about collaborators , people who were involved in indigenous police forces , that kind of thing , " said jonathan drimmer , the deputy director of the office of special investigations at the us department of justice , who has been following the cases . not enough proof ? germany , however , refuses to accept them .
asked by " monitor " reporters for the reason , german interior ministry officials said the us had not given enough proof that the suspects were war criminals , despite repeated requests from germany . deportation in such us court cases requires not criminal , but just civil , proceedings , with a burden of proof of " clear , convincing , and unequivocal evidence . " drimmer said that germany should accept the deportees , " pursuant to a written diplomatic promise that had been given in 1954 that people who had come into the united states illegally , who had misrepresented their nazi past to get into the united states , would be taken back by germany . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo-nazis in front of berlin 's brandenburg gate interior ministry officials in berlin countered that if germany accepted the deportees , they would be supported by the german social system and possibly would involve themselves in the extreme right or anti-semitic political activities .

asked by journalists what will happen if the g4 pushes for a vote at the end of the month , he said : " they 'll lose . " i think everybody is advising against a trainwreck happening , and that will happen if this draft is tabled and put to a vote , " he said .

" june has always been our target , we have not given up .
we are confident that we have the two-third majority that we need but we 're also striving to have the largest possible support . " enlargement before september ? the general assembly of the united nations comprises 191 members , so a two-third majority is 128 votes .
the general assembly does not hold veto power , a privilege reserved for the five permanent members of the security council - china , the united states , france , britain and russia .

" this particular issue is one we do n't want to have a deadline on , " a us diplomat who did not want to be identified told afp . us wary bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us secretary of state has not made a clear statement about whether her country would back other permanent members on the council the united states has publicly expressed support for japan 's candidacy but remains reserved about that of germany .
it has not yet taken a position on the g4 , merely repeating that they want reform to produce greater efficiency . china , for its part , is hostile to japan and firmly opposed to the g4 proposal , which it calls " dangerous , " likely to divide the un and derail reform . friday , pakistan 's ambassador munir akram echoed that stance .
asked by journalists what will happen if the g4 pushes for a vote at the end of the month , he said : " they 'll lose . " i think everybody is advising against a trainwreck happening , and that will happen if this draft is tabled and put to a vote , " he said .
" there will be a strong division here at the un , no matter who wins or loses .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 11.06.2005 bidding farewell to berlin 's squatters großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin squatters have been protesting eviction for decades police this week evicted squatters of a famous tenement in berlin .
the move is just one more example of how the new german capital moves away from its post-war past . an 18-month stand-off between supporters of a counter-culture project and city officials came to an end this week after police removed the 60 residents of a white tenement block in berlin 's kreuzberg district , dismantling on of the last alternative living projects that sprung up in post-world war west berlin . hundreds of people watched as police cleared out the " yorck 59 " building , as the squatter 's building has been known since 1989 .
later monday evening , hundreds demonstrated in a peaceful march through the neighborhood holding banners that read , " capitalism must go , " and " yorck street stays . " in reaction to the eviction , about 20 people took control of another kreuzberg building across the neighborhood to try to get yorck 59 back .
police successfully evicted them shortly after , officials said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a rebel still revered by some the name is taken after the address , yorckstrasse 59 , or 59 yorck street in a district that has been known for its student and left-wing subculture and became part of mainstream culture .
yorck 59 provided a roof for 60 residents including 10 children and alternative groups such as those fighting racism , globalization and economic reform . no amicable solution found in decades following the war , a number of alternative groups sprung up as left-wing radicalism , pacifism and even anarchism became a reaction to post-war prosperity and conservatism . many such alternative living arrangements died in the years following the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 as the city and private entrepreneurs bought up property and began gentrifying neighborhoods .
problems for the left-wing project started when a hamburg businessman bought the building in 2003 and raised the rent .
residents refused to pay the increase , saying they could n't afford it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clashes with police are rarely about buildings anymore city officials and residents tried to find a solution , including an alternative building but failed to come to an agreement . " there was no amicable solution found between the landlord and residents , " said berlin senator ehrhart körting . the city 's efforts were " inadequate , " resident jens schildmann told reuters . legal consequences and now , former residents and their supporters face legal consequences .
the owner of the building is suing those who barricaded themselves in the building for damages and rent totaling 90,000 euros -lrb- $ 110,000 -rrb- . similar alternative communities have been dismantled around germany and most famously , in neighboring denmark .
last year , denmark 's conservative government voted to dismantle the counterculture neighborhood of christiana , where hundreds of people have lived for free for decades - on 80 acres of prime real estate belong to the government .
now , the government wants to tear down existing buildings and use the property for luxury apartments . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans protest against corporate greed more than half a million people across germany on sunday took part in traditional labor day rallies to protest against large-scale unemployment and greedy managers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 11.06.2005 dead by digital ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the agfa film company did n't recognize the digital trend digital photography is exerting more and more pressure on traditional celluloid film .
agfa , once a top film company , is finding out that if it does not conform , it will only become a niche player in the photo industry . the stomachs of employees from agfaphoto must have turned a little uneasy when the eu commission announced its latest initiative in june : " the initiative i2010 should create new jobs in the it-branch and in the media . " while the word " digital " does not appear directly in the initiative , the concept is certainly included as the world becomes more and more digitalized .
bits and bytes , software and hardware are now mainstays in most professional fields and in the photography industry it is no different .
2400 agfa workers , mostly in germany , have to wonder how much longer they will have a secure workplace . one thing is certain : agfa is bankrupt and creditors are now standing in line to receive payment . pressure growing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the digital craze is sweeping the world .
here a billboard in china the number of digital camera owners is expanding exponentially .
in the year 2004 alone , the german photo industry association -lrb- piv -rrb- reported that 7 million of the 8.43 million cameras sold in germany .
in 2001 it was just 1.2 of 4.7 million . the piv is not commenting on supposed " victims of digitalization . " " there are differing reports , " press spokeswoman constanze clauss said .
" the photo industry has something for everybody .
but the simple fact is that if a camera dealer does not sell any digital cameras , then he has lost touch with the times . " the numbers speak for themselves .
the marketing research company idc expects until 2008 , the number of digital photos will increase 35 percent annually . " up to 80 percent of our sales are directly digital or somehow related with digital photography , " said harald remsperger a camera dealer in frankfurt am main . pockets of resistance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : classic single reflex cameras work just as well not everyone is jumping on the digital bandwagon .
professional photographers , for example .
or the aficionados who are not satisfied with the mass-photo developing services online or that drug stores and supermarkets provide . " of course lots of small photo dealers have had to close shop , but those who have adapted to the new market are surviving , " remsperger said . the transitional status from analog to digital also persists .
many households have both a digital and a camera in the traditional sense - and use them .
one market , the single use camera , is even expanding .
users bought 5.5 million disposable devices in 2004 , a 25 percent increase over the previous year . yet agfa 's core business , the sale of classic film to consumers , is dwindling quickly .
in 2004 , they suffered a loss in film sales of 18 percent over 2003 . no matter what happens in that branch , photographers want their prints , be them digital or analog on paper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the quality of cell phone camera 's is also increasing " people want to have the tactile feeling of having a photo in their hands , " said rolf hollander , chairman of the board of cewe color , europe 's largest film developer . hobby photographers who work with slides might like to digitalize them but that does n't mean the old-fashioned slide should be tossed . " digitalize yes , but definitely keep the old slides and prints , " piv spokeswoman clauss said .

the move is just one more example of how the new german capital moves away from its post-war past . an 18-month stand-off between supporters of a counter-culture project and city officials came to an end this week after police removed the 60 residents of a white tenement block in berlin 's kreuzberg district , dismantling on of the last alternative living projects that sprung up in post-world war west berlin . hundreds of people watched as police cleared out the " yorck 59 " building , as the squatter 's building has been known since 1989 .
later monday evening , hundreds demonstrated in a peaceful march through the neighborhood holding banners that read , " capitalism must go , " and " yorck street stays . " in reaction to the eviction , about 20 people took control of another kreuzberg building across the neighborhood to try to get yorck 59 back .
police successfully evicted them shortly after , officials said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a rebel still revered by some the name is taken after the address , yorckstrasse 59 , or 59 yorck street in a district that has been known for its student and left-wing subculture and became part of mainstream culture .
yorck 59 provided a roof for 60 residents including 10 children and alternative groups such as those fighting racism , globalization and economic reform . no amicable solution found in decades following the war , a number of alternative groups sprung up as left-wing radicalism , pacifism and even anarchism became a reaction to post-war prosperity and conservatism . many such alternative living arrangements died in the years following the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 as the city and private entrepreneurs bought up property and began gentrifying neighborhoods .
problems for the left-wing project started when a hamburg businessman bought the building in 2003 and raised the rent .
residents refused to pay the increase , saying they could n't afford it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clashes with police are rarely about buildings anymore city officials and residents tried to find a solution , including an alternative building but failed to come to an agreement . " there was no amicable solution found between the landlord and residents , " said berlin senator ehrhart körting . the city 's efforts were " inadequate , " resident jens schildmann told reuters . legal consequences and now , former residents and their supporters face legal consequences .
the owner of the building is suing those who barricaded themselves in the building for damages and rent totaling 90,000 euros -lrb- $ 110,000 -rrb- . similar alternative communities have been dismantled around germany and most famously , in neighboring denmark .
last year , denmark 's conservative government voted to dismantle the counterculture neighborhood of christiana , where hundreds of people have lived for free for decades - on 80 acres of prime real estate belong to the government .
now , the government wants to tear down existing buildings and use the property for luxury apartments . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans protest against corporate greed more than half a million people across germany on sunday took part in traditional labor day rallies to protest against large-scale unemployment and greedy managers .

" although the payment is in one sense largely symbolic , it has made a difference for many elderly and in some cases very needy people , " he said . only now has the issue been resolved . " i think this is probably the last claims and compensation effort that we will have to work on as a result of world war ii , " he added . each victim of slave labor has received nearly 7,700 euros -lrb- $ 9,333 -rrb- .
the sum is not huge , but has been a lifeline to many people who barely have enough money to survive . freeing up the funds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : funds for the german foundation " remembrance , responsibility and future " were provided in equal parts by german industry and the german government . more than 1.6 million people in over 100 countries so far have received payments of over four billion euros .
as a partner , iom has already compensated more than 15,000 people for property loss under the nazi regime . gunter saathoff , director of payments for the foundation , said iom is only one of seven partners responsible for making payments to victims of nazi oppression .
these include jews , gypsies , homosexuals , forced laborers and victims of medical experiments . according to him , 98 percent of all the money has been paid out and whatever funds remain when the program ends in september 2006 must be returned to the german foundation . " if there is money over from our payment programs , our board has made a decision that this should be used for special programs for the victims , especially medical care programs , " saathoff said . a chapter that will never be closed the chairman of the german foundation , hans-otto brautigam , said these compensation payments are a recognition by both the german government and its people of the immense suffering and injustice inflicted on the victims of the nazi regime . he acknowledged that this recognition is long overdue , but hoped it is not too late . " in a political and in a moral sense , this chapter will never be closed , " he said .
" what is at stake here - and this is the responsibility of our generation and future generations - is to keep these very tragic events , these human rights violations firmly in the national memory .

the move is just one more example of how the new german capital moves away from its post-war past . an 18-month stand-off between supporters of a counter-culture project and city officials came to an end this week after police removed the 60 residents of a white tenement block in berlin 's kreuzberg district , dismantling on of the last alternative living projects that sprung up in post-world war west berlin . hundreds of people watched as police cleared out the " yorck 59 " building , as the squatter 's building has been known since 1989 .
later monday evening , hundreds demonstrated in a peaceful march through the neighborhood holding banners that read , " capitalism must go , " and " yorck street stays .

the cow , which could not walk - a typical bse symptom - had twice tested negative to a different type of test .
a ban on us beef was imposed by japan , once the top us export market , after the first case of bse was recorded in washington state in may 2003 .
consumption of beef in the us is still on the rise despite the scare .
a sample will be sent to a special uk-based laboratory for further testing , officials said .
" this animal did not enter the food supply or the feed supply , " said agriculture secretary mike johanns , who played down the alert by saying he was going to enjoy " a good steak " .
' transparency ' " it 's going to require additional testing before we can confirm one way or another whether this is bse , " said dr john clifford , a top veterinary with the agriculture department .
it is unclear whether the animal , which was processed at a special facility for animals not suitable for human consumption , was born in the us .
the us was hoping for the japanese ban to be lifted , but what if confirmed , the new case of bse might further damage us beef exports .
but mr johanns played down the possible consequences .
" i do n't anticipate problems with our trading partners , " he said .
" they 'll want to know what the issues are and what we have done .
" we want to assure them , and assure the public , that what we are doing here is transparent . "
so far , the human variant of the degenerative brain disorder , known as creutzfeldt-jakob disease , has claimed more than 150 lives - mostly in britain , which was the epicentre of the outbreak which started in the 1990s .

chloe curtis is at the automatic grammatizator , building bizarre words and phrases into a story .
wonka chocolate doors greet visitors " i 'm hoping she 's going to make a fun one or a rude one , " says her mother , morag bremner .
morag is from the design team behind the roald dahl museum and story centre , which opens in great missenden on saturday .
the grammatizator is one of many interactive exhibits and , with lights , projects words on to the floor .
a ' persistent muddler ' " for a lot of children , words can be quite frightening , " says morag .
" in his books roald said ' you can make up the words , you can do this . "
the room is meant to inspire children 's imagination with it 's " ideas table " , movie-making exhibits , fridges covered in words and advice from popular authors .
story characters ' dance ' in the dreamcatcher behind willy wonka-style chocolate doors , the museum has galleries about the late author 's work , a comprehensive archive , family letters , video and photographs .
a replica of the hut where he wrote classics like charlie and the chocolate factory and matilda stands in the former coaching inn 's courtyard .
it comes a month ahead of the release of a new charlie and the chocolate factory film , starring johnny depp , and a bbc documentary on dahl .
for granddaughter and model , sophie dahl , it is the museum 's room on his earlier life at school and in the raf , which is " fantastic " .
his 1930 school reports from repton in derbyshire described him as a " persistent muddler , writing and saying the opposite of what he means .
fails to correct this ... "
he was pretty confident in his own imagination ophelia dahl " i like that now we get to see him as a little boy , him as a man , him as a writer , " says sophie .
" there 's nothing more reassuring for children to see a school report and that he did n't do very well in latin - yet went on to do great things . "
her brother ned donovan , 11 , a fan of the twits , is also drawn to the museum 's toilets .
" as soon as you go in , they start making noises like ' whizzpop ' , " he says .
they also recite stories and commands - ' i will not eat worms ' plays out in the ladies .
chloe 's story was a tale of forests and crocodiles the museum shows how roald dahl wrote - from his ideas books through an illuminated dreamcatcher for creating bfg-like dreams to giant versions of the imported yellow notepads and pencils he used .
the drafts and redrafts of stories - cut and pasted in the original sense , with scissors and sticky tape - display how he crafted tales for adults and children .
how james and the giant cherry became a ' peach ' .
dahl wrote in a hut in the garden of the nearby family home in the morning and afternoon .
but at his children 's bedtime he climbed the stairs , to begin their own stories and excerpts from books , including the bfg .
no worksheets dahl 's daughter , ophelia says : " he had a wonderful ability to keep the story going , to keep the thread .
it was magical . "
but he did not try out his drafts on his children : " he was pretty confident in his own imagination , " she says .
the museum will host school trips - but ' hated ' worksheets will be outlawed .
instead , children can use their own ' ideas books ' to jot down any inspired thoughts .
dahl 's second wife liccy says museums were on his ' detest ' list for ophelia , the museum is : " not about absorbing his work , it 's about finding a place where -lrb- children 's -rrb- own imagination can roam and take flight . "
dahl 's second wife liccy began the project 10 years ago .
surveying the finished result she says he " might have wept , a little .
he would have been touched and moved " .
museums , she says , are one of the things roald " really despised " in life - as well as " beards , committees and speeches " .
" i wanted to prove that roald was wrong , that museums need not be boring . "
' i 'm no witch ' cherie blair opened the museum to special guests on friday , alluding to the witches .
in choosing her outfit , she said : " i made sure everyone could see my toes , no gloves , no wig . "
the newspapers could be " positively confident i am not the great high witch " .
reports , letters and photos paint a picture of his early life the museum 's director sue davies hopes it will provide a place for children and adults to get into a " creative groove " .
that process is already under way for rachel miller , 11 , who is standing in a room full of photos of dahl 's 74-year life to 1990 .
" i 've been looking at things he has done and writing them down , and having ideas so that when i grow up that can start me off , " she says .
" i write fantasy , fairy tales with people getting saved - someone gets captured and their brother or sister has to try and save them . "
in the story centre , famous children 's authors talk about their approach to writing .
" someone somewhere , " booms the voice of his dark materials author philip pullman , " is writing the next big sensation - and that might be you . "

chloe curtis is at the automatic grammatizator , building bizarre words and phrases into a story .
wonka chocolate doors greet visitors " i 'm hoping she 's going to make a fun one or a rude one , " says her mother , morag bremner .
morag is from the design team behind the roald dahl museum and story centre , which opens in great missenden on saturday .
the grammatizator is one of many interactive exhibits and , with lights , projects words on to the floor .
a ' persistent muddler ' " for a lot of children , words can be quite frightening , " says morag .
" in his books roald said ' you can make up the words , you can do this . "
the room is meant to inspire children 's imagination with it 's " ideas table " , movie-making exhibits , fridges covered in words and advice from popular authors .
story characters ' dance ' in the dreamcatcher behind willy wonka-style chocolate doors , the museum has galleries about the late author 's work , a comprehensive archive , family letters , video and photographs .
a replica of the hut where he wrote classics like charlie and the chocolate factory and matilda stands in the former coaching inn 's courtyard .
it comes a month ahead of the release of a new charlie and the chocolate factory film , starring johnny depp , and a bbc documentary on dahl .
for granddaughter and model , sophie dahl , it is the museum 's room on his earlier life at school and in the raf , which is " fantastic " .
his 1930 school reports from repton in derbyshire described him as a " persistent muddler , writing and saying the opposite of what he means .
fails to correct this ... "
he was pretty confident in his own imagination ophelia dahl " i like that now we get to see him as a little boy , him as a man , him as a writer , " says sophie .
" there 's nothing more reassuring for children to see a school report and that he did n't do very well in latin - yet went on to do great things . "
her brother ned donovan , 11 , a fan of the twits , is also drawn to the museum 's toilets .
" as soon as you go in , they start making noises like ' whizzpop ' , " he says .
they also recite stories and commands - ' i will not eat worms ' plays out in the ladies .
chloe 's story was a tale of forests and crocodiles the museum shows how roald dahl wrote - from his ideas books through an illuminated dreamcatcher for creating bfg-like dreams to giant versions of the imported yellow notepads and pencils he used .
the drafts and redrafts of stories - cut and pasted in the original sense , with scissors and sticky tape - display how he crafted tales for adults and children .
how james and the giant cherry became a ' peach ' .
dahl wrote in a hut in the garden of the nearby family home in the morning and afternoon .
but at his children 's bedtime he climbed the stairs , to begin their own stories and excerpts from books , including the bfg .
no worksheets dahl 's daughter , ophelia says : " he had a wonderful ability to keep the story going , to keep the thread .
it was magical . "
but he did not try out his drafts on his children : " he was pretty confident in his own imagination , " she says .
the museum will host school trips - but ' hated ' worksheets will be outlawed .
instead , children can use their own ' ideas books ' to jot down any inspired thoughts .
dahl 's second wife liccy says museums were on his ' detest ' list for ophelia , the museum is : " not about absorbing his work , it 's about finding a place where -lrb- children 's -rrb- own imagination can roam and take flight . "
dahl 's second wife liccy began the project 10 years ago .
surveying the finished result she says he " might have wept , a little .
he would have been touched and moved " .
museums , she says , are one of the things roald " really despised " in life - as well as " beards , committees and speeches " .
" i wanted to prove that roald was wrong , that museums need not be boring . "
' i 'm no witch ' cherie blair opened the museum to special guests on friday , alluding to the witches .
in choosing her outfit , she said : " i made sure everyone could see my toes , no gloves , no wig . "
the newspapers could be " positively confident i am not the great high witch " .
reports , letters and photos paint a picture of his early life the museum 's director sue davies hopes it will provide a place for children and adults to get into a " creative groove " .
that process is already under way for rachel miller , 11 , who is standing in a room full of photos of dahl 's 74-year life to 1990 .
" i 've been looking at things he has done and writing them down , and having ideas so that when i grow up that can start me off , " she says .
" i write fantasy , fairy tales with people getting saved - someone gets captured and their brother or sister has to try and save them . "
in the story centre , famous children 's authors talk about their approach to writing .
" someone somewhere , " booms the voice of his dark materials author philip pullman , " is writing the next big sensation - and that might be you . "

morag is from the design team behind the roald dahl museum and story centre , which opens in great missenden on saturday .
the grammatizator is one of many interactive exhibits and , with lights , projects words on to the floor .
a ' persistent muddler ' " for a lot of children , words can be quite frightening , " says morag .
" in his books roald said ' you can make up the words , you can do this . "
the room is meant to inspire children 's imagination with it 's " ideas table " , movie-making exhibits , fridges covered in words and advice from popular authors .
story characters ' dance ' in the dreamcatcher behind willy wonka-style chocolate doors , the museum has galleries about the late author 's work , a comprehensive archive , family letters , video and photographs .
a replica of the hut where he wrote classics like charlie and the chocolate factory and matilda stands in the former coaching inn 's courtyard .
it comes a month ahead of the release of a new charlie and the chocolate factory film , starring johnny depp , and a bbc documentary on dahl .
for granddaughter and model , sophie dahl , it is the museum 's room on his earlier life at school and in the raf , which is " fantastic " .
his 1930 school reports from repton in derbyshire described him as a " persistent muddler , writing and saying the opposite of what he means .
fails to correct this ... "
he was pretty confident in his own imagination ophelia dahl " i like that now we get to see him as a little boy , him as a man , him as a writer , " says sophie .
" there 's nothing more reassuring for children to see a school report and that he did n't do very well in latin - yet went on to do great things . "
her brother ned donovan , 11 , a fan of the twits , is also drawn to the museum 's toilets .
" as soon as you go in , they start making noises like ' whizzpop ' , " he says .
they also recite stories and commands - ' i will not eat worms ' plays out in the ladies .
chloe 's story was a tale of forests and crocodiles the museum shows how roald dahl wrote - from his ideas books through an illuminated dreamcatcher for creating bfg-like dreams to giant versions of the imported yellow notepads and pencils he used .
the drafts and redrafts of stories - cut and pasted in the original sense , with scissors and sticky tape - display how he crafted tales for adults and children .
how james and the giant cherry became a ' peach ' .
dahl wrote in a hut in the garden of the nearby family home in the morning and afternoon .
but at his children 's bedtime he climbed the stairs , to begin their own stories and excerpts from books , including the bfg .
no worksheets dahl 's daughter , ophelia says : " he had a wonderful ability to keep the story going , to keep the thread .
it was magical . "
but he did not try out his drafts on his children : " he was pretty confident in his own imagination , " she says .
the museum will host school trips - but ' hated ' worksheets will be outlawed .
instead , children can use their own ' ideas books ' to jot down any inspired thoughts .
dahl 's second wife liccy says museums were on his ' detest ' list for ophelia , the museum is : " not about absorbing his work , it 's about finding a place where -lrb- children 's -rrb- own imagination can roam and take flight . "
dahl 's second wife liccy began the project 10 years ago .
surveying the finished result she says he " might have wept , a little .
he would have been touched and moved " .

bbc news -pipe- technology -pipe- hard drives for ' terabyte lives ' home news sport radio tv weather languages low graphics -pipe- accessibility help one-minute world news news services your news when you want it news front page africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia uk business health science & environment technology entertainment also in the news - video and audio - programmes have your say in pictures country profiles special reports related bbc sites sport weather on this day editors ' blog last updated : saturday , 11 june , 2005 , 07:17 gmt 08:17 uk e-mail this to a friend printable version hard drives for ' terabyte lives ' by jo twist bbc news website science and technology reporter people want to have storage where they want , and when as hunger for storage grows unabated , hard drive makers are continuing to push storage capacity up , while keeping physical size down .
this week seagate announced a slew of hard drives which it says are for people who want a " terabyte lifestyle " .
among them is the first 2.5-inch 160gb hard drive which uses what is called perpendicular recording to fit much more data for every square inch .
it also said it was producing a specially " ruggedised " drive for cars .
its 20gb and 40gb hard drives for cars have been designed to withstand temperatures from minus 30 to plus 80 degrees centigrade , as well as vibrations .
" right now in the consumer electronics industry people ca n't get enough storage , " rob pait , seagate 's director of consumer electronics marketing , told the bbc news website .
bigger and bigger cars , digital video recorders , notebook computers , portable media players , mobile telephony , and gaming are all pushing at the storage capacity door .
the geek in us says it is all about storage , but in the marketplace it is messier than that rob pait , seagate the demand for hard drives in cars is one of the key areas which will continue to grow quickly , said mr pait .
the rising popularity and falling prices of in-car entertainment systems , as well as more sophisticated gps -lrb- global positioning satellite -rrb- and navigation applications , will push this demand .
seagate also announced the biggest ever digital video recorder hard drive at 500gb , which will allow for more high-definition -lrb- hd -rrb- content storage .
about 80 hours of hd video can fit onto a drive that size .
but it will mean people can archive a lot more standard definition programmes too .
seagate also said its one-inch hard drives , a crucial size for portable media devices like digital music players , has gone up to 8gb .
terabyte living mr pait thinks that although many people are already living an accumulative terabyte lifestyle , in about five years pcs will have five terabytes of storage on board .
one terabyte is the equivalent of 1,024gb , enough to hold more than 240,000 songs at the standard encoding rate for digital music files .
the car is going to be an even bigger technology hub soon this will only be possible because of perpendicular recording methods , which seagate , hitachi , and others , have to exploit .
the storage industry currently makes hard drives using longitudinal recording , which is reaching its physical limit .
with this method , bits of data are arranged horizontally on the recording magnetic medium .
perpendicular recording methods arrange bits vertically so more can fit on , and higher recording densities can be achieved without magnetic interference which can corrupt data .
this method should mean hard drive storage based on moving mechanical parts will be around for another 20 years or so , says mr pait .
hitachi , one of seagate 's rivals , expects to ship its first perpendicular recording product in 2005 on a 2.5-inch hard drive , used in notebook computers and handheld devices .
people also want to have storage when and where they want it as devices increasingly let them take their digital media , like video and music , out and about with them .
" the geek in us says it is all about storage , but in the marketplace it is messier than that , " said mr pait .
" people are looking for storage to enable them to be able to record video , to store photos , to play games .
we are talking about applications here . "
the rapid demand for the tiny one-inch drives which fit into portable devices has surprised seagate ; the demand has been four times that which they anticipated .
just the beginning but the storage industry is still at a very early stage .
analysts predict that the number of hard drives in consumer electronics gadgets could grow from 17 million in 2003 to 55 million in 2006 .
the ability for people to create their own digital entertainment , movies , pictures , and music and even podcasts , has people wanting more space to store it all too .
gaming will bring with it more demands for storage " my 16-year-old is a trumpet player .
he has sony acid on his pc in the basement , mics , mixers , everything he needs in his bedroom to mix his own single , " says mr pait .
" the tools are so easy to use now .
everything you do is so intuitive now you do n't have to wait for a thing , you just make them happen .
it 's going to be huge . "
but hard drive manufacturers are contending with people 's desire for slimmer and smaller boxes that will be more discreet in living rooms too .
microsoft 's xbox 360 , for instance , comes with an external hard drive which has to look just as sleek as the box itself .
and in the next year , says mr pait , mini motherboards , therefore much smaller and compact pcs , will become a bigger area of demand , especially in europe .

this week seagate announced a slew of hard drives which it says are for people who want a " terabyte lifestyle " .
among them is the first 2.5-inch 160gb hard drive which uses what is called perpendicular recording to fit much more data for every square inch .
it also said it was producing a specially " ruggedised " drive for cars .
its 20gb and 40gb hard drives for cars have been designed to withstand temperatures from minus 30 to plus 80 degrees centigrade , as well as vibrations .
" right now in the consumer electronics industry people ca n't get enough storage , " rob pait , seagate 's director of consumer electronics marketing , told the bbc news website .
bigger and bigger cars , digital video recorders , notebook computers , portable media players , mobile telephony , and gaming are all pushing at the storage capacity door .
the geek in us says it is all about storage , but in the marketplace it is messier than that rob pait , seagate the demand for hard drives in cars is one of the key areas which will continue to grow quickly , said mr pait .
the rising popularity and falling prices of in-car entertainment systems , as well as more sophisticated gps -lrb- global positioning satellite -rrb- and navigation applications , will push this demand .
seagate also announced the biggest ever digital video recorder hard drive at 500gb , which will allow for more high-definition -lrb- hd -rrb- content storage .
about 80 hours of hd video can fit onto a drive that size .
but it will mean people can archive a lot more standard definition programmes too .
seagate also said its one-inch hard drives , a crucial size for portable media devices like digital music players , has gone up to 8gb .
terabyte living mr pait thinks that although many people are already living an accumulative terabyte lifestyle , in about five years pcs will have five terabytes of storage on board .
one terabyte is the equivalent of 1,024gb , enough to hold more than 240,000 songs at the standard encoding rate for digital music files .
the car is going to be an even bigger technology hub soon this will only be possible because of perpendicular recording methods , which seagate , hitachi , and others , have to exploit .
the storage industry currently makes hard drives using longitudinal recording , which is reaching its physical limit .
with this method , bits of data are arranged horizontally on the recording magnetic medium .
perpendicular recording methods arrange bits vertically so more can fit on , and higher recording densities can be achieved without magnetic interference which can corrupt data .
this method should mean hard drive storage based on moving mechanical parts will be around for another 20 years or so , says mr pait .
hitachi , one of seagate 's rivals , expects to ship its first perpendicular recording product in 2005 on a 2.5-inch hard drive , used in notebook computers and handheld devices .
people also want to have storage when and where they want it as devices increasingly let them take their digital media , like video and music , out and about with them .
" the geek in us says it is all about storage , but in the marketplace it is messier than that , " said mr pait .
" people are looking for storage to enable them to be able to record video , to store photos , to play games .
we are talking about applications here . "
the rapid demand for the tiny one-inch drives which fit into portable devices has surprised seagate ; the demand has been four times that which they anticipated .
just the beginning but the storage industry is still at a very early stage .

this week seagate announced a slew of hard drives which it says are for people who want a " terabyte lifestyle " .
among them is the first 2.5-inch 160gb hard drive which uses what is called perpendicular recording to fit much more data for every square inch .
it also said it was producing a specially " ruggedised " drive for cars .
its 20gb and 40gb hard drives for cars have been designed to withstand temperatures from minus 30 to plus 80 degrees centigrade , as well as vibrations .
" right now in the consumer electronics industry people ca n't get enough storage , " rob pait , seagate 's director of consumer electronics marketing , told the bbc news website .
bigger and bigger cars , digital video recorders , notebook computers , portable media players , mobile telephony , and gaming are all pushing at the storage capacity door .
the geek in us says it is all about storage , but in the marketplace it is messier than that rob pait , seagate the demand for hard drives in cars is one of the key areas which will continue to grow quickly , said mr pait .
the rising popularity and falling prices of in-car entertainment systems , as well as more sophisticated gps -lrb- global positioning satellite -rrb- and navigation applications , will push this demand .
seagate also announced the biggest ever digital video recorder hard drive at 500gb , which will allow for more high-definition -lrb- hd -rrb- content storage .
about 80 hours of hd video can fit onto a drive that size .
but it will mean people can archive a lot more standard definition programmes too .
seagate also said its one-inch hard drives , a crucial size for portable media devices like digital music players , has gone up to 8gb .
terabyte living mr pait thinks that although many people are already living an accumulative terabyte lifestyle , in about five years pcs will have five terabytes of storage on board .
one terabyte is the equivalent of 1,024gb , enough to hold more than 240,000 songs at the standard encoding rate for digital music files .
the car is going to be an even bigger technology hub soon this will only be possible because of perpendicular recording methods , which seagate , hitachi , and others , have to exploit .
the storage industry currently makes hard drives using longitudinal recording , which is reaching its physical limit .
with this method , bits of data are arranged horizontally on the recording magnetic medium .
perpendicular recording methods arrange bits vertically so more can fit on , and higher recording densities can be achieved without magnetic interference which can corrupt data .
this method should mean hard drive storage based on moving mechanical parts will be around for another 20 years or so , says mr pait .
hitachi , one of seagate 's rivals , expects to ship its first perpendicular recording product in 2005 on a 2.5-inch hard drive , used in notebook computers and handheld devices .
people also want to have storage when and where they want it as devices increasingly let them take their digital media , like video and music , out and about with them .
" the geek in us says it is all about storage , but in the marketplace it is messier than that , " said mr pait .
" people are looking for storage to enable them to be able to record video , to store photos , to play games .
we are talking about applications here . "
the rapid demand for the tiny one-inch drives which fit into portable devices has surprised seagate ; the demand has been four times that which they anticipated .
just the beginning but the storage industry is still at a very early stage .
analysts predict that the number of hard drives in consumer electronics gadgets could grow from 17 million in 2003 to 55 million in 2006 .
the ability for people to create their own digital entertainment , movies , pictures , and music and even podcasts , has people wanting more space to store it all too .

but , as regular beach users know , even the most benign-looking waters can quickly become treacherous .
so the decision of local councils to review or even withdraw lifeguard cover at some beaches has sparked fears that lives could be lost .
and the issue of who actually owns each individual beach is muddying the waters even further .
last year north devon council said it was unfair for council tax payers to pay for lifeguards on beaches at saunton , croyde and woolacombe , which are privately owned .
the announcement provoked criticism from surfers , watersports enthusiasts and other beach users , many of whom said lifeguards should be regarded as a public service .
one of the joys of cornwall is the beaches ... they 're public beaches and it should be a public service chris harvey , st ives bay holiday park a number of beaches in the region are privately-owned , but are still accessible to members of the public and the thousands of holidaymakers who contribute millions of pounds to the south west economy .
in january , kerrier district council in cornwall was also criticised when it announced plans to withdraw winter lifeguards at praa sands near helston and portreath beach .
but the council said it would save £ 15,000 a year and people using the beach should shoulder the responsibility for their own safety .
robert grose , the head of service regeneration for kerrier , told bbc news there was a review of lifeguard services for the six beaches in the council 's area .
he said the council is considering asking for contributions from private beach owners for the lifeguard service it provides and if the request is refused , the council may have to consider withdrawing or reducing cover .
funding reviews " at the end of the day the final decision will be made by the elected members , " mr grose said .
some holiday park owners are worried that if the funding reviews by councils lead to lifeguard cover being withdrawn lives could be put at risk .
chris harvey , the owner of st ives bay holiday park and part of the beach at hayle in cornwall , said the vast majority of the beaches in the south west were considered public so lifeguard cover should be a public service .
he said penwith district council has suggested three options regarding the service - continuing it , withdrawing it , or to compromise .
mr harvey said : " the council says it has no legal obligation because lifeguard cover is non-statutory .
clean and safe beaches are an essential part of tourism and should be invested in robin barker , from south west tourism " but ... even if they have no legal obligation , they still have an obligation .
" one of the joys of cornwall is the beaches .
they 're public beaches and it should be a public service . "
phil drew , the beach manager for penwith district council , insists all beaches in penwith will be fully staffed until the end of the summer .
he confirmed the council is reviewing lifeguard cover as part of the local authority budget .
the cost of providing cover on penwith 's 15 beaches ranges from £ 7,000 to £ 50,000 each year .
mr drew said : " there 's been an explosion in extreme sports , including jet skis , sand boarding and surfing and we do need some help .
reduced cover " of course we have a duty , but we have a duty to look after all non-statutory services .
" i think it 's reasonable to expect that people who own the beaches , or make a big profit from the people who use them , contribute to providing lifeguard cover . "
the council says the national trust and duchy of cornwall , which own beaches in the region , are supportive but invest any available cash back into ongoing projects .
mr drew said whatever the review 's outcome , it is probable that from next year cover may be reduced on some beaches and strengthened on others because of varying risk factors .

but , as regular beach users know , even the most benign-looking waters can quickly become treacherous .
so the decision of local councils to review or even withdraw lifeguard cover at some beaches has sparked fears that lives could be lost .
and the issue of who actually owns each individual beach is muddying the waters even further .
last year north devon council said it was unfair for council tax payers to pay for lifeguards on beaches at saunton , croyde and woolacombe , which are privately owned .
the announcement provoked criticism from surfers , watersports enthusiasts and other beach users , many of whom said lifeguards should be regarded as a public service .
one of the joys of cornwall is the beaches ... they 're public beaches and it should be a public service chris harvey , st ives bay holiday park a number of beaches in the region are privately-owned , but are still accessible to members of the public and the thousands of holidaymakers who contribute millions of pounds to the south west economy .
in january , kerrier district council in cornwall was also criticised when it announced plans to withdraw winter lifeguards at praa sands near helston and portreath beach .
but the council said it would save £ 15,000 a year and people using the beach should shoulder the responsibility for their own safety .
robert grose , the head of service regeneration for kerrier , told bbc news there was a review of lifeguard services for the six beaches in the council 's area .
he said the council is considering asking for contributions from private beach owners for the lifeguard service it provides and if the request is refused , the council may have to consider withdrawing or reducing cover .
funding reviews " at the end of the day the final decision will be made by the elected members , " mr grose said .
some holiday park owners are worried that if the funding reviews by councils lead to lifeguard cover being withdrawn lives could be put at risk .
chris harvey , the owner of st ives bay holiday park and part of the beach at hayle in cornwall , said the vast majority of the beaches in the south west were considered public so lifeguard cover should be a public service .
he said penwith district council has suggested three options regarding the service - continuing it , withdrawing it , or to compromise .
mr harvey said : " the council says it has no legal obligation because lifeguard cover is non-statutory .
clean and safe beaches are an essential part of tourism and should be invested in robin barker , from south west tourism " but ... even if they have no legal obligation , they still have an obligation .
" one of the joys of cornwall is the beaches .
they 're public beaches and it should be a public service . "
phil drew , the beach manager for penwith district council , insists all beaches in penwith will be fully staffed until the end of the summer .
he confirmed the council is reviewing lifeguard cover as part of the local authority budget .
the cost of providing cover on penwith 's 15 beaches ranges from £ 7,000 to £ 50,000 each year .
mr drew said : " there 's been an explosion in extreme sports , including jet skis , sand boarding and surfing and we do need some help .
reduced cover " of course we have a duty , but we have a duty to look after all non-statutory services .
" i think it 's reasonable to expect that people who own the beaches , or make a big profit from the people who use them , contribute to providing lifeguard cover . "
the council says the national trust and duchy of cornwall , which own beaches in the region , are supportive but invest any available cash back into ongoing projects .
mr drew said whatever the review 's outcome , it is probable that from next year cover may be reduced on some beaches and strengthened on others because of varying risk factors .
another factor for consideration is whether lifeguard cover , or the lack of it , would influence holidaymakers choosing to visit the region .
robin barker , a spokesman for south west tourism , said : " clean and safe beaches are an essential part of tourism and should be invested in . "
