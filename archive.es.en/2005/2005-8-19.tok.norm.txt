pope benedict 's visit will add another chapter to the tale of highs and lows , religion , tragedy and rebirth . when the jews first came to cologne in the wake of the roman legions , they were taken by the lush green and fertile land of the rhine valley .
so much so , that they decided to stay and found what is now the oldest jewish community north of the alps .
the first official mention of the community is in a decree from king constantine in 321 ad , granting them membership in the city council .
although cologne is now known for it ’ s cathedral and catholic traditions , back then it was considered the jerusalem of the north . the city 's jewish community struggled on through the centuries as empires , from the romans to the huns , the franks to the ottonians and the germans rose and fell around them .
although the community often played an active role in helping to shape the empires , it was not free from the persecution , pogroms and plagues which characterized the times . short-lived religious freedom discrimination under the rule of emperors , kings and bishops was rife , and it was only when french revolutionary troops occupied the city in 1792 that cologne 's jews received civil rights and religious freedom .
but that freedom did n't last . the nazis ended nearly two millennia of jewish life in cologne .
although some were lucky enough to escape in time , some 11,000 of the city 's jews were deported and murdered at the hands of the hitler regime . rebuilding the community bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city of cologne sometimes the city invites jews who fled the nazis , to come and visit the place where they used to live .
otto spier , who now lives in israel , recently returned to cologne for the first time in more than 60 years . " the view of cologne floats before my eyes again .
what ’ s surprising is that you still have a relationship to your city of birth and that despite everything that ’ s happened , there ’ s still a bond to the things that formed you in your youth , " he said . today , the immigration of jews from the former soviet union means that cologne is once again home to one of germany ’ s largest jewish communities . kirsten serup-bilfeldt -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german pope promises dialogue with jews as pope benedict xvi continued to settle into his role as the new leader of the catholic church , he vowed to promote dialogue with jews as part of an emphasis on interfaith issues .

11 hijackers while the cell was preparing the attacks in hamburg , was convicted of being a member of a terrorist organization and sentenced to seven years in prison by a german court on friday . presiding judge ernst-rainer schudt announced the verdict of the moroccan 's year-long retrial hearing without stating the court 's reasons for the decision . support of hamburg cell leads to conviction el motassadeq was convicted on terror-related charges after the prosecution accused him of helping pay tuition and other bills for members of the hamburg cell to allow them to live as students while they plotted the attacks . prosecutors had demanded the maximum sentence of 15 years in prison for el motassadeq , but defense lawyers sought acquittal for the moroccan , who acknowledges he was close to the hijackers but insists he knew nothing of their plans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plumes of smoke pour from the world trade center buildings in new york tuesday , sept .
11 , 2001 .
el motassadeq , who looked on calmly as schudt announced the verdict , was the first man to go on trial over the terrorist attacks in new york and washington that killed more than 3,000 people .
he was found guilty and sentenced the maximum 15 years in prison in february 2003 .
but a german federal tribunal overturned the verdict last year and sent the case back to the court in the northern port city of hamburg , where three of the 19 suicide hijackers lived and studied .
attorney ladislav anisic said there was no evidence that directly linked his client to the plot and argued that motassadeq was being tried simply on guilt by association , which he said was unacceptable under the rule of law in a democracy like germany 's .
" let us not let osama bin laden win here at home by sacrificing our legal foundations , " he argued before the court .
anisic has said he will appeal any verdict other than an acquittal .
us not cooperating german observers say the prosecution 's case had been weakened by the failure of the united states to hand over more information on two top al qaeda operatives in its custody .
the federal court overturned the verdict on the grounds that the hamburg judges had not been able to hear potentially exculpatory testimony from the self-purported mastermind behind the attacks , ramzi binalshibh , and al qaeda 's suspected number three , khalid sheikh mohammed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdelghani mzoudi , left , was freed .
many think motassadeq will also be acquitted .
the us justice department provided two sets of summaries of their interrogation in which the two men reportedly said that motassadeq and fellow moroccan abdelghani mzoudi had had no involvement in the plot .
the prosecution has argued that the accounts are not credible given al qaeda training methods in counterintelligence .
but the reports and the holes in the case were enough to see mzoudi acquitted in hamburg on the same charges motassadeq is again facing .
after his release , mzoudi returned to morocco in june under threat of deportation .
perhaps in the hopes of a similar outcome to his trial , motassadeq has extended his moroccan passport and said he wished to go home as soon as possible .
after 65 hearings and 112 witnesses during the retrial alone , which began one year ago , a not guilty verdict would have been a humiliating blow to federal prosecutors . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb / nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de 9/11 suspect trial resumes after delay a moroccan student being retried over involvement in the september 11 , 2001 attacks in new york and washington , provided " active support " to the suicide pilots , the federal prosecutor told a german court on monday .

on his postcard , he wrote to chancellor gerhard schröder of his concern that germany is moving too far in the direction of the us when it comes to labor policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wenn ich kanzler wäre … kunstaktion sheryl oring schreibmaschine " people are being forced into doing any old job , even if it is below their qualifications , just so that they 're back at work , " thomas said , adding that he appreciated oring 's project . " if you express your opinion as part of an art project , you know you wo n't have to face any repercussions , " he said .
" it 's a safe way to do it . " diverse responses while many of the postcards deal with election campaign issues such as unemployment , pensions , and education , other participants used their time at oring 's desk to air their pet peeves , or let their imaginations run wild . " i would charge a big fee for people who do n't clean up after their dogs , " wrote one disgruntled berliner . " i 'd like to be the king of berlin , " wrote another resident whose solution to the city 's problems would be to " open a big casino so everyone would be happy . " queuing up to talk with oring , eight-year-old gabriel excitedly outlined a list of laws he would pass if he were chancellor , including one that would " allow kids to play soccer everywhere . " bildunterschrift : kids get in on the act , too it 's the diversity of responses that keeps oring going .
she is bringing " if i were chancellor " to five german cities over a period of three weeks , and expects to type as many as 200 cards .
she keeps a copy of each card , and is hoping to turn them into an exhibition or a book . " i 'm always amazed at people 's answers , " she says .
" even though i 've done the show before , it never feels repetitive .

" this morning the quota for category seven , blouses , was filled .
member states custom authorities will no longer issue import licenses for this product , " spokesman rupert krietemeyer told afp , reading a statement .
according to the eu imports database , data shows that 100 percent of a 2005 quota of nearly 24.8 million chinese blouses had been cleared for entry into the eu as of thursday evening . the commission spokesperson had further bad news for retailers : " it is likely that a number of other quotas will also be filled in the very near future , " he added .
specifically , quotas for bras , t-shirts and flax yarn were close to being met . the quotas for men 's trousers and pullovers were also already reached earlier this month , leaving millions of garments stranded at eu customs and outraging some big eu retailers awaiting deliveries . eu , china still locked in quota talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu and chinese officials have been holding talks on the quotas and brussels has said it is willing to be flexible .
eu trade commissioner peter mandelson -lrb- photo -rrb- has made it clear that he wants to negotiate with china to allow more clothing imports into the bloc , possibly by using some of 2006 quotas in 2005 . after eu textile producers urged that the quotas be implemented , eu officials are coming under fierce pressure from retailers who warn that store shelves could be bare during the key back-to-school period because they have not received some shipments . on thursday , government ministers from the netherlands , denmark , sweden and finland wrote an article in the financial times saying there was a risk of job losses and bankruptcies unless the eu eases the curbs on the imports .
this followed a letter sent to mandelson by germany 's economy minister wolfgang clement which called for a relaxation of the import restrictions . textile producers fear massive influx from china not all eu countries want the import restrictions to be relaxed .
countries with big textile industries of their own , like france , italy and spain , are worried they will suffer if chinese clothing enters the eu on a massive scale . the eu and china agreed to a broad textile trade agreement in june setting annual restrictions on 10 categories of chinese imports , which had been surging since the beginning of the year following the end of an international quota system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu trade commissioner peter mandelson , left , and his chinese counterpart bo xilai , right , toast during a signing ceremony early saturday june 11 , 2005 in shanghai , china .

after protracted negotiations between chinese commerce minister bo xilai and mandelson in shanghai in june , china said that it would limit growth in exports of 10 textile and clothing products to the eu from between 8 to 12.5 percent a year in a bid to defuse the trade row . agreement in june rubber-stamped growth rate " china and the european union have agreed that , in the period from june 11 , 2005 to the end of 2007 , with an agreed base quantity , we will determine china 's amount of exports to europe by a growth rate of between 8 to 12.5 percent per year , " the ministry of commerce said in a statement on its web site after the end of negotiations . the eu response was to issue a statement that said that in 2008 , the eu will only apply " with restraint " paragraph 242 of china 's world trade organization accession protocol on textiles , which requires china to limit exports of textile products .

" this morning the quota for category seven , blouses , was filled .
member states custom authorities will no longer issue import licenses for this product , " spokesman rupert krietemeyer told afp , reading a statement .
according to the eu imports database , data shows that 100 percent of a 2005 quota of nearly 24.8 million chinese blouses had been cleared for entry into the eu as of thursday evening . the commission spokesperson had further bad news for retailers : " it is likely that a number of other quotas will also be filled in the very near future , " he added .
specifically , quotas for bras , t-shirts and flax yarn were close to being met . the quotas for men 's trousers and pullovers were also already reached earlier this month , leaving millions of garments stranded at eu customs and outraging some big eu retailers awaiting deliveries . eu , china still locked in quota talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu and chinese officials have been holding talks on the quotas and brussels has said it is willing to be flexible .
eu trade commissioner peter mandelson -lrb- photo -rrb- has made it clear that he wants to negotiate with china to allow more clothing imports into the bloc , possibly by using some of 2006 quotas in 2005 . after eu textile producers urged that the quotas be implemented , eu officials are coming under fierce pressure from retailers who warn that store shelves could be bare during the key back-to-school period because they have not received some shipments . on thursday , government ministers from the netherlands , denmark , sweden and finland wrote an article in the financial times saying there was a risk of job losses and bankruptcies unless the eu eases the curbs on the imports .
this followed a letter sent to mandelson by germany 's economy minister wolfgang clement which called for a relaxation of the import restrictions . textile producers fear massive influx from china not all eu countries want the import restrictions to be relaxed .
countries with big textile industries of their own , like france , italy and spain , are worried they will suffer if chinese clothing enters the eu on a massive scale . the eu and china agreed to a broad textile trade agreement in june setting annual restrictions on 10 categories of chinese imports , which had been surging since the beginning of the year following the end of an international quota system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu trade commissioner peter mandelson , left , and his chinese counterpart bo xilai , right , toast during a signing ceremony early saturday june 11 , 2005 in shanghai , china .
the european union said friday it had reached a deal to resolve a dispute with china over a surge of chinese textile imports .
after protracted negotiations between chinese commerce minister bo xilai and mandelson in shanghai in june , china said that it would limit growth in exports of 10 textile and clothing products to the eu from between 8 to 12.5 percent a year in a bid to defuse the trade row . agreement in june rubber-stamped growth rate " china and the european union have agreed that , in the period from june 11 , 2005 to the end of 2007 , with an agreed base quantity , we will determine china 's amount of exports to europe by a growth rate of between 8 to 12.5 percent per year , " the ministry of commerce said in a statement on its web site after the end of negotiations . the eu response was to issue a statement that said that in 2008 , the eu will only apply " with restraint " paragraph 242 of china 's world trade organization accession protocol on textiles , which requires china to limit exports of textile products .
there was no further explanation . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu , china settle textiles row china said saturday it will limit growth in exports of 10 textile and clothing products to the european union to 8 to 12.5 percent a year in a bid to defuse a trade row straining ties between them .

pope benedict 's visit will add another chapter to the tale of highs and lows , religion , tragedy and rebirth . when the jews first came to cologne in the wake of the roman legions , they were taken by the lush green and fertile land of the rhine valley .
so much so , that they decided to stay and found what is now the oldest jewish community north of the alps .
the first official mention of the community is in a decree from king constantine in 321 ad , granting them membership in the city council .
although cologne is now known for it ’ s cathedral and catholic traditions , back then it was considered the jerusalem of the north . the city 's jewish community struggled on through the centuries as empires , from the romans to the huns , the franks to the ottonians and the germans rose and fell around them .
although the community often played an active role in helping to shape the empires , it was not free from the persecution , pogroms and plagues which characterized the times . short-lived religious freedom discrimination under the rule of emperors , kings and bishops was rife , and it was only when french revolutionary troops occupied the city in 1792 that cologne 's jews received civil rights and religious freedom .
but that freedom did n't last . the nazis ended nearly two millennia of jewish life in cologne .
although some were lucky enough to escape in time , some 11,000 of the city 's jews were deported and murdered at the hands of the hitler regime . rebuilding the community bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city of cologne sometimes the city invites jews who fled the nazis , to come and visit the place where they used to live .
otto spier , who now lives in israel , recently returned to cologne for the first time in more than 60 years . " the view of cologne floats before my eyes again .
what ’ s surprising is that you still have a relationship to your city of birth and that despite everything that ’ s happened , there ’ s still a bond to the things that formed you in your youth , " he said . today , the immigration of jews from the former soviet union means that cologne is once again home to one of germany ’ s largest jewish communities . kirsten serup-bilfeldt -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german pope promises dialogue with jews as pope benedict xvi continued to settle into his role as the new leader of the catholic church , he vowed to promote dialogue with jews as part of an emphasis on interfaith issues .

in their midst , a young woman dressed like a secretary from a 1950 's film calmly types away on an equally old-fashioned typewriter while listening intently to the man seated opposite her .
a sign beside them reads " if i were chancellor … " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when the man finishes dictating his message to germany 's political leaders , the " secretary " hands him his postcard , complete with postage .
he twirls a wheel of rubber stamps , selects one that says " urgent , " and inks this in bright red across his card .
he then drops the card into a mailbox conveniently located just a few steps away , a look of satisfaction on his face . the scene - part political event , part art happening - causes passersby to slow their pace .
some just watch , while others get in line for a chance to have their say .
it 's all the brainchild of the woman in the red secretary 's costume , american artist and journalist sheryl oring . in the year leading up to the 2004 elections in the united states , oring travelled across her country with a similar project called " i wish to say , " typing over a thousand postcards for people who wanted to voice their concerns to president george w. bush . " the reaction in the states was so great that i thought of trying it in other countries , " says oring , who had previously worked and studied in germany and speaks fluent german . german grammar despite having a good grasp of the language , oring says she was slightly nervous about taking her " show " to germany . bildunterschrift : " i have to tell people to speak slowly because i 'm not a native speaker , and when i 'm done , i give them the chance to read it over and correct the grammar mistakes , " she laughs . but she added that being a foreigner has its advantages , as it makes people curious , and more likely to participate . " i did n't know how it would go over in germany , but people are really into doing it , " oring says .
" people have a lot of concerns about unemployment and social benefits , for example , and they 're really eager to talk about that .

in a way , it 's a service to people , and that 's something that 's been very gratifying . " thomas , a 42-year-old berliner , sat down with oring to tell her about his dissatisfaction with the current economic and social situation in germany .
on his postcard , he wrote to chancellor gerhard schröder of his concern that germany is moving too far in the direction of the us when it comes to labor policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wenn ich kanzler wäre … kunstaktion sheryl oring schreibmaschine " people are being forced into doing any old job , even if it is below their qualifications , just so that they 're back at work , " thomas said , adding that he appreciated oring 's project . " if you express your opinion as part of an art project , you know you wo n't have to face any repercussions , " he said .
" it 's a safe way to do it . " diverse responses while many of the postcards deal with election campaign issues such as unemployment , pensions , and education , other participants used their time at oring 's desk to air their pet peeves , or let their imaginations run wild . " i would charge a big fee for people who do n't clean up after their dogs , " wrote one disgruntled berliner . " i 'd like to be the king of berlin , " wrote another resident whose solution to the city 's problems would be to " open a big casino so everyone would be happy . " queuing up to talk with oring , eight-year-old gabriel excitedly outlined a list of laws he would pass if he were chancellor , including one that would " allow kids to play soccer everywhere . " bildunterschrift : kids get in on the act , too it 's the diversity of responses that keeps oring going .
she is bringing " if i were chancellor " to five german cities over a period of three weeks , and expects to type as many as 200 cards .
she keeps a copy of each card , and is hoping to turn them into an exhibition or a book . " i 'm always amazed at people 's answers , " she says .

dw-world talked to her about germany in light of the upcoming election . born in atlanta , georgia , neiman studied philosophy at harvard university and berlin 's free university .
she taught philosophy at yale and tel aviv universities .
in her latest book , " fremde sehen anders " -lrb- " strangers see things differently " -rrb- , due out in germany on aug .
24 , neiman argues that germans might be oblivious to the fact that their country is already on the road to recovery . dw-world : how is germa n y doi n g i n your opi n io n ? susan neiman : i think it 's doing much better than germans think it is .
from the outside , it looks like one of the most dynamic places in europe .
berlin is an international magnet .
under this government , the country has flourished more than people have realized .
it 's broken , decisively , with the stigma under which germany was standing for half a century .
not even economically it is as bad as people think it is .
people complain about certain kinds of cuts in social services and economic problems , but the country is fundamentally sound in comparison with other places .
you can have 9 percent economic growth , as china is experiencing , if you drop any concern for human beings and the environment .
what n eeds to happe n i n germa n y to help speed up the cou n try 's recovery ? i think it 's clear that all the industrialized nations still need to come up with concepts about unemployment in view of globalization .
i do n't think any of us have fully grasped what globalization means .
but i think that again , what 's remarkable is that germans think much worse about themselves than anyone else .
i think both the extreme left and members of some of the right have tried to benefit by painting a picture that things are terrible .
they reflect , however , the mood of the people .
you have a sort of mirroring effect .
if people would stop being so pessimistic , a great deal would be accomplished .
east and west germans tend to expect the state to take care of everything .
i think there is an expectation that the state should provide more than people expect in other countries .
there is a sense that if anything goes wrong , one blames it on the government . schröder or merkel ?
who is your perso n al choice for cha n cellor ?
why ? i 'm generally happy with the way the current red-green government has proceeded .
on the whole , they have done a good job and should continue to do so .
i 'm impressed by the ways in which , under the current government , germany has taken large steps towards becoming a more cosmopolitan and less racist country . i am particularly impressed by the difference in their attititudes to the iraq war , during which schröder was willing to take a stand , while merkel assured the bush administration that the cdu would follow american policy , whatever it was .
schröder was sharply criticized for his position - not least in germany , where most people called him opportunistic - but he turned out to be right .
america needs friends who are critical , not who blindly follow whatever very controversial policies happen to be the order of the day .
both schröder and merkel will have to continue painful economic reforms , and there the differences will be small ; the significant differences between them concern foreign policy . what do you like about germa n y ? i like the growing cosmopolitanism , an interest in what people do and think all over the world .
that 's much stronger than in france , england , and the us .
i like the sense of historical interest , i like the interest in preserving good parts of the past and the interest in dealing with bad parts of it .
i like the intelligence and intensity of german public culture . what do you dislike about germa n y ? i dislike the tendency to complain , and to see things in mostly negative terms .
i dislike a certain kind of formality that takes place in many relations . interview conducted by mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de election 2005 click here for dw-world 's complete election coverage .
election 2005 : the other perspective read what other english speakers have to say about germany 's state of affairs in light of the upcoming elections .
the german fear of reform germany might be in the middle of a deep economic crisis , but the country 's high unemployment and weak growth are probably the best things ever to happen to angela merkel 's career .

dw-world talked to her about germany in light of the upcoming election . born in atlanta , georgia , neiman studied philosophy at harvard university and berlin 's free university .

24 , neiman argues that germans might be oblivious to the fact that their country is already on the road to recovery . dw-world : how is germa n y doi n g i n your opi n io n ? susan neiman : i think it 's doing much better than germans think it is .
from the outside , it looks like one of the most dynamic places in europe .
berlin is an international magnet .
under this government , the country has flourished more than people have realized .
it 's broken , decisively , with the stigma under which germany was standing for half a century .
not even economically it is as bad as people think it is .
people complain about certain kinds of cuts in social services and economic problems , but the country is fundamentally sound in comparison with other places .
you can have 9 percent economic growth , as china is experiencing , if you drop any concern for human beings and the environment .
what n eeds to happe n i n germa n y to help speed up the cou n try 's recovery ? i think it 's clear that all the industrialized nations still need to come up with concepts about unemployment in view of globalization .
i do n't think any of us have fully grasped what globalization means .
but i think that again , what 's remarkable is that germans think much worse about themselves than anyone else .
i think both the extreme left and members of some of the right have tried to benefit by painting a picture that things are terrible .
they reflect , however , the mood of the people .
you have a sort of mirroring effect .
if people would stop being so pessimistic , a great deal would be accomplished .
east and west germans tend to expect the state to take care of everything .
i think there is an expectation that the state should provide more than people expect in other countries .
there is a sense that if anything goes wrong , one blames it on the government . schröder or merkel ?
who is your perso n al choice for cha n cellor ?
why ? i 'm generally happy with the way the current red-green government has proceeded .
on the whole , they have done a good job and should continue to do so .
i 'm impressed by the ways in which , under the current government , germany has taken large steps towards becoming a more cosmopolitan and less racist country . i am particularly impressed by the difference in their attititudes to the iraq war , during which schröder was willing to take a stand , while merkel assured the bush administration that the cdu would follow american policy , whatever it was .
schröder was sharply criticized for his position - not least in germany , where most people called him opportunistic - but he turned out to be right .
america needs friends who are critical , not who blindly follow whatever very controversial policies happen to be the order of the day .
both schröder and merkel will have to continue painful economic reforms , and there the differences will be small ; the significant differences between them concern foreign policy . what do you like about germa n y ? i like the growing cosmopolitanism , an interest in what people do and think all over the world .
that 's much stronger than in france , england , and the us .
i like the sense of historical interest , i like the interest in preserving good parts of the past and the interest in dealing with bad parts of it .

everyone knows what to do when a diaper starts to stink but what do you do when one starts to tick ?
call the police and run for the hills .
that 's what postal workers in a german city did . most parents will already consider a fully fed yet strangely uncomfortable looking baby as volatile an object as a container of nitroglycerin .

the aftermath of such an explosion can leave everyone involved covered in a nasty biological agent of some kind or another . but there usually has to be an infant involved for a fully blown diaper emergency to take place .
not so in the german city of heilbronn , however . without a baby 's bottom in sight , the southwestern city was thrown into chaos on thursday after what police later described as an " electronic nappy " caused a major bomb scare in the local post office . workers at the heilbronn branch of deutsche post went running for cover when a parcel started ticking suspiciously in the package department . police called as post office fears bomb attack fearing a bomb attack , the police were called and two squad cars sped to the scene where the officers immediately contacted the sender .
the police gave the all-clear after they contacted the woman who told them the intercepted package contained only a malfunctioning diaper . but why was it ticking ?
apparently , the hi-tech nappy was of a kind that reacts to wetness and which alerts the nearest parent to the fact that nature has run its course .

the positive review in " the economist " has everyone surprised - except for the chancellor . great britain 's and maybe the world 's most prominent business magazine is not known for its love affair with germany 's economic system .
the decidedly pro-business economist has in recent years enjoyed ribbing europe 's largest economy for its stagnant growth rates , high unemployment and a union strength that has led to sky-high labor costs .
all the more surprising , then , that when the german symbol , the black eagle , graced the front of this week 's magazine as a caricature , it was flexing its muscles underneath the headline " germany 's surprising economy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : really ? " some forecasters are now predicting that germany , which has for so many years disappointed on the downside , could be about to surprise on the upside , " the magazine wrote in the lead editorial . weakened unions a good thing as reasons for this the economist listed , above all , the turnaround accomplished by the country 's major corporations .
the newfound flexibility of germany 's usually stubborn unions has helped lower labor costs immensely and made the country more competitive than italy , the netherlands , great britain and france .
" that is a big reason why , last year , it regained its position as the world 's biggest exporter , " it wrote . the magazine gave credit to chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition government of social democrats and the green party for getting reforms underway .
his raft of labor and socio-economic reforms , called agenda 2010 , may lose him the election this september , but they have nonetheless " raised hopes that fresh impetus could set the economy on to its strongest track for years . " tough measures , like the unpopular hartz iv law that made it more difficult for germany 's 1.8 million long-term unemployed to receive benefits without actively looking for jobs , won the magazine 's approval .
" hartz iv ... has added 8 billion euros -lrb- $ 9.8 billion -rrb- to this year 's government costs , but failed to create many new jobs , " the magazine wrote .
" it has , however , made employees more fearful of the consequences of losing their jobs .
that has strengthened the hand of firms ... and weakened the power of trade unions . " bildunterschrift : germany 's unions are getting weak , and that 's a good thing , according to " the economist " chancellor : proof we 're doing things right the report raised eyebrows in germany , getting press coverage not only from business magazines , but local papers as well .
germany 's prominent frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper followed up on the economist cover with a piece examining the euphoria .
" nobody wants to believe it : germany is gaining more prominence abroad as an investment destination , " it wrote . nobody , that is , except for the chancellor .
at one point during an hour-long interview on german public television yesterday evening , schröder fished a piece of paper out of his pocket .
it was the economist 's piece . " the economist , a publication that in the past was never particularly pro-german , has a cover story ' economist cheers germany 's surprising economy ' and says that thanks to the reforms we introduced our competitiveness has grown enormously , " he said . economist : merkel needs a chance but schröder neglected to mention one thing .
though it gave schröder 's government a small amount of praise for getting the reform process started , the economist editorialists clearly hope his opponents will be the ones continuing them after the likely elections on sept .

the positive review in " the economist " has everyone surprised - except for the chancellor . great britain 's and maybe the world 's most prominent business magazine is not known for its love affair with germany 's economic system .
the decidedly pro-business economist has in recent years enjoyed ribbing europe 's largest economy for its stagnant growth rates , high unemployment and a union strength that has led to sky-high labor costs .
all the more surprising , then , that when the german symbol , the black eagle , graced the front of this week 's magazine as a caricature , it was flexing its muscles underneath the headline " germany 's surprising economy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : really ? " some forecasters are now predicting that germany , which has for so many years disappointed on the downside , could be about to surprise on the upside , " the magazine wrote in the lead editorial . weakened unions a good thing as reasons for this the economist listed , above all , the turnaround accomplished by the country 's major corporations .
the newfound flexibility of germany 's usually stubborn unions has helped lower labor costs immensely and made the country more competitive than italy , the netherlands , great britain and france .
" that is a big reason why , last year , it regained its position as the world 's biggest exporter , " it wrote . the magazine gave credit to chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition government of social democrats and the green party for getting reforms underway .
his raft of labor and socio-economic reforms , called agenda 2010 , may lose him the election this september , but they have nonetheless " raised hopes that fresh impetus could set the economy on to its strongest track for years . " tough measures , like the unpopular hartz iv law that made it more difficult for germany 's 1.8 million long-term unemployed to receive benefits without actively looking for jobs , won the magazine 's approval .
" hartz iv ... has added 8 billion euros -lrb- $ 9.8 billion -rrb- to this year 's government costs , but failed to create many new jobs , " the magazine wrote .
" it has , however , made employees more fearful of the consequences of losing their jobs .
that has strengthened the hand of firms ... and weakened the power of trade unions . " bildunterschrift : germany 's unions are getting weak , and that 's a good thing , according to " the economist " chancellor : proof we 're doing things right the report raised eyebrows in germany , getting press coverage not only from business magazines , but local papers as well .
germany 's prominent frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper followed up on the economist cover with a piece examining the euphoria .
" nobody wants to believe it : germany is gaining more prominence abroad as an investment destination , " it wrote . nobody , that is , except for the chancellor .
at one point during an hour-long interview on german public television yesterday evening , schröder fished a piece of paper out of his pocket .
it was the economist 's piece . " the economist , a publication that in the past was never particularly pro-german , has a cover story ' economist cheers germany 's surprising economy ' and says that thanks to the reforms we introduced our competitiveness has grown enormously , " he said . economist : merkel needs a chance but schröder neglected to mention one thing .
though it gave schröder 's government a small amount of praise for getting the reform process started , the economist editorialists clearly hope his opponents will be the ones continuing them after the likely elections on sept .

" the commitment of the new government to further reforms will make a big difference , " they wrote .

" i was extremely impressed by what he said and how he said it .

" i was extremely impressed by what he said and how he said it .
he condemned the crimes of the nazis without any ifs and buts , " spiegel told germany 's ard television . during only the second visit to a synagogue by a pope in the modern history of the catholic church , the pope described the extermination of six million jews by the nazis as an " unimaginable crime . " spiegel , the president of the central council of jews in germany , said at a news conference later that he welcomed the pope 's call for jews and christians to work more closely together to overcome their sometimes fractious relationship . he added he was " particularly impressed that he said the roots of christianity lie in judaism . " benedict xvi , who served briefly in the hitler youth during the war when membership of the nazi organization was compulsory , paused to pray at a memorial to the six million jews killed in the holocaust as he began the landmark visit . speaking in the synagogue which was destroyed in the anti-jewish kristallnacht attacks in 1938 and rebuilt in 1959 , he called the holocaust " this unspeakable and previously unimaginable crime . " pope warns of new threats bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " in the 20th century , in the darkest period of german and european history , an insane racist ideology , born of neo-paganism , gave rise to the attempt , planned and systematically carried out by the regime , to exterminate european jewry , " he said . the pope warned that new threats of racism and anti-semitism were always lurking .
" it is a particularly important task , since today , sadly , we are witnessing the rise of new signs of anti-semitism and various forms of a general hostility towards foreigners , " he said . " how can we fail to see in this a reason for concern and vigilance ?
the catholic church is committed - i reaffirm this again today - to tolerance , respect , friendship and peace between all peoples , cultures and religions , " he said . in his speech to jewish leaders , benedict also referred to john paul ii , saying that " in considering the jewish roots of christianity , my venerable predecessor , quoting a statement by the german bishops , affirmed that ' whoever meets jesus christ meets judaism ' . " jewish leader calls on holocaust files to be opened during the pope 's visit , a leader of germany 's jewish community called on the pope to fully open the vatican 's archives on the holocaust . in a speech welcoming the 78-year-old german-born pope , abraham lehrer called on the pope to " fully open " the archives , reminding him that as the former head of the vatican congregation for the doctrine of the faith , he had helped release some of the documents they contained for public scrutiny in 1998 . lehrer said he would welcome such a move as a " further sign " of the vatican 's goodwill towards the jewish community and allow both sides to continue " peaceful and critical " examination of the history of their troubled relations . " as leader of the catholic church , you have a special responsibility .
your actions serve as a model for the church , " lehrer told the pope . the archives contain diplomatic correspondence and church documents which could throw light on the degree of vatican knowledge of nazi efforts to deport and exterminate europe 's jews . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope pius xii jewish groups have strongly opposed plans set in motion by benedict 's predecessor john paul ii to elevate wartime pope pius xii -lrb- photo -rrb- to sainthood , claiming he did little or nothing to prevent jews being deported . lehrer praised benedict xvi , who succeeded john paul ii in april , as a " builder of bridges between religions , " adding that his visit was " an extraordinary event of great political and religious significance . " the head of the german bishops ' conference , cardinal karl lehmann , acknowledged at a news conference later that part of the archives was already open " but we must continue to work to open the archives of the pius xii period . " the visit to the synagogue was the highlight of the second day of the 78-year-old pope 's four-day visit to germany , the first foreign trip of his pontificate . discussions with köhler behind closed doors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi talks to german president horst köhler , left , in the presedential residence in bonn , western germany , friday , aug .

pope benedict xvi on friday became the second pope to visit a synagogue , stopping to pray and remember holocaust victims with cologne 's jewish community .
earlier in the day the pope met with german president horst köhler , adding a political touch to a day dominated by the highly symbolic visit to the synagogue and talks with protestants . after his jubilant reception thursday , when around 400,000 young catholics welcomed him back to his native country , benedict 's agenda on the second day of his visit began with closed-door talks at the presidential villa in nearby bonn before moving on to the religious meetings in cologne . benedict waved to a small crowd outside the villa hammerschmidt , the presidential residence in the former german capital , and shook hands with children after the meeting . " this world youth day shows that catholics are not a minority but come from all around the world , " köhler told journalists before the pope arrived .
" it is good and it will do good for protestants as well , " said köhler , a protestant . about half of the christians in germany , home of martin luther 's reformation , are protestant . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german pope visits synagogue while in cologne for world youth day , pope benedict xvi makes history as the second catholic leader to visit a jewish place of worship .

11 hijackers while the cell was preparing the attacks in hamburg , was convicted of being a member of a terrorist organization and sentenced to seven years in prison by a german court on friday . presiding judge ernst-rainer schudt announced the verdict of the moroccan 's year-long retrial hearing without stating the court 's reasons for the decision . support of hamburg cell leads to conviction el motassadeq was convicted on terror-related charges after the prosecution accused him of helping pay tuition and other bills for members of the hamburg cell to allow them to live as students while they plotted the attacks . prosecutors had demanded the maximum sentence of 15 years in prison for el motassadeq , but defense lawyers sought acquittal for the moroccan , who acknowledges he was close to the hijackers but insists he knew nothing of their plans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plumes of smoke pour from the world trade center buildings in new york tuesday , sept .
11 , 2001 .
el motassadeq , who looked on calmly as schudt announced the verdict , was the first man to go on trial over the terrorist attacks in new york and washington that killed more than 3,000 people .
he was found guilty and sentenced the maximum 15 years in prison in february 2003 .
but a german federal tribunal overturned the verdict last year and sent the case back to the court in the northern port city of hamburg , where three of the 19 suicide hijackers lived and studied .
attorney ladislav anisic said there was no evidence that directly linked his client to the plot and argued that motassadeq was being tried simply on guilt by association , which he said was unacceptable under the rule of law in a democracy like germany 's .
" let us not let osama bin laden win here at home by sacrificing our legal foundations , " he argued before the court .
anisic has said he will appeal any verdict other than an acquittal .
us not cooperating german observers say the prosecution 's case had been weakened by the failure of the united states to hand over more information on two top al qaeda operatives in its custody .
the federal court overturned the verdict on the grounds that the hamburg judges had not been able to hear potentially exculpatory testimony from the self-purported mastermind behind the attacks , ramzi binalshibh , and al qaeda 's suspected number three , khalid sheikh mohammed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdelghani mzoudi , left , was freed .
many think motassadeq will also be acquitted .
the us justice department provided two sets of summaries of their interrogation in which the two men reportedly said that motassadeq and fellow moroccan abdelghani mzoudi had had no involvement in the plot .
the prosecution has argued that the accounts are not credible given al qaeda training methods in counterintelligence .
but the reports and the holes in the case were enough to see mzoudi acquitted in hamburg on the same charges motassadeq is again facing .
after his release , mzoudi returned to morocco in june under threat of deportation .
perhaps in the hopes of a similar outcome to his trial , motassadeq has extended his moroccan passport and said he wished to go home as soon as possible .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 19.08.2005 cologne : germany 's oldest jewish community großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne 's synagogue will welcome pope benedict xvi on friday the jewish community in cologne is the oldest in germany , with a history which stretches back 2,000 years .
pope benedict 's visit will add another chapter to the tale of highs and lows , religion , tragedy and rebirth . when the jews first came to cologne in the wake of the roman legions , they were taken by the lush green and fertile land of the rhine valley .
so much so , that they decided to stay and found what is now the oldest jewish community north of the alps .
the first official mention of the community is in a decree from king constantine in 321 ad , granting them membership in the city council .
although cologne is now known for it ’ s cathedral and catholic traditions , back then it was considered the jerusalem of the north . the city 's jewish community struggled on through the centuries as empires , from the romans to the huns , the franks to the ottonians and the germans rose and fell around them .
although the community often played an active role in helping to shape the empires , it was not free from the persecution , pogroms and plagues which characterized the times . short-lived religious freedom discrimination under the rule of emperors , kings and bishops was rife , and it was only when french revolutionary troops occupied the city in 1792 that cologne 's jews received civil rights and religious freedom .
but that freedom did n't last . the nazis ended nearly two millennia of jewish life in cologne .
although some were lucky enough to escape in time , some 11,000 of the city 's jews were deported and murdered at the hands of the hitler regime . rebuilding the community bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city of cologne sometimes the city invites jews who fled the nazis , to come and visit the place where they used to live .
otto spier , who now lives in israel , recently returned to cologne for the first time in more than 60 years . " the view of cologne floats before my eyes again .
what ’ s surprising is that you still have a relationship to your city of birth and that despite everything that ’ s happened , there ’ s still a bond to the things that formed you in your youth , " he said . today , the immigration of jews from the former soviet union means that cologne is once again home to one of germany ’ s largest jewish communities . kirsten serup-bilfeldt -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german pope promises dialogue with jews as pope benedict xvi continued to settle into his role as the new leader of the catholic church , he vowed to promote dialogue with jews as part of an emphasis on interfaith issues .

there are signs that the gap between them and church leaders is narrowing . as world youth day -lrb- wyd -rrb- enters its climactic phase with the arrival of pope benedict xvi on thursday , church critics are also stepping up their activities .
a number of reform organizations from around the world have been handing out flyers and staging events in the city of cologne in an attempt to reach the young people attending the catholic festival . united under the umbrella of the " world youth day 4 all coalition " -lrb- wyd4all -rrb- , they have set up their base for the duration of the gathering in a church in the city center . while there is hardly any room given to controversial issues in the official wyd program , young believers ' response to critical questions has been enormous , says aisha taylor , program director of the us-based women 's ordination conference . " the possibility for priests to get married , the rights of gays and lesbians , more democratic participation for lay people - all these are points on which we would like to see progress , " she said . women priests unsettle leaders a particular focus of taylor 's work concerns the role of women in the church .
according to official doctrine women can not be become priests . " when seven women were ordained priests in 2002 by a dissident bishop in austria , the vatican excommunicated the women within a week or so , " taylor , 24 , said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gisela forster , left , and christine mayr-lumetzberger are two of the seven women who were ordained as priests by argentine bishop romulo braschi in 2002 in defiance of the ban of catholic church on female clergy .
at the time , it was cardinal joseph ratzinger , then head of the congregation for the doctrine of the faith and now pope benedict xvi , who lead the charge against them . yet , judging from responses from the people thronging the streets of cologne , equal rights for women in the church consistently rank among the top demands , reports taylor , who sees the demonstrative ordination of women also as a way to elicit a direct response from the vatican . " the pope is getting annoyed and knows who we are , " she said .
" but we have to use these alternative paths to make our opinions known , because the church is not a democracy and its members have no vote . " even if benedict xvi refuses to recognize women priests , in the future another pope could make a cut with the past , she says .
and the ongoing effort by reformers is having an impact , she adds : " we now have female altar service and women who work as eucharistic ministers .
and in a letter the pope , then a cardinal , made a point of the equality of men and women in public life - except in the church context . " latin american concerns in other regions of the world , such as latin america , where a large majority of the population is catholic , there is not necessarily a less critical view than in europe or north america . " the church has a lot of spiritual and political power in our part of the world , " said 25-year-old andrea ramirez from bolivia who heads the youth chapter of the " we are church " reform movement in her home country .
" but there is also strong support for the gay movement or the feminists . " " we want to show that you can be a good catholic and be gay or lesbian .
or that you can be a good catholic and use condoms , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church still has enormous influence in latin america the ongoing refusal by the vatican to soften its stance on family planning or the use of condoms is particularly detrimental to poor countries , says ramirez . " but maybe the pope has n't had enough time , yet , to properly get in touch with the very real problems of the nations of the south . " the refusal by conservative church leaders to engage in debate sometimes takes forms that amount to keeping information away from young believers , critics say . “ we have seen how nuns accompanying a group of young catholics took away from them the flyers we had just handed out to them , ” reports agnes rudnik , a spokeswoman for the gay and lesbian groups at wyd . cheer the pope , follow your conscience - no problem so is it a contradiction that young people attending wyd are welcoming the pope with overwhelming enthusiasm , yet feel strongly about a number contentious issues on which they are opposed to the pontiff , as reformers claim ? " i don ’ t think there is a contradiction when people cheer the pope and follow their conscience at the same time , ” says tobias raschke , the german spokesman for " we are church . ”
" young people feel it is their church and sincerely want the pope to understand what their concerns are . ” the critics make a strong point that they are part of the church and do consider themselves firmly rooted in the faith . " i really hope our work gives a new impetus for change to the pope , because he ’ s my religious leader after all , ” says ramirez . “ i love my faith and the catholic church , it ’ s my heritage , my tradition " , says aisha taylor . signs of change while wyd is an event that appeals to the masses , many young reformers agree that behind it there is a genuine attempt to reach out to the younger generation .
the efforts and successes of the church in tackling social problems , injustice and poverty around the world is something that draws particularly strong support from young people . one of the few events wyd organizers put on to engage young people in an open debate focused on precisely these themes called " youthhearing . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal oscar rodriguez archbishop of tegucicalpa -lrb- honduras -rrb- held at a community center in cologne on wednesday afternoon , there was rapturous applause from the floor when critics brought up the ban on condom use , which in their view undermines the fight against hiv / aids in poor countries . in their response , german bishop reinhard marx and cardinal oscar rodriguez from honduras stopped just short of actively endorsing condoms , but acknowledged that they can play an important role . a revolution ?

" when seven women were ordained priests in 2002 by a dissident bishop in austria , the vatican excommunicated the women within a week or so , " taylor , 24 , said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gisela forster , left , and christine mayr-lumetzberger are two of the seven women who were ordained as priests by argentine bishop romulo braschi in 2002 in defiance of the ban of catholic church on female clergy .
at the time , it was cardinal joseph ratzinger , then head of the congregation for the doctrine of the faith and now pope benedict xvi , who lead the charge against them . yet , judging from responses from the people thronging the streets of cologne , equal rights for women in the church consistently rank among the top demands , reports taylor , who sees the demonstrative ordination of women also as a way to elicit a direct response from the vatican . " the pope is getting annoyed and knows who we are , " she said .
" but we have to use these alternative paths to make our opinions known , because the church is not a democracy and its members have no vote . " even if benedict xvi refuses to recognize women priests , in the future another pope could make a cut with the past , she says .
and the ongoing effort by reformers is having an impact , she adds : " we now have female altar service and women who work as eucharistic ministers .
and in a letter the pope , then a cardinal , made a point of the equality of men and women in public life - except in the church context . " latin american concerns in other regions of the world , such as latin america , where a large majority of the population is catholic , there is not necessarily a less critical view than in europe or north america . " the church has a lot of spiritual and political power in our part of the world , " said 25-year-old andrea ramirez from bolivia who heads the youth chapter of the " we are church " reform movement in her home country .
" but there is also strong support for the gay movement or the feminists . " " we want to show that you can be a good catholic and be gay or lesbian .
or that you can be a good catholic and use condoms , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church still has enormous influence in latin america the ongoing refusal by the vatican to soften its stance on family planning or the use of condoms is particularly detrimental to poor countries , says ramirez . " but maybe the pope has n't had enough time , yet , to properly get in touch with the very real problems of the nations of the south . " the refusal by conservative church leaders to engage in debate sometimes takes forms that amount to keeping information away from young believers , critics say . “ we have seen how nuns accompanying a group of young catholics took away from them the flyers we had just handed out to them , ” reports agnes rudnik , a spokeswoman for the gay and lesbian groups at wyd . cheer the pope , follow your conscience - no problem so is it a contradiction that young people attending wyd are welcoming the pope with overwhelming enthusiasm , yet feel strongly about a number contentious issues on which they are opposed to the pontiff , as reformers claim ? " i don ’ t think there is a contradiction when people cheer the pope and follow their conscience at the same time , ” says tobias raschke , the german spokesman for " we are church . ”
" young people feel it is their church and sincerely want the pope to understand what their concerns are . ” the critics make a strong point that they are part of the church and do consider themselves firmly rooted in the faith . " i really hope our work gives a new impetus for change to the pope , because he ’ s my religious leader after all , ” says ramirez . “ i love my faith and the catholic church , it ’ s my heritage , my tradition " , says aisha taylor . signs of change while wyd is an event that appeals to the masses , many young reformers agree that behind it there is a genuine attempt to reach out to the younger generation .
the efforts and successes of the church in tackling social problems , injustice and poverty around the world is something that draws particularly strong support from young people . one of the few events wyd organizers put on to engage young people in an open debate focused on precisely these themes called " youthhearing . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal oscar rodriguez archbishop of tegucicalpa -lrb- honduras -rrb- held at a community center in cologne on wednesday afternoon , there was rapturous applause from the floor when critics brought up the ban on condom use , which in their view undermines the fight against hiv / aids in poor countries . in their response , german bishop reinhard marx and cardinal oscar rodriguez from honduras stopped just short of actively endorsing condoms , but acknowledged that they can play an important role . a revolution ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 19.08.2005 eu panics as chinese imports hit quota großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not permitted for import european union clothing retailers faced a new headache as news broke that the 2005 quota for chinese-made blouses was reached on thursday with other quotas nearing their ceiling for the year . clothing retailers in the european union face a worrying time after imports of chinese-made blouses into the eu reached their agreed quota for this year with other categories of textiles likely to meet their limits soon too , according to a spokesperson for the eu 's executive commission on friday . " this morning the quota for category seven , blouses , was filled .
member states custom authorities will no longer issue import licenses for this product , " spokesman rupert krietemeyer told afp , reading a statement .
according to the eu imports database , data shows that 100 percent of a 2005 quota of nearly 24.8 million chinese blouses had been cleared for entry into the eu as of thursday evening . the commission spokesperson had further bad news for retailers : " it is likely that a number of other quotas will also be filled in the very near future , " he added .
specifically , quotas for bras , t-shirts and flax yarn were close to being met . the quotas for men 's trousers and pullovers were also already reached earlier this month , leaving millions of garments stranded at eu customs and outraging some big eu retailers awaiting deliveries . eu , china still locked in quota talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu and chinese officials have been holding talks on the quotas and brussels has said it is willing to be flexible .
eu trade commissioner peter mandelson -lrb- photo -rrb- has made it clear that he wants to negotiate with china to allow more clothing imports into the bloc , possibly by using some of 2006 quotas in 2005 . after eu textile producers urged that the quotas be implemented , eu officials are coming under fierce pressure from retailers who warn that store shelves could be bare during the key back-to-school period because they have not received some shipments . on thursday , government ministers from the netherlands , denmark , sweden and finland wrote an article in the financial times saying there was a risk of job losses and bankruptcies unless the eu eases the curbs on the imports .
this followed a letter sent to mandelson by germany 's economy minister wolfgang clement which called for a relaxation of the import restrictions . textile producers fear massive influx from china not all eu countries want the import restrictions to be relaxed .
countries with big textile industries of their own , like france , italy and spain , are worried they will suffer if chinese clothing enters the eu on a massive scale . the eu and china agreed to a broad textile trade agreement in june setting annual restrictions on 10 categories of chinese imports , which had been surging since the beginning of the year following the end of an international quota system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu trade commissioner peter mandelson , left , and his chinese counterpart bo xilai , right , toast during a signing ceremony early saturday june 11 , 2005 in shanghai , china .

" this morning the quota for category seven , blouses , was filled .
member states custom authorities will no longer issue import licenses for this product , " spokesman rupert krietemeyer told afp , reading a statement .
according to the eu imports database , data shows that 100 percent of a 2005 quota of nearly 24.8 million chinese blouses had been cleared for entry into the eu as of thursday evening . the commission spokesperson had further bad news for retailers : " it is likely that a number of other quotas will also be filled in the very near future , " he added .
specifically , quotas for bras , t-shirts and flax yarn were close to being met . the quotas for men 's trousers and pullovers were also already reached earlier this month , leaving millions of garments stranded at eu customs and outraging some big eu retailers awaiting deliveries . eu , china still locked in quota talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu and chinese officials have been holding talks on the quotas and brussels has said it is willing to be flexible .
eu trade commissioner peter mandelson -lrb- photo -rrb- has made it clear that he wants to negotiate with china to allow more clothing imports into the bloc , possibly by using some of 2006 quotas in 2005 . after eu textile producers urged that the quotas be implemented , eu officials are coming under fierce pressure from retailers who warn that store shelves could be bare during the key back-to-school period because they have not received some shipments . on thursday , government ministers from the netherlands , denmark , sweden and finland wrote an article in the financial times saying there was a risk of job losses and bankruptcies unless the eu eases the curbs on the imports .
this followed a letter sent to mandelson by germany 's economy minister wolfgang clement which called for a relaxation of the import restrictions . textile producers fear massive influx from china not all eu countries want the import restrictions to be relaxed .
countries with big textile industries of their own , like france , italy and spain , are worried they will suffer if chinese clothing enters the eu on a massive scale . the eu and china agreed to a broad textile trade agreement in june setting annual restrictions on 10 categories of chinese imports , which had been surging since the beginning of the year following the end of an international quota system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu trade commissioner peter mandelson , left , and his chinese counterpart bo xilai , right , toast during a signing ceremony early saturday june 11 , 2005 in shanghai , china .

member states custom authorities will no longer issue import licenses for this product , " spokesman rupert krietemeyer told afp , reading a statement .
according to the eu imports database , data shows that 100 percent of a 2005 quota of nearly 24.8 million chinese blouses had been cleared for entry into the eu as of thursday evening . the commission spokesperson had further bad news for retailers : " it is likely that a number of other quotas will also be filled in the very near future , " he added .
specifically , quotas for bras , t-shirts and flax yarn were close to being met . the quotas for men 's trousers and pullovers were also already reached earlier this month , leaving millions of garments stranded at eu customs and outraging some big eu retailers awaiting deliveries . eu , china still locked in quota talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu and chinese officials have been holding talks on the quotas and brussels has said it is willing to be flexible .
eu trade commissioner peter mandelson -lrb- photo -rrb- has made it clear that he wants to negotiate with china to allow more clothing imports into the bloc , possibly by using some of 2006 quotas in 2005 . after eu textile producers urged that the quotas be implemented , eu officials are coming under fierce pressure from retailers who warn that store shelves could be bare during the key back-to-school period because they have not received some shipments . on thursday , government ministers from the netherlands , denmark , sweden and finland wrote an article in the financial times saying there was a risk of job losses and bankruptcies unless the eu eases the curbs on the imports .
this followed a letter sent to mandelson by germany 's economy minister wolfgang clement which called for a relaxation of the import restrictions . textile producers fear massive influx from china not all eu countries want the import restrictions to be relaxed .
countries with big textile industries of their own , like france , italy and spain , are worried they will suffer if chinese clothing enters the eu on a massive scale . the eu and china agreed to a broad textile trade agreement in june setting annual restrictions on 10 categories of chinese imports , which had been surging since the beginning of the year following the end of an international quota system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu trade commissioner peter mandelson , left , and his chinese counterpart bo xilai , right , toast during a signing ceremony early saturday june 11 , 2005 in shanghai , china .
the european union said friday it had reached a deal to resolve a dispute with china over a surge of chinese textile imports .
after protracted negotiations between chinese commerce minister bo xilai and mandelson in shanghai in june , china said that it would limit growth in exports of 10 textile and clothing products to the eu from between 8 to 12.5 percent a year in a bid to defuse the trade row . agreement in june rubber-stamped growth rate " china and the european union have agreed that , in the period from june 11 , 2005 to the end of 2007 , with an agreed base quantity , we will determine china 's amount of exports to europe by a growth rate of between 8 to 12.5 percent per year , " the ministry of commerce said in a statement on its web site after the end of negotiations . the eu response was to issue a statement that said that in 2008 , the eu will only apply " with restraint " paragraph 242 of china 's world trade organization accession protocol on textiles , which requires china to limit exports of textile products .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 19.08.2005 surprise good review for german economy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chancellor likes what " the economist " is writing one of the world 's most prominent business magazines has given the german economy the thumbs up .
the positive review in " the economist " has everyone surprised - except for the chancellor . great britain 's and maybe the world 's most prominent business magazine is not known for its love affair with germany 's economic system .
the decidedly pro-business economist has in recent years enjoyed ribbing europe 's largest economy for its stagnant growth rates , high unemployment and a union strength that has led to sky-high labor costs .
all the more surprising , then , that when the german symbol , the black eagle , graced the front of this week 's magazine as a caricature , it was flexing its muscles underneath the headline " germany 's surprising economy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : really ? " some forecasters are now predicting that germany , which has for so many years disappointed on the downside , could be about to surprise on the upside , " the magazine wrote in the lead editorial . weakened unions a good thing as reasons for this the economist listed , above all , the turnaround accomplished by the country 's major corporations .
the newfound flexibility of germany 's usually stubborn unions has helped lower labor costs immensely and made the country more competitive than italy , the netherlands , great britain and france .
" that is a big reason why , last year , it regained its position as the world 's biggest exporter , " it wrote . the magazine gave credit to chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition government of social democrats and the green party for getting reforms underway .
his raft of labor and socio-economic reforms , called agenda 2010 , may lose him the election this september , but they have nonetheless " raised hopes that fresh impetus could set the economy on to its strongest track for years . " tough measures , like the unpopular hartz iv law that made it more difficult for germany 's 1.8 million long-term unemployed to receive benefits without actively looking for jobs , won the magazine 's approval .
" hartz iv ... has added 8 billion euros -lrb- $ 9.8 billion -rrb- to this year 's government costs , but failed to create many new jobs , " the magazine wrote .
" it has , however , made employees more fearful of the consequences of losing their jobs .
that has strengthened the hand of firms ... and weakened the power of trade unions . " bildunterschrift : germany 's unions are getting weak , and that 's a good thing , according to " the economist " chancellor : proof we 're doing things right the report raised eyebrows in germany , getting press coverage not only from business magazines , but local papers as well .
germany 's prominent frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper followed up on the economist cover with a piece examining the euphoria .
" nobody wants to believe it : germany is gaining more prominence abroad as an investment destination , " it wrote . nobody , that is , except for the chancellor .
at one point during an hour-long interview on german public television yesterday evening , schröder fished a piece of paper out of his pocket .
it was the economist 's piece . " the economist , a publication that in the past was never particularly pro-german , has a cover story ' economist cheers germany 's surprising economy ' and says that thanks to the reforms we introduced our competitiveness has grown enormously , " he said . economist : merkel needs a chance but schröder neglected to mention one thing .
though it gave schröder 's government a small amount of praise for getting the reform process started , the economist editorialists clearly hope his opponents will be the ones continuing them after the likely elections on sept .
18 .
" the commitment of the new government to further reforms will make a big difference , " they wrote .
" the politicians may not be able to control the economy , but they can certainly muck it up .
a center-right government under ms. merkel would have the advantage that her party also controls the upper-house bundesrat , making it far easier to push through legislative change .

11 terror attacks in the united states , was convicted by a german court on friday and sentenced to seven years in prison . mounir el motassadeq , the man suspected of helping the sept .
11 hijackers while the cell was preparing the attacks in hamburg , was convicted of being a member of a terrorist organization and sentenced to seven years in prison by a german court on friday . presiding judge ernst-rainer schudt announced the verdict of the moroccan 's year-long retrial hearing without stating the court 's reasons for the decision . support of hamburg cell leads to conviction el motassadeq was convicted on terror-related charges after the prosecution accused him of helping pay tuition and other bills for members of the hamburg cell to allow them to live as students while they plotted the attacks . prosecutors had demanded the maximum sentence of 15 years in prison for el motassadeq , but defense lawyers sought acquittal for the moroccan , who acknowledges he was close to the hijackers but insists he knew nothing of their plans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plumes of smoke pour from the world trade center buildings in new york tuesday , sept .
11 , 2001 .
el motassadeq , who looked on calmly as schudt announced the verdict , was the first man to go on trial over the terrorist attacks in new york and washington that killed more than 3,000 people .
he was found guilty and sentenced the maximum 15 years in prison in february 2003 .
but a german federal tribunal overturned the verdict last year and sent the case back to the court in the northern port city of hamburg , where three of the 19 suicide hijackers lived and studied .
attorney ladislav anisic said there was no evidence that directly linked his client to the plot and argued that motassadeq was being tried simply on guilt by association , which he said was unacceptable under the rule of law in a democracy like germany 's .
" let us not let osama bin laden win here at home by sacrificing our legal foundations , " he argued before the court .
anisic has said he will appeal any verdict other than an acquittal .
us not cooperating german observers say the prosecution 's case had been weakened by the failure of the united states to hand over more information on two top al qaeda operatives in its custody .
the federal court overturned the verdict on the grounds that the hamburg judges had not been able to hear potentially exculpatory testimony from the self-purported mastermind behind the attacks , ramzi binalshibh , and al qaeda 's suspected number three , khalid sheikh mohammed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdelghani mzoudi , left , was freed .
many think motassadeq will also be acquitted .
the us justice department provided two sets of summaries of their interrogation in which the two men reportedly said that motassadeq and fellow moroccan abdelghani mzoudi had had no involvement in the plot .
the prosecution has argued that the accounts are not credible given al qaeda training methods in counterintelligence .
but the reports and the holes in the case were enough to see mzoudi acquitted in hamburg on the same charges motassadeq is again facing .
after his release , mzoudi returned to morocco in june under threat of deportation .
perhaps in the hopes of a similar outcome to his trial , motassadeq has extended his moroccan passport and said he wished to go home as soon as possible .

" i thank all of you for our presence in cologne at this great gathering , in the hope that it will mark a step forward on the path towards reconciliation and unity , " said the german-born pope , formerly cardinal joseph ratzinger . by using his visit here to meet with the leaders of jewish and muslim communities , benedict has underscored a pledge made in his first speeches after his election in april that he would use his pontificate to work for christian unity and to build bridges with the other monotheistic religions . benedict 's symbolic visit to cologne 's synagogue at midday on friday will be only the second in modern history , following that of his predecessor john paul ii to rome 's synagogue 19 years ago . " while john paul ii expressed himself through gestures , pope ratzinger gives great space to words .
this pontificate will be a pontificate of concepts and of words , " vatican spokesman joaquin navarro-valls told journalists thursday in a rare public comparison of papal styles . benedict looking to build a youth following seeking to build the same kind of rapport with young people enjoyed by his charismatic predecessor , pope benedict said he would use his trip to " confirm their faith and enliven their hope " .

" through you may other young people everywhere come to recognize in christ the true answer to their deepest aspirations , " he said .

11 terror attacks in the united states , was convicted by a german court on friday and sentenced to seven years in prison . mounir el motassadeq , the man suspected of helping the sept .
11 hijackers while the cell was preparing the attacks in hamburg , was convicted of being a member of a terrorist organization and sentenced to seven years in prison by a german court on friday . presiding judge ernst-rainer schudt announced the verdict of the moroccan 's year-long retrial hearing without stating the court 's reasons for the decision . support of hamburg cell leads to conviction el motassadeq was convicted on terror-related charges after the prosecution accused him of helping pay tuition and other bills for members of the hamburg cell to allow them to live as students while they plotted the attacks . prosecutors had demanded the maximum sentence of 15 years in prison for el motassadeq , but defense lawyers sought acquittal for the moroccan , who acknowledges he was close to the hijackers but insists he knew nothing of their plans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plumes of smoke pour from the world trade center buildings in new york tuesday , sept .
11 , 2001 .
el motassadeq , who looked on calmly as schudt announced the verdict , was the first man to go on trial over the terrorist attacks in new york and washington that killed more than 3,000 people .
he was found guilty and sentenced the maximum 15 years in prison in february 2003 .
but a german federal tribunal overturned the verdict last year and sent the case back to the court in the northern port city of hamburg , where three of the 19 suicide hijackers lived and studied .
attorney ladislav anisic said there was no evidence that directly linked his client to the plot and argued that motassadeq was being tried simply on guilt by association , which he said was unacceptable under the rule of law in a democracy like germany 's .
" let us not let osama bin laden win here at home by sacrificing our legal foundations , " he argued before the court .
anisic has said he will appeal any verdict other than an acquittal .
us not cooperating german observers say the prosecution 's case had been weakened by the failure of the united states to hand over more information on two top al qaeda operatives in its custody .
the federal court overturned the verdict on the grounds that the hamburg judges had not been able to hear potentially exculpatory testimony from the self-purported mastermind behind the attacks , ramzi binalshibh , and al qaeda 's suspected number three , khalid sheikh mohammed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdelghani mzoudi , left , was freed .
many think motassadeq will also be acquitted .
the us justice department provided two sets of summaries of their interrogation in which the two men reportedly said that motassadeq and fellow moroccan abdelghani mzoudi had had no involvement in the plot .
the prosecution has argued that the accounts are not credible given al qaeda training methods in counterintelligence .
but the reports and the holes in the case were enough to see mzoudi acquitted in hamburg on the same charges motassadeq is again facing .
after his release , mzoudi returned to morocco in june under threat of deportation .
perhaps in the hopes of a similar outcome to his trial , motassadeq has extended his moroccan passport and said he wished to go home as soon as possible .
after 65 hearings and 112 witnesses during the retrial alone , which began one year ago , a not guilty verdict would have been a humiliating blow to federal prosecutors . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb / nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de 9/11 suspect trial resumes after delay a moroccan student being retried over involvement in the september 11 , 2001 attacks in new york and washington , provided " active support " to the suicide pilots , the federal prosecutor told a german court on monday .

the positive review in " the economist " has everyone surprised - except for the chancellor . great britain 's and maybe the world 's most prominent business magazine is not known for its love affair with germany 's economic system .
the decidedly pro-business economist has in recent years enjoyed ribbing europe 's largest economy for its stagnant growth rates , high unemployment and a union strength that has led to sky-high labor costs .
all the more surprising , then , that when the german symbol , the black eagle , graced the front of this week 's magazine as a caricature , it was flexing its muscles underneath the headline " germany 's surprising economy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : really ? " some forecasters are now predicting that germany , which has for so many years disappointed on the downside , could be about to surprise on the upside , " the magazine wrote in the lead editorial . weakened unions a good thing as reasons for this the economist listed , above all , the turnaround accomplished by the country 's major corporations .
the newfound flexibility of germany 's usually stubborn unions has helped lower labor costs immensely and made the country more competitive than italy , the netherlands , great britain and france .
" that is a big reason why , last year , it regained its position as the world 's biggest exporter , " it wrote . the magazine gave credit to chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition government of social democrats and the green party for getting reforms underway .
his raft of labor and socio-economic reforms , called agenda 2010 , may lose him the election this september , but they have nonetheless " raised hopes that fresh impetus could set the economy on to its strongest track for years . " tough measures , like the unpopular hartz iv law that made it more difficult for germany 's 1.8 million long-term unemployed to receive benefits without actively looking for jobs , won the magazine 's approval .
" hartz iv ... has added 8 billion euros -lrb- $ 9.8 billion -rrb- to this year 's government costs , but failed to create many new jobs , " the magazine wrote .
" it has , however , made employees more fearful of the consequences of losing their jobs .

germany 's prominent frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper followed up on the economist cover with a piece examining the euphoria .
" nobody wants to believe it : germany is gaining more prominence abroad as an investment destination , " it wrote . nobody , that is , except for the chancellor .
at one point during an hour-long interview on german public television yesterday evening , schröder fished a piece of paper out of his pocket .
it was the economist 's piece . " the economist , a publication that in the past was never particularly pro-german , has a cover story ' economist cheers germany 's surprising economy ' and says that thanks to the reforms we introduced our competitiveness has grown enormously , " he said . economist : merkel needs a chance but schröder neglected to mention one thing .

pope benedict 's visit will add another chapter to the tale of highs and lows , religion , tragedy and rebirth . when the jews first came to cologne in the wake of the roman legions , they were taken by the lush green and fertile land of the rhine valley .
so much so , that they decided to stay and found what is now the oldest jewish community north of the alps .
the first official mention of the community is in a decree from king constantine in 321 ad , granting them membership in the city council .
although cologne is now known for it ’ s cathedral and catholic traditions , back then it was considered the jerusalem of the north . the city 's jewish community struggled on through the centuries as empires , from the romans to the huns , the franks to the ottonians and the germans rose and fell around them .
although the community often played an active role in helping to shape the empires , it was not free from the persecution , pogroms and plagues which characterized the times . short-lived religious freedom discrimination under the rule of emperors , kings and bishops was rife , and it was only when french revolutionary troops occupied the city in 1792 that cologne 's jews received civil rights and religious freedom .
but that freedom did n't last . the nazis ended nearly two millennia of jewish life in cologne .
although some were lucky enough to escape in time , some 11,000 of the city 's jews were deported and murdered at the hands of the hitler regime . rebuilding the community bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city of cologne sometimes the city invites jews who fled the nazis , to come and visit the place where they used to live .
otto spier , who now lives in israel , recently returned to cologne for the first time in more than 60 years . " the view of cologne floats before my eyes again .
what ’ s surprising is that you still have a relationship to your city of birth and that despite everything that ’ s happened , there ’ s still a bond to the things that formed you in your youth , " he said . today , the immigration of jews from the former soviet union means that cologne is once again home to one of germany ’ s largest jewish communities . kirsten serup-bilfeldt -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german pope promises dialogue with jews as pope benedict xvi continued to settle into his role as the new leader of the catholic church , he vowed to promote dialogue with jews as part of an emphasis on interfaith issues .
-lrb- april 22 , 2005 -rrb- young jews in germany want normality with germany 's jewish community growing steadily in recent years , young jews are becoming more active .
their goal : to be considered a normal part of society .

there are signs that the gap between them and church leaders is narrowing . as world youth day -lrb- wyd -rrb- enters its climactic phase with the arrival of pope benedict xvi on thursday , church critics are also stepping up their activities .
a number of reform organizations from around the world have been handing out flyers and staging events in the city of cologne in an attempt to reach the young people attending the catholic festival . united under the umbrella of the " world youth day 4 all coalition " -lrb- wyd4all -rrb- , they have set up their base for the duration of the gathering in a church in the city center . while there is hardly any room given to controversial issues in the official wyd program , young believers ' response to critical questions has been enormous , says aisha taylor , program director of the us-based women 's ordination conference . " the possibility for priests to get married , the rights of gays and lesbians , more democratic participation for lay people - all these are points on which we would like to see progress , " she said . women priests unsettle leaders a particular focus of taylor 's work concerns the role of women in the church .
according to official doctrine women can not be become priests . " when seven women were ordained priests in 2002 by a dissident bishop in austria , the vatican excommunicated the women within a week or so , " taylor , 24 , said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gisela forster , left , and christine mayr-lumetzberger are two of the seven women who were ordained as priests by argentine bishop romulo braschi in 2002 in defiance of the ban of catholic church on female clergy .
at the time , it was cardinal joseph ratzinger , then head of the congregation for the doctrine of the faith and now pope benedict xvi , who lead the charge against them . yet , judging from responses from the people thronging the streets of cologne , equal rights for women in the church consistently rank among the top demands , reports taylor , who sees the demonstrative ordination of women also as a way to elicit a direct response from the vatican . " the pope is getting annoyed and knows who we are , " she said .
" but we have to use these alternative paths to make our opinions known , because the church is not a democracy and its members have no vote . " even if benedict xvi refuses to recognize women priests , in the future another pope could make a cut with the past , she says .
and the ongoing effort by reformers is having an impact , she adds : " we now have female altar service and women who work as eucharistic ministers .
and in a letter the pope , then a cardinal , made a point of the equality of men and women in public life - except in the church context . " latin american concerns in other regions of the world , such as latin america , where a large majority of the population is catholic , there is not necessarily a less critical view than in europe or north america . " the church has a lot of spiritual and political power in our part of the world , " said 25-year-old andrea ramirez from bolivia who heads the youth chapter of the " we are church " reform movement in her home country .
" but there is also strong support for the gay movement or the feminists . " " we want to show that you can be a good catholic and be gay or lesbian .
or that you can be a good catholic and use condoms , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church still has enormous influence in latin america the ongoing refusal by the vatican to soften its stance on family planning or the use of condoms is particularly detrimental to poor countries , says ramirez . " but maybe the pope has n't had enough time , yet , to properly get in touch with the very real problems of the nations of the south . " the refusal by conservative church leaders to engage in debate sometimes takes forms that amount to keeping information away from young believers , critics say . “ we have seen how nuns accompanying a group of young catholics took away from them the flyers we had just handed out to them , ” reports agnes rudnik , a spokeswoman for the gay and lesbian groups at wyd . cheer the pope , follow your conscience - no problem so is it a contradiction that young people attending wyd are welcoming the pope with overwhelming enthusiasm , yet feel strongly about a number contentious issues on which they are opposed to the pontiff , as reformers claim ? " i don ’ t think there is a contradiction when people cheer the pope and follow their conscience at the same time , ” says tobias raschke , the german spokesman for " we are church . ”
" young people feel it is their church and sincerely want the pope to understand what their concerns are . ” the critics make a strong point that they are part of the church and do consider themselves firmly rooted in the faith . " i really hope our work gives a new impetus for change to the pope , because he ’ s my religious leader after all , ” says ramirez . “ i love my faith and the catholic church , it ’ s my heritage , my tradition " , says aisha taylor . signs of change while wyd is an event that appeals to the masses , many young reformers agree that behind it there is a genuine attempt to reach out to the younger generation .
the efforts and successes of the church in tackling social problems , injustice and poverty around the world is something that draws particularly strong support from young people . one of the few events wyd organizers put on to engage young people in an open debate focused on precisely these themes called " youthhearing . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal oscar rodriguez archbishop of tegucicalpa -lrb- honduras -rrb- held at a community center in cologne on wednesday afternoon , there was rapturous applause from the floor when critics brought up the ban on condom use , which in their view undermines the fight against hiv / aids in poor countries . in their response , german bishop reinhard marx and cardinal oscar rodriguez from honduras stopped just short of actively endorsing condoms , but acknowledged that they can play an important role . a revolution ?

" when seven women were ordained priests in 2002 by a dissident bishop in austria , the vatican excommunicated the women within a week or so , " taylor , 24 , said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gisela forster , left , and christine mayr-lumetzberger are two of the seven women who were ordained as priests by argentine bishop romulo braschi in 2002 in defiance of the ban of catholic church on female clergy .
at the time , it was cardinal joseph ratzinger , then head of the congregation for the doctrine of the faith and now pope benedict xvi , who lead the charge against them . yet , judging from responses from the people thronging the streets of cologne , equal rights for women in the church consistently rank among the top demands , reports taylor , who sees the demonstrative ordination of women also as a way to elicit a direct response from the vatican . " the pope is getting annoyed and knows who we are , " she said .
" but we have to use these alternative paths to make our opinions known , because the church is not a democracy and its members have no vote . " even if benedict xvi refuses to recognize women priests , in the future another pope could make a cut with the past , she says .
and the ongoing effort by reformers is having an impact , she adds : " we now have female altar service and women who work as eucharistic ministers .
and in a letter the pope , then a cardinal , made a point of the equality of men and women in public life - except in the church context . " latin american concerns in other regions of the world , such as latin america , where a large majority of the population is catholic , there is not necessarily a less critical view than in europe or north america . " the church has a lot of spiritual and political power in our part of the world , " said 25-year-old andrea ramirez from bolivia who heads the youth chapter of the " we are church " reform movement in her home country .
" but there is also strong support for the gay movement or the feminists . " " we want to show that you can be a good catholic and be gay or lesbian .
or that you can be a good catholic and use condoms , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church still has enormous influence in latin america the ongoing refusal by the vatican to soften its stance on family planning or the use of condoms is particularly detrimental to poor countries , says ramirez . " but maybe the pope has n't had enough time , yet , to properly get in touch with the very real problems of the nations of the south . " the refusal by conservative church leaders to engage in debate sometimes takes forms that amount to keeping information away from young believers , critics say . “ we have seen how nuns accompanying a group of young catholics took away from them the flyers we had just handed out to them , ” reports agnes rudnik , a spokeswoman for the gay and lesbian groups at wyd . cheer the pope , follow your conscience - no problem so is it a contradiction that young people attending wyd are welcoming the pope with overwhelming enthusiasm , yet feel strongly about a number contentious issues on which they are opposed to the pontiff , as reformers claim ? " i don ’ t think there is a contradiction when people cheer the pope and follow their conscience at the same time , ” says tobias raschke , the german spokesman for " we are church . ”
" young people feel it is their church and sincerely want the pope to understand what their concerns are . ” the critics make a strong point that they are part of the church and do consider themselves firmly rooted in the faith . " i really hope our work gives a new impetus for change to the pope , because he ’ s my religious leader after all , ” says ramirez . “ i love my faith and the catholic church , it ’ s my heritage , my tradition " , says aisha taylor . signs of change while wyd is an event that appeals to the masses , many young reformers agree that behind it there is a genuine attempt to reach out to the younger generation .
the efforts and successes of the church in tackling social problems , injustice and poverty around the world is something that draws particularly strong support from young people . one of the few events wyd organizers put on to engage young people in an open debate focused on precisely these themes called " youthhearing . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal oscar rodriguez archbishop of tegucicalpa -lrb- honduras -rrb- held at a community center in cologne on wednesday afternoon , there was rapturous applause from the floor when critics brought up the ban on condom use , which in their view undermines the fight against hiv / aids in poor countries . in their response , german bishop reinhard marx and cardinal oscar rodriguez from honduras stopped just short of actively endorsing condoms , but acknowledged that they can play an important role . a revolution ?
not quite .

" it 's a safe way to do it . " diverse responses while many of the postcards deal with election campaign issues such as unemployment , pensions , and education , other participants used their time at oring 's desk to air their pet peeves , or let their imaginations run wild . " i would charge a big fee for people who do n't clean up after their dogs , " wrote one disgruntled berliner . " i 'd like to be the king of berlin , " wrote another resident whose solution to the city 's problems would be to " open a big casino so everyone would be happy . " queuing up to talk with oring , eight-year-old gabriel excitedly outlined a list of laws he would pass if he were chancellor , including one that would " allow kids to play soccer everywhere .

pope benedict 's visit will add another chapter to the tale of highs and lows , religion , tragedy and rebirth . when the jews first came to cologne in the wake of the roman legions , they were taken by the lush green and fertile land of the rhine valley .
so much so , that they decided to stay and found what is now the oldest jewish community north of the alps .
the first official mention of the community is in a decree from king constantine in 321 ad , granting them membership in the city council .
although cologne is now known for it ’ s cathedral and catholic traditions , back then it was considered the jerusalem of the north . the city 's jewish community struggled on through the centuries as empires , from the romans to the huns , the franks to the ottonians and the germans rose and fell around them .
although the community often played an active role in helping to shape the empires , it was not free from the persecution , pogroms and plagues which characterized the times . short-lived religious freedom discrimination under the rule of emperors , kings and bishops was rife , and it was only when french revolutionary troops occupied the city in 1792 that cologne 's jews received civil rights and religious freedom .
but that freedom did n't last . the nazis ended nearly two millennia of jewish life in cologne .
although some were lucky enough to escape in time , some 11,000 of the city 's jews were deported and murdered at the hands of the hitler regime . rebuilding the community bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city of cologne sometimes the city invites jews who fled the nazis , to come and visit the place where they used to live .
otto spier , who now lives in israel , recently returned to cologne for the first time in more than 60 years . " the view of cologne floats before my eyes again .
what ’ s surprising is that you still have a relationship to your city of birth and that despite everything that ’ s happened , there ’ s still a bond to the things that formed you in your youth , " he said . today , the immigration of jews from the former soviet union means that cologne is once again home to one of germany ’ s largest jewish communities . kirsten serup-bilfeldt -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german pope promises dialogue with jews as pope benedict xvi continued to settle into his role as the new leader of the catholic church , he vowed to promote dialogue with jews as part of an emphasis on interfaith issues .

he began offering english-language tours of the city and now employs 15 to 20 guides at " insider tour . " hartnett plans to stay for at least a couple of more years , but is thinking about returning to his home country .
" the lifestyle 's pretty enviable there , " he said , adding that australia 's booming economy and optimism might be a better environment for his 15-month-old son to grow up in .
" i would want him to be shaped by that as opposed to present-day germany , " he said . dw-world : how is germany doing in your opinion ? francis hartnett : i think ratzinger -lrb- pope benedict xvi -rrb- said at the cologne world youth day that europe is lost in pessimism at the moment and that it has particularly striken germany and germans .
i think that 's a problem that pervades this country socially and economically .
as much savings as this country has it needs to be invigorated .
it 's going to snowball into a greater problem unless change is made , unless people feel energized and are given direction .
germany really needs to have some sense of purpose . what needs to happen in germany to help speed up the country 's recovery ? there needs to be some political effort to raise the profile of germany internationally .
there have been attempts in recent years but they are not leading anywhere .
instead of all these fainthearted attempts to portray germany as new european country , there needs to be plain talk about redefining and feeling good about germany and the good things of its past . gerhard schröder or angela merkel ?
who is your personal choice for chancellor ?
why ? when it comes down to personality , schröder is very appealing .
he 's very professional .
but merkel 's public relations people seem to have put her in pretty good shape and she is looking more professional .
i guess as with any political malaise , the public has a pervading sense that it 's time for change and i 've also fallen prey to that .
i think the shadow cabinet merkel is trying to assemble sounds interesting .
her financial advisor is talking about a 25 percent tax rate - that sounds quite exciting .
her conservative stance might be welcomed by international investors .
she has a more critical stance towards russia , which is good , and a more appeasing stance towards the us , which i think is not so good . what do you like about germany ? i really like germany in the sense that it is extremely progressive .
i really appreciate its environmental stance , coming from australia , where we are so much like the us .
everybody seems to have an opinion here , people are quite engaged and that 's quite healthy . what do you dislike about germany ? i 'm sick of germans ' miserable attitudes towards themselves .
that 's really boring and annoying as well .
the rigidity , this selfishness , this short-sightedness - not wanting to invigorate the economy , where everybody should know full well that 's the only way to take on reforms .
there seems to be a lack of responsibility for the future of germany .
it comes down to a negative self-perception of themselves . interview conducted by mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de election 2005 click here for dw-world 's complete coverage of the upcoming elections .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de election 2005 -pipe- 19.08.2005 a postcard for your thoughts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oring gives germans the chance to be chancellor , if only for a minute in the weeks leading up to september 's election , american artist sheryl oring is bringing us-style grassroots democracy to the streets of germany , offering people the chance to give politicians a piece of their mind . as rush hour begins at berlin 's bustling schönhauser allee station , people push past each other , pressed to catch a connecting train .
in their midst , a young woman dressed like a secretary from a 1950 's film calmly types away on an equally old-fashioned typewriter while listening intently to the man seated opposite her .
a sign beside them reads " if i were chancellor … " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when the man finishes dictating his message to germany 's political leaders , the " secretary " hands him his postcard , complete with postage .
he twirls a wheel of rubber stamps , selects one that says " urgent , " and inks this in bright red across his card .
he then drops the card into a mailbox conveniently located just a few steps away , a look of satisfaction on his face . the scene - part political event , part art happening - causes passersby to slow their pace .
some just watch , while others get in line for a chance to have their say .
it 's all the brainchild of the woman in the red secretary 's costume , american artist and journalist sheryl oring . in the year leading up to the 2004 elections in the united states , oring travelled across her country with a similar project called " i wish to say , " typing over a thousand postcards for people who wanted to voice their concerns to president george w. bush . " the reaction in the states was so great that i thought of trying it in other countries , " says oring , who had previously worked and studied in germany and speaks fluent german . german grammar despite having a good grasp of the language , oring says she was slightly nervous about taking her " show " to germany . bildunterschrift : " i have to tell people to speak slowly because i 'm not a native speaker , and when i 'm done , i give them the chance to read it over and correct the grammar mistakes , " she laughs . but she added that being a foreigner has its advantages , as it makes people curious , and more likely to participate . " i did n't know how it would go over in germany , but people are really into doing it , " oring says .
" people have a lot of concerns about unemployment and social benefits , for example , and they 're really eager to talk about that .
here , people do n't feel the media or the politicians are listening to them , but this project gives them that .
in a way , it 's a service to people , and that 's something that 's been very gratifying . " thomas , a 42-year-old berliner , sat down with oring to tell her about his dissatisfaction with the current economic and social situation in germany .
on his postcard , he wrote to chancellor gerhard schröder of his concern that germany is moving too far in the direction of the us when it comes to labor policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wenn ich kanzler wäre … kunstaktion sheryl oring schreibmaschine " people are being forced into doing any old job , even if it is below their qualifications , just so that they 're back at work , " thomas said , adding that he appreciated oring 's project . " if you express your opinion as part of an art project , you know you wo n't have to face any repercussions , " he said .
" it 's a safe way to do it . " diverse responses while many of the postcards deal with election campaign issues such as unemployment , pensions , and education , other participants used their time at oring 's desk to air their pet peeves , or let their imaginations run wild . " i would charge a big fee for people who do n't clean up after their dogs , " wrote one disgruntled berliner . " i 'd like to be the king of berlin , " wrote another resident whose solution to the city 's problems would be to " open a big casino so everyone would be happy . " queuing up to talk with oring , eight-year-old gabriel excitedly outlined a list of laws he would pass if he were chancellor , including one that would " allow kids to play soccer everywhere . " bildunterschrift : kids get in on the act , too it 's the diversity of responses that keeps oring going .
she is bringing " if i were chancellor " to five german cities over a period of three weeks , and expects to type as many as 200 cards .
she keeps a copy of each card , and is hoping to turn them into an exhibition or a book . " i 'm always amazed at people 's answers , " she says .
" even though i 've done the show before , it never feels repetitive .
when i meet new people and hear a really moving story , that 's when i think it 's all worth it .

there are signs that the gap between them and church leaders is narrowing . as world youth day -lrb- wyd -rrb- enters its climactic phase with the arrival of pope benedict xvi on thursday , church critics are also stepping up their activities .
a number of reform organizations from around the world have been handing out flyers and staging events in the city of cologne in an attempt to reach the young people attending the catholic festival . united under the umbrella of the " world youth day 4 all coalition " -lrb- wyd4all -rrb- , they have set up their base for the duration of the gathering in a church in the city center . while there is hardly any room given to controversial issues in the official wyd program , young believers ' response to critical questions has been enormous , says aisha taylor , program director of the us-based women 's ordination conference . " the possibility for priests to get married , the rights of gays and lesbians , more democratic participation for lay people - all these are points on which we would like to see progress , " she said . women priests unsettle leaders a particular focus of taylor 's work concerns the role of women in the church .
according to official doctrine women can not be become priests . " when seven women were ordained priests in 2002 by a dissident bishop in austria , the vatican excommunicated the women within a week or so , " taylor , 24 , said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gisela forster , left , and christine mayr-lumetzberger are two of the seven women who were ordained as priests by argentine bishop romulo braschi in 2002 in defiance of the ban of catholic church on female clergy .
at the time , it was cardinal joseph ratzinger , then head of the congregation for the doctrine of the faith and now pope benedict xvi , who lead the charge against them . yet , judging from responses from the people thronging the streets of cologne , equal rights for women in the church consistently rank among the top demands , reports taylor , who sees the demonstrative ordination of women also as a way to elicit a direct response from the vatican . " the pope is getting annoyed and knows who we are , " she said .
" but we have to use these alternative paths to make our opinions known , because the church is not a democracy and its members have no vote . " even if benedict xvi refuses to recognize women priests , in the future another pope could make a cut with the past , she says .
and the ongoing effort by reformers is having an impact , she adds : " we now have female altar service and women who work as eucharistic ministers .
and in a letter the pope , then a cardinal , made a point of the equality of men and women in public life - except in the church context .

" young people feel it is their church and sincerely want the pope to understand what their concerns are . ” the critics make a strong point that they are part of the church and do consider themselves firmly rooted in the faith .

" the pope is getting annoyed and knows who we are , " she said .
" but we have to use these alternative paths to make our opinions known , because the church is not a democracy and its members have no vote . " even if benedict xvi refuses to recognize women priests , in the future another pope could make a cut with the past , she says .
and the ongoing effort by reformers is having an impact , she adds : " we now have female altar service and women who work as eucharistic ministers .
and in a letter the pope , then a cardinal , made a point of the equality of men and women in public life - except in the church context . " latin american concerns in other regions of the world , such as latin america , where a large majority of the population is catholic , there is not necessarily a less critical view than in europe or north america . " the church has a lot of spiritual and political power in our part of the world , " said 25-year-old andrea ramirez from bolivia who heads the youth chapter of the " we are church " reform movement in her home country .
" but there is also strong support for the gay movement or the feminists . " " we want to show that you can be a good catholic and be gay or lesbian .
or that you can be a good catholic and use condoms , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church still has enormous influence in latin america the ongoing refusal by the vatican to soften its stance on family planning or the use of condoms is particularly detrimental to poor countries , says ramirez . " but maybe the pope has n't had enough time , yet , to properly get in touch with the very real problems of the nations of the south . " the refusal by conservative church leaders to engage in debate sometimes takes forms that amount to keeping information away from young believers , critics say . “ we have seen how nuns accompanying a group of young catholics took away from them the flyers we had just handed out to them , ” reports agnes rudnik , a spokeswoman for the gay and lesbian groups at wyd . cheer the pope , follow your conscience - no problem so is it a contradiction that young people attending wyd are welcoming the pope with overwhelming enthusiasm , yet feel strongly about a number contentious issues on which they are opposed to the pontiff , as reformers claim ? " i don ’ t think there is a contradiction when people cheer the pope and follow their conscience at the same time , ” says tobias raschke , the german spokesman for " we are church . ”
" young people feel it is their church and sincerely want the pope to understand what their concerns are . ” the critics make a strong point that they are part of the church and do consider themselves firmly rooted in the faith . " i really hope our work gives a new impetus for change to the pope , because he ’ s my religious leader after all , ” says ramirez . “ i love my faith and the catholic church , it ’ s my heritage , my tradition " , says aisha taylor . signs of change while wyd is an event that appeals to the masses , many young reformers agree that behind it there is a genuine attempt to reach out to the younger generation .
the efforts and successes of the church in tackling social problems , injustice and poverty around the world is something that draws particularly strong support from young people . one of the few events wyd organizers put on to engage young people in an open debate focused on precisely these themes called " youthhearing . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal oscar rodriguez archbishop of tegucicalpa -lrb- honduras -rrb- held at a community center in cologne on wednesday afternoon , there was rapturous applause from the floor when critics brought up the ban on condom use , which in their view undermines the fight against hiv / aids in poor countries . in their response , german bishop reinhard marx and cardinal oscar rodriguez from honduras stopped just short of actively endorsing condoms , but acknowledged that they can play an important role . a revolution ?

in their midst , a young woman dressed like a secretary from a 1950 's film calmly types away on an equally old-fashioned typewriter while listening intently to the man seated opposite her .
a sign beside them reads " if i were chancellor … " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when the man finishes dictating his message to germany 's political leaders , the " secretary " hands him his postcard , complete with postage .
he twirls a wheel of rubber stamps , selects one that says " urgent , " and inks this in bright red across his card .
he then drops the card into a mailbox conveniently located just a few steps away , a look of satisfaction on his face . the scene - part political event , part art happening - causes passersby to slow their pace .
some just watch , while others get in line for a chance to have their say .
it 's all the brainchild of the woman in the red secretary 's costume , american artist and journalist sheryl oring . in the year leading up to the 2004 elections in the united states , oring travelled across her country with a similar project called " i wish to say , " typing over a thousand postcards for people who wanted to voice their concerns to president george w. bush . " the reaction in the states was so great that i thought of trying it in other countries , " says oring , who had previously worked and studied in germany and speaks fluent german . german grammar despite having a good grasp of the language , oring says she was slightly nervous about taking her " show " to germany . bildunterschrift : " i have to tell people to speak slowly because i 'm not a native speaker , and when i 'm done , i give them the chance to read it over and correct the grammar mistakes , " she laughs . but she added that being a foreigner has its advantages , as it makes people curious , and more likely to participate . " i did n't know how it would go over in germany , but people are really into doing it , " oring says .
" people have a lot of concerns about unemployment and social benefits , for example , and they 're really eager to talk about that .
here , people do n't feel the media or the politicians are listening to them , but this project gives them that .
in a way , it 's a service to people , and that 's something that 's been very gratifying . " thomas , a 42-year-old berliner , sat down with oring to tell her about his dissatisfaction with the current economic and social situation in germany .
on his postcard , he wrote to chancellor gerhard schröder of his concern that germany is moving too far in the direction of the us when it comes to labor policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wenn ich kanzler wäre … kunstaktion sheryl oring schreibmaschine " people are being forced into doing any old job , even if it is below their qualifications , just so that they 're back at work , " thomas said , adding that he appreciated oring 's project . " if you express your opinion as part of an art project , you know you wo n't have to face any repercussions , " he said .
" it 's a safe way to do it . " diverse responses while many of the postcards deal with election campaign issues such as unemployment , pensions , and education , other participants used their time at oring 's desk to air their pet peeves , or let their imaginations run wild . " i would charge a big fee for people who do n't clean up after their dogs , " wrote one disgruntled berliner . " i 'd like to be the king of berlin , " wrote another resident whose solution to the city 's problems would be to " open a big casino so everyone would be happy . " queuing up to talk with oring , eight-year-old gabriel excitedly outlined a list of laws he would pass if he were chancellor , including one that would " allow kids to play soccer everywhere . " bildunterschrift : kids get in on the act , too it 's the diversity of responses that keeps oring going .
she is bringing " if i were chancellor " to five german cities over a period of three weeks , and expects to type as many as 200 cards .
she keeps a copy of each card , and is hoping to turn them into an exhibition or a book . " i 'm always amazed at people 's answers , " she says .
" even though i 've done the show before , it never feels repetitive .

"
everyone knows what to do when a diaper starts to stink but what do you do when one starts to tick ?
call the police and run for the hills .
that 's what postal workers in a german city did . most parents will already consider a fully fed yet strangely uncomfortable looking baby as volatile an object as a container of nitroglycerin .
the slightest of movements and the whole thing could blow .
the aftermath of such an explosion can leave everyone involved covered in a nasty biological agent of some kind or another . but there usually has to be an infant involved for a fully blown diaper emergency to take place .
not so in the german city of heilbronn , however . without a baby 's bottom in sight , the southwestern city was thrown into chaos on thursday after what police later described as an " electronic nappy " caused a major bomb scare in the local post office . workers at the heilbronn branch of deutsche post went running for cover when a parcel started ticking suspiciously in the package department . police called as post office fears bomb attack fearing a bomb attack , the police were called and two squad cars sped to the scene where the officers immediately contacted the sender .
the police gave the all-clear after they contacted the woman who told them the intercepted package contained only a malfunctioning diaper . but why was it ticking ?
apparently , the hi-tech nappy was of a kind that reacts to wetness and which alerts the nearest parent to the fact that nature has run its course .

"
everyone knows what to do when a diaper starts to stink but what do you do when one starts to tick ?
call the police and run for the hills .
that 's what postal workers in a german city did . most parents will already consider a fully fed yet strangely uncomfortable looking baby as volatile an object as a container of nitroglycerin .
the slightest of movements and the whole thing could blow .
the aftermath of such an explosion can leave everyone involved covered in a nasty biological agent of some kind or another . but there usually has to be an infant involved for a fully blown diaper emergency to take place .
not so in the german city of heilbronn , however . without a baby 's bottom in sight , the southwestern city was thrown into chaos on thursday after what police later described as an " electronic nappy " caused a major bomb scare in the local post office . workers at the heilbronn branch of deutsche post went running for cover when a parcel started ticking suspiciously in the package department . police called as post office fears bomb attack fearing a bomb attack , the police were called and two squad cars sped to the scene where the officers immediately contacted the sender .
the police gave the all-clear after they contacted the woman who told them the intercepted package contained only a malfunctioning diaper . but why was it ticking ?
apparently , the hi-tech nappy was of a kind that reacts to wetness and which alerts the nearest parent to the fact that nature has run its course .
but instead of the usual signal , this diaper had begun to omit a more ominous sound . wetness sensor ticked not bleeped " -lrb- the postal workers -rrb- suspected it was a bomb so they put the package into an empty room and called the police , " said a police spokesman .
" it was supposed to respond to wetness with bleeping sounds but this one ticked .

dw-world talked to her about germany in light of the upcoming election . born in atlanta , georgia , neiman studied philosophy at harvard university and berlin 's free university .

from the outside , it looks like one of the most dynamic places in europe .
berlin is an international magnet .
under this government , the country has flourished more than people have realized .
it 's broken , decisively , with the stigma under which germany was standing for half a century .
not even economically it is as bad as people think it is .
people complain about certain kinds of cuts in social services and economic problems , but the country is fundamentally sound in comparison with other places .
you can have 9 percent economic growth , as china is experiencing , if you drop any concern for human beings and the environment .
what n eeds to happe n i n germa n y to help speed up the cou n try 's recovery ? i think it 's clear that all the industrialized nations still need to come up with concepts about unemployment in view of globalization .
i do n't think any of us have fully grasped what globalization means .
but i think that again , what 's remarkable is that germans think much worse about themselves than anyone else .
i think both the extreme left and members of some of the right have tried to benefit by painting a picture that things are terrible .
they reflect , however , the mood of the people .
you have a sort of mirroring effect .
if people would stop being so pessimistic , a great deal would be accomplished .
east and west germans tend to expect the state to take care of everything .
i think there is an expectation that the state should provide more than people expect in other countries .
there is a sense that if anything goes wrong , one blames it on the government . schröder or merkel ?
who is your perso n al choice for cha n cellor ?
why ? i 'm generally happy with the way the current red-green government has proceeded .
on the whole , they have done a good job and should continue to do so .
i 'm impressed by the ways in which , under the current government , germany has taken large steps towards becoming a more cosmopolitan and less racist country . i am particularly impressed by the difference in their attititudes to the iraq war , during which schröder was willing to take a stand , while merkel assured the bush administration that the cdu would follow american policy , whatever it was .
schröder was sharply criticized for his position - not least in germany , where most people called him opportunistic - but he turned out to be right .
america needs friends who are critical , not who blindly follow whatever very controversial policies happen to be the order of the day .
both schröder and merkel will have to continue painful economic reforms , and there the differences will be small ; the significant differences between them concern foreign policy . what do you like about germa n y ? i like the growing cosmopolitanism , an interest in what people do and think all over the world .
that 's much stronger than in france , england , and the us .
i like the sense of historical interest , i like the interest in preserving good parts of the past and the interest in dealing with bad parts of it .

" i was extremely impressed by what he said and how he said it .
he condemned the crimes of the nazis without any ifs and buts , " spiegel told germany 's ard television . during only the second visit to a synagogue by a pope in the modern history of the catholic church , the pope described the extermination of six million jews by the nazis as an " unimaginable crime . " spiegel , the president of the central council of jews in germany , said at a news conference later that he welcomed the pope 's call for jews and christians to work more closely together to overcome their sometimes fractious relationship . he added he was " particularly impressed that he said the roots of christianity lie in judaism . " benedict xvi , who served briefly in the hitler youth during the war when membership of the nazi organization was compulsory , paused to pray at a memorial to the six million jews killed in the holocaust as he began the landmark visit . speaking in the synagogue which was destroyed in the anti-jewish kristallnacht attacks in 1938 and rebuilt in 1959 , he called the holocaust " this unspeakable and previously unimaginable crime . " pope warns of new threats bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " in the 20th century , in the darkest period of german and european history , an insane racist ideology , born of neo-paganism , gave rise to the attempt , planned and systematically carried out by the regime , to exterminate european jewry , " he said . the pope warned that new threats of racism and anti-semitism were always lurking .
" it is a particularly important task , since today , sadly , we are witnessing the rise of new signs of anti-semitism and various forms of a general hostility towards foreigners , " he said . " how can we fail to see in this a reason for concern and vigilance ?
the catholic church is committed - i reaffirm this again today - to tolerance , respect , friendship and peace between all peoples , cultures and religions , " he said . in his speech to jewish leaders , benedict also referred to john paul ii , saying that " in considering the jewish roots of christianity , my venerable predecessor , quoting a statement by the german bishops , affirmed that ' whoever meets jesus christ meets judaism ' . " jewish leader calls on holocaust files to be opened during the pope 's visit , a leader of germany 's jewish community called on the pope to fully open the vatican 's archives on the holocaust . in a speech welcoming the 78-year-old german-born pope , abraham lehrer called on the pope to " fully open " the archives , reminding him that as the former head of the vatican congregation for the doctrine of the faith , he had helped release some of the documents they contained for public scrutiny in 1998 . lehrer said he would welcome such a move as a " further sign " of the vatican 's goodwill towards the jewish community and allow both sides to continue " peaceful and critical " examination of the history of their troubled relations . " as leader of the catholic church , you have a special responsibility .
your actions serve as a model for the church , " lehrer told the pope . the archives contain diplomatic correspondence and church documents which could throw light on the degree of vatican knowledge of nazi efforts to deport and exterminate europe 's jews . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope pius xii jewish groups have strongly opposed plans set in motion by benedict 's predecessor john paul ii to elevate wartime pope pius xii -lrb- photo -rrb- to sainthood , claiming he did little or nothing to prevent jews being deported . lehrer praised benedict xvi , who succeeded john paul ii in april , as a " builder of bridges between religions , " adding that his visit was " an extraordinary event of great political and religious significance . " the head of the german bishops ' conference , cardinal karl lehmann , acknowledged at a news conference later that part of the archives was already open " but we must continue to work to open the archives of the pius xii period .

pope benedict xvi on friday became the second pope to visit a synagogue , stopping to pray and remember holocaust victims with cologne 's jewish community .
earlier in the day the pope met with german president horst köhler , adding a political touch to a day dominated by the highly symbolic visit to the synagogue and talks with protestants . after his jubilant reception thursday , when around 400,000 young catholics welcomed him back to his native country , benedict 's agenda on the second day of his visit began with closed-door talks at the presidential villa in nearby bonn before moving on to the religious meetings in cologne . benedict waved to a small crowd outside the villa hammerschmidt , the presidential residence in the former german capital , and shook hands with children after the meeting . " this world youth day shows that catholics are not a minority but come from all around the world , " köhler told journalists before the pope arrived .
" it is good and it will do good for protestants as well , " said köhler , a protestant . about half of the christians in germany , home of martin luther 's reformation , are protestant . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german pope visits synagogue while in cologne for world youth day , pope benedict xvi makes history as the second catholic leader to visit a jewish place of worship .

11 terror attacks in the united states , was convicted by a german court on friday and sentenced to seven years in prison . mounir el motassadeq , the man suspected of helping the sept .
11 hijackers while the cell was preparing the attacks in hamburg , was convicted of being a member of a terrorist organization and sentenced to seven years in prison by a german court on friday . presiding judge ernst-rainer schudt announced the verdict of the moroccan 's year-long retrial hearing without stating the court 's reasons for the decision . support of hamburg cell leads to conviction el motassadeq was convicted on terror-related charges after the prosecution accused him of helping pay tuition and other bills for members of the hamburg cell to allow them to live as students while they plotted the attacks . prosecutors had demanded the maximum sentence of 15 years in prison for el motassadeq , but defense lawyers sought acquittal for the moroccan , who acknowledges he was close to the hijackers but insists he knew nothing of their plans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plumes of smoke pour from the world trade center buildings in new york tuesday , sept .
11 , 2001 .
el motassadeq , who looked on calmly as schudt announced the verdict , was the first man to go on trial over the terrorist attacks in new york and washington that killed more than 3,000 people .
he was found guilty and sentenced the maximum 15 years in prison in february 2003 .
but a german federal tribunal overturned the verdict last year and sent the case back to the court in the northern port city of hamburg , where three of the 19 suicide hijackers lived and studied .
attorney ladislav anisic said there was no evidence that directly linked his client to the plot and argued that motassadeq was being tried simply on guilt by association , which he said was unacceptable under the rule of law in a democracy like germany 's .
" let us not let osama bin laden win here at home by sacrificing our legal foundations , " he argued before the court .
anisic has said he will appeal any verdict other than an acquittal .
us not cooperating german observers say the prosecution 's case had been weakened by the failure of the united states to hand over more information on two top al qaeda operatives in its custody .
the federal court overturned the verdict on the grounds that the hamburg judges had not been able to hear potentially exculpatory testimony from the self-purported mastermind behind the attacks , ramzi binalshibh , and al qaeda 's suspected number three , khalid sheikh mohammed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdelghani mzoudi , left , was freed .
many think motassadeq will also be acquitted .
the us justice department provided two sets of summaries of their interrogation in which the two men reportedly said that motassadeq and fellow moroccan abdelghani mzoudi had had no involvement in the plot .
the prosecution has argued that the accounts are not credible given al qaeda training methods in counterintelligence .
but the reports and the holes in the case were enough to see mzoudi acquitted in hamburg on the same charges motassadeq is again facing .
after his release , mzoudi returned to morocco in june under threat of deportation .
perhaps in the hopes of a similar outcome to his trial , motassadeq has extended his moroccan passport and said he wished to go home as soon as possible .
after 65 hearings and 112 witnesses during the retrial alone , which began one year ago , a not guilty verdict would have been a humiliating blow to federal prosecutors . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb / nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de 9/11 suspect trial resumes after delay a moroccan student being retried over involvement in the september 11 , 2001 attacks in new york and washington , provided " active support " to the suicide pilots , the federal prosecutor told a german court on monday .

pope benedict 's visit will add another chapter to the tale of highs and lows , religion , tragedy and rebirth . when the jews first came to cologne in the wake of the roman legions , they were taken by the lush green and fertile land of the rhine valley .
so much so , that they decided to stay and found what is now the oldest jewish community north of the alps .
the first official mention of the community is in a decree from king constantine in 321 ad , granting them membership in the city council .
although cologne is now known for it ’ s cathedral and catholic traditions , back then it was considered the jerusalem of the north . the city 's jewish community struggled on through the centuries as empires , from the romans to the huns , the franks to the ottonians and the germans rose and fell around them .
although the community often played an active role in helping to shape the empires , it was not free from the persecution , pogroms and plagues which characterized the times . short-lived religious freedom discrimination under the rule of emperors , kings and bishops was rife , and it was only when french revolutionary troops occupied the city in 1792 that cologne 's jews received civil rights and religious freedom .
but that freedom did n't last . the nazis ended nearly two millennia of jewish life in cologne .
although some were lucky enough to escape in time , some 11,000 of the city 's jews were deported and murdered at the hands of the hitler regime . rebuilding the community bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city of cologne sometimes the city invites jews who fled the nazis , to come and visit the place where they used to live .
otto spier , who now lives in israel , recently returned to cologne for the first time in more than 60 years . " the view of cologne floats before my eyes again .
what ’ s surprising is that you still have a relationship to your city of birth and that despite everything that ’ s happened , there ’ s still a bond to the things that formed you in your youth , " he said . today , the immigration of jews from the former soviet union means that cologne is once again home to one of germany ’ s largest jewish communities . kirsten serup-bilfeldt -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german pope promises dialogue with jews as pope benedict xvi continued to settle into his role as the new leader of the catholic church , he vowed to promote dialogue with jews as part of an emphasis on interfaith issues .

" i thank all of you for our presence in cologne at this great gathering , in the hope that it will mark a step forward on the path towards reconciliation and unity , " said the german-born pope , formerly cardinal joseph ratzinger . by using his visit here to meet with the leaders of jewish and muslim communities , benedict has underscored a pledge made in his first speeches after his election in april that he would use his pontificate to work for christian unity and to build bridges with the other monotheistic religions . benedict 's symbolic visit to cologne 's synagogue at midday on friday will be only the second in modern history , following that of his predecessor john paul ii to rome 's synagogue 19 years ago .

" i thank all of you for our presence in cologne at this great gathering , in the hope that it will mark a step forward on the path towards reconciliation and unity , " said the german-born pope , formerly cardinal joseph ratzinger . by using his visit here to meet with the leaders of jewish and muslim communities , benedict has underscored a pledge made in his first speeches after his election in april that he would use his pontificate to work for christian unity and to build bridges with the other monotheistic religions . benedict 's symbolic visit to cologne 's synagogue at midday on friday will be only the second in modern history , following that of his predecessor john paul ii to rome 's synagogue 19 years ago . " while john paul ii expressed himself through gestures , pope ratzinger gives great space to words .
this pontificate will be a pontificate of concepts and of words , " vatican spokesman joaquin navarro-valls told journalists thursday in a rare public comparison of papal styles . benedict looking to build a youth following seeking to build the same kind of rapport with young people enjoyed by his charismatic predecessor , pope benedict said he would use his trip to " confirm their faith and enliven their hope " .

11 hijackers while the cell was preparing the attacks in hamburg , was convicted of being a member of a terrorist organization and sentenced to seven years in prison by a german court on friday . presiding judge ernst-rainer schudt announced the verdict of the moroccan 's year-long retrial hearing without stating the court 's reasons for the decision . support of hamburg cell leads to conviction el motassadeq was convicted on terror-related charges after the prosecution accused him of helping pay tuition and other bills for members of the hamburg cell to allow them to live as students while they plotted the attacks . prosecutors had demanded the maximum sentence of 15 years in prison for el motassadeq , but defense lawyers sought acquittal for the moroccan , who acknowledges he was close to the hijackers but insists he knew nothing of their plans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plumes of smoke pour from the world trade center buildings in new york tuesday , sept .

el motassadeq , who looked on calmly as schudt announced the verdict , was the first man to go on trial over the terrorist attacks in new york and washington that killed more than 3,000 people .
he was found guilty and sentenced the maximum 15 years in prison in february 2003 .
but a german federal tribunal overturned the verdict last year and sent the case back to the court in the northern port city of hamburg , where three of the 19 suicide hijackers lived and studied .
attorney ladislav anisic said there was no evidence that directly linked his client to the plot and argued that motassadeq was being tried simply on guilt by association , which he said was unacceptable under the rule of law in a democracy like germany 's .
" let us not let osama bin laden win here at home by sacrificing our legal foundations , " he argued before the court .
anisic has said he will appeal any verdict other than an acquittal .
us not cooperating german observers say the prosecution 's case had been weakened by the failure of the united states to hand over more information on two top al qaeda operatives in its custody .
the federal court overturned the verdict on the grounds that the hamburg judges had not been able to hear potentially exculpatory testimony from the self-purported mastermind behind the attacks , ramzi binalshibh , and al qaeda 's suspected number three , khalid sheikh mohammed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdelghani mzoudi , left , was freed .

the us justice department provided two sets of summaries of their interrogation in which the two men reportedly said that motassadeq and fellow moroccan abdelghani mzoudi had had no involvement in the plot .
the prosecution has argued that the accounts are not credible given al qaeda training methods in counterintelligence .
but the reports and the holes in the case were enough to see mzoudi acquitted in hamburg on the same charges motassadeq is again facing .
after his release , mzoudi returned to morocco in june under threat of deportation .
perhaps in the hopes of a similar outcome to his trial , motassadeq has extended his moroccan passport and said he wished to go home as soon as possible .

but experts say an outbreak in europe is only a question of time . to counter the possible spread of the bird flu virus in germany , the federal government in berlin has agreed on mandatory action to keep poultry under shelter .
the protective measure is expected to be in place by mid-september at the latest , if by then the virus has spread west of russia 's ural mountains , a high-ranking official from the ministry of consumer protection said on thursday .
the decision is the result of an summit of experts convened by the ministry .
the government is also considering intensifying airport controls of people arriving from russia to identify and isolate passengers who have contracted the disease .
the dutch agriculture ministry has already ordered all commercial poultry farmers to bring their fowl indoors by monday to prevent them from catching avian flu from wild birds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german minister for consumer protection renate künast the german consumer protection minister renate künast said on thursday she was worried about the outbreak of a deadly strain of bird flu in russia , fearing that the disease could reach western europe through migrating birds .
" we are expecting the worst , " she said .
there was a likely chance the disease could spread during the upcoming bird migration period , the minister added .
bird flu in europe only question of time world health organization experts say the bird flu virus is now endemic in parts of asia despite the slaughter of tens of millions of domestic fowl , which are able to pass the virus on to humans .
it has now been confirmed that the deadly bird flu virus - the h5n1 strain of the influenza virus - has reached russia .
it has already killed almost 60 people since sweeping through asia since 2003 .
last week the european union already banned the import of live birds and feathers from russia and kazakhstan .
but german disease watchdogs say that an outbreak of bird flu is only a matter of time .
" all experts agree that the possibility of an outbreak is larger than ever before in the past 50 years , " said reinhard kurth , director of the robert-koch-institute in berlin .
" they say - and i fully agree - that this is going to happen , but whether this year already or in the next three years remains unclear . "
virus more likely to mutate into deadly form health experts fear that the longer the virus survives , the more likely it is to mutate into a form which can pass easily between humans .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vaccination in vietnam " we are concerned that the virus infects a human that already has contracted a strain of normal influenza and this influenza will mix with this avian form , " said dick thompson , a spokesman for the world health organization .
" as a result , a new strain could be formed that the human immune system has never seen before and that would ignite a pandemic . "
on friday german disease-control experts were set to propose detailed plans to prevent an outbreak of bird flu among local bird populations and come up with ways to protect the german population .

his predecessor john paul ii visited the rome synagogue in 1986 . since taking over as the head of the catholic church , the new pope has made clear his intention to maintain a dialogue with jewish leaders such as was nurtured by pope john paul ii .
the late pontiff was much admired in israel for his efforts to promote reconciliation between the vatican and the jewish people . pope benedict xvi has remained true to his word .
his visit to the synagogue in cologne , which is home to the oldest jewish community in germany , is widely viewed as a deeply symbolic gesture , which underlines his determination to foster reconciliation between different faiths at a time of stresses and strains on all sides . bildunterschrift : warm welcome for the pope 's homecoming upon his arrival in germany for world youth day celebrations , the new pope spoke of the importance of planned meetings with jews and muslims . later he said he hoped the presence in cologne of representatives of different christian denominations and those from different religions would " mark a step forward on the path towards reconciliation and unity .

the positive review in " the economist " has everyone surprised - except for the chancellor . great britain 's and maybe the world 's most prominent business magazine is not known for its love affair with germany 's economic system .
the decidedly pro-business economist has in recent years enjoyed ribbing europe 's largest economy for its stagnant growth rates , high unemployment and a union strength that has led to sky-high labor costs .
all the more surprising , then , that when the german symbol , the black eagle , graced the front of this week 's magazine as a caricature , it was flexing its muscles underneath the headline " germany 's surprising economy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : really ? " some forecasters are now predicting that germany , which has for so many years disappointed on the downside , could be about to surprise on the upside , " the magazine wrote in the lead editorial . weakened unions a good thing as reasons for this the economist listed , above all , the turnaround accomplished by the country 's major corporations .
the newfound flexibility of germany 's usually stubborn unions has helped lower labor costs immensely and made the country more competitive than italy , the netherlands , great britain and france .
" that is a big reason why , last year , it regained its position as the world 's biggest exporter , " it wrote . the magazine gave credit to chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition government of social democrats and the green party for getting reforms underway .
his raft of labor and socio-economic reforms , called agenda 2010 , may lose him the election this september , but they have nonetheless " raised hopes that fresh impetus could set the economy on to its strongest track for years . " tough measures , like the unpopular hartz iv law that made it more difficult for germany 's 1.8 million long-term unemployed to receive benefits without actively looking for jobs , won the magazine 's approval .
" hartz iv ... has added 8 billion euros -lrb- $ 9.8 billion -rrb- to this year 's government costs , but failed to create many new jobs , " the magazine wrote .
" it has , however , made employees more fearful of the consequences of losing their jobs .
that has strengthened the hand of firms ... and weakened the power of trade unions . " bildunterschrift : germany 's unions are getting weak , and that 's a good thing , according to " the economist " chancellor : proof we 're doing things right the report raised eyebrows in germany , getting press coverage not only from business magazines , but local papers as well .
germany 's prominent frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper followed up on the economist cover with a piece examining the euphoria .
" nobody wants to believe it : germany is gaining more prominence abroad as an investment destination , " it wrote . nobody , that is , except for the chancellor .
at one point during an hour-long interview on german public television yesterday evening , schröder fished a piece of paper out of his pocket .
it was the economist 's piece . " the economist , a publication that in the past was never particularly pro-german , has a cover story ' economist cheers germany 's surprising economy ' and says that thanks to the reforms we introduced our competitiveness has grown enormously , " he said . economist : merkel needs a chance but schröder neglected to mention one thing .
though it gave schröder 's government a small amount of praise for getting the reform process started , the economist editorialists clearly hope his opponents will be the ones continuing them after the likely elections on sept .

" the commitment of the new government to further reforms will make a big difference , " they wrote .
" the politicians may not be able to control the economy , but they can certainly muck it up .

" this morning the quota for category seven , blouses , was filled .
member states custom authorities will no longer issue import licenses for this product , " spokesman rupert krietemeyer told afp , reading a statement .
according to the eu imports database , data shows that 100 percent of a 2005 quota of nearly 24.8 million chinese blouses had been cleared for entry into the eu as of thursday evening . the commission spokesperson had further bad news for retailers : " it is likely that a number of other quotas will also be filled in the very near future , " he added .
specifically , quotas for bras , t-shirts and flax yarn were close to being met . the quotas for men 's trousers and pullovers were also already reached earlier this month , leaving millions of garments stranded at eu customs and outraging some big eu retailers awaiting deliveries . eu , china still locked in quota talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu and chinese officials have been holding talks on the quotas and brussels has said it is willing to be flexible .
eu trade commissioner peter mandelson -lrb- photo -rrb- has made it clear that he wants to negotiate with china to allow more clothing imports into the bloc , possibly by using some of 2006 quotas in 2005 . after eu textile producers urged that the quotas be implemented , eu officials are coming under fierce pressure from retailers who warn that store shelves could be bare during the key back-to-school period because they have not received some shipments . on thursday , government ministers from the netherlands , denmark , sweden and finland wrote an article in the financial times saying there was a risk of job losses and bankruptcies unless the eu eases the curbs on the imports .
this followed a letter sent to mandelson by germany 's economy minister wolfgang clement which called for a relaxation of the import restrictions . textile producers fear massive influx from china not all eu countries want the import restrictions to be relaxed .
countries with big textile industries of their own , like france , italy and spain , are worried they will suffer if chinese clothing enters the eu on a massive scale . the eu and china agreed to a broad textile trade agreement in june setting annual restrictions on 10 categories of chinese imports , which had been surging since the beginning of the year following the end of an international quota system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu trade commissioner peter mandelson , left , and his chinese counterpart bo xilai , right , toast during a signing ceremony early saturday june 11 , 2005 in shanghai , china .
the european union said friday it had reached a deal to resolve a dispute with china over a surge of chinese textile imports .
after protracted negotiations between chinese commerce minister bo xilai and mandelson in shanghai in june , china said that it would limit growth in exports of 10 textile and clothing products to the eu from between 8 to 12.5 percent a year in a bid to defuse the trade row . agreement in june rubber-stamped growth rate " china and the european union have agreed that , in the period from june 11 , 2005 to the end of 2007 , with an agreed base quantity , we will determine china 's amount of exports to europe by a growth rate of between 8 to 12.5 percent per year , " the ministry of commerce said in a statement on its web site after the end of negotiations . the eu response was to issue a statement that said that in 2008 , the eu will only apply " with restraint " paragraph 242 of china 's world trade organization accession protocol on textiles , which requires china to limit exports of textile products .
there was no further explanation . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu , china settle textiles row china said saturday it will limit growth in exports of 10 textile and clothing products to the european union to 8 to 12.5 percent a year in a bid to defuse a trade row straining ties between them .

schröder was sharply criticized for his position - not least in germany , where most people called him opportunistic - but he turned out to be right .
america needs friends who are critical , not who blindly follow whatever very controversial policies happen to be the order of the day .
both schröder and merkel will have to continue painful economic reforms , and there the differences will be small ; the significant differences between them concern foreign policy . what do you like about germa n y ? i like the growing cosmopolitanism , an interest in what people do and think all over the world .

but experts say an outbreak in europe is only a question of time . to counter the possible spread of the bird flu virus in germany , the federal government in berlin has agreed on mandatory action to keep poultry under shelter .
the protective measure is expected to be in place by mid-september at the latest , if by then the virus has spread west of russia 's ural mountains , a high-ranking official from the ministry of consumer protection said on thursday .
the decision is the result of an summit of experts convened by the ministry .
the government is also considering intensifying airport controls of people arriving from russia to identify and isolate passengers who have contracted the disease .
the dutch agriculture ministry has already ordered all commercial poultry farmers to bring their fowl indoors by monday to prevent them from catching avian flu from wild birds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german minister for consumer protection renate künast the german consumer protection minister renate künast said on thursday she was worried about the outbreak of a deadly strain of bird flu in russia , fearing that the disease could reach western europe through migrating birds .
" we are expecting the worst , " she said .
there was a likely chance the disease could spread during the upcoming bird migration period , the minister added .
bird flu in europe only question of time world health organization experts say the bird flu virus is now endemic in parts of asia despite the slaughter of tens of millions of domestic fowl , which are able to pass the virus on to humans .
it has now been confirmed that the deadly bird flu virus - the h5n1 strain of the influenza virus - has reached russia .
it has already killed almost 60 people since sweeping through asia since 2003 .
last week the european union already banned the import of live birds and feathers from russia and kazakhstan .
but german disease watchdogs say that an outbreak of bird flu is only a matter of time .
" all experts agree that the possibility of an outbreak is larger than ever before in the past 50 years , " said reinhard kurth , director of the robert-koch-institute in berlin .
" they say - and i fully agree - that this is going to happen , but whether this year already or in the next three years remains unclear . "
virus more likely to mutate into deadly form health experts fear that the longer the virus survives , the more likely it is to mutate into a form which can pass easily between humans .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vaccination in vietnam " we are concerned that the virus infects a human that already has contracted a strain of normal influenza and this influenza will mix with this avian form , " said dick thompson , a spokesman for the world health organization .
" as a result , a new strain could be formed that the human immune system has never seen before and that would ignite a pandemic . "
on friday german disease-control experts were set to propose detailed plans to prevent an outbreak of bird flu among local bird populations and come up with ways to protect the german population .
on thursday they had criticized authorities for being unprepared to meet a possibly major health crisis .
eu countries are expected to meet next week to discuss ways of better coordinating their strategies for dealing with the illness . uwe hessler -lrb- rri -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de what is bird flu ?
primarily affecting birds , the avian influenza virus can infect humans in close contact with affected animals .

but experts say an outbreak in europe is only a question of time . to counter the possible spread of the bird flu virus in germany , the federal government in berlin has agreed on mandatory action to keep poultry under shelter .
the protective measure is expected to be in place by mid-september at the latest , if by then the virus has spread west of russia 's ural mountains , a high-ranking official from the ministry of consumer protection said on thursday .
the decision is the result of an summit of experts convened by the ministry .
the government is also considering intensifying airport controls of people arriving from russia to identify and isolate passengers who have contracted the disease .
the dutch agriculture ministry has already ordered all commercial poultry farmers to bring their fowl indoors by monday to prevent them from catching avian flu from wild birds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german minister for consumer protection renate künast the german consumer protection minister renate künast said on thursday she was worried about the outbreak of a deadly strain of bird flu in russia , fearing that the disease could reach western europe through migrating birds .
" we are expecting the worst , " she said .
there was a likely chance the disease could spread during the upcoming bird migration period , the minister added .
bird flu in europe only question of time world health organization experts say the bird flu virus is now endemic in parts of asia despite the slaughter of tens of millions of domestic fowl , which are able to pass the virus on to humans .
it has now been confirmed that the deadly bird flu virus - the h5n1 strain of the influenza virus - has reached russia .
it has already killed almost 60 people since sweeping through asia since 2003 .
last week the european union already banned the import of live birds and feathers from russia and kazakhstan .
but german disease watchdogs say that an outbreak of bird flu is only a matter of time .
" all experts agree that the possibility of an outbreak is larger than ever before in the past 50 years , " said reinhard kurth , director of the robert-koch-institute in berlin .
" they say - and i fully agree - that this is going to happen , but whether this year already or in the next three years remains unclear . "
virus more likely to mutate into deadly form health experts fear that the longer the virus survives , the more likely it is to mutate into a form which can pass easily between humans .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vaccination in vietnam " we are concerned that the virus infects a human that already has contracted a strain of normal influenza and this influenza will mix with this avian form , " said dick thompson , a spokesman for the world health organization .
" as a result , a new strain could be formed that the human immune system has never seen before and that would ignite a pandemic . "
on friday german disease-control experts were set to propose detailed plans to prevent an outbreak of bird flu among local bird populations and come up with ways to protect the german population .
on thursday they had criticized authorities for being unprepared to meet a possibly major health crisis .
eu countries are expected to meet next week to discuss ways of better coordinating their strategies for dealing with the illness . uwe hessler -lrb- rri -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de what is bird flu ?

the positive review in " the economist " has everyone surprised - except for the chancellor . great britain 's and maybe the world 's most prominent business magazine is not known for its love affair with germany 's economic system .
the decidedly pro-business economist has in recent years enjoyed ribbing europe 's largest economy for its stagnant growth rates , high unemployment and a union strength that has led to sky-high labor costs .
all the more surprising , then , that when the german symbol , the black eagle , graced the front of this week 's magazine as a caricature , it was flexing its muscles underneath the headline " germany 's surprising economy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : really ? " some forecasters are now predicting that germany , which has for so many years disappointed on the downside , could be about to surprise on the upside , " the magazine wrote in the lead editorial . weakened unions a good thing as reasons for this the economist listed , above all , the turnaround accomplished by the country 's major corporations .
the newfound flexibility of germany 's usually stubborn unions has helped lower labor costs immensely and made the country more competitive than italy , the netherlands , great britain and france .
" that is a big reason why , last year , it regained its position as the world 's biggest exporter , " it wrote . the magazine gave credit to chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition government of social democrats and the green party for getting reforms underway .
his raft of labor and socio-economic reforms , called agenda 2010 , may lose him the election this september , but they have nonetheless " raised hopes that fresh impetus could set the economy on to its strongest track for years . " tough measures , like the unpopular hartz iv law that made it more difficult for germany 's 1.8 million long-term unemployed to receive benefits without actively looking for jobs , won the magazine 's approval .
" hartz iv ... has added 8 billion euros -lrb- $ 9.8 billion -rrb- to this year 's government costs , but failed to create many new jobs , " the magazine wrote .
" it has , however , made employees more fearful of the consequences of losing their jobs .
that has strengthened the hand of firms ... and weakened the power of trade unions . " bildunterschrift : germany 's unions are getting weak , and that 's a good thing , according to " the economist " chancellor : proof we 're doing things right the report raised eyebrows in germany , getting press coverage not only from business magazines , but local papers as well .
germany 's prominent frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper followed up on the economist cover with a piece examining the euphoria .
" nobody wants to believe it : germany is gaining more prominence abroad as an investment destination , " it wrote . nobody , that is , except for the chancellor .
at one point during an hour-long interview on german public television yesterday evening , schröder fished a piece of paper out of his pocket .
it was the economist 's piece . " the economist , a publication that in the past was never particularly pro-german , has a cover story ' economist cheers germany 's surprising economy ' and says that thanks to the reforms we introduced our competitiveness has grown enormously , " he said . economist : merkel needs a chance but schröder neglected to mention one thing .

the positive review in " the economist " has everyone surprised - except for the chancellor . great britain 's and maybe the world 's most prominent business magazine is not known for its love affair with germany 's economic system .
the decidedly pro-business economist has in recent years enjoyed ribbing europe 's largest economy for its stagnant growth rates , high unemployment and a union strength that has led to sky-high labor costs .
all the more surprising , then , that when the german symbol , the black eagle , graced the front of this week 's magazine as a caricature , it was flexing its muscles underneath the headline " germany 's surprising economy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : really ? " some forecasters are now predicting that germany , which has for so many years disappointed on the downside , could be about to surprise on the upside , " the magazine wrote in the lead editorial . weakened unions a good thing as reasons for this the economist listed , above all , the turnaround accomplished by the country 's major corporations .
the newfound flexibility of germany 's usually stubborn unions has helped lower labor costs immensely and made the country more competitive than italy , the netherlands , great britain and france .
" that is a big reason why , last year , it regained its position as the world 's biggest exporter , " it wrote . the magazine gave credit to chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition government of social democrats and the green party for getting reforms underway .
his raft of labor and socio-economic reforms , called agenda 2010 , may lose him the election this september , but they have nonetheless " raised hopes that fresh impetus could set the economy on to its strongest track for years . " tough measures , like the unpopular hartz iv law that made it more difficult for germany 's 1.8 million long-term unemployed to receive benefits without actively looking for jobs , won the magazine 's approval .
" hartz iv ... has added 8 billion euros -lrb- $ 9.8 billion -rrb- to this year 's government costs , but failed to create many new jobs , " the magazine wrote .
" it has , however , made employees more fearful of the consequences of losing their jobs .
that has strengthened the hand of firms ... and weakened the power of trade unions . " bildunterschrift : germany 's unions are getting weak , and that 's a good thing , according to " the economist " chancellor : proof we 're doing things right the report raised eyebrows in germany , getting press coverage not only from business magazines , but local papers as well .
germany 's prominent frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper followed up on the economist cover with a piece examining the euphoria .
" nobody wants to believe it : germany is gaining more prominence abroad as an investment destination , " it wrote . nobody , that is , except for the chancellor .
at one point during an hour-long interview on german public television yesterday evening , schröder fished a piece of paper out of his pocket .
it was the economist 's piece . " the economist , a publication that in the past was never particularly pro-german , has a cover story ' economist cheers germany 's surprising economy ' and says that thanks to the reforms we introduced our competitiveness has grown enormously , " he said . economist : merkel needs a chance but schröder neglected to mention one thing .
though it gave schröder 's government a small amount of praise for getting the reform process started , the economist editorialists clearly hope his opponents will be the ones continuing them after the likely elections on sept .

" the commitment of the new government to further reforms will make a big difference , " they wrote .
" the politicians may not be able to control the economy , but they can certainly muck it up .

ahead of germany 's election , the native australian shares his views on the country 's state and voices his annoyance with a pervading pessimism . hartnett first came to the german capital in 1995 from melbourne , australia .
he began offering english-language tours of the city and now employs 15 to 20 guides at " insider tour . " hartnett plans to stay for at least a couple of more years , but is thinking about returning to his home country .
" the lifestyle 's pretty enviable there , " he said , adding that australia 's booming economy and optimism might be a better environment for his 15-month-old son to grow up in .

i think that 's a problem that pervades this country socially and economically .
as much savings as this country has it needs to be invigorated .
it 's going to snowball into a greater problem unless change is made , unless people feel energized and are given direction .
germany really needs to have some sense of purpose . what needs to happen in germany to help speed up the country 's recovery ? there needs to be some political effort to raise the profile of germany internationally .

who is your personal choice for chancellor ?
why ? when it comes down to personality , schröder is very appealing .
he 's very professional .
but merkel 's public relations people seem to have put her in pretty good shape and she is looking more professional .
i guess as with any political malaise , the public has a pervading sense that it 's time for change and i 've also fallen prey to that .
i think the shadow cabinet merkel is trying to assemble sounds interesting .
her financial advisor is talking about a 25 percent tax rate - that sounds quite exciting .
her conservative stance might be welcomed by international investors .
she has a more critical stance towards russia , which is good , and a more appeasing stance towards the us , which i think is not so good . what do you like about germany ? i really like germany in the sense that it is extremely progressive .
i really appreciate its environmental stance , coming from australia , where we are so much like the us .
everybody seems to have an opinion here , people are quite engaged and that 's quite healthy . what do you dislike about germany ? i 'm sick of germans ' miserable attitudes towards themselves .
that 's really boring and annoying as well .
the rigidity , this selfishness , this short-sightedness - not wanting to invigorate the economy , where everybody should know full well that 's the only way to take on reforms .

" i was extremely impressed by what he said and how he said it .

11 hijackers while the cell was preparing the attacks in hamburg , was convicted of being a member of a terrorist organization and sentenced to seven years in prison by a german court on friday . presiding judge ernst-rainer schudt announced the verdict of the moroccan 's year-long retrial hearing without stating the court 's reasons for the decision . support of hamburg cell leads to conviction el motassadeq was convicted on terror-related charges after the prosecution accused him of helping pay tuition and other bills for members of the hamburg cell to allow them to live as students while they plotted the attacks . prosecutors had demanded the maximum sentence of 15 years in prison for el motassadeq , but defense lawyers sought acquittal for the moroccan , who acknowledges he was close to the hijackers but insists he knew nothing of their plans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plumes of smoke pour from the world trade center buildings in new york tuesday , sept .

el motassadeq , who looked on calmly as schudt announced the verdict , was the first man to go on trial over the terrorist attacks in new york and washington that killed more than 3,000 people .
he was found guilty and sentenced the maximum 15 years in prison in february 2003 .
but a german federal tribunal overturned the verdict last year and sent the case back to the court in the northern port city of hamburg , where three of the 19 suicide hijackers lived and studied .
attorney ladislav anisic said there was no evidence that directly linked his client to the plot and argued that motassadeq was being tried simply on guilt by association , which he said was unacceptable under the rule of law in a democracy like germany 's .
" let us not let osama bin laden win here at home by sacrificing our legal foundations , " he argued before the court .
anisic has said he will appeal any verdict other than an acquittal .
us not cooperating german observers say the prosecution 's case had been weakened by the failure of the united states to hand over more information on two top al qaeda operatives in its custody .
the federal court overturned the verdict on the grounds that the hamburg judges had not been able to hear potentially exculpatory testimony from the self-purported mastermind behind the attacks , ramzi binalshibh , and al qaeda 's suspected number three , khalid sheikh mohammed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdelghani mzoudi , left , was freed .
many think motassadeq will also be acquitted .
the us justice department provided two sets of summaries of their interrogation in which the two men reportedly said that motassadeq and fellow moroccan abdelghani mzoudi had had no involvement in the plot .
the prosecution has argued that the accounts are not credible given al qaeda training methods in counterintelligence .
but the reports and the holes in the case were enough to see mzoudi acquitted in hamburg on the same charges motassadeq is again facing .
after his release , mzoudi returned to morocco in june under threat of deportation .
perhaps in the hopes of a similar outcome to his trial , motassadeq has extended his moroccan passport and said he wished to go home as soon as possible .

11 , 2001 .
el motassadeq , who looked on calmly as schudt announced the verdict , was the first man to go on trial over the terrorist attacks in new york and washington that killed more than 3,000 people .
he was found guilty and sentenced the maximum 15 years in prison in february 2003 .
but a german federal tribunal overturned the verdict last year and sent the case back to the court in the northern port city of hamburg , where three of the 19 suicide hijackers lived and studied .
attorney ladislav anisic said there was no evidence that directly linked his client to the plot and argued that motassadeq was being tried simply on guilt by association , which he said was unacceptable under the rule of law in a democracy like germany 's .
" let us not let osama bin laden win here at home by sacrificing our legal foundations , " he argued before the court .
anisic has said he will appeal any verdict other than an acquittal .
us not cooperating german observers say the prosecution 's case had been weakened by the failure of the united states to hand over more information on two top al qaeda operatives in its custody .
the federal court overturned the verdict on the grounds that the hamburg judges had not been able to hear potentially exculpatory testimony from the self-purported mastermind behind the attacks , ramzi binalshibh , and al qaeda 's suspected number three , khalid sheikh mohammed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdelghani mzoudi , left , was freed .
many think motassadeq will also be acquitted .
the us justice department provided two sets of summaries of their interrogation in which the two men reportedly said that motassadeq and fellow moroccan abdelghani mzoudi had had no involvement in the plot .
the prosecution has argued that the accounts are not credible given al qaeda training methods in counterintelligence .
but the reports and the holes in the case were enough to see mzoudi acquitted in hamburg on the same charges motassadeq is again facing .
after his release , mzoudi returned to morocco in june under threat of deportation .
perhaps in the hopes of a similar outcome to his trial , motassadeq has extended his moroccan passport and said he wished to go home as soon as possible .
after 65 hearings and 112 witnesses during the retrial alone , which began one year ago , a not guilty verdict would have been a humiliating blow to federal prosecutors . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb / nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de 9/11 suspect trial resumes after delay a moroccan student being retried over involvement in the september 11 , 2001 attacks in new york and washington , provided " active support " to the suicide pilots , the federal prosecutor told a german court on monday .

" tui and hapag-lloyd -lrb- its maritime transportation subsidiary -rrb- are regularly in talks with other container shipping companies , including cp ships .
whether these talks will lead to alliances or transactions in the near future or at any other point in time is undecided . "
the wall street journal earlier reported that tui was close to a deal to buy cp ships , a london-based spinoff from the former canadian pacific limited , for 1.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.84 billion -rrb- .
a bid by tui would likely trigger a lively reaction from other potential buyers , notably china shipping group and cma cgm of france . dw-world.de tackling terror threats to tourism germany 's biggest tourism company wants to show it cares more about terrorism concerns than others .

there are signs that the gap between them and church leaders is narrowing . as world youth day -lrb- wyd -rrb- enters its climactic phase with the arrival of pope benedict xvi on thursday , church critics are also stepping up their activities .
a number of reform organizations from around the world have been handing out flyers and staging events in the city of cologne in an attempt to reach the young people attending the catholic festival . united under the umbrella of the " world youth day 4 all coalition " -lrb- wyd4all -rrb- , they have set up their base for the duration of the gathering in a church in the city center . while there is hardly any room given to controversial issues in the official wyd program , young believers ' response to critical questions has been enormous , says aisha taylor , program director of the us-based women 's ordination conference . " the possibility for priests to get married , the rights of gays and lesbians , more democratic participation for lay people - all these are points on which we would like to see progress , " she said . women priests unsettle leaders a particular focus of taylor 's work concerns the role of women in the church .
according to official doctrine women can not be become priests . " when seven women were ordained priests in 2002 by a dissident bishop in austria , the vatican excommunicated the women within a week or so , " taylor , 24 , said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gisela forster , left , and christine mayr-lumetzberger are two of the seven women who were ordained as priests by argentine bishop romulo braschi in 2002 in defiance of the ban of catholic church on female clergy .
at the time , it was cardinal joseph ratzinger , then head of the congregation for the doctrine of the faith and now pope benedict xvi , who lead the charge against them . yet , judging from responses from the people thronging the streets of cologne , equal rights for women in the church consistently rank among the top demands , reports taylor , who sees the demonstrative ordination of women also as a way to elicit a direct response from the vatican . " the pope is getting annoyed and knows who we are , " she said .
" but we have to use these alternative paths to make our opinions known , because the church is not a democracy and its members have no vote . " even if benedict xvi refuses to recognize women priests , in the future another pope could make a cut with the past , she says .
and the ongoing effort by reformers is having an impact , she adds : " we now have female altar service and women who work as eucharistic ministers .
and in a letter the pope , then a cardinal , made a point of the equality of men and women in public life - except in the church context . " latin american concerns in other regions of the world , such as latin america , where a large majority of the population is catholic , there is not necessarily a less critical view than in europe or north america . " the church has a lot of spiritual and political power in our part of the world , " said 25-year-old andrea ramirez from bolivia who heads the youth chapter of the " we are church " reform movement in her home country .
" but there is also strong support for the gay movement or the feminists . " " we want to show that you can be a good catholic and be gay or lesbian .

" but maybe the pope has n't had enough time , yet , to properly get in touch with the very real problems of the nations of the south . " the refusal by conservative church leaders to engage in debate sometimes takes forms that amount to keeping information away from young believers , critics say . “ we have seen how nuns accompanying a group of young catholics took away from them the flyers we had just handed out to them , ” reports agnes rudnik , a spokeswoman for the gay and lesbian groups at wyd . cheer the pope , follow your conscience - no problem so is it a contradiction that young people attending wyd are welcoming the pope with overwhelming enthusiasm , yet feel strongly about a number contentious issues on which they are opposed to the pontiff , as reformers claim ? " i don ’ t think there is a contradiction when people cheer the pope and follow their conscience at the same time , ” says tobias raschke , the german spokesman for " we are church . ”
" young people feel it is their church and sincerely want the pope to understand what their concerns are . ” the critics make a strong point that they are part of the church and do consider themselves firmly rooted in the faith . " i really hope our work gives a new impetus for change to the pope , because he ’ s my religious leader after all , ” says ramirez . “ i love my faith and the catholic church , it ’ s my heritage , my tradition " , says aisha taylor . signs of change while wyd is an event that appeals to the masses , many young reformers agree that behind it there is a genuine attempt to reach out to the younger generation .

there are signs that the gap between them and church leaders is narrowing . as world youth day -lrb- wyd -rrb- enters its climactic phase with the arrival of pope benedict xvi on thursday , church critics are also stepping up their activities .
a number of reform organizations from around the world have been handing out flyers and staging events in the city of cologne in an attempt to reach the young people attending the catholic festival . united under the umbrella of the " world youth day 4 all coalition " -lrb- wyd4all -rrb- , they have set up their base for the duration of the gathering in a church in the city center . while there is hardly any room given to controversial issues in the official wyd program , young believers ' response to critical questions has been enormous , says aisha taylor , program director of the us-based women 's ordination conference . " the possibility for priests to get married , the rights of gays and lesbians , more democratic participation for lay people - all these are points on which we would like to see progress , " she said . women priests unsettle leaders a particular focus of taylor 's work concerns the role of women in the church .
according to official doctrine women can not be become priests . " when seven women were ordained priests in 2002 by a dissident bishop in austria , the vatican excommunicated the women within a week or so , " taylor , 24 , said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gisela forster , left , and christine mayr-lumetzberger are two of the seven women who were ordained as priests by argentine bishop romulo braschi in 2002 in defiance of the ban of catholic church on female clergy .
at the time , it was cardinal joseph ratzinger , then head of the congregation for the doctrine of the faith and now pope benedict xvi , who lead the charge against them . yet , judging from responses from the people thronging the streets of cologne , equal rights for women in the church consistently rank among the top demands , reports taylor , who sees the demonstrative ordination of women also as a way to elicit a direct response from the vatican . " the pope is getting annoyed and knows who we are , " she said .
" but we have to use these alternative paths to make our opinions known , because the church is not a democracy and its members have no vote . " even if benedict xvi refuses to recognize women priests , in the future another pope could make a cut with the past , she says .
and the ongoing effort by reformers is having an impact , she adds : " we now have female altar service and women who work as eucharistic ministers .
and in a letter the pope , then a cardinal , made a point of the equality of men and women in public life - except in the church context . " latin american concerns in other regions of the world , such as latin america , where a large majority of the population is catholic , there is not necessarily a less critical view than in europe or north america . " the church has a lot of spiritual and political power in our part of the world , " said 25-year-old andrea ramirez from bolivia who heads the youth chapter of the " we are church " reform movement in her home country .
" but there is also strong support for the gay movement or the feminists . " " we want to show that you can be a good catholic and be gay or lesbian .
or that you can be a good catholic and use condoms , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church still has enormous influence in latin america the ongoing refusal by the vatican to soften its stance on family planning or the use of condoms is particularly detrimental to poor countries , says ramirez . " but maybe the pope has n't had enough time , yet , to properly get in touch with the very real problems of the nations of the south . " the refusal by conservative church leaders to engage in debate sometimes takes forms that amount to keeping information away from young believers , critics say . “ we have seen how nuns accompanying a group of young catholics took away from them the flyers we had just handed out to them , ” reports agnes rudnik , a spokeswoman for the gay and lesbian groups at wyd . cheer the pope , follow your conscience - no problem so is it a contradiction that young people attending wyd are welcoming the pope with overwhelming enthusiasm , yet feel strongly about a number contentious issues on which they are opposed to the pontiff , as reformers claim ? " i don ’ t think there is a contradiction when people cheer the pope and follow their conscience at the same time , ” says tobias raschke , the german spokesman for " we are church . ”
" young people feel it is their church and sincerely want the pope to understand what their concerns are . ” the critics make a strong point that they are part of the church and do consider themselves firmly rooted in the faith .

in their midst , a young woman dressed like a secretary from a 1950 's film calmly types away on an equally old-fashioned typewriter while listening intently to the man seated opposite her .
a sign beside them reads " if i were chancellor … " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when the man finishes dictating his message to germany 's political leaders , the " secretary " hands him his postcard , complete with postage .
he twirls a wheel of rubber stamps , selects one that says " urgent , " and inks this in bright red across his card .

she is bringing " if i were chancellor " to five german cities over a period of three weeks , and expects to type as many as 200 cards .

a sign beside them reads " if i were chancellor … " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when the man finishes dictating his message to germany 's political leaders , the " secretary " hands him his postcard , complete with postage .
he twirls a wheel of rubber stamps , selects one that says " urgent , " and inks this in bright red across his card .
he then drops the card into a mailbox conveniently located just a few steps away , a look of satisfaction on his face . the scene - part political event , part art happening - causes passersby to slow their pace .
some just watch , while others get in line for a chance to have their say .
it 's all the brainchild of the woman in the red secretary 's costume , american artist and journalist sheryl oring . in the year leading up to the 2004 elections in the united states , oring travelled across her country with a similar project called " i wish to say , " typing over a thousand postcards for people who wanted to voice their concerns to president george w. bush . " the reaction in the states was so great that i thought of trying it in other countries , " says oring , who had previously worked and studied in germany and speaks fluent german . german grammar despite having a good grasp of the language , oring says she was slightly nervous about taking her " show " to germany . bildunterschrift : " i have to tell people to speak slowly because i 'm not a native speaker , and when i 'm done , i give them the chance to read it over and correct the grammar mistakes , " she laughs . but she added that being a foreigner has its advantages , as it makes people curious , and more likely to participate . " i did n't know how it would go over in germany , but people are really into doing it , " oring says .
" people have a lot of concerns about unemployment and social benefits , for example , and they 're really eager to talk about that .
here , people do n't feel the media or the politicians are listening to them , but this project gives them that .
in a way , it 's a service to people , and that 's something that 's been very gratifying . " thomas , a 42-year-old berliner , sat down with oring to tell her about his dissatisfaction with the current economic and social situation in germany .
on his postcard , he wrote to chancellor gerhard schröder of his concern that germany is moving too far in the direction of the us when it comes to labor policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wenn ich kanzler wäre … kunstaktion sheryl oring schreibmaschine " people are being forced into doing any old job , even if it is below their qualifications , just so that they 're back at work , " thomas said , adding that he appreciated oring 's project . " if you express your opinion as part of an art project , you know you wo n't have to face any repercussions , " he said .
" it 's a safe way to do it . " diverse responses while many of the postcards deal with election campaign issues such as unemployment , pensions , and education , other participants used their time at oring 's desk to air their pet peeves , or let their imaginations run wild . " i would charge a big fee for people who do n't clean up after their dogs , " wrote one disgruntled berliner . " i 'd like to be the king of berlin , " wrote another resident whose solution to the city 's problems would be to " open a big casino so everyone would be happy . " queuing up to talk with oring , eight-year-old gabriel excitedly outlined a list of laws he would pass if he were chancellor , including one that would " allow kids to play soccer everywhere . " bildunterschrift : kids get in on the act , too it 's the diversity of responses that keeps oring going .
she is bringing " if i were chancellor " to five german cities over a period of three weeks , and expects to type as many as 200 cards .
she keeps a copy of each card , and is hoping to turn them into an exhibition or a book . " i 'm always amazed at people 's answers , " she says .
" even though i 've done the show before , it never feels repetitive .
when i meet new people and hear a really moving story , that 's when i think it 's all worth it .

" this morning the quota for category seven , blouses , was filled .
member states custom authorities will no longer issue import licenses for this product , " spokesman rupert krietemeyer told afp , reading a statement .
according to the eu imports database , data shows that 100 percent of a 2005 quota of nearly 24.8 million chinese blouses had been cleared for entry into the eu as of thursday evening . the commission spokesperson had further bad news for retailers : " it is likely that a number of other quotas will also be filled in the very near future , " he added .
specifically , quotas for bras , t-shirts and flax yarn were close to being met . the quotas for men 's trousers and pullovers were also already reached earlier this month , leaving millions of garments stranded at eu customs and outraging some big eu retailers awaiting deliveries . eu , china still locked in quota talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu and chinese officials have been holding talks on the quotas and brussels has said it is willing to be flexible .
eu trade commissioner peter mandelson -lrb- photo -rrb- has made it clear that he wants to negotiate with china to allow more clothing imports into the bloc , possibly by using some of 2006 quotas in 2005 . after eu textile producers urged that the quotas be implemented , eu officials are coming under fierce pressure from retailers who warn that store shelves could be bare during the key back-to-school period because they have not received some shipments . on thursday , government ministers from the netherlands , denmark , sweden and finland wrote an article in the financial times saying there was a risk of job losses and bankruptcies unless the eu eases the curbs on the imports .
this followed a letter sent to mandelson by germany 's economy minister wolfgang clement which called for a relaxation of the import restrictions . textile producers fear massive influx from china not all eu countries want the import restrictions to be relaxed .
countries with big textile industries of their own , like france , italy and spain , are worried they will suffer if chinese clothing enters the eu on a massive scale . the eu and china agreed to a broad textile trade agreement in june setting annual restrictions on 10 categories of chinese imports , which had been surging since the beginning of the year following the end of an international quota system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu trade commissioner peter mandelson , left , and his chinese counterpart bo xilai , right , toast during a signing ceremony early saturday june 11 , 2005 in shanghai , china .
the european union said friday it had reached a deal to resolve a dispute with china over a surge of chinese textile imports .
after protracted negotiations between chinese commerce minister bo xilai and mandelson in shanghai in june , china said that it would limit growth in exports of 10 textile and clothing products to the eu from between 8 to 12.5 percent a year in a bid to defuse the trade row . agreement in june rubber-stamped growth rate " china and the european union have agreed that , in the period from june 11 , 2005 to the end of 2007 , with an agreed base quantity , we will determine china 's amount of exports to europe by a growth rate of between 8 to 12.5 percent per year , " the ministry of commerce said in a statement on its web site after the end of negotiations . the eu response was to issue a statement that said that in 2008 , the eu will only apply " with restraint " paragraph 242 of china 's world trade organization accession protocol on textiles , which requires china to limit exports of textile products .

" this morning the quota for category seven , blouses , was filled .
member states custom authorities will no longer issue import licenses for this product , " spokesman rupert krietemeyer told afp , reading a statement .
according to the eu imports database , data shows that 100 percent of a 2005 quota of nearly 24.8 million chinese blouses had been cleared for entry into the eu as of thursday evening . the commission spokesperson had further bad news for retailers : " it is likely that a number of other quotas will also be filled in the very near future , " he added .
specifically , quotas for bras , t-shirts and flax yarn were close to being met . the quotas for men 's trousers and pullovers were also already reached earlier this month , leaving millions of garments stranded at eu customs and outraging some big eu retailers awaiting deliveries . eu , china still locked in quota talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu and chinese officials have been holding talks on the quotas and brussels has said it is willing to be flexible .
eu trade commissioner peter mandelson -lrb- photo -rrb- has made it clear that he wants to negotiate with china to allow more clothing imports into the bloc , possibly by using some of 2006 quotas in 2005 . after eu textile producers urged that the quotas be implemented , eu officials are coming under fierce pressure from retailers who warn that store shelves could be bare during the key back-to-school period because they have not received some shipments . on thursday , government ministers from the netherlands , denmark , sweden and finland wrote an article in the financial times saying there was a risk of job losses and bankruptcies unless the eu eases the curbs on the imports .
this followed a letter sent to mandelson by germany 's economy minister wolfgang clement which called for a relaxation of the import restrictions . textile producers fear massive influx from china not all eu countries want the import restrictions to be relaxed .
countries with big textile industries of their own , like france , italy and spain , are worried they will suffer if chinese clothing enters the eu on a massive scale . the eu and china agreed to a broad textile trade agreement in june setting annual restrictions on 10 categories of chinese imports , which had been surging since the beginning of the year following the end of an international quota system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu trade commissioner peter mandelson , left , and his chinese counterpart bo xilai , right , toast during a signing ceremony early saturday june 11 , 2005 in shanghai , china .
the european union said friday it had reached a deal to resolve a dispute with china over a surge of chinese textile imports .
after protracted negotiations between chinese commerce minister bo xilai and mandelson in shanghai in june , china said that it would limit growth in exports of 10 textile and clothing products to the eu from between 8 to 12.5 percent a year in a bid to defuse the trade row . agreement in june rubber-stamped growth rate " china and the european union have agreed that , in the period from june 11 , 2005 to the end of 2007 , with an agreed base quantity , we will determine china 's amount of exports to europe by a growth rate of between 8 to 12.5 percent per year , " the ministry of commerce said in a statement on its web site after the end of negotiations . the eu response was to issue a statement that said that in 2008 , the eu will only apply " with restraint " paragraph 242 of china 's world trade organization accession protocol on textiles , which requires china to limit exports of textile products .

eu trade commissioner peter mandelson -lrb- photo -rrb- has made it clear that he wants to negotiate with china to allow more clothing imports into the bloc , possibly by using some of 2006 quotas in 2005 . after eu textile producers urged that the quotas be implemented , eu officials are coming under fierce pressure from retailers who warn that store shelves could be bare during the key back-to-school period because they have not received some shipments . on thursday , government ministers from the netherlands , denmark , sweden and finland wrote an article in the financial times saying there was a risk of job losses and bankruptcies unless the eu eases the curbs on the imports .
this followed a letter sent to mandelson by germany 's economy minister wolfgang clement which called for a relaxation of the import restrictions . textile producers fear massive influx from china not all eu countries want the import restrictions to be relaxed .
countries with big textile industries of their own , like france , italy and spain , are worried they will suffer if chinese clothing enters the eu on a massive scale . the eu and china agreed to a broad textile trade agreement in june setting annual restrictions on 10 categories of chinese imports , which had been surging since the beginning of the year following the end of an international quota system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu trade commissioner peter mandelson , left , and his chinese counterpart bo xilai , right , toast during a signing ceremony early saturday june 11 , 2005 in shanghai , china .
the european union said friday it had reached a deal to resolve a dispute with china over a surge of chinese textile imports .
after protracted negotiations between chinese commerce minister bo xilai and mandelson in shanghai in june , china said that it would limit growth in exports of 10 textile and clothing products to the eu from between 8 to 12.5 percent a year in a bid to defuse the trade row . agreement in june rubber-stamped growth rate " china and the european union have agreed that , in the period from june 11 , 2005 to the end of 2007 , with an agreed base quantity , we will determine china 's amount of exports to europe by a growth rate of between 8 to 12.5 percent per year , " the ministry of commerce said in a statement on its web site after the end of negotiations . the eu response was to issue a statement that said that in 2008 , the eu will only apply " with restraint " paragraph 242 of china 's world trade organization accession protocol on textiles , which requires china to limit exports of textile products .
there was no further explanation . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu , china settle textiles row china said saturday it will limit growth in exports of 10 textile and clothing products to the european union to 8 to 12.5 percent a year in a bid to defuse a trade row straining ties between them .
-lrb- june 11 , 2005 -rrb- chinese textiles row heats up china has said it is abolishing export duties on 81 categories of its own textile products .
the move has escalated tensions with the european union and united states , which have set new curbs on chinese textile imports .

"
everyone knows what to do when a diaper starts to stink but what do you do when one starts to tick ?
call the police and run for the hills .
that 's what postal workers in a german city did . most parents will already consider a fully fed yet strangely uncomfortable looking baby as volatile an object as a container of nitroglycerin .
the slightest of movements and the whole thing could blow .
the aftermath of such an explosion can leave everyone involved covered in a nasty biological agent of some kind or another . but there usually has to be an infant involved for a fully blown diaper emergency to take place .
not so in the german city of heilbronn , however . without a baby 's bottom in sight , the southwestern city was thrown into chaos on thursday after what police later described as an " electronic nappy " caused a major bomb scare in the local post office . workers at the heilbronn branch of deutsche post went running for cover when a parcel started ticking suspiciously in the package department . police called as post office fears bomb attack fearing a bomb attack , the police were called and two squad cars sped to the scene where the officers immediately contacted the sender .
the police gave the all-clear after they contacted the woman who told them the intercepted package contained only a malfunctioning diaper . but why was it ticking ?
apparently , the hi-tech nappy was of a kind that reacts to wetness and which alerts the nearest parent to the fact that nature has run its course .
but instead of the usual signal , this diaper had begun to omit a more ominous sound . wetness sensor ticked not bleeped " -lrb- the postal workers -rrb- suspected it was a bomb so they put the package into an empty room and called the police , " said a police spokesman .
" it was supposed to respond to wetness with bleeping sounds but this one ticked . " reports that electronic diapers were going to be issued to postal staff in case of future scares were unsubstantiated . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the best of " from the fringe " offbeat and quirky news from around germany the lighter side of german news proving there 's more to news than politics , business and technology , dw-world has launched a newsletter that shines a light on germany 's cultural , peculiar and sometimes odd happenings .

the positive review in " the economist " has everyone surprised - except for the chancellor . great britain 's and maybe the world 's most prominent business magazine is not known for its love affair with germany 's economic system .
the decidedly pro-business economist has in recent years enjoyed ribbing europe 's largest economy for its stagnant growth rates , high unemployment and a union strength that has led to sky-high labor costs .
all the more surprising , then , that when the german symbol , the black eagle , graced the front of this week 's magazine as a caricature , it was flexing its muscles underneath the headline " germany 's surprising economy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : really ? " some forecasters are now predicting that germany , which has for so many years disappointed on the downside , could be about to surprise on the upside , " the magazine wrote in the lead editorial . weakened unions a good thing as reasons for this the economist listed , above all , the turnaround accomplished by the country 's major corporations .
the newfound flexibility of germany 's usually stubborn unions has helped lower labor costs immensely and made the country more competitive than italy , the netherlands , great britain and france .
" that is a big reason why , last year , it regained its position as the world 's biggest exporter , " it wrote . the magazine gave credit to chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition government of social democrats and the green party for getting reforms underway .
his raft of labor and socio-economic reforms , called agenda 2010 , may lose him the election this september , but they have nonetheless " raised hopes that fresh impetus could set the economy on to its strongest track for years . " tough measures , like the unpopular hartz iv law that made it more difficult for germany 's 1.8 million long-term unemployed to receive benefits without actively looking for jobs , won the magazine 's approval .
" hartz iv ... has added 8 billion euros -lrb- $ 9.8 billion -rrb- to this year 's government costs , but failed to create many new jobs , " the magazine wrote .
" it has , however , made employees more fearful of the consequences of losing their jobs .
that has strengthened the hand of firms ... and weakened the power of trade unions . " bildunterschrift : germany 's unions are getting weak , and that 's a good thing , according to " the economist " chancellor : proof we 're doing things right the report raised eyebrows in germany , getting press coverage not only from business magazines , but local papers as well .
germany 's prominent frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper followed up on the economist cover with a piece examining the euphoria .
" nobody wants to believe it : germany is gaining more prominence abroad as an investment destination , " it wrote . nobody , that is , except for the chancellor .
at one point during an hour-long interview on german public television yesterday evening , schröder fished a piece of paper out of his pocket .
it was the economist 's piece . " the economist , a publication that in the past was never particularly pro-german , has a cover story ' economist cheers germany 's surprising economy ' and says that thanks to the reforms we introduced our competitiveness has grown enormously , " he said . economist : merkel needs a chance but schröder neglected to mention one thing .
though it gave schröder 's government a small amount of praise for getting the reform process started , the economist editorialists clearly hope his opponents will be the ones continuing them after the likely elections on sept .
18 .
" the commitment of the new government to further reforms will make a big difference , " they wrote .
" the politicians may not be able to control the economy , but they can certainly muck it up .
a center-right government under ms. merkel would have the advantage that her party also controls the upper-house bundesrat , making it far easier to push through legislative change .

the positive review in " the economist " has everyone surprised - except for the chancellor . great britain 's and maybe the world 's most prominent business magazine is not known for its love affair with germany 's economic system .
the decidedly pro-business economist has in recent years enjoyed ribbing europe 's largest economy for its stagnant growth rates , high unemployment and a union strength that has led to sky-high labor costs .
all the more surprising , then , that when the german symbol , the black eagle , graced the front of this week 's magazine as a caricature , it was flexing its muscles underneath the headline " germany 's surprising economy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : really ? " some forecasters are now predicting that germany , which has for so many years disappointed on the downside , could be about to surprise on the upside , " the magazine wrote in the lead editorial . weakened unions a good thing as reasons for this the economist listed , above all , the turnaround accomplished by the country 's major corporations .
the newfound flexibility of germany 's usually stubborn unions has helped lower labor costs immensely and made the country more competitive than italy , the netherlands , great britain and france .
" that is a big reason why , last year , it regained its position as the world 's biggest exporter , " it wrote . the magazine gave credit to chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition government of social democrats and the green party for getting reforms underway .
his raft of labor and socio-economic reforms , called agenda 2010 , may lose him the election this september , but they have nonetheless " raised hopes that fresh impetus could set the economy on to its strongest track for years . " tough measures , like the unpopular hartz iv law that made it more difficult for germany 's 1.8 million long-term unemployed to receive benefits without actively looking for jobs , won the magazine 's approval .
" hartz iv ... has added 8 billion euros -lrb- $ 9.8 billion -rrb- to this year 's government costs , but failed to create many new jobs , " the magazine wrote .
" it has , however , made employees more fearful of the consequences of losing their jobs .
that has strengthened the hand of firms ... and weakened the power of trade unions . " bildunterschrift : germany 's unions are getting weak , and that 's a good thing , according to " the economist " chancellor : proof we 're doing things right the report raised eyebrows in germany , getting press coverage not only from business magazines , but local papers as well .
germany 's prominent frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper followed up on the economist cover with a piece examining the euphoria .
" nobody wants to believe it : germany is gaining more prominence abroad as an investment destination , " it wrote . nobody , that is , except for the chancellor .
at one point during an hour-long interview on german public television yesterday evening , schröder fished a piece of paper out of his pocket .
it was the economist 's piece . " the economist , a publication that in the past was never particularly pro-german , has a cover story ' economist cheers germany 's surprising economy ' and says that thanks to the reforms we introduced our competitiveness has grown enormously , " he said . economist : merkel needs a chance but schröder neglected to mention one thing .
though it gave schröder 's government a small amount of praise for getting the reform process started , the economist editorialists clearly hope his opponents will be the ones continuing them after the likely elections on sept .
18 .
" the commitment of the new government to further reforms will make a big difference , " they wrote .
" the politicians may not be able to control the economy , but they can certainly muck it up .
a center-right government under ms. merkel would have the advantage that her party also controls the upper-house bundesrat , making it far easier to push through legislative change .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 19.08.2005 surprise good review for german economy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chancellor likes what " the economist " is writing one of the world 's most prominent business magazines has given the german economy the thumbs up .
the positive review in " the economist " has everyone surprised - except for the chancellor . great britain 's and maybe the world 's most prominent business magazine is not known for its love affair with germany 's economic system .
the decidedly pro-business economist has in recent years enjoyed ribbing europe 's largest economy for its stagnant growth rates , high unemployment and a union strength that has led to sky-high labor costs .
all the more surprising , then , that when the german symbol , the black eagle , graced the front of this week 's magazine as a caricature , it was flexing its muscles underneath the headline " germany 's surprising economy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : really ? " some forecasters are now predicting that germany , which has for so many years disappointed on the downside , could be about to surprise on the upside , " the magazine wrote in the lead editorial . weakened unions a good thing as reasons for this the economist listed , above all , the turnaround accomplished by the country 's major corporations .
the newfound flexibility of germany 's usually stubborn unions has helped lower labor costs immensely and made the country more competitive than italy , the netherlands , great britain and france .
" that is a big reason why , last year , it regained its position as the world 's biggest exporter , " it wrote . the magazine gave credit to chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition government of social democrats and the green party for getting reforms underway .
his raft of labor and socio-economic reforms , called agenda 2010 , may lose him the election this september , but they have nonetheless " raised hopes that fresh impetus could set the economy on to its strongest track for years . " tough measures , like the unpopular hartz iv law that made it more difficult for germany 's 1.8 million long-term unemployed to receive benefits without actively looking for jobs , won the magazine 's approval .
" hartz iv ... has added 8 billion euros -lrb- $ 9.8 billion -rrb- to this year 's government costs , but failed to create many new jobs , " the magazine wrote .
" it has , however , made employees more fearful of the consequences of losing their jobs .
that has strengthened the hand of firms ... and weakened the power of trade unions . " bildunterschrift : germany 's unions are getting weak , and that 's a good thing , according to " the economist " chancellor : proof we 're doing things right the report raised eyebrows in germany , getting press coverage not only from business magazines , but local papers as well .
germany 's prominent frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper followed up on the economist cover with a piece examining the euphoria .
" nobody wants to believe it : germany is gaining more prominence abroad as an investment destination , " it wrote . nobody , that is , except for the chancellor .
at one point during an hour-long interview on german public television yesterday evening , schröder fished a piece of paper out of his pocket .
it was the economist 's piece . " the economist , a publication that in the past was never particularly pro-german , has a cover story ' economist cheers germany 's surprising economy ' and says that thanks to the reforms we introduced our competitiveness has grown enormously , " he said . economist : merkel needs a chance but schröder neglected to mention one thing .
though it gave schröder 's government a small amount of praise for getting the reform process started , the economist editorialists clearly hope his opponents will be the ones continuing them after the likely elections on sept .
18 .
" the commitment of the new government to further reforms will make a big difference , " they wrote .
" the politicians may not be able to control the economy , but they can certainly muck it up .
a center-right government under ms. merkel would have the advantage that her party also controls the upper-house bundesrat , making it far easier to push through legislative change .

the positive review in " the economist " has everyone surprised - except for the chancellor . great britain 's and maybe the world 's most prominent business magazine is not known for its love affair with germany 's economic system .
the decidedly pro-business economist has in recent years enjoyed ribbing europe 's largest economy for its stagnant growth rates , high unemployment and a union strength that has led to sky-high labor costs .
all the more surprising , then , that when the german symbol , the black eagle , graced the front of this week 's magazine as a caricature , it was flexing its muscles underneath the headline " germany 's surprising economy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : really ? " some forecasters are now predicting that germany , which has for so many years disappointed on the downside , could be about to surprise on the upside , " the magazine wrote in the lead editorial . weakened unions a good thing as reasons for this the economist listed , above all , the turnaround accomplished by the country 's major corporations .
the newfound flexibility of germany 's usually stubborn unions has helped lower labor costs immensely and made the country more competitive than italy , the netherlands , great britain and france .
" that is a big reason why , last year , it regained its position as the world 's biggest exporter , " it wrote . the magazine gave credit to chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition government of social democrats and the green party for getting reforms underway .
his raft of labor and socio-economic reforms , called agenda 2010 , may lose him the election this september , but they have nonetheless " raised hopes that fresh impetus could set the economy on to its strongest track for years . " tough measures , like the unpopular hartz iv law that made it more difficult for germany 's 1.8 million long-term unemployed to receive benefits without actively looking for jobs , won the magazine 's approval .
" hartz iv ... has added 8 billion euros -lrb- $ 9.8 billion -rrb- to this year 's government costs , but failed to create many new jobs , " the magazine wrote .
" it has , however , made employees more fearful of the consequences of losing their jobs .
that has strengthened the hand of firms ... and weakened the power of trade unions . " bildunterschrift : germany 's unions are getting weak , and that 's a good thing , according to " the economist " chancellor : proof we 're doing things right the report raised eyebrows in germany , getting press coverage not only from business magazines , but local papers as well .
germany 's prominent frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper followed up on the economist cover with a piece examining the euphoria .
" nobody wants to believe it : germany is gaining more prominence abroad as an investment destination , " it wrote . nobody , that is , except for the chancellor .
at one point during an hour-long interview on german public television yesterday evening , schröder fished a piece of paper out of his pocket .
it was the economist 's piece . " the economist , a publication that in the past was never particularly pro-german , has a cover story ' economist cheers germany 's surprising economy ' and says that thanks to the reforms we introduced our competitiveness has grown enormously , " he said . economist : merkel needs a chance but schröder neglected to mention one thing .
though it gave schröder 's government a small amount of praise for getting the reform process started , the economist editorialists clearly hope his opponents will be the ones continuing them after the likely elections on sept .
18 .
" the commitment of the new government to further reforms will make a big difference , " they wrote .
" the politicians may not be able to control the economy , but they can certainly muck it up .
a center-right government under ms. merkel would have the advantage that her party also controls the upper-house bundesrat , making it far easier to push through legislative change .

ahead of germany 's election , the native australian shares his views on the country 's state and voices his annoyance with a pervading pessimism . hartnett first came to the german capital in 1995 from melbourne , australia .
he began offering english-language tours of the city and now employs 15 to 20 guides at " insider tour . " hartnett plans to stay for at least a couple of more years , but is thinking about returning to his home country .
" the lifestyle 's pretty enviable there , " he said , adding that australia 's booming economy and optimism might be a better environment for his 15-month-old son to grow up in .
" i would want him to be shaped by that as opposed to present-day germany , " he said . dw-world : how is germany doing in your opinion ? francis hartnett : i think ratzinger -lrb- pope benedict xvi -rrb- said at the cologne world youth day that europe is lost in pessimism at the moment and that it has particularly striken germany and germans .
i think that 's a problem that pervades this country socially and economically .
as much savings as this country has it needs to be invigorated .
it 's going to snowball into a greater problem unless change is made , unless people feel energized and are given direction .
germany really needs to have some sense of purpose . what needs to happen in germany to help speed up the country 's recovery ? there needs to be some political effort to raise the profile of germany internationally .
there have been attempts in recent years but they are not leading anywhere .
instead of all these fainthearted attempts to portray germany as new european country , there needs to be plain talk about redefining and feeling good about germany and the good things of its past . gerhard schröder or angela merkel ?
who is your personal choice for chancellor ?
why ? when it comes down to personality , schröder is very appealing .
he 's very professional .
but merkel 's public relations people seem to have put her in pretty good shape and she is looking more professional .
i guess as with any political malaise , the public has a pervading sense that it 's time for change and i 've also fallen prey to that .
i think the shadow cabinet merkel is trying to assemble sounds interesting .
her financial advisor is talking about a 25 percent tax rate - that sounds quite exciting .
her conservative stance might be welcomed by international investors .
she has a more critical stance towards russia , which is good , and a more appeasing stance towards the us , which i think is not so good . what do you like about germany ? i really like germany in the sense that it is extremely progressive .
i really appreciate its environmental stance , coming from australia , where we are so much like the us .
everybody seems to have an opinion here , people are quite engaged and that 's quite healthy . what do you dislike about germany ? i 'm sick of germans ' miserable attitudes towards themselves .
that 's really boring and annoying as well .
the rigidity , this selfishness , this short-sightedness - not wanting to invigorate the economy , where everybody should know full well that 's the only way to take on reforms .
there seems to be a lack of responsibility for the future of germany .
it comes down to a negative self-perception of themselves . interview conducted by mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de election 2005 click here for dw-world 's complete coverage of the upcoming elections .

the positive review in " the economist " has everyone surprised - except for the chancellor . great britain 's and maybe the world 's most prominent business magazine is not known for its love affair with germany 's economic system .
the decidedly pro-business economist has in recent years enjoyed ribbing europe 's largest economy for its stagnant growth rates , high unemployment and a union strength that has led to sky-high labor costs .
all the more surprising , then , that when the german symbol , the black eagle , graced the front of this week 's magazine as a caricature , it was flexing its muscles underneath the headline " germany 's surprising economy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : really ? " some forecasters are now predicting that germany , which has for so many years disappointed on the downside , could be about to surprise on the upside , " the magazine wrote in the lead editorial . weakened unions a good thing as reasons for this the economist listed , above all , the turnaround accomplished by the country 's major corporations .
the newfound flexibility of germany 's usually stubborn unions has helped lower labor costs immensely and made the country more competitive than italy , the netherlands , great britain and france .
" that is a big reason why , last year , it regained its position as the world 's biggest exporter , " it wrote . the magazine gave credit to chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition government of social democrats and the green party for getting reforms underway .
his raft of labor and socio-economic reforms , called agenda 2010 , may lose him the election this september , but they have nonetheless " raised hopes that fresh impetus could set the economy on to its strongest track for years . " tough measures , like the unpopular hartz iv law that made it more difficult for germany 's 1.8 million long-term unemployed to receive benefits without actively looking for jobs , won the magazine 's approval .
" hartz iv ... has added 8 billion euros -lrb- $ 9.8 billion -rrb- to this year 's government costs , but failed to create many new jobs , " the magazine wrote .
" it has , however , made employees more fearful of the consequences of losing their jobs .
that has strengthened the hand of firms ... and weakened the power of trade unions . " bildunterschrift : germany 's unions are getting weak , and that 's a good thing , according to " the economist " chancellor : proof we 're doing things right the report raised eyebrows in germany , getting press coverage not only from business magazines , but local papers as well .
germany 's prominent frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper followed up on the economist cover with a piece examining the euphoria .
" nobody wants to believe it : germany is gaining more prominence abroad as an investment destination , " it wrote . nobody , that is , except for the chancellor .
at one point during an hour-long interview on german public television yesterday evening , schröder fished a piece of paper out of his pocket .
it was the economist 's piece . " the economist , a publication that in the past was never particularly pro-german , has a cover story ' economist cheers germany 's surprising economy ' and says that thanks to the reforms we introduced our competitiveness has grown enormously , " he said . economist : merkel needs a chance but schröder neglected to mention one thing .
though it gave schröder 's government a small amount of praise for getting the reform process started , the economist editorialists clearly hope his opponents will be the ones continuing them after the likely elections on sept .

" the commitment of the new government to further reforms will make a big difference , " they wrote .
" the politicians may not be able to control the economy , but they can certainly muck it up .

the positive review in " the economist " has everyone surprised - except for the chancellor . great britain 's and maybe the world 's most prominent business magazine is not known for its love affair with germany 's economic system .
the decidedly pro-business economist has in recent years enjoyed ribbing europe 's largest economy for its stagnant growth rates , high unemployment and a union strength that has led to sky-high labor costs .
all the more surprising , then , that when the german symbol , the black eagle , graced the front of this week 's magazine as a caricature , it was flexing its muscles underneath the headline " germany 's surprising economy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : really ? " some forecasters are now predicting that germany , which has for so many years disappointed on the downside , could be about to surprise on the upside , " the magazine wrote in the lead editorial . weakened unions a good thing as reasons for this the economist listed , above all , the turnaround accomplished by the country 's major corporations .
the newfound flexibility of germany 's usually stubborn unions has helped lower labor costs immensely and made the country more competitive than italy , the netherlands , great britain and france .
" that is a big reason why , last year , it regained its position as the world 's biggest exporter , " it wrote . the magazine gave credit to chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition government of social democrats and the green party for getting reforms underway .
his raft of labor and socio-economic reforms , called agenda 2010 , may lose him the election this september , but they have nonetheless " raised hopes that fresh impetus could set the economy on to its strongest track for years . " tough measures , like the unpopular hartz iv law that made it more difficult for germany 's 1.8 million long-term unemployed to receive benefits without actively looking for jobs , won the magazine 's approval .
" hartz iv ... has added 8 billion euros -lrb- $ 9.8 billion -rrb- to this year 's government costs , but failed to create many new jobs , " the magazine wrote .
" it has , however , made employees more fearful of the consequences of losing their jobs .
that has strengthened the hand of firms ... and weakened the power of trade unions . " bildunterschrift : germany 's unions are getting weak , and that 's a good thing , according to " the economist " chancellor : proof we 're doing things right the report raised eyebrows in germany , getting press coverage not only from business magazines , but local papers as well .
germany 's prominent frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper followed up on the economist cover with a piece examining the euphoria .
" nobody wants to believe it : germany is gaining more prominence abroad as an investment destination , " it wrote . nobody , that is , except for the chancellor .
at one point during an hour-long interview on german public television yesterday evening , schröder fished a piece of paper out of his pocket .
it was the economist 's piece . " the economist , a publication that in the past was never particularly pro-german , has a cover story ' economist cheers germany 's surprising economy ' and says that thanks to the reforms we introduced our competitiveness has grown enormously , " he said . economist : merkel needs a chance but schröder neglected to mention one thing .
though it gave schröder 's government a small amount of praise for getting the reform process started , the economist editorialists clearly hope his opponents will be the ones continuing them after the likely elections on sept .
18 .
" the commitment of the new government to further reforms will make a big difference , " they wrote .
" the politicians may not be able to control the economy , but they can certainly muck it up .
a center-right government under ms. merkel would have the advantage that her party also controls the upper-house bundesrat , making it far easier to push through legislative change .

in their midst , a young woman dressed like a secretary from a 1950 's film calmly types away on an equally old-fashioned typewriter while listening intently to the man seated opposite her .
a sign beside them reads " if i were chancellor … " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when the man finishes dictating his message to germany 's political leaders , the " secretary " hands him his postcard , complete with postage .
he twirls a wheel of rubber stamps , selects one that says " urgent , " and inks this in bright red across his card .
he then drops the card into a mailbox conveniently located just a few steps away , a look of satisfaction on his face . the scene - part political event , part art happening - causes passersby to slow their pace .
some just watch , while others get in line for a chance to have their say .
it 's all the brainchild of the woman in the red secretary 's costume , american artist and journalist sheryl oring . in the year leading up to the 2004 elections in the united states , oring travelled across her country with a similar project called " i wish to say , " typing over a thousand postcards for people who wanted to voice their concerns to president george w. bush . " the reaction in the states was so great that i thought of trying it in other countries , " says oring , who had previously worked and studied in germany and speaks fluent german . german grammar despite having a good grasp of the language , oring says she was slightly nervous about taking her " show " to germany . bildunterschrift : " i have to tell people to speak slowly because i 'm not a native speaker , and when i 'm done , i give them the chance to read it over and correct the grammar mistakes , " she laughs . but she added that being a foreigner has its advantages , as it makes people curious , and more likely to participate . " i did n't know how it would go over in germany , but people are really into doing it , " oring says .
" people have a lot of concerns about unemployment and social benefits , for example , and they 're really eager to talk about that .
here , people do n't feel the media or the politicians are listening to them , but this project gives them that .
in a way , it 's a service to people , and that 's something that 's been very gratifying . " thomas , a 42-year-old berliner , sat down with oring to tell her about his dissatisfaction with the current economic and social situation in germany .
on his postcard , he wrote to chancellor gerhard schröder of his concern that germany is moving too far in the direction of the us when it comes to labor policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wenn ich kanzler wäre … kunstaktion sheryl oring schreibmaschine " people are being forced into doing any old job , even if it is below their qualifications , just so that they 're back at work , " thomas said , adding that he appreciated oring 's project . " if you express your opinion as part of an art project , you know you wo n't have to face any repercussions , " he said .
" it 's a safe way to do it . " diverse responses while many of the postcards deal with election campaign issues such as unemployment , pensions , and education , other participants used their time at oring 's desk to air their pet peeves , or let their imaginations run wild . " i would charge a big fee for people who do n't clean up after their dogs , " wrote one disgruntled berliner . " i 'd like to be the king of berlin , " wrote another resident whose solution to the city 's problems would be to " open a big casino so everyone would be happy . " queuing up to talk with oring , eight-year-old gabriel excitedly outlined a list of laws he would pass if he were chancellor , including one that would " allow kids to play soccer everywhere . " bildunterschrift : kids get in on the act , too it 's the diversity of responses that keeps oring going .
she is bringing " if i were chancellor " to five german cities over a period of three weeks , and expects to type as many as 200 cards .
she keeps a copy of each card , and is hoping to turn them into an exhibition or a book . " i 'm always amazed at people 's answers , " she says .
" even though i 've done the show before , it never feels repetitive .
when i meet new people and hear a really moving story , that 's when i think it 's all worth it .

but experts say an outbreak in europe is only a question of time . to counter the possible spread of the bird flu virus in germany , the federal government in berlin has agreed on mandatory action to keep poultry under shelter .
the protective measure is expected to be in place by mid-september at the latest , if by then the virus has spread west of russia 's ural mountains , a high-ranking official from the ministry of consumer protection said on thursday .
the decision is the result of an summit of experts convened by the ministry .
the government is also considering intensifying airport controls of people arriving from russia to identify and isolate passengers who have contracted the disease .
the dutch agriculture ministry has already ordered all commercial poultry farmers to bring their fowl indoors by monday to prevent them from catching avian flu from wild birds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german minister for consumer protection renate künast the german consumer protection minister renate künast said on thursday she was worried about the outbreak of a deadly strain of bird flu in russia , fearing that the disease could reach western europe through migrating birds .
" we are expecting the worst , " she said .
there was a likely chance the disease could spread during the upcoming bird migration period , the minister added .
bird flu in europe only question of time world health organization experts say the bird flu virus is now endemic in parts of asia despite the slaughter of tens of millions of domestic fowl , which are able to pass the virus on to humans .
it has now been confirmed that the deadly bird flu virus - the h5n1 strain of the influenza virus - has reached russia .
it has already killed almost 60 people since sweeping through asia since 2003 .
last week the european union already banned the import of live birds and feathers from russia and kazakhstan .
but german disease watchdogs say that an outbreak of bird flu is only a matter of time .
" all experts agree that the possibility of an outbreak is larger than ever before in the past 50 years , " said reinhard kurth , director of the robert-koch-institute in berlin .
" they say - and i fully agree - that this is going to happen , but whether this year already or in the next three years remains unclear . "
virus more likely to mutate into deadly form health experts fear that the longer the virus survives , the more likely it is to mutate into a form which can pass easily between humans .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vaccination in vietnam " we are concerned that the virus infects a human that already has contracted a strain of normal influenza and this influenza will mix with this avian form , " said dick thompson , a spokesman for the world health organization .
" as a result , a new strain could be formed that the human immune system has never seen before and that would ignite a pandemic . "
on friday german disease-control experts were set to propose detailed plans to prevent an outbreak of bird flu among local bird populations and come up with ways to protect the german population .
on thursday they had criticized authorities for being unprepared to meet a possibly major health crisis .
eu countries are expected to meet next week to discuss ways of better coordinating their strategies for dealing with the illness . uwe hessler -lrb- rri -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de what is bird flu ?
primarily affecting birds , the avian influenza virus can infect humans in close contact with affected animals .
experts fear that in humans the virus can mix with the human flu virus to produce a new deadly strain .

" this morning the quota for category seven , blouses , was filled .
member states custom authorities will no longer issue import licenses for this product , " spokesman rupert krietemeyer told afp , reading a statement .
according to the eu imports database , data shows that 100 percent of a 2005 quota of nearly 24.8 million chinese blouses had been cleared for entry into the eu as of thursday evening . the commission spokesperson had further bad news for retailers : " it is likely that a number of other quotas will also be filled in the very near future , " he added .
specifically , quotas for bras , t-shirts and flax yarn were close to being met . the quotas for men 's trousers and pullovers were also already reached earlier this month , leaving millions of garments stranded at eu customs and outraging some big eu retailers awaiting deliveries . eu , china still locked in quota talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu and chinese officials have been holding talks on the quotas and brussels has said it is willing to be flexible .
eu trade commissioner peter mandelson -lrb- photo -rrb- has made it clear that he wants to negotiate with china to allow more clothing imports into the bloc , possibly by using some of 2006 quotas in 2005 . after eu textile producers urged that the quotas be implemented , eu officials are coming under fierce pressure from retailers who warn that store shelves could be bare during the key back-to-school period because they have not received some shipments . on thursday , government ministers from the netherlands , denmark , sweden and finland wrote an article in the financial times saying there was a risk of job losses and bankruptcies unless the eu eases the curbs on the imports .
this followed a letter sent to mandelson by germany 's economy minister wolfgang clement which called for a relaxation of the import restrictions . textile producers fear massive influx from china not all eu countries want the import restrictions to be relaxed .
countries with big textile industries of their own , like france , italy and spain , are worried they will suffer if chinese clothing enters the eu on a massive scale . the eu and china agreed to a broad textile trade agreement in june setting annual restrictions on 10 categories of chinese imports , which had been surging since the beginning of the year following the end of an international quota system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu trade commissioner peter mandelson , left , and his chinese counterpart bo xilai , right , toast during a signing ceremony early saturday june 11 , 2005 in shanghai , china .
the european union said friday it had reached a deal to resolve a dispute with china over a surge of chinese textile imports .
after protracted negotiations between chinese commerce minister bo xilai and mandelson in shanghai in june , china said that it would limit growth in exports of 10 textile and clothing products to the eu from between 8 to 12.5 percent a year in a bid to defuse the trade row . agreement in june rubber-stamped growth rate " china and the european union have agreed that , in the period from june 11 , 2005 to the end of 2007 , with an agreed base quantity , we will determine china 's amount of exports to europe by a growth rate of between 8 to 12.5 percent per year , " the ministry of commerce said in a statement on its web site after the end of negotiations . the eu response was to issue a statement that said that in 2008 , the eu will only apply " with restraint " paragraph 242 of china 's world trade organization accession protocol on textiles , which requires china to limit exports of textile products .
there was no further explanation . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu , china settle textiles row china said saturday it will limit growth in exports of 10 textile and clothing products to the european union to 8 to 12.5 percent a year in a bid to defuse a trade row straining ties between them .

" i thank all of you for our presence in cologne at this great gathering , in the hope that it will mark a step forward on the path towards reconciliation and unity , " said the german-born pope , formerly cardinal joseph ratzinger . by using his visit here to meet with the leaders of jewish and muslim communities , benedict has underscored a pledge made in his first speeches after his election in april that he would use his pontificate to work for christian unity and to build bridges with the other monotheistic religions . benedict 's symbolic visit to cologne 's synagogue at midday on friday will be only the second in modern history , following that of his predecessor john paul ii to rome 's synagogue 19 years ago . " while john paul ii expressed himself through gestures , pope ratzinger gives great space to words .
this pontificate will be a pontificate of concepts and of words , " vatican spokesman joaquin navarro-valls told journalists thursday in a rare public comparison of papal styles . benedict looking to build a youth following seeking to build the same kind of rapport with young people enjoyed by his charismatic predecessor , pope benedict said he would use his trip to " confirm their faith and enliven their hope " .
but his key message of the opening day of a four-day visit to the world youth day festival , though delivered warmly , was uncompromising . bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi waves from the upper deck during a boat trip at the river rhine in cologne on thursday , aug .

" i thank all of you for our presence in cologne at this great gathering , in the hope that it will mark a step forward on the path towards reconciliation and unity , " said the german-born pope , formerly cardinal joseph ratzinger . by using his visit here to meet with the leaders of jewish and muslim communities , benedict has underscored a pledge made in his first speeches after his election in april that he would use his pontificate to work for christian unity and to build bridges with the other monotheistic religions . benedict 's symbolic visit to cologne 's synagogue at midday on friday will be only the second in modern history , following that of his predecessor john paul ii to rome 's synagogue 19 years ago . " while john paul ii expressed himself through gestures , pope ratzinger gives great space to words .
this pontificate will be a pontificate of concepts and of words , " vatican spokesman joaquin navarro-valls told journalists thursday in a rare public comparison of papal styles . benedict looking to build a youth following seeking to build the same kind of rapport with young people enjoyed by his charismatic predecessor , pope benedict said he would use his trip to " confirm their faith and enliven their hope " .

in their midst , a young woman dressed like a secretary from a 1950 's film calmly types away on an equally old-fashioned typewriter while listening intently to the man seated opposite her .
a sign beside them reads " if i were chancellor … " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when the man finishes dictating his message to germany 's political leaders , the " secretary " hands him his postcard , complete with postage .
he twirls a wheel of rubber stamps , selects one that says " urgent , " and inks this in bright red across his card .
he then drops the card into a mailbox conveniently located just a few steps away , a look of satisfaction on his face . the scene - part political event , part art happening - causes passersby to slow their pace .
some just watch , while others get in line for a chance to have their say .
it 's all the brainchild of the woman in the red secretary 's costume , american artist and journalist sheryl oring . in the year leading up to the 2004 elections in the united states , oring travelled across her country with a similar project called " i wish to say , " typing over a thousand postcards for people who wanted to voice their concerns to president george w. bush . " the reaction in the states was so great that i thought of trying it in other countries , " says oring , who had previously worked and studied in germany and speaks fluent german . german grammar despite having a good grasp of the language , oring says she was slightly nervous about taking her " show " to germany . bildunterschrift : " i have to tell people to speak slowly because i 'm not a native speaker , and when i 'm done , i give them the chance to read it over and correct the grammar mistakes , " she laughs . but she added that being a foreigner has its advantages , as it makes people curious , and more likely to participate . " i did n't know how it would go over in germany , but people are really into doing it , " oring says .
" people have a lot of concerns about unemployment and social benefits , for example , and they 're really eager to talk about that .
here , people do n't feel the media or the politicians are listening to them , but this project gives them that .
in a way , it 's a service to people , and that 's something that 's been very gratifying . " thomas , a 42-year-old berliner , sat down with oring to tell her about his dissatisfaction with the current economic and social situation in germany .
on his postcard , he wrote to chancellor gerhard schröder of his concern that germany is moving too far in the direction of the us when it comes to labor policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wenn ich kanzler wäre … kunstaktion sheryl oring schreibmaschine " people are being forced into doing any old job , even if it is below their qualifications , just so that they 're back at work , " thomas said , adding that he appreciated oring 's project . " if you express your opinion as part of an art project , you know you wo n't have to face any repercussions , " he said .
" it 's a safe way to do it . " diverse responses while many of the postcards deal with election campaign issues such as unemployment , pensions , and education , other participants used their time at oring 's desk to air their pet peeves , or let their imaginations run wild . " i would charge a big fee for people who do n't clean up after their dogs , " wrote one disgruntled berliner . " i 'd like to be the king of berlin , " wrote another resident whose solution to the city 's problems would be to " open a big casino so everyone would be happy . " queuing up to talk with oring , eight-year-old gabriel excitedly outlined a list of laws he would pass if he were chancellor , including one that would " allow kids to play soccer everywhere . " bildunterschrift : kids get in on the act , too it 's the diversity of responses that keeps oring going .
she is bringing " if i were chancellor " to five german cities over a period of three weeks , and expects to type as many as 200 cards .
she keeps a copy of each card , and is hoping to turn them into an exhibition or a book . " i 'm always amazed at people 's answers , " she says .
" even though i 've done the show before , it never feels repetitive .

11 hijackers while the cell was preparing the attacks in hamburg , was convicted of being a member of a terrorist organization and sentenced to seven years in prison by a german court on friday . presiding judge ernst-rainer schudt announced the verdict of the moroccan 's year-long retrial hearing without stating the court 's reasons for the decision . support of hamburg cell leads to conviction el motassadeq was convicted on terror-related charges after the prosecution accused him of helping pay tuition and other bills for members of the hamburg cell to allow them to live as students while they plotted the attacks . prosecutors had demanded the maximum sentence of 15 years in prison for el motassadeq , but defense lawyers sought acquittal for the moroccan , who acknowledges he was close to the hijackers but insists he knew nothing of their plans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plumes of smoke pour from the world trade center buildings in new york tuesday , sept .
11 , 2001 .
el motassadeq , who looked on calmly as schudt announced the verdict , was the first man to go on trial over the terrorist attacks in new york and washington that killed more than 3,000 people .
he was found guilty and sentenced the maximum 15 years in prison in february 2003 .
but a german federal tribunal overturned the verdict last year and sent the case back to the court in the northern port city of hamburg , where three of the 19 suicide hijackers lived and studied .
attorney ladislav anisic said there was no evidence that directly linked his client to the plot and argued that motassadeq was being tried simply on guilt by association , which he said was unacceptable under the rule of law in a democracy like germany 's .
" let us not let osama bin laden win here at home by sacrificing our legal foundations , " he argued before the court .
anisic has said he will appeal any verdict other than an acquittal .
us not cooperating german observers say the prosecution 's case had been weakened by the failure of the united states to hand over more information on two top al qaeda operatives in its custody .
the federal court overturned the verdict on the grounds that the hamburg judges had not been able to hear potentially exculpatory testimony from the self-purported mastermind behind the attacks , ramzi binalshibh , and al qaeda 's suspected number three , khalid sheikh mohammed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdelghani mzoudi , left , was freed .
many think motassadeq will also be acquitted .
the us justice department provided two sets of summaries of their interrogation in which the two men reportedly said that motassadeq and fellow moroccan abdelghani mzoudi had had no involvement in the plot .
the prosecution has argued that the accounts are not credible given al qaeda training methods in counterintelligence .
but the reports and the holes in the case were enough to see mzoudi acquitted in hamburg on the same charges motassadeq is again facing .
after his release , mzoudi returned to morocco in june under threat of deportation .
perhaps in the hopes of a similar outcome to his trial , motassadeq has extended his moroccan passport and said he wished to go home as soon as possible .

11 hijackers while the cell was preparing the attacks in hamburg , was convicted of being a member of a terrorist organization and sentenced to seven years in prison by a german court on friday . presiding judge ernst-rainer schudt announced the verdict of the moroccan 's year-long retrial hearing without stating the court 's reasons for the decision . support of hamburg cell leads to conviction el motassadeq was convicted on terror-related charges after the prosecution accused him of helping pay tuition and other bills for members of the hamburg cell to allow them to live as students while they plotted the attacks . prosecutors had demanded the maximum sentence of 15 years in prison for el motassadeq , but defense lawyers sought acquittal for the moroccan , who acknowledges he was close to the hijackers but insists he knew nothing of their plans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plumes of smoke pour from the world trade center buildings in new york tuesday , sept .
11 , 2001 .
el motassadeq , who looked on calmly as schudt announced the verdict , was the first man to go on trial over the terrorist attacks in new york and washington that killed more than 3,000 people .
he was found guilty and sentenced the maximum 15 years in prison in february 2003 .
but a german federal tribunal overturned the verdict last year and sent the case back to the court in the northern port city of hamburg , where three of the 19 suicide hijackers lived and studied .
attorney ladislav anisic said there was no evidence that directly linked his client to the plot and argued that motassadeq was being tried simply on guilt by association , which he said was unacceptable under the rule of law in a democracy like germany 's .
" let us not let osama bin laden win here at home by sacrificing our legal foundations , " he argued before the court .
anisic has said he will appeal any verdict other than an acquittal .
us not cooperating german observers say the prosecution 's case had been weakened by the failure of the united states to hand over more information on two top al qaeda operatives in its custody .
the federal court overturned the verdict on the grounds that the hamburg judges had not been able to hear potentially exculpatory testimony from the self-purported mastermind behind the attacks , ramzi binalshibh , and al qaeda 's suspected number three , khalid sheikh mohammed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdelghani mzoudi , left , was freed .
many think motassadeq will also be acquitted .
the us justice department provided two sets of summaries of their interrogation in which the two men reportedly said that motassadeq and fellow moroccan abdelghani mzoudi had had no involvement in the plot .
the prosecution has argued that the accounts are not credible given al qaeda training methods in counterintelligence .
but the reports and the holes in the case were enough to see mzoudi acquitted in hamburg on the same charges motassadeq is again facing .
after his release , mzoudi returned to morocco in june under threat of deportation .
perhaps in the hopes of a similar outcome to his trial , motassadeq has extended his moroccan passport and said he wished to go home as soon as possible .

in their midst , a young woman dressed like a secretary from a 1950 's film calmly types away on an equally old-fashioned typewriter while listening intently to the man seated opposite her .
a sign beside them reads " if i were chancellor … " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when the man finishes dictating his message to germany 's political leaders , the " secretary " hands him his postcard , complete with postage .
he twirls a wheel of rubber stamps , selects one that says " urgent , " and inks this in bright red across his card .
he then drops the card into a mailbox conveniently located just a few steps away , a look of satisfaction on his face . the scene - part political event , part art happening - causes passersby to slow their pace .
some just watch , while others get in line for a chance to have their say .
it 's all the brainchild of the woman in the red secretary 's costume , american artist and journalist sheryl oring . in the year leading up to the 2004 elections in the united states , oring travelled across her country with a similar project called " i wish to say , " typing over a thousand postcards for people who wanted to voice their concerns to president george w. bush . " the reaction in the states was so great that i thought of trying it in other countries , " says oring , who had previously worked and studied in germany and speaks fluent german . german grammar despite having a good grasp of the language , oring says she was slightly nervous about taking her " show " to germany . bildunterschrift : " i have to tell people to speak slowly because i 'm not a native speaker , and when i 'm done , i give them the chance to read it over and correct the grammar mistakes , " she laughs . but she added that being a foreigner has its advantages , as it makes people curious , and more likely to participate . " i did n't know how it would go over in germany , but people are really into doing it , " oring says .
" people have a lot of concerns about unemployment and social benefits , for example , and they 're really eager to talk about that .

in a way , it 's a service to people , and that 's something that 's been very gratifying . " thomas , a 42-year-old berliner , sat down with oring to tell her about his dissatisfaction with the current economic and social situation in germany .
on his postcard , he wrote to chancellor gerhard schröder of his concern that germany is moving too far in the direction of the us when it comes to labor policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wenn ich kanzler wäre … kunstaktion sheryl oring schreibmaschine " people are being forced into doing any old job , even if it is below their qualifications , just so that they 're back at work , " thomas said , adding that he appreciated oring 's project . " if you express your opinion as part of an art project , you know you wo n't have to face any repercussions , " he said .
" it 's a safe way to do it . " diverse responses while many of the postcards deal with election campaign issues such as unemployment , pensions , and education , other participants used their time at oring 's desk to air their pet peeves , or let their imaginations run wild . " i would charge a big fee for people who do n't clean up after their dogs , " wrote one disgruntled berliner . " i 'd like to be the king of berlin , " wrote another resident whose solution to the city 's problems would be to " open a big casino so everyone would be happy . " queuing up to talk with oring , eight-year-old gabriel excitedly outlined a list of laws he would pass if he were chancellor , including one that would " allow kids to play soccer everywhere . " bildunterschrift : kids get in on the act , too it 's the diversity of responses that keeps oring going .
she is bringing " if i were chancellor " to five german cities over a period of three weeks , and expects to type as many as 200 cards .
she keeps a copy of each card , and is hoping to turn them into an exhibition or a book . " i 'm always amazed at people 's answers , " she says .
" even though i 've done the show before , it never feels repetitive .

from the outside , it looks like one of the most dynamic places in europe .
berlin is an international magnet .
under this government , the country has flourished more than people have realized .

not even economically it is as bad as people think it is .
people complain about certain kinds of cuts in social services and economic problems , but the country is fundamentally sound in comparison with other places .

i do n't think any of us have fully grasped what globalization means .
but i think that again , what 's remarkable is that germans think much worse about themselves than anyone else .

you have a sort of mirroring effect .
if people would stop being so pessimistic , a great deal would be accomplished .
east and west germans tend to expect the state to take care of everything .

who is your perso n al choice for cha n cellor ?
why ? i 'm generally happy with the way the current red-green government has proceeded .
on the whole , they have done a good job and should continue to do so .
i 'm impressed by the ways in which , under the current government , germany has taken large steps towards becoming a more cosmopolitan and less racist country . i am particularly impressed by the difference in their attititudes to the iraq war , during which schröder was willing to take a stand , while merkel assured the bush administration that the cdu would follow american policy , whatever it was .
schröder was sharply criticized for his position - not least in germany , where most people called him opportunistic - but he turned out to be right .
america needs friends who are critical , not who blindly follow whatever very controversial policies happen to be the order of the day .
both schröder and merkel will have to continue painful economic reforms , and there the differences will be small ; the significant differences between them concern foreign policy . what do you like about germa n y ? i like the growing cosmopolitanism , an interest in what people do and think all over the world .
that 's much stronger than in france , england , and the us .
i like the sense of historical interest , i like the interest in preserving good parts of the past and the interest in dealing with bad parts of it .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : world youth day 2005 german visas for the faithful germany prepares for world youth day prayer , and environmental protection tight security for pope 's youth gathering current affairs -pipe- 19.08.2005 reformers turn up heat on church großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not everyone at wyd is cheering for the pope critics have been present at world youth day , bringing up issues such as the role of women , family planning and gay rights .
there are signs that the gap between them and church leaders is narrowing . as world youth day -lrb- wyd -rrb- enters its climactic phase with the arrival of pope benedict xvi on thursday , church critics are also stepping up their activities .
a number of reform organizations from around the world have been handing out flyers and staging events in the city of cologne in an attempt to reach the young people attending the catholic festival . united under the umbrella of the " world youth day 4 all coalition " -lrb- wyd4all -rrb- , they have set up their base for the duration of the gathering in a church in the city center . while there is hardly any room given to controversial issues in the official wyd program , young believers ' response to critical questions has been enormous , says aisha taylor , program director of the us-based women 's ordination conference . " the possibility for priests to get married , the rights of gays and lesbians , more democratic participation for lay people - all these are points on which we would like to see progress , " she said . women priests unsettle leaders a particular focus of taylor 's work concerns the role of women in the church .
according to official doctrine women can not be become priests . " when seven women were ordained priests in 2002 by a dissident bishop in austria , the vatican excommunicated the women within a week or so , " taylor , 24 , said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gisela forster , left , and christine mayr-lumetzberger are two of the seven women who were ordained as priests by argentine bishop romulo braschi in 2002 in defiance of the ban of catholic church on female clergy .
at the time , it was cardinal joseph ratzinger , then head of the congregation for the doctrine of the faith and now pope benedict xvi , who lead the charge against them . yet , judging from responses from the people thronging the streets of cologne , equal rights for women in the church consistently rank among the top demands , reports taylor , who sees the demonstrative ordination of women also as a way to elicit a direct response from the vatican . " the pope is getting annoyed and knows who we are , " she said .
" but we have to use these alternative paths to make our opinions known , because the church is not a democracy and its members have no vote . " even if benedict xvi refuses to recognize women priests , in the future another pope could make a cut with the past , she says .
and the ongoing effort by reformers is having an impact , she adds : " we now have female altar service and women who work as eucharistic ministers .
and in a letter the pope , then a cardinal , made a point of the equality of men and women in public life - except in the church context . " latin american concerns in other regions of the world , such as latin america , where a large majority of the population is catholic , there is not necessarily a less critical view than in europe or north america . " the church has a lot of spiritual and political power in our part of the world , " said 25-year-old andrea ramirez from bolivia who heads the youth chapter of the " we are church " reform movement in her home country .
" but there is also strong support for the gay movement or the feminists . " " we want to show that you can be a good catholic and be gay or lesbian .
or that you can be a good catholic and use condoms , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church still has enormous influence in latin america the ongoing refusal by the vatican to soften its stance on family planning or the use of condoms is particularly detrimental to poor countries , says ramirez . " but maybe the pope has n't had enough time , yet , to properly get in touch with the very real problems of the nations of the south . " the refusal by conservative church leaders to engage in debate sometimes takes forms that amount to keeping information away from young believers , critics say . “ we have seen how nuns accompanying a group of young catholics took away from them the flyers we had just handed out to them , ” reports agnes rudnik , a spokeswoman for the gay and lesbian groups at wyd . cheer the pope , follow your conscience - no problem so is it a contradiction that young people attending wyd are welcoming the pope with overwhelming enthusiasm , yet feel strongly about a number contentious issues on which they are opposed to the pontiff , as reformers claim ? " i don ’ t think there is a contradiction when people cheer the pope and follow their conscience at the same time , ” says tobias raschke , the german spokesman for " we are church . ”
" young people feel it is their church and sincerely want the pope to understand what their concerns are . ” the critics make a strong point that they are part of the church and do consider themselves firmly rooted in the faith . " i really hope our work gives a new impetus for change to the pope , because he ’ s my religious leader after all , ” says ramirez . “ i love my faith and the catholic church , it ’ s my heritage , my tradition " , says aisha taylor . signs of change while wyd is an event that appeals to the masses , many young reformers agree that behind it there is a genuine attempt to reach out to the younger generation .
the efforts and successes of the church in tackling social problems , injustice and poverty around the world is something that draws particularly strong support from young people . one of the few events wyd organizers put on to engage young people in an open debate focused on precisely these themes called " youthhearing .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : world youth day 2005 german visas for the faithful germany prepares for world youth day prayer , and environmental protection tight security for pope 's youth gathering current affairs -pipe- 19.08.2005 reformers turn up heat on church großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not everyone at wyd is cheering for the pope critics have been present at world youth day , bringing up issues such as the role of women , family planning and gay rights .
there are signs that the gap between them and church leaders is narrowing . as world youth day -lrb- wyd -rrb- enters its climactic phase with the arrival of pope benedict xvi on thursday , church critics are also stepping up their activities .
a number of reform organizations from around the world have been handing out flyers and staging events in the city of cologne in an attempt to reach the young people attending the catholic festival . united under the umbrella of the " world youth day 4 all coalition " -lrb- wyd4all -rrb- , they have set up their base for the duration of the gathering in a church in the city center . while there is hardly any room given to controversial issues in the official wyd program , young believers ' response to critical questions has been enormous , says aisha taylor , program director of the us-based women 's ordination conference . " the possibility for priests to get married , the rights of gays and lesbians , more democratic participation for lay people - all these are points on which we would like to see progress , " she said . women priests unsettle leaders a particular focus of taylor 's work concerns the role of women in the church .
according to official doctrine women can not be become priests . " when seven women were ordained priests in 2002 by a dissident bishop in austria , the vatican excommunicated the women within a week or so , " taylor , 24 , said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gisela forster , left , and christine mayr-lumetzberger are two of the seven women who were ordained as priests by argentine bishop romulo braschi in 2002 in defiance of the ban of catholic church on female clergy .
at the time , it was cardinal joseph ratzinger , then head of the congregation for the doctrine of the faith and now pope benedict xvi , who lead the charge against them . yet , judging from responses from the people thronging the streets of cologne , equal rights for women in the church consistently rank among the top demands , reports taylor , who sees the demonstrative ordination of women also as a way to elicit a direct response from the vatican . " the pope is getting annoyed and knows who we are , " she said .
" but we have to use these alternative paths to make our opinions known , because the church is not a democracy and its members have no vote . " even if benedict xvi refuses to recognize women priests , in the future another pope could make a cut with the past , she says .
and the ongoing effort by reformers is having an impact , she adds : " we now have female altar service and women who work as eucharistic ministers .
and in a letter the pope , then a cardinal , made a point of the equality of men and women in public life - except in the church context . " latin american concerns in other regions of the world , such as latin america , where a large majority of the population is catholic , there is not necessarily a less critical view than in europe or north america . " the church has a lot of spiritual and political power in our part of the world , " said 25-year-old andrea ramirez from bolivia who heads the youth chapter of the " we are church " reform movement in her home country .
" but there is also strong support for the gay movement or the feminists . " " we want to show that you can be a good catholic and be gay or lesbian .
or that you can be a good catholic and use condoms , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church still has enormous influence in latin america the ongoing refusal by the vatican to soften its stance on family planning or the use of condoms is particularly detrimental to poor countries , says ramirez . " but maybe the pope has n't had enough time , yet , to properly get in touch with the very real problems of the nations of the south .

the positive review in " the economist " has everyone surprised - except for the chancellor . great britain 's and maybe the world 's most prominent business magazine is not known for its love affair with germany 's economic system .
the decidedly pro-business economist has in recent years enjoyed ribbing europe 's largest economy for its stagnant growth rates , high unemployment and a union strength that has led to sky-high labor costs .
all the more surprising , then , that when the german symbol , the black eagle , graced the front of this week 's magazine as a caricature , it was flexing its muscles underneath the headline " germany 's surprising economy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : really ? " some forecasters are now predicting that germany , which has for so many years disappointed on the downside , could be about to surprise on the upside , " the magazine wrote in the lead editorial . weakened unions a good thing as reasons for this the economist listed , above all , the turnaround accomplished by the country 's major corporations .
the newfound flexibility of germany 's usually stubborn unions has helped lower labor costs immensely and made the country more competitive than italy , the netherlands , great britain and france .
" that is a big reason why , last year , it regained its position as the world 's biggest exporter , " it wrote . the magazine gave credit to chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition government of social democrats and the green party for getting reforms underway .
his raft of labor and socio-economic reforms , called agenda 2010 , may lose him the election this september , but they have nonetheless " raised hopes that fresh impetus could set the economy on to its strongest track for years . " tough measures , like the unpopular hartz iv law that made it more difficult for germany 's 1.8 million long-term unemployed to receive benefits without actively looking for jobs , won the magazine 's approval .
" hartz iv ... has added 8 billion euros -lrb- $ 9.8 billion -rrb- to this year 's government costs , but failed to create many new jobs , " the magazine wrote .
" it has , however , made employees more fearful of the consequences of losing their jobs .
that has strengthened the hand of firms ... and weakened the power of trade unions . " bildunterschrift : germany 's unions are getting weak , and that 's a good thing , according to " the economist " chancellor : proof we 're doing things right the report raised eyebrows in germany , getting press coverage not only from business magazines , but local papers as well .
germany 's prominent frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper followed up on the economist cover with a piece examining the euphoria .
" nobody wants to believe it : germany is gaining more prominence abroad as an investment destination , " it wrote . nobody , that is , except for the chancellor .
at one point during an hour-long interview on german public television yesterday evening , schröder fished a piece of paper out of his pocket .
it was the economist 's piece . " the economist , a publication that in the past was never particularly pro-german , has a cover story ' economist cheers germany 's surprising economy ' and says that thanks to the reforms we introduced our competitiveness has grown enormously , " he said . economist : merkel needs a chance but schröder neglected to mention one thing .
though it gave schröder 's government a small amount of praise for getting the reform process started , the economist editorialists clearly hope his opponents will be the ones continuing them after the likely elections on sept .
18 .
" the commitment of the new government to further reforms will make a big difference , " they wrote .
" the politicians may not be able to control the economy , but they can certainly muck it up .
a center-right government under ms. merkel would have the advantage that her party also controls the upper-house bundesrat , making it far easier to push through legislative change .

there are signs that the gap between them and church leaders is narrowing . as world youth day -lrb- wyd -rrb- enters its climactic phase with the arrival of pope benedict xvi on thursday , church critics are also stepping up their activities .
a number of reform organizations from around the world have been handing out flyers and staging events in the city of cologne in an attempt to reach the young people attending the catholic festival . united under the umbrella of the " world youth day 4 all coalition " -lrb- wyd4all -rrb- , they have set up their base for the duration of the gathering in a church in the city center . while there is hardly any room given to controversial issues in the official wyd program , young believers ' response to critical questions has been enormous , says aisha taylor , program director of the us-based women 's ordination conference . " the possibility for priests to get married , the rights of gays and lesbians , more democratic participation for lay people - all these are points on which we would like to see progress , " she said . women priests unsettle leaders a particular focus of taylor 's work concerns the role of women in the church .
according to official doctrine women can not be become priests . " when seven women were ordained priests in 2002 by a dissident bishop in austria , the vatican excommunicated the women within a week or so , " taylor , 24 , said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gisela forster , left , and christine mayr-lumetzberger are two of the seven women who were ordained as priests by argentine bishop romulo braschi in 2002 in defiance of the ban of catholic church on female clergy .
at the time , it was cardinal joseph ratzinger , then head of the congregation for the doctrine of the faith and now pope benedict xvi , who lead the charge against them . yet , judging from responses from the people thronging the streets of cologne , equal rights for women in the church consistently rank among the top demands , reports taylor , who sees the demonstrative ordination of women also as a way to elicit a direct response from the vatican . " the pope is getting annoyed and knows who we are , " she said .
" but we have to use these alternative paths to make our opinions known , because the church is not a democracy and its members have no vote . " even if benedict xvi refuses to recognize women priests , in the future another pope could make a cut with the past , she says .
and the ongoing effort by reformers is having an impact , she adds : " we now have female altar service and women who work as eucharistic ministers .
and in a letter the pope , then a cardinal , made a point of the equality of men and women in public life - except in the church context . " latin american concerns in other regions of the world , such as latin america , where a large majority of the population is catholic , there is not necessarily a less critical view than in europe or north america . " the church has a lot of spiritual and political power in our part of the world , " said 25-year-old andrea ramirez from bolivia who heads the youth chapter of the " we are church " reform movement in her home country .
" but there is also strong support for the gay movement or the feminists . " " we want to show that you can be a good catholic and be gay or lesbian .
or that you can be a good catholic and use condoms , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church still has enormous influence in latin america the ongoing refusal by the vatican to soften its stance on family planning or the use of condoms is particularly detrimental to poor countries , says ramirez . " but maybe the pope has n't had enough time , yet , to properly get in touch with the very real problems of the nations of the south . " the refusal by conservative church leaders to engage in debate sometimes takes forms that amount to keeping information away from young believers , critics say . “ we have seen how nuns accompanying a group of young catholics took away from them the flyers we had just handed out to them , ” reports agnes rudnik , a spokeswoman for the gay and lesbian groups at wyd . cheer the pope , follow your conscience - no problem so is it a contradiction that young people attending wyd are welcoming the pope with overwhelming enthusiasm , yet feel strongly about a number contentious issues on which they are opposed to the pontiff , as reformers claim ? " i don ’ t think there is a contradiction when people cheer the pope and follow their conscience at the same time , ” says tobias raschke , the german spokesman for " we are church . ”
" young people feel it is their church and sincerely want the pope to understand what their concerns are . ” the critics make a strong point that they are part of the church and do consider themselves firmly rooted in the faith . " i really hope our work gives a new impetus for change to the pope , because he ’ s my religious leader after all , ” says ramirez . “ i love my faith and the catholic church , it ’ s my heritage , my tradition " , says aisha taylor . signs of change while wyd is an event that appeals to the masses , many young reformers agree that behind it there is a genuine attempt to reach out to the younger generation .
the efforts and successes of the church in tackling social problems , injustice and poverty around the world is something that draws particularly strong support from young people . one of the few events wyd organizers put on to engage young people in an open debate focused on precisely these themes called " youthhearing . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal oscar rodriguez archbishop of tegucicalpa -lrb- honduras -rrb- held at a community center in cologne on wednesday afternoon , there was rapturous applause from the floor when critics brought up the ban on condom use , which in their view undermines the fight against hiv / aids in poor countries . in their response , german bishop reinhard marx and cardinal oscar rodriguez from honduras stopped just short of actively endorsing condoms , but acknowledged that they can play an important role . a revolution ?

" i thank all of you for our presence in cologne at this great gathering , in the hope that it will mark a step forward on the path towards reconciliation and unity , " said the german-born pope , formerly cardinal joseph ratzinger . by using his visit here to meet with the leaders of jewish and muslim communities , benedict has underscored a pledge made in his first speeches after his election in april that he would use his pontificate to work for christian unity and to build bridges with the other monotheistic religions . benedict 's symbolic visit to cologne 's synagogue at midday on friday will be only the second in modern history , following that of his predecessor john paul ii to rome 's synagogue 19 years ago . " while john paul ii expressed himself through gestures , pope ratzinger gives great space to words .
this pontificate will be a pontificate of concepts and of words , " vatican spokesman joaquin navarro-valls told journalists thursday in a rare public comparison of papal styles . benedict looking to build a youth following seeking to build the same kind of rapport with young people enjoyed by his charismatic predecessor , pope benedict said he would use his trip to " confirm their faith and enliven their hope " .

his predecessor john paul ii visited the rome synagogue in 1986 . since taking over as the head of the catholic church , the new pope has made clear his intention to maintain a dialogue with jewish leaders such as was nurtured by pope john paul ii .
the late pontiff was much admired in israel for his efforts to promote reconciliation between the vatican and the jewish people . pope benedict xvi has remained true to his word .
his visit to the synagogue in cologne , which is home to the oldest jewish community in germany , is widely viewed as a deeply symbolic gesture , which underlines his determination to foster reconciliation between different faiths at a time of stresses and strains on all sides . bildunterschrift : warm welcome for the pope 's homecoming upon his arrival in germany for world youth day celebrations , the new pope spoke of the importance of planned meetings with jews and muslims . later he said he hoped the presence in cologne of representatives of different christian denominations and those from different religions would " mark a step forward on the path towards reconciliation and unity . " historic visit the president of the central council of jews in germany , paul spiegel , has welcomed the pope 's planned visit , describing it as an " historic event . "

11 terror attacks in the united states , was convicted by a german court on friday and sentenced to seven years in prison . mounir el motassadeq , the man suspected of helping the sept .
11 hijackers while the cell was preparing the attacks in hamburg , was convicted of being a member of a terrorist organization and sentenced to seven years in prison by a german court on friday . presiding judge ernst-rainer schudt announced the verdict of the moroccan 's year-long retrial hearing without stating the court 's reasons for the decision . support of hamburg cell leads to conviction el motassadeq was convicted on terror-related charges after the prosecution accused him of helping pay tuition and other bills for members of the hamburg cell to allow them to live as students while they plotted the attacks . prosecutors had demanded the maximum sentence of 15 years in prison for el motassadeq , but defense lawyers sought acquittal for the moroccan , who acknowledges he was close to the hijackers but insists he knew nothing of their plans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plumes of smoke pour from the world trade center buildings in new york tuesday , sept .
11 , 2001 .
el motassadeq , who looked on calmly as schudt announced the verdict , was the first man to go on trial over the terrorist attacks in new york and washington that killed more than 3,000 people .
he was found guilty and sentenced the maximum 15 years in prison in february 2003 .
but a german federal tribunal overturned the verdict last year and sent the case back to the court in the northern port city of hamburg , where three of the 19 suicide hijackers lived and studied .
attorney ladislav anisic said there was no evidence that directly linked his client to the plot and argued that motassadeq was being tried simply on guilt by association , which he said was unacceptable under the rule of law in a democracy like germany 's .
" let us not let osama bin laden win here at home by sacrificing our legal foundations , " he argued before the court .
anisic has said he will appeal any verdict other than an acquittal .
us not cooperating german observers say the prosecution 's case had been weakened by the failure of the united states to hand over more information on two top al qaeda operatives in its custody .
the federal court overturned the verdict on the grounds that the hamburg judges had not been able to hear potentially exculpatory testimony from the self-purported mastermind behind the attacks , ramzi binalshibh , and al qaeda 's suspected number three , khalid sheikh mohammed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdelghani mzoudi , left , was freed .
many think motassadeq will also be acquitted .
the us justice department provided two sets of summaries of their interrogation in which the two men reportedly said that motassadeq and fellow moroccan abdelghani mzoudi had had no involvement in the plot .
the prosecution has argued that the accounts are not credible given al qaeda training methods in counterintelligence .
but the reports and the holes in the case were enough to see mzoudi acquitted in hamburg on the same charges motassadeq is again facing .
after his release , mzoudi returned to morocco in june under threat of deportation .
perhaps in the hopes of a similar outcome to his trial , motassadeq has extended his moroccan passport and said he wished to go home as soon as possible .

in their midst , a young woman dressed like a secretary from a 1950 's film calmly types away on an equally old-fashioned typewriter while listening intently to the man seated opposite her .
a sign beside them reads " if i were chancellor … " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when the man finishes dictating his message to germany 's political leaders , the " secretary " hands him his postcard , complete with postage .
he twirls a wheel of rubber stamps , selects one that says " urgent , " and inks this in bright red across his card .
he then drops the card into a mailbox conveniently located just a few steps away , a look of satisfaction on his face . the scene - part political event , part art happening - causes passersby to slow their pace .
some just watch , while others get in line for a chance to have their say .
it 's all the brainchild of the woman in the red secretary 's costume , american artist and journalist sheryl oring . in the year leading up to the 2004 elections in the united states , oring travelled across her country with a similar project called " i wish to say , " typing over a thousand postcards for people who wanted to voice their concerns to president george w. bush . " the reaction in the states was so great that i thought of trying it in other countries , " says oring , who had previously worked and studied in germany and speaks fluent german . german grammar despite having a good grasp of the language , oring says she was slightly nervous about taking her " show " to germany . bildunterschrift : " i have to tell people to speak slowly because i 'm not a native speaker , and when i 'm done , i give them the chance to read it over and correct the grammar mistakes , " she laughs . but she added that being a foreigner has its advantages , as it makes people curious , and more likely to participate . " i did n't know how it would go over in germany , but people are really into doing it , " oring says .
" people have a lot of concerns about unemployment and social benefits , for example , and they 're really eager to talk about that .

the positive review in " the economist " has everyone surprised - except for the chancellor . great britain 's and maybe the world 's most prominent business magazine is not known for its love affair with germany 's economic system .
the decidedly pro-business economist has in recent years enjoyed ribbing europe 's largest economy for its stagnant growth rates , high unemployment and a union strength that has led to sky-high labor costs .
all the more surprising , then , that when the german symbol , the black eagle , graced the front of this week 's magazine as a caricature , it was flexing its muscles underneath the headline " germany 's surprising economy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : really ? " some forecasters are now predicting that germany , which has for so many years disappointed on the downside , could be about to surprise on the upside , " the magazine wrote in the lead editorial . weakened unions a good thing as reasons for this the economist listed , above all , the turnaround accomplished by the country 's major corporations .
the newfound flexibility of germany 's usually stubborn unions has helped lower labor costs immensely and made the country more competitive than italy , the netherlands , great britain and france .
" that is a big reason why , last year , it regained its position as the world 's biggest exporter , " it wrote . the magazine gave credit to chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition government of social democrats and the green party for getting reforms underway .
his raft of labor and socio-economic reforms , called agenda 2010 , may lose him the election this september , but they have nonetheless " raised hopes that fresh impetus could set the economy on to its strongest track for years . " tough measures , like the unpopular hartz iv law that made it more difficult for germany 's 1.8 million long-term unemployed to receive benefits without actively looking for jobs , won the magazine 's approval .
" hartz iv ... has added 8 billion euros -lrb- $ 9.8 billion -rrb- to this year 's government costs , but failed to create many new jobs , " the magazine wrote .
" it has , however , made employees more fearful of the consequences of losing their jobs .
that has strengthened the hand of firms ... and weakened the power of trade unions . " bildunterschrift : germany 's unions are getting weak , and that 's a good thing , according to " the economist " chancellor : proof we 're doing things right the report raised eyebrows in germany , getting press coverage not only from business magazines , but local papers as well .
germany 's prominent frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper followed up on the economist cover with a piece examining the euphoria .
" nobody wants to believe it : germany is gaining more prominence abroad as an investment destination , " it wrote . nobody , that is , except for the chancellor .
at one point during an hour-long interview on german public television yesterday evening , schröder fished a piece of paper out of his pocket .
it was the economist 's piece . " the economist , a publication that in the past was never particularly pro-german , has a cover story ' economist cheers germany 's surprising economy ' and says that thanks to the reforms we introduced our competitiveness has grown enormously , " he said . economist : merkel needs a chance but schröder neglected to mention one thing .
though it gave schröder 's government a small amount of praise for getting the reform process started , the economist editorialists clearly hope his opponents will be the ones continuing them after the likely elections on sept .
18 .
" the commitment of the new government to further reforms will make a big difference , " they wrote .
" the politicians may not be able to control the economy , but they can certainly muck it up .
a center-right government under ms. merkel would have the advantage that her party also controls the upper-house bundesrat , making it far easier to push through legislative change .

but experts say an outbreak in europe is only a question of time . to counter the possible spread of the bird flu virus in germany , the federal government in berlin has agreed on mandatory action to keep poultry under shelter .
the protective measure is expected to be in place by mid-september at the latest , if by then the virus has spread west of russia 's ural mountains , a high-ranking official from the ministry of consumer protection said on thursday .
the decision is the result of an summit of experts convened by the ministry .
the government is also considering intensifying airport controls of people arriving from russia to identify and isolate passengers who have contracted the disease .
the dutch agriculture ministry has already ordered all commercial poultry farmers to bring their fowl indoors by monday to prevent them from catching avian flu from wild birds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german minister for consumer protection renate künast the german consumer protection minister renate künast said on thursday she was worried about the outbreak of a deadly strain of bird flu in russia , fearing that the disease could reach western europe through migrating birds .
" we are expecting the worst , " she said .
there was a likely chance the disease could spread during the upcoming bird migration period , the minister added .
bird flu in europe only question of time world health organization experts say the bird flu virus is now endemic in parts of asia despite the slaughter of tens of millions of domestic fowl , which are able to pass the virus on to humans .
it has now been confirmed that the deadly bird flu virus - the h5n1 strain of the influenza virus - has reached russia .
it has already killed almost 60 people since sweeping through asia since 2003 .
last week the european union already banned the import of live birds and feathers from russia and kazakhstan .
but german disease watchdogs say that an outbreak of bird flu is only a matter of time .
" all experts agree that the possibility of an outbreak is larger than ever before in the past 50 years , " said reinhard kurth , director of the robert-koch-institute in berlin .
" they say - and i fully agree - that this is going to happen , but whether this year already or in the next three years remains unclear . "
virus more likely to mutate into deadly form health experts fear that the longer the virus survives , the more likely it is to mutate into a form which can pass easily between humans .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vaccination in vietnam " we are concerned that the virus infects a human that already has contracted a strain of normal influenza and this influenza will mix with this avian form , " said dick thompson , a spokesman for the world health organization .
" as a result , a new strain could be formed that the human immune system has never seen before and that would ignite a pandemic . "
on friday german disease-control experts were set to propose detailed plans to prevent an outbreak of bird flu among local bird populations and come up with ways to protect the german population .
on thursday they had criticized authorities for being unprepared to meet a possibly major health crisis .
eu countries are expected to meet next week to discuss ways of better coordinating their strategies for dealing with the illness . uwe hessler -lrb- rri -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de what is bird flu ?

in their midst , a young woman dressed like a secretary from a 1950 's film calmly types away on an equally old-fashioned typewriter while listening intently to the man seated opposite her .
a sign beside them reads " if i were chancellor … " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when the man finishes dictating his message to germany 's political leaders , the " secretary " hands him his postcard , complete with postage .
he twirls a wheel of rubber stamps , selects one that says " urgent , " and inks this in bright red across his card .
he then drops the card into a mailbox conveniently located just a few steps away , a look of satisfaction on his face . the scene - part political event , part art happening - causes passersby to slow their pace .

" it 's a safe way to do it . " diverse responses while many of the postcards deal with election campaign issues such as unemployment , pensions , and education , other participants used their time at oring 's desk to air their pet peeves , or let their imaginations run wild .

" i 'd like to be the king of berlin , " wrote another resident whose solution to the city 's problems would be to " open a big casino so everyone would be happy .

she is bringing " if i were chancellor " to five german cities over a period of three weeks , and expects to type as many as 200 cards .

in their midst , a young woman dressed like a secretary from a 1950 's film calmly types away on an equally old-fashioned typewriter while listening intently to the man seated opposite her .
a sign beside them reads " if i were chancellor … " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when the man finishes dictating his message to germany 's political leaders , the " secretary " hands him his postcard , complete with postage .
he twirls a wheel of rubber stamps , selects one that says " urgent , " and inks this in bright red across his card .
he then drops the card into a mailbox conveniently located just a few steps away , a look of satisfaction on his face . the scene - part political event , part art happening - causes passersby to slow their pace .
some just watch , while others get in line for a chance to have their say .
it 's all the brainchild of the woman in the red secretary 's costume , american artist and journalist sheryl oring . in the year leading up to the 2004 elections in the united states , oring travelled across her country with a similar project called " i wish to say , " typing over a thousand postcards for people who wanted to voice their concerns to president george w. bush . " the reaction in the states was so great that i thought of trying it in other countries , " says oring , who had previously worked and studied in germany and speaks fluent german . german grammar despite having a good grasp of the language , oring says she was slightly nervous about taking her " show " to germany . bildunterschrift : " i have to tell people to speak slowly because i 'm not a native speaker , and when i 'm done , i give them the chance to read it over and correct the grammar mistakes , " she laughs . but she added that being a foreigner has its advantages , as it makes people curious , and more likely to participate . " i did n't know how it would go over in germany , but people are really into doing it , " oring says .
" people have a lot of concerns about unemployment and social benefits , for example , and they 're really eager to talk about that .
here , people do n't feel the media or the politicians are listening to them , but this project gives them that .
in a way , it 's a service to people , and that 's something that 's been very gratifying . " thomas , a 42-year-old berliner , sat down with oring to tell her about his dissatisfaction with the current economic and social situation in germany .
on his postcard , he wrote to chancellor gerhard schröder of his concern that germany is moving too far in the direction of the us when it comes to labor policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wenn ich kanzler wäre … kunstaktion sheryl oring schreibmaschine " people are being forced into doing any old job , even if it is below their qualifications , just so that they 're back at work , " thomas said , adding that he appreciated oring 's project . " if you express your opinion as part of an art project , you know you wo n't have to face any repercussions , " he said .
" it 's a safe way to do it . " diverse responses while many of the postcards deal with election campaign issues such as unemployment , pensions , and education , other participants used their time at oring 's desk to air their pet peeves , or let their imaginations run wild . " i would charge a big fee for people who do n't clean up after their dogs , " wrote one disgruntled berliner . " i 'd like to be the king of berlin , " wrote another resident whose solution to the city 's problems would be to " open a big casino so everyone would be happy . " queuing up to talk with oring , eight-year-old gabriel excitedly outlined a list of laws he would pass if he were chancellor , including one that would " allow kids to play soccer everywhere . " bildunterschrift : kids get in on the act , too it 's the diversity of responses that keeps oring going .
she is bringing " if i were chancellor " to five german cities over a period of three weeks , and expects to type as many as 200 cards .
she keeps a copy of each card , and is hoping to turn them into an exhibition or a book . " i 'm always amazed at people 's answers , " she says .

his predecessor john paul ii visited the rome synagogue in 1986 . since taking over as the head of the catholic church , the new pope has made clear his intention to maintain a dialogue with jewish leaders such as was nurtured by pope john paul ii .
the late pontiff was much admired in israel for his efforts to promote reconciliation between the vatican and the jewish people . pope benedict xvi has remained true to his word .
his visit to the synagogue in cologne , which is home to the oldest jewish community in germany , is widely viewed as a deeply symbolic gesture , which underlines his determination to foster reconciliation between different faiths at a time of stresses and strains on all sides . bildunterschrift : warm welcome for the pope 's homecoming upon his arrival in germany for world youth day celebrations , the new pope spoke of the importance of planned meetings with jews and muslims . later he said he hoped the presence in cologne of representatives of different christian denominations and those from different religions would " mark a step forward on the path towards reconciliation and unity .

speaking on deutschlandradio , he said he hoped the pope would place the emphasis on a mutual religious foundation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how much can he achieve ?
but jubilation about the visit has not poured from all corners , with some suggestions from the jewish community in lower saxony , that the visit to the synagogue was not the same as meeting with jewish representatives , such as john paul ii did on his three visits to germany . the synagogue visit will be followed by talks with muslim leaders on saturday , signifying the pope 's commitment to dialogue with other religions during a summer scarred by islamic terrorist violence with bombings in london and egypt and continued violence in the middle east . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cologne : germany 's oldest jewish community the jewish community in cologne is the oldest in germany , with a history which stretches back 2000 years .

11 hijackers while the cell was preparing the attacks in hamburg , was convicted of being a member of a terrorist organization and sentenced to seven years in prison by a german court on friday . presiding judge ernst-rainer schudt announced the verdict of the moroccan 's year-long retrial hearing without stating the court 's reasons for the decision . support of hamburg cell leads to conviction el motassadeq was convicted on terror-related charges after the prosecution accused him of helping pay tuition and other bills for members of the hamburg cell to allow them to live as students while they plotted the attacks . prosecutors had demanded the maximum sentence of 15 years in prison for el motassadeq , but defense lawyers sought acquittal for the moroccan , who acknowledges he was close to the hijackers but insists he knew nothing of their plans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plumes of smoke pour from the world trade center buildings in new york tuesday , sept .
11 , 2001 .
el motassadeq , who looked on calmly as schudt announced the verdict , was the first man to go on trial over the terrorist attacks in new york and washington that killed more than 3,000 people .
he was found guilty and sentenced the maximum 15 years in prison in february 2003 .
but a german federal tribunal overturned the verdict last year and sent the case back to the court in the northern port city of hamburg , where three of the 19 suicide hijackers lived and studied .
attorney ladislav anisic said there was no evidence that directly linked his client to the plot and argued that motassadeq was being tried simply on guilt by association , which he said was unacceptable under the rule of law in a democracy like germany 's .
" let us not let osama bin laden win here at home by sacrificing our legal foundations , " he argued before the court .
anisic has said he will appeal any verdict other than an acquittal .
us not cooperating german observers say the prosecution 's case had been weakened by the failure of the united states to hand over more information on two top al qaeda operatives in its custody .
the federal court overturned the verdict on the grounds that the hamburg judges had not been able to hear potentially exculpatory testimony from the self-purported mastermind behind the attacks , ramzi binalshibh , and al qaeda 's suspected number three , khalid sheikh mohammed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdelghani mzoudi , left , was freed .
many think motassadeq will also be acquitted .
the us justice department provided two sets of summaries of their interrogation in which the two men reportedly said that motassadeq and fellow moroccan abdelghani mzoudi had had no involvement in the plot .
the prosecution has argued that the accounts are not credible given al qaeda training methods in counterintelligence .
but the reports and the holes in the case were enough to see mzoudi acquitted in hamburg on the same charges motassadeq is again facing .
after his release , mzoudi returned to morocco in june under threat of deportation .
perhaps in the hopes of a similar outcome to his trial , motassadeq has extended his moroccan passport and said he wished to go home as soon as possible .

but a german federal tribunal overturned the verdict last year and sent the case back to the court in the northern port city of hamburg , where three of the 19 suicide hijackers lived and studied .
attorney ladislav anisic said there was no evidence that directly linked his client to the plot and argued that motassadeq was being tried simply on guilt by association , which he said was unacceptable under the rule of law in a democracy like germany 's .
" let us not let osama bin laden win here at home by sacrificing our legal foundations , " he argued before the court .
anisic has said he will appeal any verdict other than an acquittal .
us not cooperating german observers say the prosecution 's case had been weakened by the failure of the united states to hand over more information on two top al qaeda operatives in its custody .
the federal court overturned the verdict on the grounds that the hamburg judges had not been able to hear potentially exculpatory testimony from the self-purported mastermind behind the attacks , ramzi binalshibh , and al qaeda 's suspected number three , khalid sheikh mohammed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdelghani mzoudi , left , was freed .
many think motassadeq will also be acquitted .
the us justice department provided two sets of summaries of their interrogation in which the two men reportedly said that motassadeq and fellow moroccan abdelghani mzoudi had had no involvement in the plot .
the prosecution has argued that the accounts are not credible given al qaeda training methods in counterintelligence .
but the reports and the holes in the case were enough to see mzoudi acquitted in hamburg on the same charges motassadeq is again facing .
after his release , mzoudi returned to morocco in june under threat of deportation .
perhaps in the hopes of a similar outcome to his trial , motassadeq has extended his moroccan passport and said he wished to go home as soon as possible .
after 65 hearings and 112 witnesses during the retrial alone , which began one year ago , a not guilty verdict would have been a humiliating blow to federal prosecutors . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb / nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de 9/11 suspect trial resumes after delay a moroccan student being retried over involvement in the september 11 , 2001 attacks in new york and washington , provided " active support " to the suicide pilots , the federal prosecutor told a german court on monday .

pope benedict 's visit will add another chapter to the tale of highs and lows , religion , tragedy and rebirth . when the jews first came to cologne in the wake of the roman legions , they were taken by the lush green and fertile land of the rhine valley .
so much so , that they decided to stay and found what is now the oldest jewish community north of the alps .
the first official mention of the community is in a decree from king constantine in 321 ad , granting them membership in the city council .
although cologne is now known for it ’ s cathedral and catholic traditions , back then it was considered the jerusalem of the north . the city 's jewish community struggled on through the centuries as empires , from the romans to the huns , the franks to the ottonians and the germans rose and fell around them .
although the community often played an active role in helping to shape the empires , it was not free from the persecution , pogroms and plagues which characterized the times . short-lived religious freedom discrimination under the rule of emperors , kings and bishops was rife , and it was only when french revolutionary troops occupied the city in 1792 that cologne 's jews received civil rights and religious freedom .
but that freedom did n't last . the nazis ended nearly two millennia of jewish life in cologne .
although some were lucky enough to escape in time , some 11,000 of the city 's jews were deported and murdered at the hands of the hitler regime . rebuilding the community bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city of cologne sometimes the city invites jews who fled the nazis , to come and visit the place where they used to live .
otto spier , who now lives in israel , recently returned to cologne for the first time in more than 60 years . " the view of cologne floats before my eyes again .
what ’ s surprising is that you still have a relationship to your city of birth and that despite everything that ’ s happened , there ’ s still a bond to the things that formed you in your youth , " he said . today , the immigration of jews from the former soviet union means that cologne is once again home to one of germany ’ s largest jewish communities . kirsten serup-bilfeldt -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german pope promises dialogue with jews as pope benedict xvi continued to settle into his role as the new leader of the catholic church , he vowed to promote dialogue with jews as part of an emphasis on interfaith issues .

their goal : to be considered a normal part of society .

" i was extremely impressed by what he said and how he said it .
he condemned the crimes of the nazis without any ifs and buts , " spiegel told germany 's ard television . during only the second visit to a synagogue by a pope in the modern history of the catholic church , the pope described the extermination of six million jews by the nazis as an " unimaginable crime . " spiegel , the president of the central council of jews in germany , said at a news conference later that he welcomed the pope 's call for jews and christians to work more closely together to overcome their sometimes fractious relationship . he added he was " particularly impressed that he said the roots of christianity lie in judaism . " benedict xvi , who served briefly in the hitler youth during the war when membership of the nazi organization was compulsory , paused to pray at a memorial to the six million jews killed in the holocaust as he began the landmark visit . speaking in the synagogue which was destroyed in the anti-jewish kristallnacht attacks in 1938 and rebuilt in 1959 , he called the holocaust " this unspeakable and previously unimaginable crime . " pope warns of new threats bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " in the 20th century , in the darkest period of german and european history , an insane racist ideology , born of neo-paganism , gave rise to the attempt , planned and systematically carried out by the regime , to exterminate european jewry , " he said . the pope warned that new threats of racism and anti-semitism were always lurking .
" it is a particularly important task , since today , sadly , we are witnessing the rise of new signs of anti-semitism and various forms of a general hostility towards foreigners , " he said . " how can we fail to see in this a reason for concern and vigilance ?
the catholic church is committed - i reaffirm this again today - to tolerance , respect , friendship and peace between all peoples , cultures and religions , " he said . in his speech to jewish leaders , benedict also referred to john paul ii , saying that " in considering the jewish roots of christianity , my venerable predecessor , quoting a statement by the german bishops , affirmed that ' whoever meets jesus christ meets judaism ' . " jewish leader calls on holocaust files to be opened during the pope 's visit , a leader of germany 's jewish community called on the pope to fully open the vatican 's archives on the holocaust . in a speech welcoming the 78-year-old german-born pope , abraham lehrer called on the pope to " fully open " the archives , reminding him that as the former head of the vatican congregation for the doctrine of the faith , he had helped release some of the documents they contained for public scrutiny in 1998 . lehrer said he would welcome such a move as a " further sign " of the vatican 's goodwill towards the jewish community and allow both sides to continue " peaceful and critical " examination of the history of their troubled relations . " as leader of the catholic church , you have a special responsibility .
your actions serve as a model for the church , " lehrer told the pope . the archives contain diplomatic correspondence and church documents which could throw light on the degree of vatican knowledge of nazi efforts to deport and exterminate europe 's jews . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope pius xii jewish groups have strongly opposed plans set in motion by benedict 's predecessor john paul ii to elevate wartime pope pius xii -lrb- photo -rrb- to sainthood , claiming he did little or nothing to prevent jews being deported . lehrer praised benedict xvi , who succeeded john paul ii in april , as a " builder of bridges between religions , " adding that his visit was " an extraordinary event of great political and religious significance . " the head of the german bishops ' conference , cardinal karl lehmann , acknowledged at a news conference later that part of the archives was already open " but we must continue to work to open the archives of the pius xii period .

pope benedict xvi on friday became the second pope to visit a synagogue , stopping to pray and remember holocaust victims with cologne 's jewish community .
earlier in the day the pope met with german president horst köhler , adding a political touch to a day dominated by the highly symbolic visit to the synagogue and talks with protestants . after his jubilant reception thursday , when around 400,000 young catholics welcomed him back to his native country , benedict 's agenda on the second day of his visit began with closed-door talks at the presidential villa in nearby bonn before moving on to the religious meetings in cologne . benedict waved to a small crowd outside the villa hammerschmidt , the presidential residence in the former german capital , and shook hands with children after the meeting . " this world youth day shows that catholics are not a minority but come from all around the world , " köhler told journalists before the pope arrived .
" it is good and it will do good for protestants as well , " said köhler , a protestant . about half of the christians in germany , home of martin luther 's reformation , are protestant . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german pope visits synagogue while in cologne for world youth day , pope benedict xvi makes history as the second catholic leader to visit a jewish place of worship .

" jewish leader calls on holocaust files to be opened during the pope 's visit , a leader of germany 's jewish community called on the pope to fully open the vatican 's archives on the holocaust . in a speech welcoming the 78-year-old german-born pope , abraham lehrer called on the pope to " fully open " the archives , reminding him that as the former head of the vatican congregation for the doctrine of the faith , he had helped release some of the documents they contained for public scrutiny in 1998 . lehrer said he would welcome such a move as a " further sign " of the vatican 's goodwill towards the jewish community and allow both sides to continue " peaceful and critical " examination of the history of their troubled relations . " as leader of the catholic church , you have a special responsibility .
your actions serve as a model for the church , " lehrer told the pope . the archives contain diplomatic correspondence and church documents which could throw light on the degree of vatican knowledge of nazi efforts to deport and exterminate europe 's jews . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope pius xii jewish groups have strongly opposed plans set in motion by benedict 's predecessor john paul ii to elevate wartime pope pius xii -lrb- photo -rrb- to sainthood , claiming he did little or nothing to prevent jews being deported . lehrer praised benedict xvi , who succeeded john paul ii in april , as a " builder of bridges between religions , " adding that his visit was " an extraordinary event of great political and religious significance . " the head of the german bishops ' conference , cardinal karl lehmann , acknowledged at a news conference later that part of the archives was already open " but we must continue to work to open the archives of the pius xii period .

pope benedict xvi on friday became the second pope to visit a synagogue , stopping to pray and remember holocaust victims with cologne 's jewish community .
earlier in the day the pope met with german president horst köhler , adding a political touch to a day dominated by the highly symbolic visit to the synagogue and talks with protestants . after his jubilant reception thursday , when around 400,000 young catholics welcomed him back to his native country , benedict 's agenda on the second day of his visit began with closed-door talks at the presidential villa in nearby bonn before moving on to the religious meetings in cologne . benedict waved to a small crowd outside the villa hammerschmidt , the presidential residence in the former german capital , and shook hands with children after the meeting . " this world youth day shows that catholics are not a minority but come from all around the world , " köhler told journalists before the pope arrived .
" it is good and it will do good for protestants as well , " said köhler , a protestant . about half of the christians in germany , home of martin luther 's reformation , are protestant . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german pope visits synagogue while in cologne for world youth day , pope benedict xvi makes history as the second catholic leader to visit a jewish place of worship .

pope benedict 's visit will add another chapter to the tale of highs and lows , religion , tragedy and rebirth . when the jews first came to cologne in the wake of the roman legions , they were taken by the lush green and fertile land of the rhine valley .
so much so , that they decided to stay and found what is now the oldest jewish community north of the alps .
the first official mention of the community is in a decree from king constantine in 321 ad , granting them membership in the city council .
although cologne is now known for it ’ s cathedral and catholic traditions , back then it was considered the jerusalem of the north . the city 's jewish community struggled on through the centuries as empires , from the romans to the huns , the franks to the ottonians and the germans rose and fell around them .
although the community often played an active role in helping to shape the empires , it was not free from the persecution , pogroms and plagues which characterized the times . short-lived religious freedom discrimination under the rule of emperors , kings and bishops was rife , and it was only when french revolutionary troops occupied the city in 1792 that cologne 's jews received civil rights and religious freedom .
but that freedom did n't last . the nazis ended nearly two millennia of jewish life in cologne .
although some were lucky enough to escape in time , some 11,000 of the city 's jews were deported and murdered at the hands of the hitler regime . rebuilding the community bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city of cologne sometimes the city invites jews who fled the nazis , to come and visit the place where they used to live .
otto spier , who now lives in israel , recently returned to cologne for the first time in more than 60 years . " the view of cologne floats before my eyes again .
what ’ s surprising is that you still have a relationship to your city of birth and that despite everything that ’ s happened , there ’ s still a bond to the things that formed you in your youth , " he said . today , the immigration of jews from the former soviet union means that cologne is once again home to one of germany ’ s largest jewish communities . kirsten serup-bilfeldt -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german pope promises dialogue with jews as pope benedict xvi continued to settle into his role as the new leader of the catholic church , he vowed to promote dialogue with jews as part of an emphasis on interfaith issues .

their goal : to be considered a normal part of society .

" i thank all of you for our presence in cologne at this great gathering , in the hope that it will mark a step forward on the path towards reconciliation and unity , " said the german-born pope , formerly cardinal joseph ratzinger . by using his visit here to meet with the leaders of jewish and muslim communities , benedict has underscored a pledge made in his first speeches after his election in april that he would use his pontificate to work for christian unity and to build bridges with the other monotheistic religions . benedict 's symbolic visit to cologne 's synagogue at midday on friday will be only the second in modern history , following that of his predecessor john paul ii to rome 's synagogue 19 years ago . " while john paul ii expressed himself through gestures , pope ratzinger gives great space to words .
this pontificate will be a pontificate of concepts and of words , " vatican spokesman joaquin navarro-valls told journalists thursday in a rare public comparison of papal styles . benedict looking to build a youth following seeking to build the same kind of rapport with young people enjoyed by his charismatic predecessor , pope benedict said he would use his trip to " confirm their faith and enliven their hope " .

" share your joys and pains with christ , and let him enlighten your minds with his light and touch your hearts with his grace . " benedict reserved a special welcome for young pilgrims from the orient , including china , where vatican relations with the government are cool . " you are the representatives of so many of our brothers and sisters who are waiting , without realizing it , for the star to rise in their skies and lead them to christ , light of the nations , in whom they will find the fullest response to their hearts ' deepest desires .

11 terror attacks in the united states , was convicted by a german court on friday and sentenced to seven years in prison . mounir el motassadeq , the man suspected of helping the sept .
11 hijackers while the cell was preparing the attacks in hamburg , was convicted of being a member of a terrorist organization and sentenced to seven years in prison by a german court on friday . presiding judge ernst-rainer schudt announced the verdict of the moroccan 's year-long retrial hearing without stating the court 's reasons for the decision . support of hamburg cell leads to conviction el motassadeq was convicted on terror-related charges after the prosecution accused him of helping pay tuition and other bills for members of the hamburg cell to allow them to live as students while they plotted the attacks . prosecutors had demanded the maximum sentence of 15 years in prison for el motassadeq , but defense lawyers sought acquittal for the moroccan , who acknowledges he was close to the hijackers but insists he knew nothing of their plans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plumes of smoke pour from the world trade center buildings in new york tuesday , sept .
11 , 2001 .
el motassadeq , who looked on calmly as schudt announced the verdict , was the first man to go on trial over the terrorist attacks in new york and washington that killed more than 3,000 people .
he was found guilty and sentenced the maximum 15 years in prison in february 2003 .
but a german federal tribunal overturned the verdict last year and sent the case back to the court in the northern port city of hamburg , where three of the 19 suicide hijackers lived and studied .
attorney ladislav anisic said there was no evidence that directly linked his client to the plot and argued that motassadeq was being tried simply on guilt by association , which he said was unacceptable under the rule of law in a democracy like germany 's .
" let us not let osama bin laden win here at home by sacrificing our legal foundations , " he argued before the court .
anisic has said he will appeal any verdict other than an acquittal .
us not cooperating german observers say the prosecution 's case had been weakened by the failure of the united states to hand over more information on two top al qaeda operatives in its custody .
the federal court overturned the verdict on the grounds that the hamburg judges had not been able to hear potentially exculpatory testimony from the self-purported mastermind behind the attacks , ramzi binalshibh , and al qaeda 's suspected number three , khalid sheikh mohammed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdelghani mzoudi , left , was freed .
many think motassadeq will also be acquitted .
the us justice department provided two sets of summaries of their interrogation in which the two men reportedly said that motassadeq and fellow moroccan abdelghani mzoudi had had no involvement in the plot .
the prosecution has argued that the accounts are not credible given al qaeda training methods in counterintelligence .
but the reports and the holes in the case were enough to see mzoudi acquitted in hamburg on the same charges motassadeq is again facing .
after his release , mzoudi returned to morocco in june under threat of deportation .
perhaps in the hopes of a similar outcome to his trial , motassadeq has extended his moroccan passport and said he wished to go home as soon as possible .
after 65 hearings and 112 witnesses during the retrial alone , which began one year ago , a not guilty verdict would have been a humiliating blow to federal prosecutors . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb / nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de 9/11 suspect trial resumes after delay a moroccan student being retried over involvement in the september 11 , 2001 attacks in new york and washington , provided " active support " to the suicide pilots , the federal prosecutor told a german court on monday .

from the outside , it looks like one of the most dynamic places in europe .

schröder was sharply criticized for his position - not least in germany , where most people called him opportunistic - but he turned out to be right .
america needs friends who are critical , not who blindly follow whatever very controversial policies happen to be the order of the day .
both schröder and merkel will have to continue painful economic reforms , and there the differences will be small ; the significant differences between them concern foreign policy . what do you like about germa n y ? i like the growing cosmopolitanism , an interest in what people do and think all over the world .

from the outside , it looks like one of the most dynamic places in europe .
berlin is an international magnet .
under this government , the country has flourished more than people have realized .

why ? i 'm generally happy with the way the current red-green government has proceeded .
on the whole , they have done a good job and should continue to do so .
i 'm impressed by the ways in which , under the current government , germany has taken large steps towards becoming a more cosmopolitan and less racist country . i am particularly impressed by the difference in their attititudes to the iraq war , during which schröder was willing to take a stand , while merkel assured the bush administration that the cdu would follow american policy , whatever it was .
schröder was sharply criticized for his position - not least in germany , where most people called him opportunistic - but he turned out to be right .
america needs friends who are critical , not who blindly follow whatever very controversial policies happen to be the order of the day .
both schröder and merkel will have to continue painful economic reforms , and there the differences will be small ; the significant differences between them concern foreign policy . what do you like about germa n y ? i like the growing cosmopolitanism , an interest in what people do and think all over the world .

pope benedict 's visit will add another chapter to the tale of highs and lows , religion , tragedy and rebirth . when the jews first came to cologne in the wake of the roman legions , they were taken by the lush green and fertile land of the rhine valley .
so much so , that they decided to stay and found what is now the oldest jewish community north of the alps .
the first official mention of the community is in a decree from king constantine in 321 ad , granting them membership in the city council .
although cologne is now known for it ’ s cathedral and catholic traditions , back then it was considered the jerusalem of the north . the city 's jewish community struggled on through the centuries as empires , from the romans to the huns , the franks to the ottonians and the germans rose and fell around them .
although the community often played an active role in helping to shape the empires , it was not free from the persecution , pogroms and plagues which characterized the times . short-lived religious freedom discrimination under the rule of emperors , kings and bishops was rife , and it was only when french revolutionary troops occupied the city in 1792 that cologne 's jews received civil rights and religious freedom .
but that freedom did n't last . the nazis ended nearly two millennia of jewish life in cologne .
although some were lucky enough to escape in time , some 11,000 of the city 's jews were deported and murdered at the hands of the hitler regime . rebuilding the community bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city of cologne sometimes the city invites jews who fled the nazis , to come and visit the place where they used to live .
otto spier , who now lives in israel , recently returned to cologne for the first time in more than 60 years . " the view of cologne floats before my eyes again .
what ’ s surprising is that you still have a relationship to your city of birth and that despite everything that ’ s happened , there ’ s still a bond to the things that formed you in your youth , " he said . today , the immigration of jews from the former soviet union means that cologne is once again home to one of germany ’ s largest jewish communities . kirsten serup-bilfeldt -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german pope promises dialogue with jews as pope benedict xvi continued to settle into his role as the new leader of the catholic church , he vowed to promote dialogue with jews as part of an emphasis on interfaith issues .
-lrb- april 22 , 2005 -rrb- young jews in germany want normality with germany 's jewish community growing steadily in recent years , young jews are becoming more active .
their goal : to be considered a normal part of society .

the positive review in " the economist " has everyone surprised - except for the chancellor . great britain 's and maybe the world 's most prominent business magazine is not known for its love affair with germany 's economic system .
the decidedly pro-business economist has in recent years enjoyed ribbing europe 's largest economy for its stagnant growth rates , high unemployment and a union strength that has led to sky-high labor costs .
all the more surprising , then , that when the german symbol , the black eagle , graced the front of this week 's magazine as a caricature , it was flexing its muscles underneath the headline " germany 's surprising economy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : really ? " some forecasters are now predicting that germany , which has for so many years disappointed on the downside , could be about to surprise on the upside , " the magazine wrote in the lead editorial . weakened unions a good thing as reasons for this the economist listed , above all , the turnaround accomplished by the country 's major corporations .
the newfound flexibility of germany 's usually stubborn unions has helped lower labor costs immensely and made the country more competitive than italy , the netherlands , great britain and france .
" that is a big reason why , last year , it regained its position as the world 's biggest exporter , " it wrote . the magazine gave credit to chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition government of social democrats and the green party for getting reforms underway .
his raft of labor and socio-economic reforms , called agenda 2010 , may lose him the election this september , but they have nonetheless " raised hopes that fresh impetus could set the economy on to its strongest track for years . " tough measures , like the unpopular hartz iv law that made it more difficult for germany 's 1.8 million long-term unemployed to receive benefits without actively looking for jobs , won the magazine 's approval .
" hartz iv ... has added 8 billion euros -lrb- $ 9.8 billion -rrb- to this year 's government costs , but failed to create many new jobs , " the magazine wrote .
" it has , however , made employees more fearful of the consequences of losing their jobs .
that has strengthened the hand of firms ... and weakened the power of trade unions . " bildunterschrift : germany 's unions are getting weak , and that 's a good thing , according to " the economist " chancellor : proof we 're doing things right the report raised eyebrows in germany , getting press coverage not only from business magazines , but local papers as well .
germany 's prominent frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper followed up on the economist cover with a piece examining the euphoria .
" nobody wants to believe it : germany is gaining more prominence abroad as an investment destination , " it wrote . nobody , that is , except for the chancellor .
at one point during an hour-long interview on german public television yesterday evening , schröder fished a piece of paper out of his pocket .
it was the economist 's piece . " the economist , a publication that in the past was never particularly pro-german , has a cover story ' economist cheers germany 's surprising economy ' and says that thanks to the reforms we introduced our competitiveness has grown enormously , " he said . economist : merkel needs a chance but schröder neglected to mention one thing .
though it gave schröder 's government a small amount of praise for getting the reform process started , the economist editorialists clearly hope his opponents will be the ones continuing them after the likely elections on sept .

" the commitment of the new government to further reforms will make a big difference , " they wrote .

the positive review in " the economist " has everyone surprised - except for the chancellor . great britain 's and maybe the world 's most prominent business magazine is not known for its love affair with germany 's economic system .
the decidedly pro-business economist has in recent years enjoyed ribbing europe 's largest economy for its stagnant growth rates , high unemployment and a union strength that has led to sky-high labor costs .
all the more surprising , then , that when the german symbol , the black eagle , graced the front of this week 's magazine as a caricature , it was flexing its muscles underneath the headline " germany 's surprising economy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : really ? " some forecasters are now predicting that germany , which has for so many years disappointed on the downside , could be about to surprise on the upside , " the magazine wrote in the lead editorial . weakened unions a good thing as reasons for this the economist listed , above all , the turnaround accomplished by the country 's major corporations .
the newfound flexibility of germany 's usually stubborn unions has helped lower labor costs immensely and made the country more competitive than italy , the netherlands , great britain and france .
" that is a big reason why , last year , it regained its position as the world 's biggest exporter , " it wrote . the magazine gave credit to chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition government of social democrats and the green party for getting reforms underway .
his raft of labor and socio-economic reforms , called agenda 2010 , may lose him the election this september , but they have nonetheless " raised hopes that fresh impetus could set the economy on to its strongest track for years . " tough measures , like the unpopular hartz iv law that made it more difficult for germany 's 1.8 million long-term unemployed to receive benefits without actively looking for jobs , won the magazine 's approval .
" hartz iv ... has added 8 billion euros -lrb- $ 9.8 billion -rrb- to this year 's government costs , but failed to create many new jobs , " the magazine wrote .
" it has , however , made employees more fearful of the consequences of losing their jobs .
that has strengthened the hand of firms ... and weakened the power of trade unions . " bildunterschrift : germany 's unions are getting weak , and that 's a good thing , according to " the economist " chancellor : proof we 're doing things right the report raised eyebrows in germany , getting press coverage not only from business magazines , but local papers as well .
germany 's prominent frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper followed up on the economist cover with a piece examining the euphoria .
" nobody wants to believe it : germany is gaining more prominence abroad as an investment destination , " it wrote . nobody , that is , except for the chancellor .
at one point during an hour-long interview on german public television yesterday evening , schröder fished a piece of paper out of his pocket .
it was the economist 's piece . " the economist , a publication that in the past was never particularly pro-german , has a cover story ' economist cheers germany 's surprising economy ' and says that thanks to the reforms we introduced our competitiveness has grown enormously , " he said . economist : merkel needs a chance but schröder neglected to mention one thing .
though it gave schröder 's government a small amount of praise for getting the reform process started , the economist editorialists clearly hope his opponents will be the ones continuing them after the likely elections on sept .
18 .
" the commitment of the new government to further reforms will make a big difference , " they wrote .
" the politicians may not be able to control the economy , but they can certainly muck it up .
a center-right government under ms. merkel would have the advantage that her party also controls the upper-house bundesrat , making it far easier to push through legislative change .

" i was extremely impressed by what he said and how he said it .
he condemned the crimes of the nazis without any ifs and buts , " spiegel told germany 's ard television . during only the second visit to a synagogue by a pope in the modern history of the catholic church , the pope described the extermination of six million jews by the nazis as an " unimaginable crime . " spiegel , the president of the central council of jews in germany , said at a news conference later that he welcomed the pope 's call for jews and christians to work more closely together to overcome their sometimes fractious relationship . he added he was " particularly impressed that he said the roots of christianity lie in judaism . " benedict xvi , who served briefly in the hitler youth during the war when membership of the nazi organization was compulsory , paused to pray at a memorial to the six million jews killed in the holocaust as he began the landmark visit . speaking in the synagogue which was destroyed in the anti-jewish kristallnacht attacks in 1938 and rebuilt in 1959 , he called the holocaust " this unspeakable and previously unimaginable crime . " pope warns of new threats bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " in the 20th century , in the darkest period of german and european history , an insane racist ideology , born of neo-paganism , gave rise to the attempt , planned and systematically carried out by the regime , to exterminate european jewry , " he said . the pope warned that new threats of racism and anti-semitism were always lurking .
" it is a particularly important task , since today , sadly , we are witnessing the rise of new signs of anti-semitism and various forms of a general hostility towards foreigners , " he said . " how can we fail to see in this a reason for concern and vigilance ?
the catholic church is committed - i reaffirm this again today - to tolerance , respect , friendship and peace between all peoples , cultures and religions , " he said . in his speech to jewish leaders , benedict also referred to john paul ii , saying that " in considering the jewish roots of christianity , my venerable predecessor , quoting a statement by the german bishops , affirmed that ' whoever meets jesus christ meets judaism ' . " jewish leader calls on holocaust files to be opened during the pope 's visit , a leader of germany 's jewish community called on the pope to fully open the vatican 's archives on the holocaust . in a speech welcoming the 78-year-old german-born pope , abraham lehrer called on the pope to " fully open " the archives , reminding him that as the former head of the vatican congregation for the doctrine of the faith , he had helped release some of the documents they contained for public scrutiny in 1998 . lehrer said he would welcome such a move as a " further sign " of the vatican 's goodwill towards the jewish community and allow both sides to continue " peaceful and critical " examination of the history of their troubled relations . " as leader of the catholic church , you have a special responsibility .
your actions serve as a model for the church , " lehrer told the pope . the archives contain diplomatic correspondence and church documents which could throw light on the degree of vatican knowledge of nazi efforts to deport and exterminate europe 's jews . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope pius xii jewish groups have strongly opposed plans set in motion by benedict 's predecessor john paul ii to elevate wartime pope pius xii -lrb- photo -rrb- to sainthood , claiming he did little or nothing to prevent jews being deported . lehrer praised benedict xvi , who succeeded john paul ii in april , as a " builder of bridges between religions , " adding that his visit was " an extraordinary event of great political and religious significance . " the head of the german bishops ' conference , cardinal karl lehmann , acknowledged at a news conference later that part of the archives was already open " but we must continue to work to open the archives of the pius xii period .

" this world youth day shows that catholics are not a minority but come from all around the world , " köhler told journalists before the pope arrived .

" this morning the quota for category seven , blouses , was filled .
member states custom authorities will no longer issue import licenses for this product , " spokesman rupert krietemeyer told afp , reading a statement .
according to the eu imports database , data shows that 100 percent of a 2005 quota of nearly 24.8 million chinese blouses had been cleared for entry into the eu as of thursday evening . the commission spokesperson had further bad news for retailers : " it is likely that a number of other quotas will also be filled in the very near future , " he added .
specifically , quotas for bras , t-shirts and flax yarn were close to being met . the quotas for men 's trousers and pullovers were also already reached earlier this month , leaving millions of garments stranded at eu customs and outraging some big eu retailers awaiting deliveries . eu , china still locked in quota talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu and chinese officials have been holding talks on the quotas and brussels has said it is willing to be flexible .
eu trade commissioner peter mandelson -lrb- photo -rrb- has made it clear that he wants to negotiate with china to allow more clothing imports into the bloc , possibly by using some of 2006 quotas in 2005 . after eu textile producers urged that the quotas be implemented , eu officials are coming under fierce pressure from retailers who warn that store shelves could be bare during the key back-to-school period because they have not received some shipments . on thursday , government ministers from the netherlands , denmark , sweden and finland wrote an article in the financial times saying there was a risk of job losses and bankruptcies unless the eu eases the curbs on the imports .
this followed a letter sent to mandelson by germany 's economy minister wolfgang clement which called for a relaxation of the import restrictions . textile producers fear massive influx from china not all eu countries want the import restrictions to be relaxed .
countries with big textile industries of their own , like france , italy and spain , are worried they will suffer if chinese clothing enters the eu on a massive scale . the eu and china agreed to a broad textile trade agreement in june setting annual restrictions on 10 categories of chinese imports , which had been surging since the beginning of the year following the end of an international quota system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu trade commissioner peter mandelson , left , and his chinese counterpart bo xilai , right , toast during a signing ceremony early saturday june 11 , 2005 in shanghai , china .
the european union said friday it had reached a deal to resolve a dispute with china over a surge of chinese textile imports .
after protracted negotiations between chinese commerce minister bo xilai and mandelson in shanghai in june , china said that it would limit growth in exports of 10 textile and clothing products to the eu from between 8 to 12.5 percent a year in a bid to defuse the trade row . agreement in june rubber-stamped growth rate " china and the european union have agreed that , in the period from june 11 , 2005 to the end of 2007 , with an agreed base quantity , we will determine china 's amount of exports to europe by a growth rate of between 8 to 12.5 percent per year , " the ministry of commerce said in a statement on its web site after the end of negotiations . the eu response was to issue a statement that said that in 2008 , the eu will only apply " with restraint " paragraph 242 of china 's world trade organization accession protocol on textiles , which requires china to limit exports of textile products .

11 terror attacks in the united states , was convicted by a german court on friday and sentenced to seven years in prison . mounir el motassadeq , the man suspected of helping the sept .
11 hijackers while the cell was preparing the attacks in hamburg , was convicted of being a member of a terrorist organization and sentenced to seven years in prison by a german court on friday . presiding judge ernst-rainer schudt announced the verdict of the moroccan 's year-long retrial hearing without stating the court 's reasons for the decision . support of hamburg cell leads to conviction el motassadeq was convicted on terror-related charges after the prosecution accused him of helping pay tuition and other bills for members of the hamburg cell to allow them to live as students while they plotted the attacks . prosecutors had demanded the maximum sentence of 15 years in prison for el motassadeq , but defense lawyers sought acquittal for the moroccan , who acknowledges he was close to the hijackers but insists he knew nothing of their plans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plumes of smoke pour from the world trade center buildings in new york tuesday , sept .
11 , 2001 .
el motassadeq , who looked on calmly as schudt announced the verdict , was the first man to go on trial over the terrorist attacks in new york and washington that killed more than 3,000 people .
he was found guilty and sentenced the maximum 15 years in prison in february 2003 .
but a german federal tribunal overturned the verdict last year and sent the case back to the court in the northern port city of hamburg , where three of the 19 suicide hijackers lived and studied .
attorney ladislav anisic said there was no evidence that directly linked his client to the plot and argued that motassadeq was being tried simply on guilt by association , which he said was unacceptable under the rule of law in a democracy like germany 's .
" let us not let osama bin laden win here at home by sacrificing our legal foundations , " he argued before the court .
anisic has said he will appeal any verdict other than an acquittal .
us not cooperating german observers say the prosecution 's case had been weakened by the failure of the united states to hand over more information on two top al qaeda operatives in its custody .
the federal court overturned the verdict on the grounds that the hamburg judges had not been able to hear potentially exculpatory testimony from the self-purported mastermind behind the attacks , ramzi binalshibh , and al qaeda 's suspected number three , khalid sheikh mohammed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdelghani mzoudi , left , was freed .
many think motassadeq will also be acquitted .
the us justice department provided two sets of summaries of their interrogation in which the two men reportedly said that motassadeq and fellow moroccan abdelghani mzoudi had had no involvement in the plot .
the prosecution has argued that the accounts are not credible given al qaeda training methods in counterintelligence .
but the reports and the holes in the case were enough to see mzoudi acquitted in hamburg on the same charges motassadeq is again facing .
after his release , mzoudi returned to morocco in june under threat of deportation .
perhaps in the hopes of a similar outcome to his trial , motassadeq has extended his moroccan passport and said he wished to go home as soon as possible .
after 65 hearings and 112 witnesses during the retrial alone , which began one year ago , a not guilty verdict would have been a humiliating blow to federal prosecutors . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb / nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de 9/11 suspect trial resumes after delay a moroccan student being retried over involvement in the september 11 , 2001 attacks in new york and washington , provided " active support " to the suicide pilots , the federal prosecutor told a german court on monday .

" this morning the quota for category seven , blouses , was filled .
member states custom authorities will no longer issue import licenses for this product , " spokesman rupert krietemeyer told afp , reading a statement .
according to the eu imports database , data shows that 100 percent of a 2005 quota of nearly 24.8 million chinese blouses had been cleared for entry into the eu as of thursday evening . the commission spokesperson had further bad news for retailers : " it is likely that a number of other quotas will also be filled in the very near future , " he added .
specifically , quotas for bras , t-shirts and flax yarn were close to being met . the quotas for men 's trousers and pullovers were also already reached earlier this month , leaving millions of garments stranded at eu customs and outraging some big eu retailers awaiting deliveries . eu , china still locked in quota talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu and chinese officials have been holding talks on the quotas and brussels has said it is willing to be flexible .
eu trade commissioner peter mandelson -lrb- photo -rrb- has made it clear that he wants to negotiate with china to allow more clothing imports into the bloc , possibly by using some of 2006 quotas in 2005 . after eu textile producers urged that the quotas be implemented , eu officials are coming under fierce pressure from retailers who warn that store shelves could be bare during the key back-to-school period because they have not received some shipments . on thursday , government ministers from the netherlands , denmark , sweden and finland wrote an article in the financial times saying there was a risk of job losses and bankruptcies unless the eu eases the curbs on the imports .
this followed a letter sent to mandelson by germany 's economy minister wolfgang clement which called for a relaxation of the import restrictions . textile producers fear massive influx from china not all eu countries want the import restrictions to be relaxed .
countries with big textile industries of their own , like france , italy and spain , are worried they will suffer if chinese clothing enters the eu on a massive scale . the eu and china agreed to a broad textile trade agreement in june setting annual restrictions on 10 categories of chinese imports , which had been surging since the beginning of the year following the end of an international quota system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu trade commissioner peter mandelson , left , and his chinese counterpart bo xilai , right , toast during a signing ceremony early saturday june 11 , 2005 in shanghai , china .
the european union said friday it had reached a deal to resolve a dispute with china over a surge of chinese textile imports .
after protracted negotiations between chinese commerce minister bo xilai and mandelson in shanghai in june , china said that it would limit growth in exports of 10 textile and clothing products to the eu from between 8 to 12.5 percent a year in a bid to defuse the trade row . agreement in june rubber-stamped growth rate " china and the european union have agreed that , in the period from june 11 , 2005 to the end of 2007 , with an agreed base quantity , we will determine china 's amount of exports to europe by a growth rate of between 8 to 12.5 percent per year , " the ministry of commerce said in a statement on its web site after the end of negotiations . the eu response was to issue a statement that said that in 2008 , the eu will only apply " with restraint " paragraph 242 of china 's world trade organization accession protocol on textiles , which requires china to limit exports of textile products .

" i was extremely impressed by what he said and how he said it .
he condemned the crimes of the nazis without any ifs and buts , " spiegel told germany 's ard television . during only the second visit to a synagogue by a pope in the modern history of the catholic church , the pope described the extermination of six million jews by the nazis as an " unimaginable crime . " spiegel , the president of the central council of jews in germany , said at a news conference later that he welcomed the pope 's call for jews and christians to work more closely together to overcome their sometimes fractious relationship . he added he was " particularly impressed that he said the roots of christianity lie in judaism . " benedict xvi , who served briefly in the hitler youth during the war when membership of the nazi organization was compulsory , paused to pray at a memorial to the six million jews killed in the holocaust as he began the landmark visit . speaking in the synagogue which was destroyed in the anti-jewish kristallnacht attacks in 1938 and rebuilt in 1959 , he called the holocaust " this unspeakable and previously unimaginable crime . " pope warns of new threats bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " in the 20th century , in the darkest period of german and european history , an insane racist ideology , born of neo-paganism , gave rise to the attempt , planned and systematically carried out by the regime , to exterminate european jewry , " he said . the pope warned that new threats of racism and anti-semitism were always lurking .
" it is a particularly important task , since today , sadly , we are witnessing the rise of new signs of anti-semitism and various forms of a general hostility towards foreigners , " he said . " how can we fail to see in this a reason for concern and vigilance ?
the catholic church is committed - i reaffirm this again today - to tolerance , respect , friendship and peace between all peoples , cultures and religions , " he said . in his speech to jewish leaders , benedict also referred to john paul ii , saying that " in considering the jewish roots of christianity , my venerable predecessor , quoting a statement by the german bishops , affirmed that ' whoever meets jesus christ meets judaism ' . " jewish leader calls on holocaust files to be opened during the pope 's visit , a leader of germany 's jewish community called on the pope to fully open the vatican 's archives on the holocaust . in a speech welcoming the 78-year-old german-born pope , abraham lehrer called on the pope to " fully open " the archives , reminding him that as the former head of the vatican congregation for the doctrine of the faith , he had helped release some of the documents they contained for public scrutiny in 1998 . lehrer said he would welcome such a move as a " further sign " of the vatican 's goodwill towards the jewish community and allow both sides to continue " peaceful and critical " examination of the history of their troubled relations . " as leader of the catholic church , you have a special responsibility .
your actions serve as a model for the church , " lehrer told the pope . the archives contain diplomatic correspondence and church documents which could throw light on the degree of vatican knowledge of nazi efforts to deport and exterminate europe 's jews . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope pius xii jewish groups have strongly opposed plans set in motion by benedict 's predecessor john paul ii to elevate wartime pope pius xii -lrb- photo -rrb- to sainthood , claiming he did little or nothing to prevent jews being deported . lehrer praised benedict xvi , who succeeded john paul ii in april , as a " builder of bridges between religions , " adding that his visit was " an extraordinary event of great political and religious significance . " the head of the german bishops ' conference , cardinal karl lehmann , acknowledged at a news conference later that part of the archives was already open " but we must continue to work to open the archives of the pius xii period . " the visit to the synagogue was the highlight of the second day of the 78-year-old pope 's four-day visit to germany , the first foreign trip of his pontificate . discussions with köhler behind closed doors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi talks to german president horst köhler , left , in the presedential residence in bonn , western germany , friday , aug .
19 , 2005 .
pope benedict xvi on friday became the second pope to visit a synagogue , stopping to pray and remember holocaust victims with cologne 's jewish community .
earlier in the day the pope met with german president horst köhler , adding a political touch to a day dominated by the highly symbolic visit to the synagogue and talks with protestants . after his jubilant reception thursday , when around 400,000 young catholics welcomed him back to his native country , benedict 's agenda on the second day of his visit began with closed-door talks at the presidential villa in nearby bonn before moving on to the religious meetings in cologne . benedict waved to a small crowd outside the villa hammerschmidt , the presidential residence in the former german capital , and shook hands with children after the meeting . " this world youth day shows that catholics are not a minority but come from all around the world , " köhler told journalists before the pope arrived .
" it is good and it will do good for protestants as well , " said köhler , a protestant . about half of the christians in germany , home of martin luther 's reformation , are protestant . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german pope visits synagogue while in cologne for world youth day , pope benedict xvi makes history as the second catholic leader to visit a jewish place of worship .

" this morning the quota for category seven , blouses , was filled .

eu trade commissioner peter mandelson -lrb- photo -rrb- has made it clear that he wants to negotiate with china to allow more clothing imports into the bloc , possibly by using some of 2006 quotas in 2005 . after eu textile producers urged that the quotas be implemented , eu officials are coming under fierce pressure from retailers who warn that store shelves could be bare during the key back-to-school period because they have not received some shipments . on thursday , government ministers from the netherlands , denmark , sweden and finland wrote an article in the financial times saying there was a risk of job losses and bankruptcies unless the eu eases the curbs on the imports .
this followed a letter sent to mandelson by germany 's economy minister wolfgang clement which called for a relaxation of the import restrictions . textile producers fear massive influx from china not all eu countries want the import restrictions to be relaxed .
countries with big textile industries of their own , like france , italy and spain , are worried they will suffer if chinese clothing enters the eu on a massive scale . the eu and china agreed to a broad textile trade agreement in june setting annual restrictions on 10 categories of chinese imports , which had been surging since the beginning of the year following the end of an international quota system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu trade commissioner peter mandelson , left , and his chinese counterpart bo xilai , right , toast during a signing ceremony early saturday june 11 , 2005 in shanghai , china .
the european union said friday it had reached a deal to resolve a dispute with china over a surge of chinese textile imports .
after protracted negotiations between chinese commerce minister bo xilai and mandelson in shanghai in june , china said that it would limit growth in exports of 10 textile and clothing products to the eu from between 8 to 12.5 percent a year in a bid to defuse the trade row . agreement in june rubber-stamped growth rate " china and the european union have agreed that , in the period from june 11 , 2005 to the end of 2007 , with an agreed base quantity , we will determine china 's amount of exports to europe by a growth rate of between 8 to 12.5 percent per year , " the ministry of commerce said in a statement on its web site after the end of negotiations . the eu response was to issue a statement that said that in 2008 , the eu will only apply " with restraint " paragraph 242 of china 's world trade organization accession protocol on textiles , which requires china to limit exports of textile products .

11 terror attacks in the united states , was convicted by a german court on friday and sentenced to seven years in prison . mounir el motassadeq , the man suspected of helping the sept .
11 hijackers while the cell was preparing the attacks in hamburg , was convicted of being a member of a terrorist organization and sentenced to seven years in prison by a german court on friday . presiding judge ernst-rainer schudt announced the verdict of the moroccan 's year-long retrial hearing without stating the court 's reasons for the decision . support of hamburg cell leads to conviction el motassadeq was convicted on terror-related charges after the prosecution accused him of helping pay tuition and other bills for members of the hamburg cell to allow them to live as students while they plotted the attacks . prosecutors had demanded the maximum sentence of 15 years in prison for el motassadeq , but defense lawyers sought acquittal for the moroccan , who acknowledges he was close to the hijackers but insists he knew nothing of their plans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plumes of smoke pour from the world trade center buildings in new york tuesday , sept .
11 , 2001 .
el motassadeq , who looked on calmly as schudt announced the verdict , was the first man to go on trial over the terrorist attacks in new york and washington that killed more than 3,000 people .
he was found guilty and sentenced the maximum 15 years in prison in february 2003 .
but a german federal tribunal overturned the verdict last year and sent the case back to the court in the northern port city of hamburg , where three of the 19 suicide hijackers lived and studied .
attorney ladislav anisic said there was no evidence that directly linked his client to the plot and argued that motassadeq was being tried simply on guilt by association , which he said was unacceptable under the rule of law in a democracy like germany 's .
" let us not let osama bin laden win here at home by sacrificing our legal foundations , " he argued before the court .
anisic has said he will appeal any verdict other than an acquittal .
us not cooperating german observers say the prosecution 's case had been weakened by the failure of the united states to hand over more information on two top al qaeda operatives in its custody .
the federal court overturned the verdict on the grounds that the hamburg judges had not been able to hear potentially exculpatory testimony from the self-purported mastermind behind the attacks , ramzi binalshibh , and al qaeda 's suspected number three , khalid sheikh mohammed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdelghani mzoudi , left , was freed .
many think motassadeq will also be acquitted .
the us justice department provided two sets of summaries of their interrogation in which the two men reportedly said that motassadeq and fellow moroccan abdelghani mzoudi had had no involvement in the plot .
the prosecution has argued that the accounts are not credible given al qaeda training methods in counterintelligence .
but the reports and the holes in the case were enough to see mzoudi acquitted in hamburg on the same charges motassadeq is again facing .
after his release , mzoudi returned to morocco in june under threat of deportation .
perhaps in the hopes of a similar outcome to his trial , motassadeq has extended his moroccan passport and said he wished to go home as soon as possible .

his predecessor john paul ii visited the rome synagogue in 1986 . since taking over as the head of the catholic church , the new pope has made clear his intention to maintain a dialogue with jewish leaders such as was nurtured by pope john paul ii .
the late pontiff was much admired in israel for his efforts to promote reconciliation between the vatican and the jewish people . pope benedict xvi has remained true to his word .
his visit to the synagogue in cologne , which is home to the oldest jewish community in germany , is widely viewed as a deeply symbolic gesture , which underlines his determination to foster reconciliation between different faiths at a time of stresses and strains on all sides . bildunterschrift : warm welcome for the pope 's homecoming upon his arrival in germany for world youth day celebrations , the new pope spoke of the importance of planned meetings with jews and muslims . later he said he hoped the presence in cologne of representatives of different christian denominations and those from different religions would " mark a step forward on the path towards reconciliation and unity .

speaking on deutschlandradio , he said he hoped the pope would place the emphasis on a mutual religious foundation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how much can he achieve ?
but jubilation about the visit has not poured from all corners , with some suggestions from the jewish community in lower saxony , that the visit to the synagogue was not the same as meeting with jewish representatives , such as john paul ii did on his three visits to germany . the synagogue visit will be followed by talks with muslim leaders on saturday , signifying the pope 's commitment to dialogue with other religions during a summer scarred by islamic terrorist violence with bombings in london and egypt and continued violence in the middle east . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cologne : germany 's oldest jewish community the jewish community in cologne is the oldest in germany , with a history which stretches back 2000 years .

pope benedict 's visit will add another chapter to the tale of highs and lows , religion , tragedy and rebirth . when the jews first came to cologne in the wake of the roman legions , they were taken by the lush green and fertile land of the rhine valley .
so much so , that they decided to stay and found what is now the oldest jewish community north of the alps .
the first official mention of the community is in a decree from king constantine in 321 ad , granting them membership in the city council .
although cologne is now known for it ’ s cathedral and catholic traditions , back then it was considered the jerusalem of the north . the city 's jewish community struggled on through the centuries as empires , from the romans to the huns , the franks to the ottonians and the germans rose and fell around them .
although the community often played an active role in helping to shape the empires , it was not free from the persecution , pogroms and plagues which characterized the times . short-lived religious freedom discrimination under the rule of emperors , kings and bishops was rife , and it was only when french revolutionary troops occupied the city in 1792 that cologne 's jews received civil rights and religious freedom .
but that freedom did n't last . the nazis ended nearly two millennia of jewish life in cologne .
although some were lucky enough to escape in time , some 11,000 of the city 's jews were deported and murdered at the hands of the hitler regime . rebuilding the community bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city of cologne sometimes the city invites jews who fled the nazis , to come and visit the place where they used to live .
otto spier , who now lives in israel , recently returned to cologne for the first time in more than 60 years . " the view of cologne floats before my eyes again .
what ’ s surprising is that you still have a relationship to your city of birth and that despite everything that ’ s happened , there ’ s still a bond to the things that formed you in your youth , " he said . today , the immigration of jews from the former soviet union means that cologne is once again home to one of germany ’ s largest jewish communities . kirsten serup-bilfeldt -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german pope promises dialogue with jews as pope benedict xvi continued to settle into his role as the new leader of the catholic church , he vowed to promote dialogue with jews as part of an emphasis on interfaith issues .
-lrb- april 22 , 2005 -rrb- young jews in germany want normality with germany 's jewish community growing steadily in recent years , young jews are becoming more active .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 19.08.2005 surprise good review for german economy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chancellor likes what " the economist " is writing one of the world 's most prominent business magazines has given the german economy the thumbs up .
the positive review in " the economist " has everyone surprised - except for the chancellor . great britain 's and maybe the world 's most prominent business magazine is not known for its love affair with germany 's economic system .
the decidedly pro-business economist has in recent years enjoyed ribbing europe 's largest economy for its stagnant growth rates , high unemployment and a union strength that has led to sky-high labor costs .
all the more surprising , then , that when the german symbol , the black eagle , graced the front of this week 's magazine as a caricature , it was flexing its muscles underneath the headline " germany 's surprising economy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : really ? " some forecasters are now predicting that germany , which has for so many years disappointed on the downside , could be about to surprise on the upside , " the magazine wrote in the lead editorial . weakened unions a good thing as reasons for this the economist listed , above all , the turnaround accomplished by the country 's major corporations .
the newfound flexibility of germany 's usually stubborn unions has helped lower labor costs immensely and made the country more competitive than italy , the netherlands , great britain and france .
" that is a big reason why , last year , it regained its position as the world 's biggest exporter , " it wrote . the magazine gave credit to chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition government of social democrats and the green party for getting reforms underway .
his raft of labor and socio-economic reforms , called agenda 2010 , may lose him the election this september , but they have nonetheless " raised hopes that fresh impetus could set the economy on to its strongest track for years . " tough measures , like the unpopular hartz iv law that made it more difficult for germany 's 1.8 million long-term unemployed to receive benefits without actively looking for jobs , won the magazine 's approval .
" hartz iv ... has added 8 billion euros -lrb- $ 9.8 billion -rrb- to this year 's government costs , but failed to create many new jobs , " the magazine wrote .
" it has , however , made employees more fearful of the consequences of losing their jobs .
that has strengthened the hand of firms ... and weakened the power of trade unions . " bildunterschrift : germany 's unions are getting weak , and that 's a good thing , according to " the economist " chancellor : proof we 're doing things right the report raised eyebrows in germany , getting press coverage not only from business magazines , but local papers as well .
germany 's prominent frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper followed up on the economist cover with a piece examining the euphoria .
" nobody wants to believe it : germany is gaining more prominence abroad as an investment destination , " it wrote . nobody , that is , except for the chancellor .
at one point during an hour-long interview on german public television yesterday evening , schröder fished a piece of paper out of his pocket .
it was the economist 's piece . " the economist , a publication that in the past was never particularly pro-german , has a cover story ' economist cheers germany 's surprising economy ' and says that thanks to the reforms we introduced our competitiveness has grown enormously , " he said . economist : merkel needs a chance but schröder neglected to mention one thing .
though it gave schröder 's government a small amount of praise for getting the reform process started , the economist editorialists clearly hope his opponents will be the ones continuing them after the likely elections on sept .
18 .
" the commitment of the new government to further reforms will make a big difference , " they wrote .
" the politicians may not be able to control the economy , but they can certainly muck it up .
a center-right government under ms. merkel would have the advantage that her party also controls the upper-house bundesrat , making it far easier to push through legislative change .

dw-world talked to her about germany in light of the upcoming election . born in atlanta , georgia , neiman studied philosophy at harvard university and berlin 's free university .
she taught philosophy at yale and tel aviv universities .
in her latest book , " fremde sehen anders " -lrb- " strangers see things differently " -rrb- , due out in germany on aug .
24 , neiman argues that germans might be oblivious to the fact that their country is already on the road to recovery . dw-world : how is germa n y doi n g i n your opi n io n ? susan neiman : i think it 's doing much better than germans think it is .
from the outside , it looks like one of the most dynamic places in europe .
berlin is an international magnet .
under this government , the country has flourished more than people have realized .
it 's broken , decisively , with the stigma under which germany was standing for half a century .
not even economically it is as bad as people think it is .
people complain about certain kinds of cuts in social services and economic problems , but the country is fundamentally sound in comparison with other places .
you can have 9 percent economic growth , as china is experiencing , if you drop any concern for human beings and the environment .
what n eeds to happe n i n germa n y to help speed up the cou n try 's recovery ? i think it 's clear that all the industrialized nations still need to come up with concepts about unemployment in view of globalization .
i do n't think any of us have fully grasped what globalization means .
but i think that again , what 's remarkable is that germans think much worse about themselves than anyone else .
i think both the extreme left and members of some of the right have tried to benefit by painting a picture that things are terrible .
they reflect , however , the mood of the people .
you have a sort of mirroring effect .
if people would stop being so pessimistic , a great deal would be accomplished .
east and west germans tend to expect the state to take care of everything .
i think there is an expectation that the state should provide more than people expect in other countries .
there is a sense that if anything goes wrong , one blames it on the government . schröder or merkel ?
who is your perso n al choice for cha n cellor ?
why ? i 'm generally happy with the way the current red-green government has proceeded .
on the whole , they have done a good job and should continue to do so .
i 'm impressed by the ways in which , under the current government , germany has taken large steps towards becoming a more cosmopolitan and less racist country . i am particularly impressed by the difference in their attititudes to the iraq war , during which schröder was willing to take a stand , while merkel assured the bush administration that the cdu would follow american policy , whatever it was .
schröder was sharply criticized for his position - not least in germany , where most people called him opportunistic - but he turned out to be right .
america needs friends who are critical , not who blindly follow whatever very controversial policies happen to be the order of the day .
both schröder and merkel will have to continue painful economic reforms , and there the differences will be small ; the significant differences between them concern foreign policy . what do you like about germa n y ? i like the growing cosmopolitanism , an interest in what people do and think all over the world .
that 's much stronger than in france , england , and the us .
i like the sense of historical interest , i like the interest in preserving good parts of the past and the interest in dealing with bad parts of it .
i like the intelligence and intensity of german public culture . what do you dislike about germa n y ? i dislike the tendency to complain , and to see things in mostly negative terms .
i dislike a certain kind of formality that takes place in many relations . interview conducted by mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de election 2005 click here for dw-world 's complete election coverage .

pope benedict 's visit will add another chapter to the tale of highs and lows , religion , tragedy and rebirth . when the jews first came to cologne in the wake of the roman legions , they were taken by the lush green and fertile land of the rhine valley .
so much so , that they decided to stay and found what is now the oldest jewish community north of the alps .
the first official mention of the community is in a decree from king constantine in 321 ad , granting them membership in the city council .
although cologne is now known for it ’ s cathedral and catholic traditions , back then it was considered the jerusalem of the north . the city 's jewish community struggled on through the centuries as empires , from the romans to the huns , the franks to the ottonians and the germans rose and fell around them .
although the community often played an active role in helping to shape the empires , it was not free from the persecution , pogroms and plagues which characterized the times . short-lived religious freedom discrimination under the rule of emperors , kings and bishops was rife , and it was only when french revolutionary troops occupied the city in 1792 that cologne 's jews received civil rights and religious freedom .

11 terror attacks in the united states , was convicted by a german court on friday and sentenced to seven years in prison . mounir el motassadeq , the man suspected of helping the sept .
11 hijackers while the cell was preparing the attacks in hamburg , was convicted of being a member of a terrorist organization and sentenced to seven years in prison by a german court on friday . presiding judge ernst-rainer schudt announced the verdict of the moroccan 's year-long retrial hearing without stating the court 's reasons for the decision . support of hamburg cell leads to conviction el motassadeq was convicted on terror-related charges after the prosecution accused him of helping pay tuition and other bills for members of the hamburg cell to allow them to live as students while they plotted the attacks . prosecutors had demanded the maximum sentence of 15 years in prison for el motassadeq , but defense lawyers sought acquittal for the moroccan , who acknowledges he was close to the hijackers but insists he knew nothing of their plans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plumes of smoke pour from the world trade center buildings in new york tuesday , sept .
11 , 2001 .
el motassadeq , who looked on calmly as schudt announced the verdict , was the first man to go on trial over the terrorist attacks in new york and washington that killed more than 3,000 people .
he was found guilty and sentenced the maximum 15 years in prison in february 2003 .
but a german federal tribunal overturned the verdict last year and sent the case back to the court in the northern port city of hamburg , where three of the 19 suicide hijackers lived and studied .
attorney ladislav anisic said there was no evidence that directly linked his client to the plot and argued that motassadeq was being tried simply on guilt by association , which he said was unacceptable under the rule of law in a democracy like germany 's .
" let us not let osama bin laden win here at home by sacrificing our legal foundations , " he argued before the court .
anisic has said he will appeal any verdict other than an acquittal .
us not cooperating german observers say the prosecution 's case had been weakened by the failure of the united states to hand over more information on two top al qaeda operatives in its custody .
the federal court overturned the verdict on the grounds that the hamburg judges had not been able to hear potentially exculpatory testimony from the self-purported mastermind behind the attacks , ramzi binalshibh , and al qaeda 's suspected number three , khalid sheikh mohammed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdelghani mzoudi , left , was freed .
many think motassadeq will also be acquitted .
the us justice department provided two sets of summaries of their interrogation in which the two men reportedly said that motassadeq and fellow moroccan abdelghani mzoudi had had no involvement in the plot .
the prosecution has argued that the accounts are not credible given al qaeda training methods in counterintelligence .
but the reports and the holes in the case were enough to see mzoudi acquitted in hamburg on the same charges motassadeq is again facing .
after his release , mzoudi returned to morocco in june under threat of deportation .
perhaps in the hopes of a similar outcome to his trial , motassadeq has extended his moroccan passport and said he wished to go home as soon as possible .
after 65 hearings and 112 witnesses during the retrial alone , which began one year ago , a not guilty verdict would have been a humiliating blow to federal prosecutors . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb / nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de 9/11 suspect trial resumes after delay a moroccan student being retried over involvement in the september 11 , 2001 attacks in new york and washington , provided " active support " to the suicide pilots , the federal prosecutor told a german court on monday .

" this morning the quota for category seven , blouses , was filled .
member states custom authorities will no longer issue import licenses for this product , " spokesman rupert krietemeyer told afp , reading a statement .
according to the eu imports database , data shows that 100 percent of a 2005 quota of nearly 24.8 million chinese blouses had been cleared for entry into the eu as of thursday evening . the commission spokesperson had further bad news for retailers : " it is likely that a number of other quotas will also be filled in the very near future , " he added .
specifically , quotas for bras , t-shirts and flax yarn were close to being met . the quotas for men 's trousers and pullovers were also already reached earlier this month , leaving millions of garments stranded at eu customs and outraging some big eu retailers awaiting deliveries . eu , china still locked in quota talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu and chinese officials have been holding talks on the quotas and brussels has said it is willing to be flexible .
eu trade commissioner peter mandelson -lrb- photo -rrb- has made it clear that he wants to negotiate with china to allow more clothing imports into the bloc , possibly by using some of 2006 quotas in 2005 . after eu textile producers urged that the quotas be implemented , eu officials are coming under fierce pressure from retailers who warn that store shelves could be bare during the key back-to-school period because they have not received some shipments . on thursday , government ministers from the netherlands , denmark , sweden and finland wrote an article in the financial times saying there was a risk of job losses and bankruptcies unless the eu eases the curbs on the imports .
this followed a letter sent to mandelson by germany 's economy minister wolfgang clement which called for a relaxation of the import restrictions . textile producers fear massive influx from china not all eu countries want the import restrictions to be relaxed .
countries with big textile industries of their own , like france , italy and spain , are worried they will suffer if chinese clothing enters the eu on a massive scale . the eu and china agreed to a broad textile trade agreement in june setting annual restrictions on 10 categories of chinese imports , which had been surging since the beginning of the year following the end of an international quota system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu trade commissioner peter mandelson , left , and his chinese counterpart bo xilai , right , toast during a signing ceremony early saturday june 11 , 2005 in shanghai , china .

after protracted negotiations between chinese commerce minister bo xilai and mandelson in shanghai in june , china said that it would limit growth in exports of 10 textile and clothing products to the eu from between 8 to 12.5 percent a year in a bid to defuse the trade row . agreement in june rubber-stamped growth rate " china and the european union have agreed that , in the period from june 11 , 2005 to the end of 2007 , with an agreed base quantity , we will determine china 's amount of exports to europe by a growth rate of between 8 to 12.5 percent per year , " the ministry of commerce said in a statement on its web site after the end of negotiations . the eu response was to issue a statement that said that in 2008 , the eu will only apply " with restraint " paragraph 242 of china 's world trade organization accession protocol on textiles , which requires china to limit exports of textile products .

eu trade commissioner peter mandelson -lrb- photo -rrb- has made it clear that he wants to negotiate with china to allow more clothing imports into the bloc , possibly by using some of 2006 quotas in 2005 . after eu textile producers urged that the quotas be implemented , eu officials are coming under fierce pressure from retailers who warn that store shelves could be bare during the key back-to-school period because they have not received some shipments . on thursday , government ministers from the netherlands , denmark , sweden and finland wrote an article in the financial times saying there was a risk of job losses and bankruptcies unless the eu eases the curbs on the imports .
this followed a letter sent to mandelson by germany 's economy minister wolfgang clement which called for a relaxation of the import restrictions . textile producers fear massive influx from china not all eu countries want the import restrictions to be relaxed .
countries with big textile industries of their own , like france , italy and spain , are worried they will suffer if chinese clothing enters the eu on a massive scale . the eu and china agreed to a broad textile trade agreement in june setting annual restrictions on 10 categories of chinese imports , which had been surging since the beginning of the year following the end of an international quota system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu trade commissioner peter mandelson , left , and his chinese counterpart bo xilai , right , toast during a signing ceremony early saturday june 11 , 2005 in shanghai , china .

after protracted negotiations between chinese commerce minister bo xilai and mandelson in shanghai in june , china said that it would limit growth in exports of 10 textile and clothing products to the eu from between 8 to 12.5 percent a year in a bid to defuse the trade row . agreement in june rubber-stamped growth rate " china and the european union have agreed that , in the period from june 11 , 2005 to the end of 2007 , with an agreed base quantity , we will determine china 's amount of exports to europe by a growth rate of between 8 to 12.5 percent per year , " the ministry of commerce said in a statement on its web site after the end of negotiations . the eu response was to issue a statement that said that in 2008 , the eu will only apply " with restraint " paragraph 242 of china 's world trade organization accession protocol on textiles , which requires china to limit exports of textile products .

11 hijackers while the cell was preparing the attacks in hamburg , was convicted of being a member of a terrorist organization and sentenced to seven years in prison by a german court on friday . presiding judge ernst-rainer schudt announced the verdict of the moroccan 's year-long retrial hearing without stating the court 's reasons for the decision . support of hamburg cell leads to conviction el motassadeq was convicted on terror-related charges after the prosecution accused him of helping pay tuition and other bills for members of the hamburg cell to allow them to live as students while they plotted the attacks . prosecutors had demanded the maximum sentence of 15 years in prison for el motassadeq , but defense lawyers sought acquittal for the moroccan , who acknowledges he was close to the hijackers but insists he knew nothing of their plans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plumes of smoke pour from the world trade center buildings in new york tuesday , sept .
11 , 2001 .
el motassadeq , who looked on calmly as schudt announced the verdict , was the first man to go on trial over the terrorist attacks in new york and washington that killed more than 3,000 people .
he was found guilty and sentenced the maximum 15 years in prison in february 2003 .
but a german federal tribunal overturned the verdict last year and sent the case back to the court in the northern port city of hamburg , where three of the 19 suicide hijackers lived and studied .
attorney ladislav anisic said there was no evidence that directly linked his client to the plot and argued that motassadeq was being tried simply on guilt by association , which he said was unacceptable under the rule of law in a democracy like germany 's .
" let us not let osama bin laden win here at home by sacrificing our legal foundations , " he argued before the court .
anisic has said he will appeal any verdict other than an acquittal .
us not cooperating german observers say the prosecution 's case had been weakened by the failure of the united states to hand over more information on two top al qaeda operatives in its custody .
the federal court overturned the verdict on the grounds that the hamburg judges had not been able to hear potentially exculpatory testimony from the self-purported mastermind behind the attacks , ramzi binalshibh , and al qaeda 's suspected number three , khalid sheikh mohammed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdelghani mzoudi , left , was freed .
many think motassadeq will also be acquitted .
the us justice department provided two sets of summaries of their interrogation in which the two men reportedly said that motassadeq and fellow moroccan abdelghani mzoudi had had no involvement in the plot .
the prosecution has argued that the accounts are not credible given al qaeda training methods in counterintelligence .
but the reports and the holes in the case were enough to see mzoudi acquitted in hamburg on the same charges motassadeq is again facing .
after his release , mzoudi returned to morocco in june under threat of deportation .
perhaps in the hopes of a similar outcome to his trial , motassadeq has extended his moroccan passport and said he wished to go home as soon as possible .

in their midst , a young woman dressed like a secretary from a 1950 's film calmly types away on an equally old-fashioned typewriter while listening intently to the man seated opposite her .
a sign beside them reads " if i were chancellor … " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when the man finishes dictating his message to germany 's political leaders , the " secretary " hands him his postcard , complete with postage .
he twirls a wheel of rubber stamps , selects one that says " urgent , " and inks this in bright red across his card .
he then drops the card into a mailbox conveniently located just a few steps away , a look of satisfaction on his face . the scene - part political event , part art happening - causes passersby to slow their pace .
some just watch , while others get in line for a chance to have their say .
it 's all the brainchild of the woman in the red secretary 's costume , american artist and journalist sheryl oring . in the year leading up to the 2004 elections in the united states , oring travelled across her country with a similar project called " i wish to say , " typing over a thousand postcards for people who wanted to voice their concerns to president george w. bush . " the reaction in the states was so great that i thought of trying it in other countries , " says oring , who had previously worked and studied in germany and speaks fluent german . german grammar despite having a good grasp of the language , oring says she was slightly nervous about taking her " show " to germany . bildunterschrift : " i have to tell people to speak slowly because i 'm not a native speaker , and when i 'm done , i give them the chance to read it over and correct the grammar mistakes , " she laughs . but she added that being a foreigner has its advantages , as it makes people curious , and more likely to participate . " i did n't know how it would go over in germany , but people are really into doing it , " oring says .
" people have a lot of concerns about unemployment and social benefits , for example , and they 're really eager to talk about that .
here , people do n't feel the media or the politicians are listening to them , but this project gives them that .
in a way , it 's a service to people , and that 's something that 's been very gratifying . " thomas , a 42-year-old berliner , sat down with oring to tell her about his dissatisfaction with the current economic and social situation in germany .
on his postcard , he wrote to chancellor gerhard schröder of his concern that germany is moving too far in the direction of the us when it comes to labor policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wenn ich kanzler wäre … kunstaktion sheryl oring schreibmaschine " people are being forced into doing any old job , even if it is below their qualifications , just so that they 're back at work , " thomas said , adding that he appreciated oring 's project . " if you express your opinion as part of an art project , you know you wo n't have to face any repercussions , " he said .
" it 's a safe way to do it . " diverse responses while many of the postcards deal with election campaign issues such as unemployment , pensions , and education , other participants used their time at oring 's desk to air their pet peeves , or let their imaginations run wild . " i would charge a big fee for people who do n't clean up after their dogs , " wrote one disgruntled berliner . " i 'd like to be the king of berlin , " wrote another resident whose solution to the city 's problems would be to " open a big casino so everyone would be happy . " queuing up to talk with oring , eight-year-old gabriel excitedly outlined a list of laws he would pass if he were chancellor , including one that would " allow kids to play soccer everywhere . " bildunterschrift : kids get in on the act , too it 's the diversity of responses that keeps oring going .
she is bringing " if i were chancellor " to five german cities over a period of three weeks , and expects to type as many as 200 cards .
she keeps a copy of each card , and is hoping to turn them into an exhibition or a book . " i 'm always amazed at people 's answers , " she says .
" even though i 've done the show before , it never feels repetitive .
when i meet new people and hear a really moving story , that 's when i think it 's all worth it .

11 hijackers while the cell was preparing the attacks in hamburg , was convicted of being a member of a terrorist organization and sentenced to seven years in prison by a german court on friday . presiding judge ernst-rainer schudt announced the verdict of the moroccan 's year-long retrial hearing without stating the court 's reasons for the decision . support of hamburg cell leads to conviction el motassadeq was convicted on terror-related charges after the prosecution accused him of helping pay tuition and other bills for members of the hamburg cell to allow them to live as students while they plotted the attacks . prosecutors had demanded the maximum sentence of 15 years in prison for el motassadeq , but defense lawyers sought acquittal for the moroccan , who acknowledges he was close to the hijackers but insists he knew nothing of their plans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plumes of smoke pour from the world trade center buildings in new york tuesday , sept .
11 , 2001 .
el motassadeq , who looked on calmly as schudt announced the verdict , was the first man to go on trial over the terrorist attacks in new york and washington that killed more than 3,000 people .
he was found guilty and sentenced the maximum 15 years in prison in february 2003 .
but a german federal tribunal overturned the verdict last year and sent the case back to the court in the northern port city of hamburg , where three of the 19 suicide hijackers lived and studied .
attorney ladislav anisic said there was no evidence that directly linked his client to the plot and argued that motassadeq was being tried simply on guilt by association , which he said was unacceptable under the rule of law in a democracy like germany 's .
" let us not let osama bin laden win here at home by sacrificing our legal foundations , " he argued before the court .
anisic has said he will appeal any verdict other than an acquittal .
us not cooperating german observers say the prosecution 's case had been weakened by the failure of the united states to hand over more information on two top al qaeda operatives in its custody .
the federal court overturned the verdict on the grounds that the hamburg judges had not been able to hear potentially exculpatory testimony from the self-purported mastermind behind the attacks , ramzi binalshibh , and al qaeda 's suspected number three , khalid sheikh mohammed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdelghani mzoudi , left , was freed .
many think motassadeq will also be acquitted .
the us justice department provided two sets of summaries of their interrogation in which the two men reportedly said that motassadeq and fellow moroccan abdelghani mzoudi had had no involvement in the plot .
the prosecution has argued that the accounts are not credible given al qaeda training methods in counterintelligence .
but the reports and the holes in the case were enough to see mzoudi acquitted in hamburg on the same charges motassadeq is again facing .
after his release , mzoudi returned to morocco in june under threat of deportation .
perhaps in the hopes of a similar outcome to his trial , motassadeq has extended his moroccan passport and said he wished to go home as soon as possible .
after 65 hearings and 112 witnesses during the retrial alone , which began one year ago , a not guilty verdict would have been a humiliating blow to federal prosecutors . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb / nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de 9/11 suspect trial resumes after delay a moroccan student being retried over involvement in the september 11 , 2001 attacks in new york and washington , provided " active support " to the suicide pilots , the federal prosecutor told a german court on monday .

" this morning the quota for category seven , blouses , was filled .
member states custom authorities will no longer issue import licenses for this product , " spokesman rupert krietemeyer told afp , reading a statement .
according to the eu imports database , data shows that 100 percent of a 2005 quota of nearly 24.8 million chinese blouses had been cleared for entry into the eu as of thursday evening . the commission spokesperson had further bad news for retailers : " it is likely that a number of other quotas will also be filled in the very near future , " he added .

after protracted negotiations between chinese commerce minister bo xilai and mandelson in shanghai in june , china said that it would limit growth in exports of 10 textile and clothing products to the eu from between 8 to 12.5 percent a year in a bid to defuse the trade row . agreement in june rubber-stamped growth rate " china and the european union have agreed that , in the period from june 11 , 2005 to the end of 2007 , with an agreed base quantity , we will determine china 's amount of exports to europe by a growth rate of between 8 to 12.5 percent per year , " the ministry of commerce said in a statement on its web site after the end of negotiations . the eu response was to issue a statement that said that in 2008 , the eu will only apply " with restraint " paragraph 242 of china 's world trade organization accession protocol on textiles , which requires china to limit exports of textile products .

" this morning the quota for category seven , blouses , was filled .
member states custom authorities will no longer issue import licenses for this product , " spokesman rupert krietemeyer told afp , reading a statement .
according to the eu imports database , data shows that 100 percent of a 2005 quota of nearly 24.8 million chinese blouses had been cleared for entry into the eu as of thursday evening . the commission spokesperson had further bad news for retailers : " it is likely that a number of other quotas will also be filled in the very near future , " he added .
specifically , quotas for bras , t-shirts and flax yarn were close to being met . the quotas for men 's trousers and pullovers were also already reached earlier this month , leaving millions of garments stranded at eu customs and outraging some big eu retailers awaiting deliveries . eu , china still locked in quota talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu and chinese officials have been holding talks on the quotas and brussels has said it is willing to be flexible .
eu trade commissioner peter mandelson -lrb- photo -rrb- has made it clear that he wants to negotiate with china to allow more clothing imports into the bloc , possibly by using some of 2006 quotas in 2005 . after eu textile producers urged that the quotas be implemented , eu officials are coming under fierce pressure from retailers who warn that store shelves could be bare during the key back-to-school period because they have not received some shipments . on thursday , government ministers from the netherlands , denmark , sweden and finland wrote an article in the financial times saying there was a risk of job losses and bankruptcies unless the eu eases the curbs on the imports .
this followed a letter sent to mandelson by germany 's economy minister wolfgang clement which called for a relaxation of the import restrictions . textile producers fear massive influx from china not all eu countries want the import restrictions to be relaxed .

" the possibility for priests to get married , the rights of gays and lesbians , more democratic participation for lay people - all these are points on which we would like to see progress , " she said . women priests unsettle leaders a particular focus of taylor 's work concerns the role of women in the church .

" young people feel it is their church and sincerely want the pope to understand what their concerns are . ” the critics make a strong point that they are part of the church and do consider themselves firmly rooted in the faith .

there are signs that the gap between them and church leaders is narrowing . as world youth day -lrb- wyd -rrb- enters its climactic phase with the arrival of pope benedict xvi on thursday , church critics are also stepping up their activities .
a number of reform organizations from around the world have been handing out flyers and staging events in the city of cologne in an attempt to reach the young people attending the catholic festival . united under the umbrella of the " world youth day 4 all coalition " -lrb- wyd4all -rrb- , they have set up their base for the duration of the gathering in a church in the city center . while there is hardly any room given to controversial issues in the official wyd program , young believers ' response to critical questions has been enormous , says aisha taylor , program director of the us-based women 's ordination conference . " the possibility for priests to get married , the rights of gays and lesbians , more democratic participation for lay people - all these are points on which we would like to see progress , " she said . women priests unsettle leaders a particular focus of taylor 's work concerns the role of women in the church .
according to official doctrine women can not be become priests . " when seven women were ordained priests in 2002 by a dissident bishop in austria , the vatican excommunicated the women within a week or so , " taylor , 24 , said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gisela forster , left , and christine mayr-lumetzberger are two of the seven women who were ordained as priests by argentine bishop romulo braschi in 2002 in defiance of the ban of catholic church on female clergy .
at the time , it was cardinal joseph ratzinger , then head of the congregation for the doctrine of the faith and now pope benedict xvi , who lead the charge against them . yet , judging from responses from the people thronging the streets of cologne , equal rights for women in the church consistently rank among the top demands , reports taylor , who sees the demonstrative ordination of women also as a way to elicit a direct response from the vatican . " the pope is getting annoyed and knows who we are , " she said .
" but we have to use these alternative paths to make our opinions known , because the church is not a democracy and its members have no vote . " even if benedict xvi refuses to recognize women priests , in the future another pope could make a cut with the past , she says .
and the ongoing effort by reformers is having an impact , she adds : " we now have female altar service and women who work as eucharistic ministers .
and in a letter the pope , then a cardinal , made a point of the equality of men and women in public life - except in the church context . " latin american concerns in other regions of the world , such as latin america , where a large majority of the population is catholic , there is not necessarily a less critical view than in europe or north america . " the church has a lot of spiritual and political power in our part of the world , " said 25-year-old andrea ramirez from bolivia who heads the youth chapter of the " we are church " reform movement in her home country .
" but there is also strong support for the gay movement or the feminists . " " we want to show that you can be a good catholic and be gay or lesbian .
or that you can be a good catholic and use condoms , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church still has enormous influence in latin america the ongoing refusal by the vatican to soften its stance on family planning or the use of condoms is particularly detrimental to poor countries , says ramirez . " but maybe the pope has n't had enough time , yet , to properly get in touch with the very real problems of the nations of the south . " the refusal by conservative church leaders to engage in debate sometimes takes forms that amount to keeping information away from young believers , critics say . “ we have seen how nuns accompanying a group of young catholics took away from them the flyers we had just handed out to them , ” reports agnes rudnik , a spokeswoman for the gay and lesbian groups at wyd . cheer the pope , follow your conscience - no problem so is it a contradiction that young people attending wyd are welcoming the pope with overwhelming enthusiasm , yet feel strongly about a number contentious issues on which they are opposed to the pontiff , as reformers claim ?

pope benedict 's visit will add another chapter to the tale of highs and lows , religion , tragedy and rebirth . when the jews first came to cologne in the wake of the roman legions , they were taken by the lush green and fertile land of the rhine valley .
so much so , that they decided to stay and found what is now the oldest jewish community north of the alps .
the first official mention of the community is in a decree from king constantine in 321 ad , granting them membership in the city council .
although cologne is now known for it ’ s cathedral and catholic traditions , back then it was considered the jerusalem of the north . the city 's jewish community struggled on through the centuries as empires , from the romans to the huns , the franks to the ottonians and the germans rose and fell around them .
although the community often played an active role in helping to shape the empires , it was not free from the persecution , pogroms and plagues which characterized the times . short-lived religious freedom discrimination under the rule of emperors , kings and bishops was rife , and it was only when french revolutionary troops occupied the city in 1792 that cologne 's jews received civil rights and religious freedom .
but that freedom did n't last . the nazis ended nearly two millennia of jewish life in cologne .
although some were lucky enough to escape in time , some 11,000 of the city 's jews were deported and murdered at the hands of the hitler regime . rebuilding the community bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city of cologne sometimes the city invites jews who fled the nazis , to come and visit the place where they used to live .
otto spier , who now lives in israel , recently returned to cologne for the first time in more than 60 years . " the view of cologne floats before my eyes again .
what ’ s surprising is that you still have a relationship to your city of birth and that despite everything that ’ s happened , there ’ s still a bond to the things that formed you in your youth , " he said . today , the immigration of jews from the former soviet union means that cologne is once again home to one of germany ’ s largest jewish communities . kirsten serup-bilfeldt -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german pope promises dialogue with jews as pope benedict xvi continued to settle into his role as the new leader of the catholic church , he vowed to promote dialogue with jews as part of an emphasis on interfaith issues .

there are signs that the gap between them and church leaders is narrowing . as world youth day -lrb- wyd -rrb- enters its climactic phase with the arrival of pope benedict xvi on thursday , church critics are also stepping up their activities .
a number of reform organizations from around the world have been handing out flyers and staging events in the city of cologne in an attempt to reach the young people attending the catholic festival . united under the umbrella of the " world youth day 4 all coalition " -lrb- wyd4all -rrb- , they have set up their base for the duration of the gathering in a church in the city center . while there is hardly any room given to controversial issues in the official wyd program , young believers ' response to critical questions has been enormous , says aisha taylor , program director of the us-based women 's ordination conference . " the possibility for priests to get married , the rights of gays and lesbians , more democratic participation for lay people - all these are points on which we would like to see progress , " she said . women priests unsettle leaders a particular focus of taylor 's work concerns the role of women in the church .
according to official doctrine women can not be become priests . " when seven women were ordained priests in 2002 by a dissident bishop in austria , the vatican excommunicated the women within a week or so , " taylor , 24 , said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gisela forster , left , and christine mayr-lumetzberger are two of the seven women who were ordained as priests by argentine bishop romulo braschi in 2002 in defiance of the ban of catholic church on female clergy .
at the time , it was cardinal joseph ratzinger , then head of the congregation for the doctrine of the faith and now pope benedict xvi , who lead the charge against them . yet , judging from responses from the people thronging the streets of cologne , equal rights for women in the church consistently rank among the top demands , reports taylor , who sees the demonstrative ordination of women also as a way to elicit a direct response from the vatican . " the pope is getting annoyed and knows who we are , " she said .
" but we have to use these alternative paths to make our opinions known , because the church is not a democracy and its members have no vote . " even if benedict xvi refuses to recognize women priests , in the future another pope could make a cut with the past , she says .
and the ongoing effort by reformers is having an impact , she adds : " we now have female altar service and women who work as eucharistic ministers .
and in a letter the pope , then a cardinal , made a point of the equality of men and women in public life - except in the church context . " latin american concerns in other regions of the world , such as latin america , where a large majority of the population is catholic , there is not necessarily a less critical view than in europe or north america . " the church has a lot of spiritual and political power in our part of the world , " said 25-year-old andrea ramirez from bolivia who heads the youth chapter of the " we are church " reform movement in her home country .
" but there is also strong support for the gay movement or the feminists . " " we want to show that you can be a good catholic and be gay or lesbian .
or that you can be a good catholic and use condoms , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church still has enormous influence in latin america the ongoing refusal by the vatican to soften its stance on family planning or the use of condoms is particularly detrimental to poor countries , says ramirez . " but maybe the pope has n't had enough time , yet , to properly get in touch with the very real problems of the nations of the south . " the refusal by conservative church leaders to engage in debate sometimes takes forms that amount to keeping information away from young believers , critics say . “ we have seen how nuns accompanying a group of young catholics took away from them the flyers we had just handed out to them , ” reports agnes rudnik , a spokeswoman for the gay and lesbian groups at wyd . cheer the pope , follow your conscience - no problem so is it a contradiction that young people attending wyd are welcoming the pope with overwhelming enthusiasm , yet feel strongly about a number contentious issues on which they are opposed to the pontiff , as reformers claim ? " i don ’ t think there is a contradiction when people cheer the pope and follow their conscience at the same time , ” says tobias raschke , the german spokesman for " we are church . ”
" young people feel it is their church and sincerely want the pope to understand what their concerns are . ” the critics make a strong point that they are part of the church and do consider themselves firmly rooted in the faith . " i really hope our work gives a new impetus for change to the pope , because he ’ s my religious leader after all , ” says ramirez . “ i love my faith and the catholic church , it ’ s my heritage , my tradition " , says aisha taylor . signs of change while wyd is an event that appeals to the masses , many young reformers agree that behind it there is a genuine attempt to reach out to the younger generation .
the efforts and successes of the church in tackling social problems , injustice and poverty around the world is something that draws particularly strong support from young people . one of the few events wyd organizers put on to engage young people in an open debate focused on precisely these themes called " youthhearing . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal oscar rodriguez archbishop of tegucicalpa -lrb- honduras -rrb- held at a community center in cologne on wednesday afternoon , there was rapturous applause from the floor when critics brought up the ban on condom use , which in their view undermines the fight against hiv / aids in poor countries . in their response , german bishop reinhard marx and cardinal oscar rodriguez from honduras stopped just short of actively endorsing condoms , but acknowledged that they can play an important role . a revolution ?

dw-world talked to her about germany in light of the upcoming election . born in atlanta , georgia , neiman studied philosophy at harvard university and berlin 's free university .
she taught philosophy at yale and tel aviv universities .
in her latest book , " fremde sehen anders " -lrb- " strangers see things differently " -rrb- , due out in germany on aug .
24 , neiman argues that germans might be oblivious to the fact that their country is already on the road to recovery . dw-world : how is germa n y doi n g i n your opi n io n ? susan neiman : i think it 's doing much better than germans think it is .
from the outside , it looks like one of the most dynamic places in europe .
berlin is an international magnet .
under this government , the country has flourished more than people have realized .
it 's broken , decisively , with the stigma under which germany was standing for half a century .
not even economically it is as bad as people think it is .
people complain about certain kinds of cuts in social services and economic problems , but the country is fundamentally sound in comparison with other places .
you can have 9 percent economic growth , as china is experiencing , if you drop any concern for human beings and the environment .
what n eeds to happe n i n germa n y to help speed up the cou n try 's recovery ? i think it 's clear that all the industrialized nations still need to come up with concepts about unemployment in view of globalization .
i do n't think any of us have fully grasped what globalization means .
but i think that again , what 's remarkable is that germans think much worse about themselves than anyone else .
i think both the extreme left and members of some of the right have tried to benefit by painting a picture that things are terrible .
they reflect , however , the mood of the people .
you have a sort of mirroring effect .
if people would stop being so pessimistic , a great deal would be accomplished .
east and west germans tend to expect the state to take care of everything .
i think there is an expectation that the state should provide more than people expect in other countries .
there is a sense that if anything goes wrong , one blames it on the government . schröder or merkel ?
who is your perso n al choice for cha n cellor ?
why ? i 'm generally happy with the way the current red-green government has proceeded .
on the whole , they have done a good job and should continue to do so .
i 'm impressed by the ways in which , under the current government , germany has taken large steps towards becoming a more cosmopolitan and less racist country . i am particularly impressed by the difference in their attititudes to the iraq war , during which schröder was willing to take a stand , while merkel assured the bush administration that the cdu would follow american policy , whatever it was .
schröder was sharply criticized for his position - not least in germany , where most people called him opportunistic - but he turned out to be right .
america needs friends who are critical , not who blindly follow whatever very controversial policies happen to be the order of the day .
both schröder and merkel will have to continue painful economic reforms , and there the differences will be small ; the significant differences between them concern foreign policy . what do you like about germa n y ? i like the growing cosmopolitanism , an interest in what people do and think all over the world .
that 's much stronger than in france , england , and the us .
i like the sense of historical interest , i like the interest in preserving good parts of the past and the interest in dealing with bad parts of it .
i like the intelligence and intensity of german public culture . what do you dislike about germa n y ? i dislike the tendency to complain , and to see things in mostly negative terms .
i dislike a certain kind of formality that takes place in many relations . interview conducted by mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de election 2005 click here for dw-world 's complete election coverage .

11 terror attacks in the united states , was convicted by a german court on friday and sentenced to seven years in prison . mounir el motassadeq , the man suspected of helping the sept .
11 hijackers while the cell was preparing the attacks in hamburg , was convicted of being a member of a terrorist organization and sentenced to seven years in prison by a german court on friday . presiding judge ernst-rainer schudt announced the verdict of the moroccan 's year-long retrial hearing without stating the court 's reasons for the decision . support of hamburg cell leads to conviction el motassadeq was convicted on terror-related charges after the prosecution accused him of helping pay tuition and other bills for members of the hamburg cell to allow them to live as students while they plotted the attacks . prosecutors had demanded the maximum sentence of 15 years in prison for el motassadeq , but defense lawyers sought acquittal for the moroccan , who acknowledges he was close to the hijackers but insists he knew nothing of their plans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plumes of smoke pour from the world trade center buildings in new york tuesday , sept .
11 , 2001 .
el motassadeq , who looked on calmly as schudt announced the verdict , was the first man to go on trial over the terrorist attacks in new york and washington that killed more than 3,000 people .
he was found guilty and sentenced the maximum 15 years in prison in february 2003 .
but a german federal tribunal overturned the verdict last year and sent the case back to the court in the northern port city of hamburg , where three of the 19 suicide hijackers lived and studied .
attorney ladislav anisic said there was no evidence that directly linked his client to the plot and argued that motassadeq was being tried simply on guilt by association , which he said was unacceptable under the rule of law in a democracy like germany 's .
" let us not let osama bin laden win here at home by sacrificing our legal foundations , " he argued before the court .
anisic has said he will appeal any verdict other than an acquittal .
us not cooperating german observers say the prosecution 's case had been weakened by the failure of the united states to hand over more information on two top al qaeda operatives in its custody .
the federal court overturned the verdict on the grounds that the hamburg judges had not been able to hear potentially exculpatory testimony from the self-purported mastermind behind the attacks , ramzi binalshibh , and al qaeda 's suspected number three , khalid sheikh mohammed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdelghani mzoudi , left , was freed .
many think motassadeq will also be acquitted .
the us justice department provided two sets of summaries of their interrogation in which the two men reportedly said that motassadeq and fellow moroccan abdelghani mzoudi had had no involvement in the plot .
the prosecution has argued that the accounts are not credible given al qaeda training methods in counterintelligence .
but the reports and the holes in the case were enough to see mzoudi acquitted in hamburg on the same charges motassadeq is again facing .
after his release , mzoudi returned to morocco in june under threat of deportation .
perhaps in the hopes of a similar outcome to his trial , motassadeq has extended his moroccan passport and said he wished to go home as soon as possible .

there are signs that the gap between them and church leaders is narrowing . as world youth day -lrb- wyd -rrb- enters its climactic phase with the arrival of pope benedict xvi on thursday , church critics are also stepping up their activities .
a number of reform organizations from around the world have been handing out flyers and staging events in the city of cologne in an attempt to reach the young people attending the catholic festival . united under the umbrella of the " world youth day 4 all coalition " -lrb- wyd4all -rrb- , they have set up their base for the duration of the gathering in a church in the city center . while there is hardly any room given to controversial issues in the official wyd program , young believers ' response to critical questions has been enormous , says aisha taylor , program director of the us-based women 's ordination conference . " the possibility for priests to get married , the rights of gays and lesbians , more democratic participation for lay people - all these are points on which we would like to see progress , " she said . women priests unsettle leaders a particular focus of taylor 's work concerns the role of women in the church .
according to official doctrine women can not be become priests . " when seven women were ordained priests in 2002 by a dissident bishop in austria , the vatican excommunicated the women within a week or so , " taylor , 24 , said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gisela forster , left , and christine mayr-lumetzberger are two of the seven women who were ordained as priests by argentine bishop romulo braschi in 2002 in defiance of the ban of catholic church on female clergy .
at the time , it was cardinal joseph ratzinger , then head of the congregation for the doctrine of the faith and now pope benedict xvi , who lead the charge against them . yet , judging from responses from the people thronging the streets of cologne , equal rights for women in the church consistently rank among the top demands , reports taylor , who sees the demonstrative ordination of women also as a way to elicit a direct response from the vatican . " the pope is getting annoyed and knows who we are , " she said .
" but we have to use these alternative paths to make our opinions known , because the church is not a democracy and its members have no vote . " even if benedict xvi refuses to recognize women priests , in the future another pope could make a cut with the past , she says .
and the ongoing effort by reformers is having an impact , she adds : " we now have female altar service and women who work as eucharistic ministers .
and in a letter the pope , then a cardinal , made a point of the equality of men and women in public life - except in the church context . " latin american concerns in other regions of the world , such as latin america , where a large majority of the population is catholic , there is not necessarily a less critical view than in europe or north america . " the church has a lot of spiritual and political power in our part of the world , " said 25-year-old andrea ramirez from bolivia who heads the youth chapter of the " we are church " reform movement in her home country .
" but there is also strong support for the gay movement or the feminists . " " we want to show that you can be a good catholic and be gay or lesbian .
or that you can be a good catholic and use condoms , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church still has enormous influence in latin america the ongoing refusal by the vatican to soften its stance on family planning or the use of condoms is particularly detrimental to poor countries , says ramirez . " but maybe the pope has n't had enough time , yet , to properly get in touch with the very real problems of the nations of the south . " the refusal by conservative church leaders to engage in debate sometimes takes forms that amount to keeping information away from young believers , critics say . “ we have seen how nuns accompanying a group of young catholics took away from them the flyers we had just handed out to them , ” reports agnes rudnik , a spokeswoman for the gay and lesbian groups at wyd . cheer the pope , follow your conscience - no problem so is it a contradiction that young people attending wyd are welcoming the pope with overwhelming enthusiasm , yet feel strongly about a number contentious issues on which they are opposed to the pontiff , as reformers claim ? " i don ’ t think there is a contradiction when people cheer the pope and follow their conscience at the same time , ” says tobias raschke , the german spokesman for " we are church . ”
" young people feel it is their church and sincerely want the pope to understand what their concerns are . ” the critics make a strong point that they are part of the church and do consider themselves firmly rooted in the faith . " i really hope our work gives a new impetus for change to the pope , because he ’ s my religious leader after all , ” says ramirez . “ i love my faith and the catholic church , it ’ s my heritage , my tradition " , says aisha taylor . signs of change while wyd is an event that appeals to the masses , many young reformers agree that behind it there is a genuine attempt to reach out to the younger generation .
the efforts and successes of the church in tackling social problems , injustice and poverty around the world is something that draws particularly strong support from young people . one of the few events wyd organizers put on to engage young people in an open debate focused on precisely these themes called " youthhearing . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal oscar rodriguez archbishop of tegucicalpa -lrb- honduras -rrb- held at a community center in cologne on wednesday afternoon , there was rapturous applause from the floor when critics brought up the ban on condom use , which in their view undermines the fight against hiv / aids in poor countries . in their response , german bishop reinhard marx and cardinal oscar rodriguez from honduras stopped just short of actively endorsing condoms , but acknowledged that they can play an important role . a revolution ?

" i thank all of you for our presence in cologne at this great gathering , in the hope that it will mark a step forward on the path towards reconciliation and unity , " said the german-born pope , formerly cardinal joseph ratzinger . by using his visit here to meet with the leaders of jewish and muslim communities , benedict has underscored a pledge made in his first speeches after his election in april that he would use his pontificate to work for christian unity and to build bridges with the other monotheistic religions . benedict 's symbolic visit to cologne 's synagogue at midday on friday will be only the second in modern history , following that of his predecessor john paul ii to rome 's synagogue 19 years ago . " while john paul ii expressed himself through gestures , pope ratzinger gives great space to words .
this pontificate will be a pontificate of concepts and of words , " vatican spokesman joaquin navarro-valls told journalists thursday in a rare public comparison of papal styles . benedict looking to build a youth following seeking to build the same kind of rapport with young people enjoyed by his charismatic predecessor , pope benedict said he would use his trip to " confirm their faith and enliven their hope " .
but his key message of the opening day of a four-day visit to the world youth day festival , though delivered warmly , was uncompromising . bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi waves from the upper deck during a boat trip at the river rhine in cologne on thursday , aug .

pope benedict xvi arrived thursday on his first foreign trip as pontiff to take part in the roman catholic church 's 20th world youth day in cologne . " in these days i encourage you to commit yourselves without reserve to serving christ , whatever the cost , " he told a huge gathering of young people from the top deck of a river cruiser on the rhine .
" share your joys and pains with christ , and let him enlighten your minds with his light and touch your hearts with his grace . " benedict reserved a special welcome for young pilgrims from the orient , including china , where vatican relations with the government are cool . " you are the representatives of so many of our brothers and sisters who are waiting , without realizing it , for the star to rise in their skies and lead them to christ , light of the nations , in whom they will find the fullest response to their hearts ' deepest desires .

in their midst , a young woman dressed like a secretary from a 1950 's film calmly types away on an equally old-fashioned typewriter while listening intently to the man seated opposite her .
a sign beside them reads " if i were chancellor … " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when the man finishes dictating his message to germany 's political leaders , the " secretary " hands him his postcard , complete with postage .
he twirls a wheel of rubber stamps , selects one that says " urgent , " and inks this in bright red across his card .
he then drops the card into a mailbox conveniently located just a few steps away , a look of satisfaction on his face . the scene - part political event , part art happening - causes passersby to slow their pace .
some just watch , while others get in line for a chance to have their say .
it 's all the brainchild of the woman in the red secretary 's costume , american artist and journalist sheryl oring . in the year leading up to the 2004 elections in the united states , oring travelled across her country with a similar project called " i wish to say , " typing over a thousand postcards for people who wanted to voice their concerns to president george w. bush . " the reaction in the states was so great that i thought of trying it in other countries , " says oring , who had previously worked and studied in germany and speaks fluent german . german grammar despite having a good grasp of the language , oring says she was slightly nervous about taking her " show " to germany . bildunterschrift : " i have to tell people to speak slowly because i 'm not a native speaker , and when i 'm done , i give them the chance to read it over and correct the grammar mistakes , " she laughs . but she added that being a foreigner has its advantages , as it makes people curious , and more likely to participate . " i did n't know how it would go over in germany , but people are really into doing it , " oring says .
" people have a lot of concerns about unemployment and social benefits , for example , and they 're really eager to talk about that .
here , people do n't feel the media or the politicians are listening to them , but this project gives them that .
in a way , it 's a service to people , and that 's something that 's been very gratifying . " thomas , a 42-year-old berliner , sat down with oring to tell her about his dissatisfaction with the current economic and social situation in germany .
on his postcard , he wrote to chancellor gerhard schröder of his concern that germany is moving too far in the direction of the us when it comes to labor policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wenn ich kanzler wäre … kunstaktion sheryl oring schreibmaschine " people are being forced into doing any old job , even if it is below their qualifications , just so that they 're back at work , " thomas said , adding that he appreciated oring 's project . " if you express your opinion as part of an art project , you know you wo n't have to face any repercussions , " he said .
" it 's a safe way to do it . " diverse responses while many of the postcards deal with election campaign issues such as unemployment , pensions , and education , other participants used their time at oring 's desk to air their pet peeves , or let their imaginations run wild . " i would charge a big fee for people who do n't clean up after their dogs , " wrote one disgruntled berliner . " i 'd like to be the king of berlin , " wrote another resident whose solution to the city 's problems would be to " open a big casino so everyone would be happy . " queuing up to talk with oring , eight-year-old gabriel excitedly outlined a list of laws he would pass if he were chancellor , including one that would " allow kids to play soccer everywhere . " bildunterschrift : kids get in on the act , too it 's the diversity of responses that keeps oring going .
she is bringing " if i were chancellor " to five german cities over a period of three weeks , and expects to type as many as 200 cards .
she keeps a copy of each card , and is hoping to turn them into an exhibition or a book . " i 'm always amazed at people 's answers , " she says .
" even though i 've done the show before , it never feels repetitive .
when i meet new people and hear a really moving story , that 's when i think it 's all worth it .

his predecessor john paul ii visited the rome synagogue in 1986 . since taking over as the head of the catholic church , the new pope has made clear his intention to maintain a dialogue with jewish leaders such as was nurtured by pope john paul ii .
the late pontiff was much admired in israel for his efforts to promote reconciliation between the vatican and the jewish people . pope benedict xvi has remained true to his word .
his visit to the synagogue in cologne , which is home to the oldest jewish community in germany , is widely viewed as a deeply symbolic gesture , which underlines his determination to foster reconciliation between different faiths at a time of stresses and strains on all sides . bildunterschrift : warm welcome for the pope 's homecoming upon his arrival in germany for world youth day celebrations , the new pope spoke of the importance of planned meetings with jews and muslims . later he said he hoped the presence in cologne of representatives of different christian denominations and those from different religions would " mark a step forward on the path towards reconciliation and unity . " historic visit the president of the central council of jews in germany , paul spiegel , has welcomed the pope 's planned visit , describing it as an " historic event . "

but jubilation about the visit has not poured from all corners , with some suggestions from the jewish community in lower saxony , that the visit to the synagogue was not the same as meeting with jewish representatives , such as john paul ii did on his three visits to germany . the synagogue visit will be followed by talks with muslim leaders on saturday , signifying the pope 's commitment to dialogue with other religions during a summer scarred by islamic terrorist violence with bombings in london and egypt and continued violence in the middle east . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cologne : germany 's oldest jewish community the jewish community in cologne is the oldest in germany , with a history which stretches back 2000 years .

from the outside , it looks like one of the most dynamic places in europe .
berlin is an international magnet .
under this government , the country has flourished more than people have realized .
it 's broken , decisively , with the stigma under which germany was standing for half a century .
not even economically it is as bad as people think it is .

i do n't think any of us have fully grasped what globalization means .
but i think that again , what 's remarkable is that germans think much worse about themselves than anyone else .
i think both the extreme left and members of some of the right have tried to benefit by painting a picture that things are terrible .
they reflect , however , the mood of the people .
you have a sort of mirroring effect .
if people would stop being so pessimistic , a great deal would be accomplished .
east and west germans tend to expect the state to take care of everything .
i think there is an expectation that the state should provide more than people expect in other countries .
there is a sense that if anything goes wrong , one blames it on the government . schröder or merkel ?
who is your perso n al choice for cha n cellor ?
why ? i 'm generally happy with the way the current red-green government has proceeded .
on the whole , they have done a good job and should continue to do so .
i 'm impressed by the ways in which , under the current government , germany has taken large steps towards becoming a more cosmopolitan and less racist country . i am particularly impressed by the difference in their attititudes to the iraq war , during which schröder was willing to take a stand , while merkel assured the bush administration that the cdu would follow american policy , whatever it was .
schröder was sharply criticized for his position - not least in germany , where most people called him opportunistic - but he turned out to be right .
america needs friends who are critical , not who blindly follow whatever very controversial policies happen to be the order of the day .
both schröder and merkel will have to continue painful economic reforms , and there the differences will be small ; the significant differences between them concern foreign policy . what do you like about germa n y ? i like the growing cosmopolitanism , an interest in what people do and think all over the world .
that 's much stronger than in france , england , and the us .
i like the sense of historical interest , i like the interest in preserving good parts of the past and the interest in dealing with bad parts of it .

the stock sale , which comes as google celebrates its first anniversary as a listed company , will partly be used to help fund possible acquisitions .
google stressed that it had no current deals in the offing , and it also would use the money to fund running costs .
shares in google lost $ 5.09 , or 1.79 % , to close at $ 279.75 on thursday .
china beckons " we believe the company is building a war chest for future acquisitions " mark rowen , prudential analyst " the principal purpose of this offering is to obtain additional capital , " google said in a filing with the us securities and exchange commission .
the company said that until suitable buying opportunities arose , it would invest the proceeds of the offering in " highly liquid , investment grade securities " .
" we believe the company is building a war chest for future acquisitions , " said prudential analyst mark rowen in a note to clients .
citigroup analyst mark mahaney said he expected google to " use the proceeds for an acquisition , most likely in international markets . "
commentators have suggested that google may use the cash to gain a stronger foothold in china , following a move by internet rival yahoo to take a 40 % stake in chinese auction website alibaba.com.
merrill lynch analyst lauren rich said google could have chinese internet search engine baidu.com in its sights .
baidu 's shares soared 350 % on their first day of trading on the us nasdaq stock exchange earlier this month .

jeremy colman 's report states that wales ' 22 councils have problems gaining access to funding and in making complex partnerships work .
it claims that better organisation is needed urgently .
the welsh assembly government said regeneration was a top priority and changes had been made to its systems .
' complex and cumbersome ' the report by the auditor general , jeremy colman , is the result of two years work into how public bodies create jobs in deprived areas and improve living conditions .
but it says the current approach is too cumbersome with outcomes not being properly monitored so it is difficult to tell if projects have delivered on their promises .
the report was compiled from research by the wales audit office , which consulted the 22 councils , the welsh assembly government , the welsh local government association , the welsh development agency and focus groups .
it also reviewed a number of regeneration projects and analysed local documentation about regeneration work .
holyhead town centre is to receive a £ 2.5m facelift in his report , mr colman called current regeneration networks " complex , cumbersome , with too many partnership arrangements , funding steams and regimes arising from welsh assembly government initiatives " .
he added : " the approach must be simplified .
" there is an urgent need for better coordinated and simpler frameworks at national and local level . "
' high priority ' mr colman also said local authorities were hindered when it came to longer-term planning because funding was generally short-term .
he recommended councils should develop 10-year local regeneration strategies , the assembly government should simplify funding and make it more long-term and it should also be more coordinated in its regeneration priorities . £ 300m is being spent on improving the heads of the valleys trunk road a spokesman for the assembly government said regeneration was one of its highest priorities and required " co-ordinated action from all parts of government and its partners in the private and voluntary sectors " .
he highlighted the £ 300m heads of the valleys road improvement programme was a prime example of how coordination in planning and regeneration had been developed .
" these developments have been put in place since the research was undertaken for the wales audit office report , " he said .
" we welcome the contribution by the wales audit office in advising on what is working well and what is working less well across local government and the whole public sector in wales .
" the assembly government and its partners will learn from this report and ensure that the progress we have already made is enhanced . "

the opposition had campaigned for a december poll , while some government officials had argued that it should be held towards the end of next year .
president nursultan nazarbayev , who has been in power for more than 15 years , has already said he will stand again .
but he could face a greater challenge this time , as analysts say the opposition has become more effective .
" it is the view of the constitutional court that the next election of the president of the republic of kazakhstan should take place on the first sunday of december of the year 2005 , " court chairman ivan rogov told reporters .
the constitutional court 's decision must be confirmed by parliament .
the controversy over the poll 's timing had centred on different articles of the kazakh constitution .
the opposition had pointed out that article 41 says the presidential term is seven years , and president nazarbayev 's present term began in january 1999 .
but members of the government had stressed that article 94 stipulates that the election should take place on the first sunday in december following the end of a presidential term - which would set an election date for 3 december 2006 .
however , the opposition accused advocates of this later date of just playing for more time .
another revolution ?
kazakhstan has never held an election judged free and fair by western observers .
president nazarbayev recently warned of the destabilising effects of importing western-style democracy too rapidly to central asia .
his remarks followed a wave of popular uprisings in the region , including neighbouring kyrgyzstan and uzbekistan .
some observers have suggested this vast oil-rich country could be another candidate for the popular revolutions which have now unseated three post-soviet presidents .
kazakhstan has the same problems as other countries in the region - of widespread corruption and an elite which has grown very rich through shady business practices .
but life for many people in kazakhstan has actually been improving , partly because of massive foreign investment in caspian sea oil , and this has blunted the demand for rapid political change .

the controversy over the poll 's timing had centred on different articles of the kazakh constitution .
the opposition had pointed out that article 41 says the presidential term is seven years , and president nazarbayev 's present term began in january 1999 .
but members of the government had stressed that article 94 stipulates that the election should take place on the first sunday in december following the end of a presidential term - which would set an election date for 3 december 2006 .
however , the opposition accused advocates of this later date of just playing for more time .
another revolution ?
kazakhstan has never held an election judged free and fair by western observers .
president nazarbayev recently warned of the destabilising effects of importing western-style democracy too rapidly to central asia .
his remarks followed a wave of popular uprisings in the region , including neighbouring kyrgyzstan and uzbekistan .
some observers have suggested this vast oil-rich country could be another candidate for the popular revolutions which have now unseated three post-soviet presidents .
kazakhstan has the same problems as other countries in the region - of widespread corruption and an elite which has grown very rich through shady business practices .
but life for many people in kazakhstan has actually been improving , partly because of massive foreign investment in caspian sea oil , and this has blunted the demand for rapid political change .

by stephen dowling bbc news this week marks 10 years since the height of britpop , when blur and oasis went head-to-head in the charts .
is the current crop of uk bands now picking up where they left off ?
in the mid-1990s , bands like blur , oasis , pulp , suede and supergrass gave british music one of its most successful periods for decades .
but , with the benefit of a decade 's hindsight , was it all just a dummy run for what could be britpop 's finest hour ?
british groups seem to be taking the world by storm again .
franz ferdinand came from nowhere to sell more than a million copies of their debut album in the us alone .
kaiser chiefs , borrowing a guitar-pop template that would have been at home in the heady days of 1994 , have created enough buzz to perform at the philadelphia leg of live 8 .
and keane , a band whose sound owes much to post-britpop groups such as travis and coldplay , have become stars from mexico to new zealand .
as for coldplay , their songs waft out of malls in toronto , beachside bars in bali and moscow nightclubs .
they are arguably the biggest band in the world .
so are we seeing british groups reap the rewards of the efforts of bands a decade ago ?
" you could say that , but you 'd be wrong , " according to andrew mueller , who was reviews editor of music weekly melody maker during the britpop years .
" coldplay 's success in the us has been , if anything , despite oasis and blur , not because of them .
" coldplay have , instead , followed the u2 model - embrace the place , tour relentlessly , show up at every meet-and-greet you 're invited to , smile , be gracious , be humble and do n't complain that the yanks do n't make tea properly . "
mr mueller thinks much of the music from the britpop period has not aged particularly well .
" with that scene , as with others , a lot of really good stuff attracted imitation by a vast legion of ambulance-chasers and bandwagon-jumpers , " he says .
" pulp 's different class and blur 's parklife still sound just dandy .
whereas it is difficult , not to say disturbing , to imagine anyone still listening to menswear . "
menswear guitarist simon white now manages bloc party , one of the most acclaimed bands of the new indie crop , and says most britpop bands were " not really that great " .
like britpop , record labels are again desperate to sign any acts with a certain sound , he says .
" any old band is getting a record deal if you 've got some of the right influences .
" i think the quality 's really low at the moment if anything .
i think there 's very little that will stand the test of time here . "
" these bands today have n't had the phenomenal status at home " mark sutherland bbc 6 music mark sutherland , an ex-melody maker editor and nme staff member who is now news editor of bbc 6 music , thinks this generation 's most successful bands have learned the mistakes of britpop .
but he also says bands as popular as coldplay are not as big as oasis were in 1995 .
" i think it 's hard to understand it unless you were there , " he says .
" they were as big as any british band ever - as big as the beatles .
" these bands today have n't had the phenomenal status at home , they have been more concerned about the international market . "
blur and oasis did not crack american because they did not need america , he argues .
" whereas even a band like franz ferdinand - who are thought of as being a bit more arty - are prepared to play that game . "
franz ferdinand 's million-strong us sales would have been unheard of for mid- ' 90s also-rans such as sleeper , echobelly and cast .
but britpop may go down as britain 's last great unifying music scene , says jody thompson , a former news editor at nme . "
maybe the kaiser chiefs and franz ferdinand can eventually match up to the 90s britpop era but it 's hard to tell right now with only their debut albums to go by . "
kirsty telford your britpop thoughts " that 's not necessarily for it 's quality , but because of the political , artistic and social climate of the time as well , " she says .
" britpop kind of became the poster boy for a resurgence of british culture as a whole and all aspects became interconnected - like damien hirst directing blur 's country house video . "
bands getting success now may find it lasts longer , she says .
" but then it 's probably more liberating for the bands around right now anyway - they can develop at their own speed without the weight of the nation 's expectations on their output . "

by stephen dowling bbc news this week marks 10 years since the height of britpop , when blur and oasis went head-to-head in the charts .
is the current crop of uk bands now picking up where they left off ?
franz ferdinand have sold more than a million albums in the us in the mid-1990s , bands like blur , oasis , pulp , suede and supergrass gave british music one of its most successful periods for decades .
but , with the benefit of a decade 's hindsight , was it all just a dummy run for what could be britpop 's finest hour ?
british groups seem to be taking the world by storm again .
franz ferdinand came from nowhere to sell more than a million copies of their debut album in the us alone .
kaiser chiefs , borrowing a guitar-pop template that would have been at home in the heady days of 1994 , have created enough buzz to perform at the philadelphia leg of live 8 .
and keane , a band whose sound owes much to post-britpop groups such as travis and coldplay , have become stars from mexico to new zealand .
kaiser chiefs - early blur for 2005 ?
as for coldplay , their songs waft out of malls in toronto , beachside bars in bali and moscow nightclubs .
they are arguably the biggest band in the world .
so are we seeing british groups reap the rewards of the efforts of bands a decade ago ?
" you could say that , but you 'd be wrong , " according to andrew mueller , who was reviews editor of music weekly melody maker during the britpop years .
" coldplay 's success in the us has been , if anything , despite oasis and blur , not because of them .
" coldplay have , instead , followed the u2 model - embrace the place , tour relentlessly , show up at every meet-and-greet you 're invited to , smile , be gracious , be humble and do n't complain that the yanks do n't make tea properly . "
mr mueller thinks much of the music from the britpop period has not aged particularly well .
coldplay have had the international success that eluded oasis " with that scene , as with others , a lot of really good stuff attracted imitation by a vast legion of ambulance-chasers and bandwagon-jumpers , " he says .
" pulp 's different class and blur 's parklife still sound just dandy .
whereas it is difficult , not to say disturbing , to imagine anyone still listening to menswear . "
menswear guitarist simon white now manages bloc party , one of the most acclaimed bands of the new indie crop , and says most britpop bands were " not really that great " .
like britpop , record labels are again desperate to sign any acts with a certain sound , he says .
" any old band is getting a record deal if you 've got some of the right influences .
" i think the quality 's really low at the moment if anything .
i think there 's very little that will stand the test of time here . "
these bands today have n't had the phenomenal status at home mark sutherland bbc 6 music mark sutherland , an ex-melody maker editor and nme staff member who is now news editor of bbc 6 music , thinks this generation 's most successful bands have learned the mistakes of britpop .
but he also says bands as popular as coldplay are not as big as oasis were in 1995 .
" i think it 's hard to understand it unless you were there , " he says .
" they were as big as any british band ever - as big as the beatles .
the class of 1995 included jarvis cocker -lrb- left -rrb- and damon albarn -lrb- right -rrb- " these bands today have n't had the phenomenal status at home , they have been more concerned about the international market . "
blur and oasis did not crack american because they did not need america , he argues .
" whereas even a band like franz ferdinand - who are thought of as being a bit more arty - are prepared to play that game . "
franz ferdinand 's million-strong us sales would have been unheard of for mid- ' 90s also-rans such as sleeper , echobelly and cast .
but britpop may go down as britain 's last great unifying music scene , says jody thompson , a former news editor at nme .
maybe the kaiser chiefs and franz ferdinand can eventually match up to the 90s britpop era but it 's hard to tell right now with only their debut albums to go by .
kirsty telford your britpop thoughts " that 's not necessarily for it 's quality , but because of the political , artistic and social climate of the time as well , " she says .
" britpop kind of became the poster boy for a resurgence of british culture as a whole and all aspects became interconnected - like damien hirst directing blur 's country house video . "
bands getting success now may find it lasts longer , she says .
" but then it 's probably more liberating for the bands around right now anyway - they can develop at their own speed without the weight of the nation 's expectations on their output . "

according to molecular analysis of modern strains , the pathogen is much older than previously thought .
as such , it predates other human afflictions such as the plague .
french researchers hope the work will lead to improved diagnosis and treatment of tb , which kills three million people each year .
tb is re-emerging in areas such as eastern europe , south-east asia , and sub-saharan africa , due to the spread of drug-resistant strains of the disease and the rise in hiv .
it is caused by the bacterium mycobacterium tuberculosis , which attacks the lungs , giving rise to symptoms such as coughing , loss of appetite , fever , and night sweats .
' essential genes ' tb has long been a human disease - tissue samples from egyptian mummies over 4,000 years old show signs of infection .
tb is caused by mycobacterium tuberculosis until now , scientists had believed the disease arose a few tens of thousands of years ago and then spread rapidly around the world .
but investigation of a rare tuberculosis-causing bacterium isolated from patients in east africa suggests the roots of the disease go back much further .
molecular analysis indictaes that the east african samples and the commoner strains are all descended from a more ancient bacterial species that emerged in africa as long as three million years ago .
" tuberculosis could thus be much older than the plague , typhoid fever , or malaria , and might have affected early hominids , " said senior researcher veronique vincent of the institut pasteur in paris .
understanding the ancient origins of the bacterium could help in the development of new drugs against tb , which is rapidly growing resistant to the drugs used to treat it .
" now we have in our hands bacteria that are quite different from the others and all are able to produce tb , " co-worker cristina gutierrez told the bbc news website .
" maybe we could find which the essential genes for virulence are . "
the research is published in the first edition of a public library of science -lrb- plos -rrb- journal , plos pathogens .

beijing 's china aviation oil holding company was ordered to pay 8m singaporean dollars -lrb- $ 4.8m ; £ 2.7m -rrb- .

warning shot cao is china 's main supplier of jet fuel and is owned by state-run china aviation oil holding company .
china aviation oil holding company sold a 15 % stake in cao on 20 october , 2004 .

experts say new figures - like those which show wading birds are moving eastwards - reveal the true impact of changes such as milder winters .
ornithologists predict warmer weather could threaten some species , while also attracting new ones to britain .
the study is by a range of groups including the rspb , english nature and the wildfowl and wetlands trust .
seabird breeding the state of uk birds 2004 study found there has been a 6 % rise in the combined populations of 111 widespread bird species since 1970 .
but for every 10 pairs of birds living in farmland in 1970 , less than six remain today .
the report highlighted a rapid decline in numbers of farm birds , like the corn bunting , whereas a number of " generalist " species , such as the wood pigeon , were increasing .
the survey said 2004 was the worst seabird breeding season on record .
migratory birds ' future is linked to concerted global actions to tackle climate change mark avery rspb conservation director this is blamed on a shortage of sand eels , which the birds feed on , and which the report said was more likely to be related to climate change than other factors such as industrial fishing .
the population of wintering ducks , geese , swans and wading birds has dropped to its lowest level for 10 years , while the distribution of seven of the nine common species of wading birds has shifted from the warm west of britain to the colder east since the mid-1980s .
but milder winters were also cited as a possible cause for an increase in some farmland birds , like the song thrush and tree sparrow .
the study also highlighted a general trend for birds to nest earlier and for migrating species to arrive earlier .
rspb conservation director mark avery said : " the impacts of climate change are already evident on the uk 's bird populations and the rspb remains concerned that within our lifetimes these changes are likely to become ever more marked .
survey findings woodland birds , like the lesser spotted woodpecker and willow tit , are continuing to decline , especially in southern england the breeding ranges of the dartford warbler , woodlark and little ringed plover have all spread northwards the has been a reduction in the number of birds living in high altitudes , such as the snow bunting , and high uk latitudes , such as the greenshank " migratory birds are no respecters of international boundaries and their future is linked to concerted global actions to tackle climate change . "
the report predicted the arrival of new species to the uk if warmer summer temperatures become established .
it said potential colonists could include the black kite , the cattle egret , the great reed warbler and the zitting cisticola .
richard hearn of the wildfowl and wetlands trust said : " the latest trends for wintering wildfowl show worrying declines over the past 10 years for a number of species that previously have not been of concern . "
he added : " redistribution of these birds in response to changes in winter climate may be masking our ability to determine whether declines in the uk are representative of the whole population . "

experts say new figures - like those which show wading birds are moving eastwards - reveal the true impact of changes such as milder winters .
ornithologists predict warmer weather could threaten some species , while also attracting new ones to britain .
the study is by a range of groups including the rspb , english nature and the wildfowl and wetlands trust .
seabird breeding the state of uk birds 2004 study found there has been a 6 % rise in the combined populations of 111 widespread bird species since 1970 .
but for every 10 pairs of birds living in farmland in 1970 , less than six remain today .
the report highlighted a rapid decline in numbers of farm birds , like the corn bunting , whereas a number of " generalist " species , such as the wood pigeon , were increasing .
the survey said 2004 was the worst seabird breeding season on record .
migratory birds ' future is linked to concerted global actions to tackle climate change mark avery rspb conservation director this is blamed on a shortage of sand eels , which the birds feed on , and which the report said was more likely to be related to climate change than other factors such as industrial fishing .
the population of wintering ducks , geese , swans and wading birds has dropped to its lowest level for 10 years , while the distribution of seven of the nine common species of wading birds has shifted from the warm west of britain to the colder east since the mid-1980s .
but milder winters were also cited as a possible cause for an increase in some farmland birds , like the song thrush and tree sparrow .
the study also highlighted a general trend for birds to nest earlier and for migrating species to arrive earlier .
rspb conservation director mark avery said : " the impacts of climate change are already evident on the uk 's bird populations and the rspb remains concerned that within our lifetimes these changes are likely to become ever more marked .
survey findings woodland birds , like the lesser spotted woodpecker and willow tit , are continuing to decline , especially in southern england the breeding ranges of the dartford warbler , woodlark and little ringed plover have all spread northwards the has been a reduction in the number of birds living in high altitudes , such as the snow bunting , and high uk latitudes , such as the greenshank " migratory birds are no respecters of international boundaries and their future is linked to concerted global actions to tackle climate change . "
the report predicted the arrival of new species to the uk if warmer summer temperatures become established .
it said potential colonists could include the black kite , the cattle egret , the great reed warbler and the zitting cisticola .
