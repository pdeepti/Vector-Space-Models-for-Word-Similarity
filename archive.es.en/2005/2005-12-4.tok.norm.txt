26 , 2004 , south asia was hit by one of the worst natural catastrophes known to mankind .
a giant tsunami tidal wave devastated the coastlines of 11 countries in the region , killing almost 200,000 people and leaving millions without shelter , food and drinking water . the catastrophe , however , also caused a massive international aid effort with a staggering 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 11.7 billion -rrb- being donated by governments and private individuals to help rebuild the countries hit by the tsunami . in germany alone , 1.1 billion euros have been raised and are currently being spent in south asia .
some 600 million euros came from private donations - a massive cash flood which non-governmental german aid organizations admitted was difficult to handle initially . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a sri lankan woman turns away from the sight of her wrecked house that 's why the biggest german agencies decided earlier this year to organize themselves with a group called " germany helps " in an attempt to guarantee the best possible use of national aid to the tsunami victims . helpi n g to rebuild homes marianne rossbach , the head of the organization , said that almost a third of the 600 million euros has since been channeled through the agency and have been earmarked for both short-term relief and long term reconstruction . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of new homes are still needed " on immediate disaster relief we spent about 17 million euros , " she said .
" we provided temporary shelters , safe drinking water and basic appliances such as cooking utensils needed for survival .
after the first three months we 've begun reconstructing homes and local infrastructure on which we will have spent 60 million euros by the end of the year .
the rest of the money has already been earmarked for more housing projects , as well as for schools and medical infrastructure . " the 10 aid agencies organized within " germany helps " are especially active in sri lanka , and to a lesser degree in india , indonesia and the maldives .
in sri lanka , where about 800,000 people have been left homeless by the tsunami the organization plans to build 1,000 new homes .
117 have already been built this year . a n eed for skilled workers christoph ernesti , head of the liaison office in the capital colombo , said he hopes the pace of construction will accelerate after a number of problems on the ground are overcome .
they include unresolved property rights , a lack of building material and a shortage of skilled workers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skilled workers are lacking " we need more than 2,000 workers , especially stone masons , craftsmen like plumbers and electricians , " he said .
" so we are currently running also vocational programs with the long term aim of training new skilled workers for the country . " such problems are evident in many disaster areas and are sometimes aggravated by conflicts between local communities and national governments or in the case of sri lanka by full-blown ethnic strife , ernesti said .
the security situation there has worsened in recent weeks as clashes between government forces and tamil tiger rebels have intensified , he said . but he dismissed fears of mismanagement and misappropriation of donor funds as a result of a lack of cooperation . " it is going very well now , after nine months , " he said .
" the government of sri lanka has established a special task force and they are doing a very good job .
coordination among the different actors , meaning between the government and the ngos as well as with the various united nations organizations is very good now . " germa n early war n i n g system bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a technician works on board of a german ship as a buoy which will be part of a tsunami warning system is seen in the background of the 1.1 billion euros in overall german tsunami reconstruction aid , about 500 million are being spent by the german government .
the money was pledged by the previous red-green government of former chancellor gerhard schröder and will go into long-term reconstruction projects , including a tsunami early warning system for the indian ocean . parts of the system , which was developed by a german research institute , were delivered last month and are currently being installed . uwe hessler -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german tsunami early warning system takes shape almost 11 months after the devastating tsunami in south asia , a german-developed early warning system has gone into action , with the releasing of the first buoy off the coast of indonesia .

26 , 2004 , south asia was hit by one of the worst natural catastrophes known to mankind .
a giant tsunami tidal wave devastated the coastlines of 11 countries in the region , killing almost 200,000 people and leaving millions without shelter , food and drinking water . the catastrophe , however , also caused a massive international aid effort with a staggering 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 11.7 billion -rrb- being donated by governments and private individuals to help rebuild the countries hit by the tsunami . in germany alone , 1.1 billion euros have been raised and are currently being spent in south asia .
some 600 million euros came from private donations - a massive cash flood which non-governmental german aid organizations admitted was difficult to handle initially . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a sri lankan woman turns away from the sight of her wrecked house that 's why the biggest german agencies decided earlier this year to organize themselves with a group called " germany helps " in an attempt to guarantee the best possible use of national aid to the tsunami victims . helpi n g to rebuild homes marianne rossbach , the head of the organization , said that almost a third of the 600 million euros has since been channeled through the agency and have been earmarked for both short-term relief and long term reconstruction . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of new homes are still needed " on immediate disaster relief we spent about 17 million euros , " she said .
" we provided temporary shelters , safe drinking water and basic appliances such as cooking utensils needed for survival .
after the first three months we 've begun reconstructing homes and local infrastructure on which we will have spent 60 million euros by the end of the year .
the rest of the money has already been earmarked for more housing projects , as well as for schools and medical infrastructure . " the 10 aid agencies organized within " germany helps " are especially active in sri lanka , and to a lesser degree in india , indonesia and the maldives .
in sri lanka , where about 800,000 people have been left homeless by the tsunami the organization plans to build 1,000 new homes .
117 have already been built this year . a n eed for skilled workers christoph ernesti , head of the liaison office in the capital colombo , said he hopes the pace of construction will accelerate after a number of problems on the ground are overcome .
they include unresolved property rights , a lack of building material and a shortage of skilled workers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skilled workers are lacking " we need more than 2,000 workers , especially stone masons , craftsmen like plumbers and electricians , " he said .
" so we are currently running also vocational programs with the long term aim of training new skilled workers for the country . " such problems are evident in many disaster areas and are sometimes aggravated by conflicts between local communities and national governments or in the case of sri lanka by full-blown ethnic strife , ernesti said .
the security situation there has worsened in recent weeks as clashes between government forces and tamil tiger rebels have intensified , he said . but he dismissed fears of mismanagement and misappropriation of donor funds as a result of a lack of cooperation . " it is going very well now , after nine months , " he said .
" the government of sri lanka has established a special task force and they are doing a very good job .
coordination among the different actors , meaning between the government and the ngos as well as with the various united nations organizations is very good now . " germa n early war n i n g system bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a technician works on board of a german ship as a buoy which will be part of a tsunami warning system is seen in the background of the 1.1 billion euros in overall german tsunami reconstruction aid , about 500 million are being spent by the german government .
the money was pledged by the previous red-green government of former chancellor gerhard schröder and will go into long-term reconstruction projects , including a tsunami early warning system for the indian ocean . parts of the system , which was developed by a german research institute , were delivered last month and are currently being installed . uwe hessler -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german tsunami early warning system takes shape almost 11 months after the devastating tsunami in south asia , a german-developed early warning system has gone into action , with the releasing of the first buoy off the coast of indonesia .

" such planes could be used to transfer presumed terrorists and place them in secret locations , " according to the magazine . the report comes on the eve of a visit to germany by us secretary of state condoleezza rice . the list was handed over by the national air navigation security agency at the request of the left party . a german government spokesman confirmed the government had received the list , but said it only revealed " how many times which planes of which companies flew in german airspace or landed at german airports . " the national air navigation security agency did not provide any information " on who had used the planes or their destination , " the spokesman said . did germa n gover n me n t k n ow about flights ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramstein air base in 2002 and 2003 two cia aircraft alone accounted for 137 and 146 uses of german airspace or landings , chiefly at frankfurt in the west , berlin or the us base at ramstein in western germany , according to the report .
germany has the largest number of us bases in europe . in an interview published saturday in the fra n kfurter ru n dschau newspaper the secretary general of the german branch of the human rights organization amnesty international claimed the german government knew of the cia flights . that assertion was contested by wolfgang bosach , a leader of the ruling christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- party , saying if the government knew of them it would be a " serious violation " of the european convention on human rights . the united states have been accused of having operated cia flights since sept .

however , the german government indicated friday that it would not be asking for explanations about the flights , not wanting to exercise " pressure . " der spiegel said the government was worried that the affair could prompt a fundamental debate about the use of german airspace by us planes for the war in iraq and the basing of us troops in germany . berlin has also been asked to inform the 46-member council of europe by feb .

" such planes could be used to transfer presumed terrorists and place them in secret locations , " according to the magazine . the report comes on the eve of a visit to germany by us secretary of state condoleezza rice . the list was handed over by the national air navigation security agency at the request of the left party . a german government spokesman confirmed the government had received the list , but said it only revealed " how many times which planes of which companies flew in german airspace or landed at german airports . " the national air navigation security agency did not provide any information " on who had used the planes or their destination , " the spokesman said . did germa n gover n me n t k n ow about flights ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramstein air base in 2002 and 2003 two cia aircraft alone accounted for 137 and 146 uses of german airspace or landings , chiefly at frankfurt in the west , berlin or the us base at ramstein in western germany , according to the report .
germany has the largest number of us bases in europe . in an interview published saturday in the fra n kfurter ru n dschau newspaper the secretary general of the german branch of the human rights organization amnesty international claimed the german government knew of the cia flights . that assertion was contested by wolfgang bosach , a leader of the ruling christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- party , saying if the government knew of them it would be a " serious violation " of the european convention on human rights . the united states have been accused of having operated cia flights since sept .

however , the german government indicated friday that it would not be asking for explanations about the flights , not wanting to exercise " pressure . " der spiegel said the government was worried that the affair could prompt a fundamental debate about the use of german airspace by us planes for the war in iraq and the basing of us troops in germany . berlin has also been asked to inform the 46-member council of europe by feb .
21 what action it has undertaken in specific cases of " kidnappings " after being told about them , the magazine says . since june 2004 the foreign ministry has had a document from a german citizen of lebanese origin , khaled al-masri , reporting ill-treatment aboard a cia flight .

26 , 2004 , south asia was hit by one of the worst natural catastrophes known to mankind .
a giant tsunami tidal wave devastated the coastlines of 11 countries in the region , killing almost 200,000 people and leaving millions without shelter , food and drinking water . the catastrophe , however , also caused a massive international aid effort with a staggering 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 11.7 billion -rrb- being donated by governments and private individuals to help rebuild the countries hit by the tsunami . in germany alone , 1.1 billion euros have been raised and are currently being spent in south asia .
some 600 million euros came from private donations - a massive cash flood which non-governmental german aid organizations admitted was difficult to handle initially . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a sri lankan woman turns away from the sight of her wrecked house that 's why the biggest german agencies decided earlier this year to organize themselves with a group called " germany helps " in an attempt to guarantee the best possible use of national aid to the tsunami victims . helpi n g to rebuild homes marianne rossbach , the head of the organization , said that almost a third of the 600 million euros has since been channeled through the agency and have been earmarked for both short-term relief and long term reconstruction . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of new homes are still needed " on immediate disaster relief we spent about 17 million euros , " she said .
" we provided temporary shelters , safe drinking water and basic appliances such as cooking utensils needed for survival .
after the first three months we 've begun reconstructing homes and local infrastructure on which we will have spent 60 million euros by the end of the year .
the rest of the money has already been earmarked for more housing projects , as well as for schools and medical infrastructure . " the 10 aid agencies organized within " germany helps " are especially active in sri lanka , and to a lesser degree in india , indonesia and the maldives .
in sri lanka , where about 800,000 people have been left homeless by the tsunami the organization plans to build 1,000 new homes .
117 have already been built this year . a n eed for skilled workers christoph ernesti , head of the liaison office in the capital colombo , said he hopes the pace of construction will accelerate after a number of problems on the ground are overcome .
they include unresolved property rights , a lack of building material and a shortage of skilled workers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skilled workers are lacking " we need more than 2,000 workers , especially stone masons , craftsmen like plumbers and electricians , " he said .
" so we are currently running also vocational programs with the long term aim of training new skilled workers for the country . " such problems are evident in many disaster areas and are sometimes aggravated by conflicts between local communities and national governments or in the case of sri lanka by full-blown ethnic strife , ernesti said .
the security situation there has worsened in recent weeks as clashes between government forces and tamil tiger rebels have intensified , he said . but he dismissed fears of mismanagement and misappropriation of donor funds as a result of a lack of cooperation . " it is going very well now , after nine months , " he said .
" the government of sri lanka has established a special task force and they are doing a very good job .
coordination among the different actors , meaning between the government and the ngos as well as with the various united nations organizations is very good now . " germa n early war n i n g system bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a technician works on board of a german ship as a buoy which will be part of a tsunami warning system is seen in the background of the 1.1 billion euros in overall german tsunami reconstruction aid , about 500 million are being spent by the german government .
the money was pledged by the previous red-green government of former chancellor gerhard schröder and will go into long-term reconstruction projects , including a tsunami early warning system for the indian ocean . parts of the system , which was developed by a german research institute , were delivered last month and are currently being installed . uwe hessler -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german tsunami early warning system takes shape almost 11 months after the devastating tsunami in south asia , a german-developed early warning system has gone into action , with the releasing of the first buoy off the coast of indonesia .

26 , 2004 , south asia was hit by one of the worst natural catastrophes known to mankind .
a giant tsunami tidal wave devastated the coastlines of 11 countries in the region , killing almost 200,000 people and leaving millions without shelter , food and drinking water . the catastrophe , however , also caused a massive international aid effort with a staggering 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 11.7 billion -rrb- being donated by governments and private individuals to help rebuild the countries hit by the tsunami . in germany alone , 1.1 billion euros have been raised and are currently being spent in south asia .
some 600 million euros came from private donations - a massive cash flood which non-governmental german aid organizations admitted was difficult to handle initially . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a sri lankan woman turns away from the sight of her wrecked house that 's why the biggest german agencies decided earlier this year to organize themselves with a group called " germany helps " in an attempt to guarantee the best possible use of national aid to the tsunami victims . helpi n g to rebuild homes marianne rossbach , the head of the organization , said that almost a third of the 600 million euros has since been channeled through the agency and have been earmarked for both short-term relief and long term reconstruction . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of new homes are still needed " on immediate disaster relief we spent about 17 million euros , " she said .
" we provided temporary shelters , safe drinking water and basic appliances such as cooking utensils needed for survival .
after the first three months we 've begun reconstructing homes and local infrastructure on which we will have spent 60 million euros by the end of the year .
the rest of the money has already been earmarked for more housing projects , as well as for schools and medical infrastructure . " the 10 aid agencies organized within " germany helps " are especially active in sri lanka , and to a lesser degree in india , indonesia and the maldives .
in sri lanka , where about 800,000 people have been left homeless by the tsunami the organization plans to build 1,000 new homes .
117 have already been built this year . a n eed for skilled workers christoph ernesti , head of the liaison office in the capital colombo , said he hopes the pace of construction will accelerate after a number of problems on the ground are overcome .
they include unresolved property rights , a lack of building material and a shortage of skilled workers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skilled workers are lacking " we need more than 2,000 workers , especially stone masons , craftsmen like plumbers and electricians , " he said .
" so we are currently running also vocational programs with the long term aim of training new skilled workers for the country . " such problems are evident in many disaster areas and are sometimes aggravated by conflicts between local communities and national governments or in the case of sri lanka by full-blown ethnic strife , ernesti said .
the security situation there has worsened in recent weeks as clashes between government forces and tamil tiger rebels have intensified , he said . but he dismissed fears of mismanagement and misappropriation of donor funds as a result of a lack of cooperation . " it is going very well now , after nine months , " he said .
" the government of sri lanka has established a special task force and they are doing a very good job .
coordination among the different actors , meaning between the government and the ngos as well as with the various united nations organizations is very good now . " germa n early war n i n g system bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a technician works on board of a german ship as a buoy which will be part of a tsunami warning system is seen in the background of the 1.1 billion euros in overall german tsunami reconstruction aid , about 500 million are being spent by the german government .
the money was pledged by the previous red-green government of former chancellor gerhard schröder and will go into long-term reconstruction projects , including a tsunami early warning system for the indian ocean . parts of the system , which was developed by a german research institute , were delivered last month and are currently being installed . uwe hessler -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german tsunami early warning system takes shape almost 11 months after the devastating tsunami in south asia , a german-developed early warning system has gone into action , with the releasing of the first buoy off the coast of indonesia .

" such planes could be used to transfer presumed terrorists and place them in secret locations , " according to the magazine . the report comes on the eve of a visit to germany by us secretary of state condoleezza rice . the list was handed over by the national air navigation security agency at the request of the left party . a german government spokesman confirmed the government had received the list , but said it only revealed " how many times which planes of which companies flew in german airspace or landed at german airports .

germany has the largest number of us bases in europe . in an interview published saturday in the fra n kfurter ru n dschau newspaper the secretary general of the german branch of the human rights organization amnesty international claimed the german government knew of the cia flights . that assertion was contested by wolfgang bosach , a leader of the ruling christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- party , saying if the government knew of them it would be a " serious violation " of the european convention on human rights . the united states have been accused of having operated cia flights since sept .

she has said she will give answers before embarking on her tour . on tuesday she will meet germany 's new conservative chancellor angela merkel .
however , the german government indicated friday that it would not be asking for explanations about the flights , not wanting to exercise " pressure . " der spiegel said the government was worried that the affair could prompt a fundamental debate about the use of german airspace by us planes for the war in iraq and the basing of us troops in germany . berlin has also been asked to inform the 46-member council of europe by feb .
21 what action it has undertaken in specific cases of " kidnappings " after being told about them , the magazine says . since june 2004 the foreign ministry has had a document from a german citizen of lebanese origin , khaled al-masri , reporting ill-treatment aboard a cia flight .

if that proves successful , the venture could be expanded to airports such as düsseldorf or stuttgart , a lufthansa spokesman said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after trying to compete with first-class service , lufthansa is now turning to discount models " lufthansa has learned a lot from the business models of low-cost carriers and is seeking to combine that knowledge with its own strengths , " said ralph beisel , an airline expert at arthur d. little , in a recent study . respo n se to market co n ditio n s in hamburg , for example , the german airline aimed to boost the number of flights by 14 percent and the number of seats available by 30 percent , the spokesman said . beisel calculated that lufthansa could boost earnings on its hamburg services by 20 percent as long as it cut prices and costs and increased tickets sales . lufthansa insists the hamburg offensive is not a strategic u-turn , simply a response to changing market conditions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite appearances , düsseldorf is warming up to lufthansa " by expanding our program in hamburg and düsseldorf , we 're reacting to strong demand in both cities , " the spokesman said . too complace n t for too lo n g ? the regional state transport ministry in düsseldorf , for example , had recently given the go-ahead for the airport to boost capacity , including the launch of new routes to destinations such as madrid and nice . " given the economic strength of north rhine-westphalia , the demand for frequent services , particularly on the part of business customers , is high , " the spokesman said . analysts said that lufthansa had been complacent on the german market for too long . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : walking from the jet to the terminal is something discount airline passangers seem to accept " it 's a matter of not losing additional market share to the low-cost airlines , " said merck finck analyst robert heberger .
" alongside britain , germany is one of the most competitive markets in europe . " the irish cut-price carrier ryanair and britain 's own easyjet had already established a strong presence in germany . discou n ters cross-promote but native german rivals such as air berlin and dba also recently stepped up their campaign to dethrone lufthansa . dba recently placed an order for 40 new boeing 737 jets with the explicit aim of becoming the number one airline in the domestic german market . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : air berlin is seeking cooperations with other discounters and the smaller low-cost rivals are also forging alliances to increase the pressure on lufthansa : air berlin is teaming up with aircraft leaser germania and from dec .
1 , air berlin and dba have agreed to market each other 's tickets on their own web sites . while the loose arrangement did not extend to full code-sharing and the two airlines were not planning to acquire any cross-shareholdings , some analysts believe the move could eventually pave the way to a full merger . " not everyone is going to survive , " herberger said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 04.12.2005 lufthansa takes on low-cost airlines großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : going head-to-head with discounters in the battle for domination in the german skies , lufthansa is seeking to beat low-cost rivals at their own game by expanding its own network of cut-price domestic and european services . only a few years ago , lufthansa scaled back its european services from airports other than the two main hubs of frankfurt and munich to focus on long-haul routes . but now it wants to take on budget rivals by boosting its own network of german and european flights from secondary hubs such as düsseldorf and hamburg . a pilot project is already underway in hamburg .
if that proves successful , the venture could be expanded to airports such as düsseldorf or stuttgart , a lufthansa spokesman said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after trying to compete with first-class service , lufthansa is now turning to discount models " lufthansa has learned a lot from the business models of low-cost carriers and is seeking to combine that knowledge with its own strengths , " said ralph beisel , an airline expert at arthur d. little , in a recent study . respo n se to market co n ditio n s in hamburg , for example , the german airline aimed to boost the number of flights by 14 percent and the number of seats available by 30 percent , the spokesman said . beisel calculated that lufthansa could boost earnings on its hamburg services by 20 percent as long as it cut prices and costs and increased tickets sales . lufthansa insists the hamburg offensive is not a strategic u-turn , simply a response to changing market conditions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite appearances , düsseldorf is warming up to lufthansa " by expanding our program in hamburg and düsseldorf , we 're reacting to strong demand in both cities , " the spokesman said . too complace n t for too lo n g ? the regional state transport ministry in düsseldorf , for example , had recently given the go-ahead for the airport to boost capacity , including the launch of new routes to destinations such as madrid and nice . " given the economic strength of north rhine-westphalia , the demand for frequent services , particularly on the part of business customers , is high , " the spokesman said . analysts said that lufthansa had been complacent on the german market for too long . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : walking from the jet to the terminal is something discount airline passangers seem to accept " it 's a matter of not losing additional market share to the low-cost airlines , " said merck finck analyst robert heberger .
" alongside britain , germany is one of the most competitive markets in europe . " the irish cut-price carrier ryanair and britain 's own easyjet had already established a strong presence in germany . discou n ters cross-promote but native german rivals such as air berlin and dba also recently stepped up their campaign to dethrone lufthansa . dba recently placed an order for 40 new boeing 737 jets with the explicit aim of becoming the number one airline in the domestic german market . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : air berlin is seeking cooperations with other discounters and the smaller low-cost rivals are also forging alliances to increase the pressure on lufthansa : air berlin is teaming up with aircraft leaser germania and from dec .
1 , air berlin and dba have agreed to market each other 's tickets on their own web sites . while the loose arrangement did not extend to full code-sharing and the two airlines were not planning to acquire any cross-shareholdings , some analysts believe the move could eventually pave the way to a full merger .

if that proves successful , the venture could be expanded to airports such as düsseldorf or stuttgart , a lufthansa spokesman said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after trying to compete with first-class service , lufthansa is now turning to discount models " lufthansa has learned a lot from the business models of low-cost carriers and is seeking to combine that knowledge with its own strengths , " said ralph beisel , an airline expert at arthur d. little , in a recent study . respo n se to market co n ditio n s in hamburg , for example , the german airline aimed to boost the number of flights by 14 percent and the number of seats available by 30 percent , the spokesman said . beisel calculated that lufthansa could boost earnings on its hamburg services by 20 percent as long as it cut prices and costs and increased tickets sales . lufthansa insists the hamburg offensive is not a strategic u-turn , simply a response to changing market conditions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite appearances , düsseldorf is warming up to lufthansa " by expanding our program in hamburg and düsseldorf , we 're reacting to strong demand in both cities , " the spokesman said . too complace n t for too lo n g ? the regional state transport ministry in düsseldorf , for example , had recently given the go-ahead for the airport to boost capacity , including the launch of new routes to destinations such as madrid and nice . " given the economic strength of north rhine-westphalia , the demand for frequent services , particularly on the part of business customers , is high , " the spokesman said . analysts said that lufthansa had been complacent on the german market for too long . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : walking from the jet to the terminal is something discount airline passangers seem to accept " it 's a matter of not losing additional market share to the low-cost airlines , " said merck finck analyst robert heberger .
" alongside britain , germany is one of the most competitive markets in europe . " the irish cut-price carrier ryanair and britain 's own easyjet had already established a strong presence in germany . discou n ters cross-promote but native german rivals such as air berlin and dba also recently stepped up their campaign to dethrone lufthansa . dba recently placed an order for 40 new boeing 737 jets with the explicit aim of becoming the number one airline in the domestic german market . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : air berlin is seeking cooperations with other discounters and the smaller low-cost rivals are also forging alliances to increase the pressure on lufthansa : air berlin is teaming up with aircraft leaser germania and from dec .
1 , air berlin and dba have agreed to market each other 's tickets on their own web sites . while the loose arrangement did not extend to full code-sharing and the two airlines were not planning to acquire any cross-shareholdings , some analysts believe the move could eventually pave the way to a full merger .

if that proves successful , the venture could be expanded to airports such as düsseldorf or stuttgart , a lufthansa spokesman said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after trying to compete with first-class service , lufthansa is now turning to discount models " lufthansa has learned a lot from the business models of low-cost carriers and is seeking to combine that knowledge with its own strengths , " said ralph beisel , an airline expert at arthur d. little , in a recent study . respo n se to market co n ditio n s in hamburg , for example , the german airline aimed to boost the number of flights by 14 percent and the number of seats available by 30 percent , the spokesman said . beisel calculated that lufthansa could boost earnings on its hamburg services by 20 percent as long as it cut prices and costs and increased tickets sales . lufthansa insists the hamburg offensive is not a strategic u-turn , simply a response to changing market conditions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite appearances , düsseldorf is warming up to lufthansa " by expanding our program in hamburg and düsseldorf , we 're reacting to strong demand in both cities , " the spokesman said . too complace n t for too lo n g ? the regional state transport ministry in düsseldorf , for example , had recently given the go-ahead for the airport to boost capacity , including the launch of new routes to destinations such as madrid and nice . " given the economic strength of north rhine-westphalia , the demand for frequent services , particularly on the part of business customers , is high , " the spokesman said . analysts said that lufthansa had been complacent on the german market for too long . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : walking from the jet to the terminal is something discount airline passangers seem to accept " it 's a matter of not losing additional market share to the low-cost airlines , " said merck finck analyst robert heberger .

if that proves successful , the venture could be expanded to airports such as düsseldorf or stuttgart , a lufthansa spokesman said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after trying to compete with first-class service , lufthansa is now turning to discount models " lufthansa has learned a lot from the business models of low-cost carriers and is seeking to combine that knowledge with its own strengths , " said ralph beisel , an airline expert at arthur d. little , in a recent study . respo n se to market co n ditio n s in hamburg , for example , the german airline aimed to boost the number of flights by 14 percent and the number of seats available by 30 percent , the spokesman said . beisel calculated that lufthansa could boost earnings on its hamburg services by 20 percent as long as it cut prices and costs and increased tickets sales . lufthansa insists the hamburg offensive is not a strategic u-turn , simply a response to changing market conditions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite appearances , düsseldorf is warming up to lufthansa " by expanding our program in hamburg and düsseldorf , we 're reacting to strong demand in both cities , " the spokesman said . too complace n t for too lo n g ? the regional state transport ministry in düsseldorf , for example , had recently given the go-ahead for the airport to boost capacity , including the launch of new routes to destinations such as madrid and nice . " given the economic strength of north rhine-westphalia , the demand for frequent services , particularly on the part of business customers , is high , " the spokesman said . analysts said that lufthansa had been complacent on the german market for too long . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : walking from the jet to the terminal is something discount airline passangers seem to accept " it 's a matter of not losing additional market share to the low-cost airlines , " said merck finck analyst robert heberger .
" alongside britain , germany is one of the most competitive markets in europe . " the irish cut-price carrier ryanair and britain 's own easyjet had already established a strong presence in germany . discou n ters cross-promote but native german rivals such as air berlin and dba also recently stepped up their campaign to dethrone lufthansa . dba recently placed an order for 40 new boeing 737 jets with the explicit aim of becoming the number one airline in the domestic german market . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : air berlin is seeking cooperations with other discounters and the smaller low-cost rivals are also forging alliances to increase the pressure on lufthansa : air berlin is teaming up with aircraft leaser germania and from dec .

high speed wi-fi is on the horizon wireless philadelphia is a project that has been in development for several years , but which will not be finished until late 2006 .
it seems such an agreeable proposition to everybody involved - cheap wi-fi for an entire city .
" a citizen will pay a base fee of $ 10 or $ 20 depending upon their income status , for access to the network , " explained the city 's chief information officer , dianah neff .
however , the project has stirred up a hornet 's nest , and has implications for the whole of america .
hot zones currently there are just hot zones around philadelphia offering free wi-fi service , acting as test areas .
there is a question here about whether the competition is fair when the government has advantages of borrowing money , owning and perhaps giving away real estate access , regulating and taxing us eric rabe , verizon the bulk of the actual hardware needed to cover the 135-square-mile metro area is yet to be installed .
the routers , usually mounted on street lighting fixtures , can be placed anywhere high up where there is a power supply .
some 3,000 of the devices will eventually make up a mesh network .
" what is very different about a mesh , versus a cellular network , is that we get the radios very close to where the customer is , " said chris rittler of tropos networks .
" what this does is actually pretty amazing .
it enables off-the-shelf devices such as laptops , pdas and wi-fi phones to connect easily .
it also really reduces the requirements on those devices . "
big ideas philadelphia is by no means the first place in the us to do this , but with 1.5 million people it is the biggest .
philadelphia compares municipal wi-fi to the city 's water and electricity other locations include alexandria in virginia , jamestown in new york , and rio rancho in new mexico .
philadelphia differs from the usual model of municipal wi-fi because it has entered into a profit-sharing , private-public sector partnership .
it chose the isp earthlink to provide the set-up and maintenance costs , as well as the billing services .
the initial outlay is estimated at $ 15 million .
when dianah neff announced the project she faced an immediate legal and lobbying onslaught from the giant telecommunications companies , led by verizon .
it was alarmed that the government of america 's fifth largest city was getting involved in wi-fi at all , and that the fees would be a fraction of the cost of a private fast internet connection , typically around $ 45-60 per month when bundled with a mandatory landline telephone service .
" there is a question here about whether the competition is fair when the government has advantages of borrowing money , owning and perhaps giving away real estate access , regulating and taxing us , " said eric rabe of verizon .
" if you are in a position where you can regulate and tax your competitor , it certainly gives you an advantage .
that is a whole fairness question that i think ought to be worked through and thought about . "
digital divide verizon lost its fight in philadelphia but has succeeded in getting the law changed in the rest of the state .
essentially it has become almost impossible for any other community to set up its own wi-fi system .
several other states have also enacted similar bans , often supported by local politicians who have connections to telecommunications corporations .
however philadelphia says that too many low income families can not afford high broadband prices and the service is needed to shrink the digital divide between rich and poor .
the city now sees internet access as an essential service just like street lighting and sanitation .
but governments are not the only ones that have seen the huge opportunities ahead .
there are also non-telecommunications companies willing to set up entire networks .
profit google is planning to provide free wi-fi access to mountain view in california .
google is next in line to provide free wi-fi access in california the reason is simple - any company that owns the login page of a local wi-fi network can cover it with profit-generating links and advertisements .
in philadelphia the login page belongs to philadelphia cloud .
" they get to see everything around them , so they get presented with information from hotels nearby , from the museums , coffee shops and restaurants , " said bailey white of philadelphia cloud .
" we are actually finding that several people are saying ' you know what , this is great .
i did n't know about those things and i 'm really happy to be here and take advantage of those activities ' . "
more and more people are hearing about citywide wi-fi and the newer more powerful technology called wimax , if only because of the political and corporate battles going on across the country .
but as they do , the reaction amongst residents is , perhaps surprisingly , not clear cut .
what is certain is that everybody will be watching the philadelphia experiment to see if it becomes a big success or mess .

it chose the isp earthlink to provide the set-up and maintenance costs , as well as the billing services .
the initial outlay is estimated at $ 15 million .
when dianah neff announced the project she faced an immediate legal and lobbying onslaught from the giant telecommunications companies , led by verizon .
it was alarmed that the government of america 's fifth largest city was getting involved in wi-fi at all , and that the fees would be a fraction of the cost of a private fast internet connection , typically around $ 45-60 per month when bundled with a mandatory landline telephone service .
" there is a question here about whether the competition is fair when the government has advantages of borrowing money , owning and perhaps giving away real estate access , regulating and taxing us , " said eric rabe of verizon .
" if you are in a position where you can regulate and tax your competitor , it certainly gives you an advantage .
that is a whole fairness question that i think ought to be worked through and thought about . "
digital divide verizon lost its fight in philadelphia but has succeeded in getting the law changed in the rest of the state .
essentially it has become almost impossible for any other community to set up its own wi-fi system .
several other states have also enacted similar bans , often supported by local politicians who have connections to telecommunications corporations .
however philadelphia says that too many low income families can not afford high broadband prices and the service is needed to shrink the digital divide between rich and poor .
the city now sees internet access as an essential service just like street lighting and sanitation .
but governments are not the only ones that have seen the huge opportunities ahead .
there are also non-telecommunications companies willing to set up entire networks .
profit google is planning to provide free wi-fi access to mountain view in california .
google is next in line to provide free wi-fi access in california the reason is simple - any company that owns the login page of a local wi-fi network can cover it with profit-generating links and advertisements .
in philadelphia the login page belongs to philadelphia cloud .
" they get to see everything around them , so they get presented with information from hotels nearby , from the museums , coffee shops and restaurants , " said bailey white of philadelphia cloud .
" we are actually finding that several people are saying ' you know what , this is great .
i did n't know about those things and i 'm really happy to be here and take advantage of those activities ' . "
more and more people are hearing about citywide wi-fi and the newer more powerful technology called wimax , if only because of the political and corporate battles going on across the country .
but as they do , the reaction amongst residents is , perhaps surprisingly , not clear cut .
what is certain is that everybody will be watching the philadelphia experiment to see if it becomes a big success or mess .

bbc news -pipe- programmes -pipe- click online -pipe- wi-fi venture tests philadelphia bbc news / click online graphics version bbc sport home click -pipe- about the programme -pipe- archive -pipe- buyers ' guides -pipe- inbox -pipe- meet the team -pipe- sunday , 4 december 2005 , 08:37 gmt wi-fi venture tests philadelphia by ian hardy bbc click online north america technology correspondent ian hardy reports from the us , where a city government had to fight hard to go wireless .
wireless philadelphia is a project that has been in development for several years , but which will not be finished until late 2006 .
it seems such an agreeable proposition to everybody involved - cheap wi-fi for an entire city .
" a citizen will pay a base fee of $ 10 or $ 20 depending upon their income status , for access to the network , " explained the city 's chief information officer , dianah neff .
however , the project has stirred up a hornet 's nest , and has implications for the whole of america .
hot zones currently there are just hot zones around philadelphia offering free wi-fi service , acting as test areas . "
there is a question here about whether the competition is fair when the government has advantages of borrowing money , owning and perhaps giving away real estate access , regulating and taxing us " eric rabe , verizon the bulk of the actual hardware needed to cover the 135-square-mile metro area is yet to be installed .
the routers , usually mounted on street lighting fixtures , can be placed anywhere high up where there is a power supply .
some 3,000 of the devices will eventually make up a mesh network .
" what is very different about a mesh , versus a cellular network , is that we get the radios very close to where the customer is , " said chris rittler of tropos networks .
" what this does is actually pretty amazing .
it enables off-the-shelf devices such as laptops , pdas and wi-fi phones to connect easily .
it also really reduces the requirements on those devices . "
big ideas philadelphia is by no means the first place in the us to do this , but with 1.5 million people it is the biggest .
other locations include alexandria in virginia , jamestown in new york , and rio rancho in new mexico .
philadelphia differs from the usual model of municipal wi-fi because it has entered into a profit-sharing , private-public sector partnership .
it chose the isp earthlink to provide the set-up and maintenance costs , as well as the billing services .

farming practices are blamed for nitrate pollution more farmers in the south west are being told to restrict the amount of chemicals they put on their land .
the issue is the latest in a long-running saga about how an eu directive on the use of fertilisers should be implemented in this country .
a greater number of areas identified as being vulnerable to nitrate pollution were identified three years ago - and the european union says regulation should be toughened up .
but farmers say this is yet more regulation that could tip some out of business .
the national farmers ' union disputes the science behind the regulations , particularly the limits set for the amount of nitrates and manure that should be spread .
the government imposed tough rules on farmers who were identified in a map of nitrate vulnerable zones -lrb- nvz -rrb- drawn up in 1996 .
six years later , the areas covered by a new nvz map were much larger .
restrictions on farms first identified continued to be restricted , but the government retained a lighter touch approach to the rest .
but the european union has said that approach is not acceptable and all such farmers within nvzs should be subject to the same rules .
the environment agency told the politics show that it was important to restrict nitrates as they promote plant growth in rivers and streams , choking other plant life .
it sympathised with farmers , but said that ultimately any regulations are bound to affect someone .
john daw , who farms in north devon , is in such a zone .
until this week his farm was not subject to the same restrictions about levels of nitrates as others .
on thursday 1 december 2005 he received a letter from the environment agency telling him that he will be affected .
" i just do not know where the money is expected to come from to do this , " he said .
anthony gibson , regional director of the nfu in the south west says : " this is a regulatory sledge-hammer to crack a non-existent nut .
" it will lead to land being abandoned , creameries and abattoirs being closed .
it really is that serious and all for no perceptible benefit in pollution terms . "
ian liddell-grainger , conservative mp for bridgwater , said : " i would just say to the government - wait , hold on , do not do it . "
the department of the environment , foot and rural affairs claimed , on their website , that better use of nitrates means greater profits for farmers .
fertiliser is not wasted and the environment benefits from the lower quantities of nitrates that leach into the water system .

bbc news -pipe- programmes -pipe- politics show -pipe- south west : water pollution bbc news / politics show graphics version bbc sport home politics show -pipe- archive -pipe- contact us -pipe- faqs -pipe- interviews -pipe- meet the team -pipe- sunday , 4 december 2005 , 08:46 gmt south west : water pollution marcus wraight the politics show south west following our story about the restrictions on the use of tallow as a biofuel , defra has asked us to clarify that it is not banning the burning of tallow from 01 january 2006 .
more farmers in the south west are being told to restrict the amount of chemicals they put on their land .
the issue is the latest in a long-running saga about how an eu directive on the use of fertilisers should be implemented in this country .
a greater number of areas identified as being vulnerable to nitrate pollution were identified three years ago - and the european union says regulation should be toughened up .
but farmers say this is yet more regulation that could tip some out of business .
the national farmers ' union disputes the science behind the regulations , particularly the limits set for the amount of nitrates and manure that should be spread .
the government imposed tough rules on farmers who were identified in a map of nitrate vulnerable zones -lrb- nvz -rrb- drawn up in 1996 .
six years later , the areas covered by a new nvz map were much larger .
restrictions on farms first identified continued to be restricted , but the government retained a lighter touch approach to the rest .
but the european union has said that approach is not acceptable and all such farmers within nvzs should be subject to the same rules .
the environment agency told the politics show that it was important to restrict nitrates as they promote plant growth in rivers and streams , choking other plant life .
it sympathised with farmers , but said that ultimately any regulations are bound to affect someone .
john daw , who farms in north devon , is in such a zone .
until this week his farm was not subject to the same restrictions about levels of nitrates as others .
on thursday 1 december 2005 he received a letter from the environment agency telling him that he will be affected .
" i just do not know where the money is expected to come from to do this , " he said .
anthony gibson , regional director of the nfu in the south west says : " this is a regulatory sledge-hammer to crack a non-existent nut .
" it will lead to land being abandoned , creameries and abattoirs being closed .
it really is that serious and all for no perceptible benefit in pollution terms . "
ian liddell-grainger , conservative mp for bridgwater , said : " i would just say to the government - wait , hold on , do not do it . "
the department of the environment , foot and rural affairs claimed , on their website , that better use of nitrates means greater profits for farmers .
fertiliser is not wasted and the environment benefits from the lower quantities of nitrates that leach into the water system .

campaigners argue bringing the law on cigarettes into line with that on alcohol would reduce under-age smokers .
the government has promised to look into their evidence , but department sources told the bbc the law was unlikely to change in the near future .
