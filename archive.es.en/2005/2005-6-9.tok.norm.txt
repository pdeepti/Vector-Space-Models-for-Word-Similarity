washington has thrown a wrench into berlin ’ s aspirations of becoming a permanent member of the un security council , arguing that the expansion of the body is not its top reform priority . at a joint press conference with german foreign minister joschka fischer on wednesday , us secretary of state condoleezza rice held back on endorsing germany 's bid to become a permanent member of the un security council , arguing that other un reforms such as streamlining management were more important than the expansion of the top decision-making body from the current 15 members to 25 , as proposed by germany , japan , india and brazil . while generally acknowledging the need of a reform , rice , however , said the united states was looking closely at the various proposals to have " a sober and reflective discussion " aimed at achieving " the broadest possible consensus on how to move forward on what would be a very fundamental change . " and so our plan at this point is to try , through the appropriate channels at the un , the presidency of the general assembly and so forth , to promote that dialogue on what it is that we are trying to achieve in security council reform as well as in the broader un reform , " she said . support for one of four support for the reform initiative and the four contenders for permanent seats is far from certain .
on wednesday , rice said the us was not ready to endorse all four countries and their bid for permanent seats .
although she reiterated washington 's interest in reforming the council , she left the door wide open in terms of the exact context of the expansion proposal . " the only country that we have said unequivocally that we support is japan , having to do with japan 's special role in the un and support for the un , " rice said .
" but obviously , we are going to look at how to think about un security council expansion within the context of … broader reforms . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flags wave in front of un headquarters in new york despite the stated preference for only one of the four bidders , german officials interpreted rice 's statements as less of a rebuff of berlin 's efforts to join the council , and more of a general wariness to expansion . " we were given to understand by the united states that their concerns about this procedure are not motivated by any anti-german considerations , " said wolfgang ischinger , the german ambassador to the united states , who attended the meeting with rice and fischer . however , several other european and asian diplomats who asked to remain anonymous have indicated that one of the factors in the us position on security council expansion was its continuing distrust of german chancellor gerhard schöder 's strong opposition to the us-led war in iraq . back to the drafting board ? the reform proposal favored by germany , japan , india and brazil initially called for the adoption of a resolution which would add 10 new members to the council , six permanent members and four non-permanent ones , which would rotate for two-year terms .
the council currently consists of five permanent members , france , britain , china , russia and the united states , and 10 non-permanent rotating members . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leaders from india , japan , brazil and germany team up to lobby for un reform the four chief contenders for permanent seats , germany , japan , india and brazil , had joined forces to lobby for their reform plans over the past year , arguing that the un 's highest body needed to better reflect the current geo-political situation and the amount each of them contributes financially and otherwise to the un . but on wednesday , the initiative was shaken up a bit after the four chief contenders revised their proposal and dropped the right to a veto for the first 15 years for new permanent members , in the hopes that their resolution would be adopted as early as this month .
diplomats speculate that the four contenders have about 100 of the 191 un members behind them , far short of the two-thirds majority needed to pass the reform resolution . five powers divided among the current five council members , only france and britain support all four of the new bidders .
china openly opposes any seat for japan while russia 's position remains unclear . within the general assembly , diplomats say germany faces the least opposition , while muslim nations are expected to organize against india and developing nations are believed to want to block japan 's aspirations . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer discusses eu future in us on what could be his farewell trip to the united states as germany 's foreign minister , joschka fischer discussed turkish membership in the eu and the eu role in the world in the aftermath of the consitutional crisis .

washington has thrown a wrench into berlin ’ s aspirations of becoming a permanent member of the un security council , arguing that the expansion of the body is not its top reform priority . at a joint press conference with german foreign minister joschka fischer on wednesday , us secretary of state condoleezza rice held back on endorsing germany 's bid to become a permanent member of the un security council , arguing that other un reforms such as streamlining management were more important than the expansion of the top decision-making body from the current 15 members to 25 , as proposed by germany , japan , india and brazil . while generally acknowledging the need of a reform , rice , however , said the united states was looking closely at the various proposals to have " a sober and reflective discussion " aimed at achieving " the broadest possible consensus on how to move forward on what would be a very fundamental change . " and so our plan at this point is to try , through the appropriate channels at the un , the presidency of the general assembly and so forth , to promote that dialogue on what it is that we are trying to achieve in security council reform as well as in the broader un reform , " she said . support for one of four support for the reform initiative and the four contenders for permanent seats is far from certain .
on wednesday , rice said the us was not ready to endorse all four countries and their bid for permanent seats .
although she reiterated washington 's interest in reforming the council , she left the door wide open in terms of the exact context of the expansion proposal . " the only country that we have said unequivocally that we support is japan , having to do with japan 's special role in the un and support for the un , " rice said .
" but obviously , we are going to look at how to think about un security council expansion within the context of … broader reforms . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flags wave in front of un headquarters in new york despite the stated preference for only one of the four bidders , german officials interpreted rice 's statements as less of a rebuff of berlin 's efforts to join the council , and more of a general wariness to expansion . " we were given to understand by the united states that their concerns about this procedure are not motivated by any anti-german considerations , " said wolfgang ischinger , the german ambassador to the united states , who attended the meeting with rice and fischer . however , several other european and asian diplomats who asked to remain anonymous have indicated that one of the factors in the us position on security council expansion was its continuing distrust of german chancellor gerhard schöder 's strong opposition to the us-led war in iraq . back to the drafting board ? the reform proposal favored by germany , japan , india and brazil initially called for the adoption of a resolution which would add 10 new members to the council , six permanent members and four non-permanent ones , which would rotate for two-year terms .

oleg liskin , 36 , risked being arrested for his political activity if he returned to russia , according to the german federal office of migration and refugees , which granted him asylum , the daily newspaper der tagesspiegel reported .
liskin was held in custody and allegedly tortured in 2001 after standing as a candidate in regional elections to become governor of tula in central russia , according to an immigration and refugee office report .
he came to berlin in december 2002 because he risked being sent to prison for being a danger to state security , the report said .
liskin also worked for the russian bank legprombank , which supported the russian reformist party yabloko .
an immigration and refugee office spokesperson , contacted by afp news service , refused to comment on the case .
liskin is the first russian national to have been granted political asylum in germany , according to human rights group amnesty international in germany .
" it 's a sign , " said amnesty international 's russian expert , peter franck .
gernot erler , the foreign affairs expert for the ruling social democrat party , described the decision as " very unusual .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 09.06.2005 colonial cliches in a german zoo ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maybe not the best setting for an exhibit of african culture many zoos put on special exhibits in order to attract visitors .
most also attract little notice much less controversy .
but one zoo in southern germany is causing an uproar with a new event , an " african village . " an " african village " in a german zoo sounds a bit strange .
still , a zoo in augsburg in bavaria has created a special exhibit complete with a steppe setting to attract visitors .
but since their intention became public , it has attracted protests .
the group initiative for black people in germany has also called to complain and wants the exhibit stopped .
spokeswoman eleonore wiedenroth-coulibaly said she is bothered not just bay the exhibit but also its name , which is promoting generalizations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the show makes caricatures of africans , critics say " first of all , there is no one ' african ' village , " she said .
" secondly , not all african landscapes are steppe .
this is a reduction of africans in the old colonial tradition - africans as living close to nature with the animals .
it is this colonial viewpoint that bothers us . " worst possible setting the spokeswoman and other critics also from outside germany are also reminded of other exhibits in zoos like ones in the 19th century that were meant to promote a greater understanding of foreign cultures , particularly in newly colonized lands .
these exhibits served , above all , to promote a view for visitors of europeans as having the more civilized culture .
for this reason , critics say , the zoo is the worst possible place to hold such an exhibit . " the zoo also evolved out of colonial tradition , " wiedenroth-coulibaly said .
" and those former exhibits also came out about the same time , ones where people were displayed in a zoo , in nature , with animals , non-european .
and they as such are defamatory .
and some people do n't see that or do n't want to see that . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is no one single african village she is referring to the zoo 's director , barbara jantschke , whose first reaction to the complaints confirmed critics ' complaints .
the augsburg zoo would be the right place to impart an exotic atmosphere , she wrote .
she referred to the show 's organizer , egyptian-born munich-based event manager medhat abdelati .

" i believe the path to reforms we have taken is the right one … and i will fight for it , " he said .
the vote of no confidence , which schröder had called for several weeks ago , will take place on july 1 as planned and is the first step towards a general election scheduled for september .
the vote of confidence , which schröder is widely expected to lose , will not be tied to any specific legislative measure , but rather will stand on its own .
the statement came after members from schröder 's ruling social democratic party criticized president horst köhler for taking sides with the conservative opposition and pressing for schröder 's resignation rather than endorsing a vote of no confidence .
schröder , who met in a closed-door session with the president earlier thursday , said he had complete trust in köhler 's bipartisan stance .
unlike the chancellor , the office of president is expected to remain outside of party politics and to have only the country 's constitution as its governing principle .
the question of linking new elections to a no-confidence vote has been debated in terms of its constitutionality and it is ultimately up to the president to approve such a measure . dw-world.de german president focus of spd criticism german president horst köhler has come under fire from senior social democrats accusing him of taking sides with his fellow conservatives and pressing for the resignation of chancellor gerhard schröder .

" i believe the path to reforms we have taken is the right one … and i will fight for it , " he said .
the vote of no confidence , which schröder had called for several weeks ago , will take place on july 1 as planned and is the first step towards a general election scheduled for september .
the vote of confidence , which schröder is widely expected to lose , will not be tied to any specific legislative measure , but rather will stand on its own .
the statement came after members from schröder 's ruling social democratic party criticized president horst köhler for taking sides with the conservative opposition and pressing for schröder 's resignation rather than endorsing a vote of no confidence .
schröder , who met in a closed-door session with the president earlier thursday , said he had complete trust in köhler 's bipartisan stance .
unlike the chancellor , the office of president is expected to remain outside of party politics and to have only the country 's constitution as its governing principle .

2004 germany ’ s federal appeals court on thursday upheld alower court 's acquittal of abdelghani mzoudi , who was accused of involvement in the sept .
11 attacks on the united states . the german federal appeals court in karlsruhe upheld an earlier court decision to acquit the 32-year-old moroccan student of all charges of aiding the hamburg terror cell which launched the sept .
11 , 2001 , terror attacks on new york and washington . abdelghani mzoudi was first brought to trial in 2003 on charges of aiding and abetting in the murder of more than 3,000 people .
the trial collapsed and mzoudi was later acquitted in a february 2004 appeals decision . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mzoudi -lrb- talking to his lawyer -rrb- was acquitted in hamburg after more than five months on trial after more than five months on trial , the higher regional court in hamburg ruled there was insufficient proof to demonstrate mzoudi 's involvement in the hamburg terror cell and association with a terror organization . federal prosecutors had called for a revision of the acquittal of only the second person brought to trial for complicity in the sept .
11 terror attacks , but failed to demonstrate the necessity of a revision on thursday . the karlsruhe court , the country 's highest appeals court , rejected the call for a retrial , arguing that the initial ruling was sound . lack of proof mzoudi , who was a friend of lead hijacker mohamed atta and other members of the hamburg cell involved in plotting the terror attacks , has repeatedly denied having knowledge of the group ’ s plans .
the presiding judge during the feb .
2004 trial described the moroccan student as a “ fringe figure ” and justified the acquittal because there was insufficient proof against mzoudi , not because the court was convinced of his innocence . the ongoing case against mzoudi has led to tensions between germany and the united states because of washington ’ s refusal , on security grounds , to allow captured al qaeda leaders to testify or to provide information from their interrogations .
the lack of such input is largely believed to have lead to the prosecution ’ s failure to convict .
the chief federal prosecutor has described us behavior as “ incomprehensible . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mounir el motassadeq , suspected of involvement in the 9/11 attacks , faces a retrial another moroccan residing in germany , mounir el motassadeq , is currently in the midst of a retrial on similar charges in hamburg .
like mzoudi , he denies involvement and knowledge of the attacks . deportation probable despite the confirmation of acquittal , mzoudi could face deportation from germany .
authorities in the northern city of hamburg , where mzoudi resides , say they still consider him an “ especially dangerous ” supporter of international terrorism and have vowed to expel him once legal proceedings are over . the director of the city-state ’ s department for internal affairs , reinhard fallak , said an earlier decision to deport mzoudi was still in effect , having only been postponed for the duration of the appeals hearing .
mzoudi now has 14 days to leave the country . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the trouble with nailing terror suspects another terror trial without a hard conviction this week has illustrated once more the difficulties the german judiciary has in putting terror suspects behind bars .

washington has thrown a wrench into berlin ’ s aspirations of becoming a permanent member of the un security council , arguing that the expansion of the body is not its top reform priority . at a joint press conference with german foreign minister joschka fischer on wednesday , us secretary of state condoleezza rice held back on endorsing germany 's bid to become a permanent member of the un security council , arguing that other un reforms such as streamlining management were more important than the expansion of the top decision-making body from the current 15 members to 25 , as proposed by germany , japan , india and brazil . while generally acknowledging the need of a reform , rice , however , said the united states was looking closely at the various proposals to have " a sober and reflective discussion " aimed at achieving " the broadest possible consensus on how to move forward on what would be a very fundamental change . " and so our plan at this point is to try , through the appropriate channels at the un , the presidency of the general assembly and so forth , to promote that dialogue on what it is that we are trying to achieve in security council reform as well as in the broader un reform , " she said . support for one of four support for the reform initiative and the four contenders for permanent seats is far from certain .
on wednesday , rice said the us was not ready to endorse all four countries and their bid for permanent seats .
although she reiterated washington 's interest in reforming the council , she left the door wide open in terms of the exact context of the expansion proposal . " the only country that we have said unequivocally that we support is japan , having to do with japan 's special role in the un and support for the un , " rice said .
" but obviously , we are going to look at how to think about un security council expansion within the context of … broader reforms . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flags wave in front of un headquarters in new york despite the stated preference for only one of the four bidders , german officials interpreted rice 's statements as less of a rebuff of berlin 's efforts to join the council , and more of a general wariness to expansion . " we were given to understand by the united states that their concerns about this procedure are not motivated by any anti-german considerations , " said wolfgang ischinger , the german ambassador to the united states , who attended the meeting with rice and fischer . however , several other european and asian diplomats who asked to remain anonymous have indicated that one of the factors in the us position on security council expansion was its continuing distrust of german chancellor gerhard schöder 's strong opposition to the us-led war in iraq . back to the drafting board ? the reform proposal favored by germany , japan , india and brazil initially called for the adoption of a resolution which would add 10 new members to the council , six permanent members and four non-permanent ones , which would rotate for two-year terms .
the council currently consists of five permanent members , france , britain , china , russia and the united states , and 10 non-permanent rotating members . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leaders from india , japan , brazil and germany team up to lobby for un reform the four chief contenders for permanent seats , germany , japan , india and brazil , had joined forces to lobby for their reform plans over the past year , arguing that the un 's highest body needed to better reflect the current geo-political situation and the amount each of them contributes financially and otherwise to the un . but on wednesday , the initiative was shaken up a bit after the four chief contenders revised their proposal and dropped the right to a veto for the first 15 years for new permanent members , in the hopes that their resolution would be adopted as early as this month .
diplomats speculate that the four contenders have about 100 of the 191 un members behind them , far short of the two-thirds majority needed to pass the reform resolution . five powers divided among the current five council members , only france and britain support all four of the new bidders .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flags wave in front of un headquarters in new york despite the stated preference for only one of the four bidders , german officials interpreted rice 's statements as less of a rebuff of berlin 's efforts to join the council , and more of a general wariness to expansion . " we were given to understand by the united states that their concerns about this procedure are not motivated by any anti-german considerations , " said wolfgang ischinger , the german ambassador to the united states , who attended the meeting with rice and fischer . however , several other european and asian diplomats who asked to remain anonymous have indicated that one of the factors in the us position on security council expansion was its continuing distrust of german chancellor gerhard schöder 's strong opposition to the us-led war in iraq . back to the drafting board ? the reform proposal favored by germany , japan , india and brazil initially called for the adoption of a resolution which would add 10 new members to the council , six permanent members and four non-permanent ones , which would rotate for two-year terms .
the council currently consists of five permanent members , france , britain , china , russia and the united states , and 10 non-permanent rotating members . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leaders from india , japan , brazil and germany team up to lobby for un reform the four chief contenders for permanent seats , germany , japan , india and brazil , had joined forces to lobby for their reform plans over the past year , arguing that the un 's highest body needed to better reflect the current geo-political situation and the amount each of them contributes financially and otherwise to the un . but on wednesday , the initiative was shaken up a bit after the four chief contenders revised their proposal and dropped the right to a veto for the first 15 years for new permanent members , in the hopes that their resolution would be adopted as early as this month .
diplomats speculate that the four contenders have about 100 of the 191 un members behind them , far short of the two-thirds majority needed to pass the reform resolution . five powers divided among the current five council members , only france and britain support all four of the new bidders .
china openly opposes any seat for japan while russia 's position remains unclear . within the general assembly , diplomats say germany faces the least opposition , while muslim nations are expected to organize against india and developing nations are believed to want to block japan 's aspirations . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer discusses eu future in us on what could be his farewell trip to the united states as germany 's foreign minister , joschka fischer discussed turkish membership in the eu and the eu role in the world in the aftermath of the consitutional crisis .

german president horst köhler has come under fire from senior social democrats accusing him of taking sides with his fellow conservatives and pressing for the resignation of chancellor gerhard schröder . the german capital these days is a hot spot of speculations and rumors intentionally spread to inflict maximum damage to political foes ahead of september 's early elections . the latest allegations have come from the left wing of the ruling social democrats who are accusing the german presidential office of intentionally leaking information from a meeting between the german president and chancellor schröder , held to discuss ways towards early elections . one day after the meeting in may , germany 's leading tabloid bild alleged schröder had called early elections because he feared a leftwing revolt in his party after a crushing defeat in a regional poll in north rhine-westphalia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ludwig stiegler senior spd members such as ludwig stiegler , one of the party 's deputy parliamentary leaders , now assume that there is a conservative network in the vicinity of the president that gave away the details in an attempt to damage the chancellor . " the information must have been leaked by a well-known old-boys network of conservatives surrounding the german president , " stiegler , who has described köhler as the " politically most one-sided president " he has known . " we have to make this public and advise the president to be more watchful about the type of people on his staff , " stiegler added . party revolt or presidential intrigue ? some social democrats are now even suggesting the german president would seek the resignation of the chancellor rather than accept schröder 's plan to deliberately lose a confidence vote in parliament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering the latest accusations have come only one day after rumors that senior spd leaders would be planning to replace schröder with spd party leader franz müntefering and continue ruling until regular elections in 2006 .
on tuesday , schröder publicly dismissed these rumors as utter nonsense and apparently spawned by the opposition conservatives . on wednesday , markus söder , general secretary of the ultra-conservative csu party said that much of what was currently happening clearly reflected a government in dissolution . " all these rumours and allegations are a clear indication of how deeply split the ruling social democrats are , " söder said .

but questions are arising whether this plan is in line with germany 's constitution . president horst köhler plays a key role in the unfolding events because he must decide whether to dissolve parliament after such a vote of confidence .

german president horst köhler has come under fire from senior social democrats accusing him of taking sides with his fellow conservatives and pressing for the resignation of chancellor gerhard schröder . the german capital these days is a hot spot of speculations and rumors intentionally spread to inflict maximum damage to political foes ahead of september 's early elections . the latest allegations have come from the left wing of the ruling social democrats who are accusing the german presidential office of intentionally leaking information from a meeting between the german president and chancellor schröder , held to discuss ways towards early elections . one day after the meeting in may , germany 's leading tabloid bild alleged schröder had called early elections because he feared a leftwing revolt in his party after a crushing defeat in a regional poll in north rhine-westphalia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ludwig stiegler senior spd members such as ludwig stiegler , one of the party 's deputy parliamentary leaders , now assume that there is a conservative network in the vicinity of the president that gave away the details in an attempt to damage the chancellor .

on tuesday , schröder publicly dismissed these rumors as utter nonsense and apparently spawned by the opposition conservatives . on wednesday , markus söder , general secretary of the ultra-conservative csu party said that much of what was currently happening clearly reflected a government in dissolution .

" we have to make this public and advise the president to be more watchful about the type of people on his staff , " stiegler added . party revolt or presidential intrigue ? some social democrats are now even suggesting the german president would seek the resignation of the chancellor rather than accept schröder 's plan to deliberately lose a confidence vote in parliament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering the latest accusations have come only one day after rumors that senior spd leaders would be planning to replace schröder with spd party leader franz müntefering and continue ruling until regular elections in 2006 .
on tuesday , schröder publicly dismissed these rumors as utter nonsense and apparently spawned by the opposition conservatives . on wednesday , markus söder , general secretary of the ultra-conservative csu party said that much of what was currently happening clearly reflected a government in dissolution . " all these rumours and allegations are a clear indication of how deeply split the ruling social democrats are , " söder said . " they are showing that the government is totally preoccupied with itself and unable to solve the problems .

there is speculation that cabinet ministers could abstain in the vote of confidence and so undo schröder 's three-seat majority in parliament .
but questions are arising whether this plan is in line with germany 's constitution . president horst köhler plays a key role in the unfolding events because he must decide whether to dissolve parliament after such a vote of confidence .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 09.06.2005 germans head south in search of jobs großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the austrian hills are alive with employment as euroskeptics across the continent smugly salute france and holland for crushing the eu constitution ratification process , a migratory trend among german workers validates the benefits of cross border labor markets . over the past decade , the austrian and swiss employment markets have become highly attractive for germans who have either failed to find work on their home turf , or for those who simply want to get a taste of life beyond the boundaries of home . statistics compiled by the austrian social insurance holding organization reveal that the number of germans working south of the border has risen from an average of some 13,000 in 1995 to more than 45,000 last month .
it 's a steep hike which is disproportionate to the overall rise in the number of foreigners employed in austria - 300,000 in 1995 compared to 364,000 in 2004 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lyrical lure of the alps traditionally germans are not renowned for roaming the continent in search of work .
although the history of the german people is dotted with emigration episodes , on the whole , there was never a great need for them to leave home in order to make ends meet .
but times , moods and motivations change , and germans now represent the largest group of foreign workers from any european union country in austria . collectively they have a presence in the construction industry , in retail , cleaning , in agriculture , railways and much more , but the biggest single group is employed , albeit seasonally , in the tourist industry . demand beats supply austria has long been wooing tourists with the alps and the likes of vienna and salzburg , however .
so why the sudden surge in foreign workers ? hermann deutsch of austria 's federal ministry for economic affairs and labor said it 's a case of demand outstripping supply . " we quite simply need additional seasonal workers , and see it as a positive thing that we have been able to attract workers from germany during recent seasons , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : salzburg , austria is seasonally home to many german employees it 's a two-way street in which both employers and their guest employees are happy .
for many small businesses , being able to hire german staff is the difference between sinking or swimming , and they go down well with the tourists , a high percentage of which are themselves german . michaela wiatrz , who works as agent for the federal labor office 's placement service for hotel and catering staff , says that many of those who seek out seasonal jobs are young and are looking for a chance to use their freshly gained qualifications . " the industry , by implication , means moving around , and german workers are highly desirable in austria and switzerland , both because they can speak the language and because of the high level of training they take with them , " she said . cause for concern ? although it sounds like a happy marriage , there is a jealous third party involved in this new nomadic trend .
austria has its own unemployment problems to deal with and there are considerable concerns that german cooks and waitresses are in the business of stealing jobs .

it 's a steep hike which is disproportionate to the overall rise in the number of foreigners employed in austria - 300,000 in 1995 compared to 364,000 in 2004 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lyrical lure of the alps traditionally germans are not renowned for roaming the continent in search of work .
although the history of the german people is dotted with emigration episodes , on the whole , there was never a great need for them to leave home in order to make ends meet .
but times , moods and motivations change , and germans now represent the largest group of foreign workers from any european union country in austria . collectively they have a presence in the construction industry , in retail , cleaning , in agriculture , railways and much more , but the biggest single group is employed , albeit seasonally , in the tourist industry . demand beats supply austria has long been wooing tourists with the alps and the likes of vienna and salzburg , however .
so why the sudden surge in foreign workers ? hermann deutsch of austria 's federal ministry for economic affairs and labor said it 's a case of demand outstripping supply . " we quite simply need additional seasonal workers , and see it as a positive thing that we have been able to attract workers from germany during recent seasons , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : salzburg , austria is seasonally home to many german employees it 's a two-way street in which both employers and their guest employees are happy .
for many small businesses , being able to hire german staff is the difference between sinking or swimming , and they go down well with the tourists , a high percentage of which are themselves german . michaela wiatrz , who works as agent for the federal labor office 's placement service for hotel and catering staff , says that many of those who seek out seasonal jobs are young and are looking for a chance to use their freshly gained qualifications . " the industry , by implication , means moving around , and german workers are highly desirable in austria and switzerland , both because they can speak the language and because of the high level of training they take with them , " she said . cause for concern ? although it sounds like a happy marriage , there is a jealous third party involved in this new nomadic trend .
austria has its own unemployment problems to deal with and there are considerable concerns that german cooks and waitresses are in the business of stealing jobs .
but hermann said such claims do not reflect the reality of the situation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " there are always those austrian employees who claim foreign workers put additional pressure on the market and that each additional german is one too many , " he said .
" granted , it is important to do everything we can to fill the market gaps with unemployed austrians , but we ca n't simply fill all the vacancies with all the jobless , that 's too facile . " the expert said he does n't believe there is any ground for the much mooted theory that the german contingent has triggered a wave of wage dumping .
he does , however , concede that because of the high applicant-to-post ratio , there is no need for employers to be excessively generous when it comes to filling the pay packet . good working conditions the fact is that traveling workers who leave germany will find the conditions and collective wage agreement pay rates in austria very similar to those at home . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pulling pints earns the same in austria as germany " rates in austria , which invariably include board and lodging , vary between 1,100 and 1,400 euros -lrb- $ 1,346 and $ 1,713 -rrb- after deductions for a five or six day week , " wiatrz said .
" ' but many germans are financially attracted to the idea of working in switzerland where they only work a five day week and earn 10 percent more . " that said , switzerland is a staggeringly expensive place to live . wiatrz pointed out that the average hospitality industry wage is simply not enough to fill the average swiss wallet , which is part of the reason for the tourist industry vacancies in the first place . tamsin walker , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de doctors defect to blissful britain germany 's health system is a troubled soul .

most also attract little notice much less controversy .
but one zoo in southern germany is causing an uproar with a new event , an " african village . " an " african village " in a german zoo sounds a bit strange .
still , a zoo in augsburg in bavaria has created a special exhibit complete with a steppe setting to attract visitors .
but since their intention became public , it has attracted protests .
the group initiative for black people in germany has also called to complain and wants the exhibit stopped .
spokeswoman eleonore wiedenroth-coulibaly said she is bothered not just bay the exhibit but also its name , which is promoting generalizations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the show makes caricatures of africans , critics say " first of all , there is no one ' african ' village , " she said .
" secondly , not all african landscapes are steppe .
this is a reduction of africans in the old colonial tradition - africans as living close to nature with the animals .
it is this colonial viewpoint that bothers us . " worst possible setting the spokeswoman and other critics also from outside germany are also reminded of other exhibits in zoos like ones in the 19th century that were meant to promote a greater understanding of foreign cultures , particularly in newly colonized lands .
these exhibits served , above all , to promote a view for visitors of europeans as having the more civilized culture .
for this reason , critics say , the zoo is the worst possible place to hold such an exhibit . " the zoo also evolved out of colonial tradition , " wiedenroth-coulibaly said .
" and those former exhibits also came out about the same time , ones where people were displayed in a zoo , in nature , with animals , non-european .
and they as such are defamatory .
and some people do n't see that or do n't want to see that . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is no one single african village she is referring to the zoo 's director , barbara jantschke , whose first reaction to the complaints confirmed critics ' complaints .
the augsburg zoo would be the right place to impart an exotic atmosphere , she wrote .
she referred to the show 's organizer , egyptian-born munich-based event manager medhat abdelati .
he said that he in no uncertain terms wanted the show to tie in with colonial and racist traditions , because he , himself , has african heritage . " i do n't find anything objectionable , " he said .
" and if i would stop it now , i would just give their opinions more strength .
i have invited them to visit and see the show before they judge it . " bad choice in the meantime , he understands that the choice of the title was not great and could lead to misunderstandings . " we are treating it as a cultural festival , " he said .
" with art , jewelry , masks , that people can buy .
there is even a program for children . " regardless , critics still believe that a zoo is not an appropriate place to hold a cultural festival and are holding protests against the exhibition .
zoo officials say they wo n't cancel the show : they have offered to hold a workshop to discuss the issues during the festival . thomas mösch -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de köhler calls for more aid for africa ahead of his first trip to africa as german president , horst köhler has called on the international community , including germany , to considerably increase financial help for the struggling continent .

washington has thrown a wrench into berlin ’ s aspirations of becoming a permanent member of the un security council , arguing that the expansion of the body is not its top reform priority . at a joint press conference with german foreign minister joschka fischer on wednesday , us secretary of state condoleezza rice held back on endorsing germany 's bid to become a permanent member of the un security council , arguing that other un reforms such as streamlining management were more important than the expansion of the top decision-making body from the current 15 members to 25 , as proposed by germany , japan , india and brazil . while generally acknowledging the need of a reform , rice , however , said the united states was looking closely at the various proposals to have " a sober and reflective discussion " aimed at achieving " the broadest possible consensus on how to move forward on what would be a very fundamental change . " and so our plan at this point is to try , through the appropriate channels at the un , the presidency of the general assembly and so forth , to promote that dialogue on what it is that we are trying to achieve in security council reform as well as in the broader un reform , " she said . support for one of four support for the reform initiative and the four contenders for permanent seats is far from certain .
on wednesday , rice said the us was not ready to endorse all four countries and their bid for permanent seats .
although she reiterated washington 's interest in reforming the council , she left the door wide open in terms of the exact context of the expansion proposal . " the only country that we have said unequivocally that we support is japan , having to do with japan 's special role in the un and support for the un , " rice said .
" but obviously , we are going to look at how to think about un security council expansion within the context of … broader reforms . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flags wave in front of un headquarters in new york despite the stated preference for only one of the four bidders , german officials interpreted rice 's statements as less of a rebuff of berlin 's efforts to join the council , and more of a general wariness to expansion . " we were given to understand by the united states that their concerns about this procedure are not motivated by any anti-german considerations , " said wolfgang ischinger , the german ambassador to the united states , who attended the meeting with rice and fischer . however , several other european and asian diplomats who asked to remain anonymous have indicated that one of the factors in the us position on security council expansion was its continuing distrust of german chancellor gerhard schöder 's strong opposition to the us-led war in iraq . back to the drafting board ? the reform proposal favored by germany , japan , india and brazil initially called for the adoption of a resolution which would add 10 new members to the council , six permanent members and four non-permanent ones , which would rotate for two-year terms .
the council currently consists of five permanent members , france , britain , china , russia and the united states , and 10 non-permanent rotating members . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leaders from india , japan , brazil and germany team up to lobby for un reform the four chief contenders for permanent seats , germany , japan , india and brazil , had joined forces to lobby for their reform plans over the past year , arguing that the un 's highest body needed to better reflect the current geo-political situation and the amount each of them contributes financially and otherwise to the un . but on wednesday , the initiative was shaken up a bit after the four chief contenders revised their proposal and dropped the right to a veto for the first 15 years for new permanent members , in the hopes that their resolution would be adopted as early as this month .
diplomats speculate that the four contenders have about 100 of the 191 un members behind them , far short of the two-thirds majority needed to pass the reform resolution . five powers divided among the current five council members , only france and britain support all four of the new bidders .
china openly opposes any seat for japan while russia 's position remains unclear . within the general assembly , diplomats say germany faces the least opposition , while muslim nations are expected to organize against india and developing nations are believed to want to block japan 's aspirations . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer discusses eu future in us on what could be his farewell trip to the united states as germany 's foreign minister , joschka fischer discussed turkish membership in the eu and the eu role in the world in the aftermath of the consitutional crisis .

oleg liskin , 36 , risked being arrested for his political activity if he returned to russia , according to the german federal office of migration and refugees , which granted him asylum , the daily newspaper der tagesspiegel reported .
liskin was held in custody and allegedly tortured in 2001 after standing as a candidate in regional elections to become governor of tula in central russia , according to an immigration and refugee office report .
he came to berlin in december 2002 because he risked being sent to prison for being a danger to state security , the report said .
liskin also worked for the russian bank legprombank , which supported the russian reformist party yabloko .
an immigration and refugee office spokesperson , contacted by afp news service , refused to comment on the case .
liskin is the first russian national to have been granted political asylum in germany , according to human rights group amnesty international in germany .
" it 's a sign , " said amnesty international 's russian expert , peter franck .
gernot erler , the foreign affairs expert for the ruling social democrat party , described the decision as " very unusual .

it is the alliance 's first mission in africa . putting a dispute within the alliance behind them , nato representatives at the brussels meeting agreed late wednesday to airlift some 5,000 african union peacekeepers to the troubled region in western sudan .
the mission , which will be carried out by nato as well as the european union , is the first such operation on the african continent . " as you know , the situation in that region is appalling , and we must do all that is in our power , in coordination with other organizations , starting with the eu , to assist the african union in its efforts , " nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer in a final communiqué on the issue , nato said " we are committed to implementing speedily our logistical support to the african union mission in sudan in the areas of strategic deployment and self capacity building . " no firm dates have been set for the start of the mission , but officials said they hope to meet the african union 's goal of a july start . dispute over alliances in the run-up to thursday 's announcement , france had objected to a mission under nato command on the grounds that the european union was already assisting the african union in sudan .
france had argued that its offer to transport two battalions of senegalese troops was made under an eu , not a nato , banner . while washington wanted nato to coordinate the entire mission , defense chiefs in brussels were at pains to stress that there was no competition between its mission and that of the eu , and both organizations were working to avoid squabbling over alliances while people continue to die in darfur . " i believe that all sides here have the same aim : to help the sudan , " said german defense minister peter struck .
" there is no sense in arguing over competencies , over who should do what .
the main thing is that action is taken . " " who takes the lead in coordinating -lrb- the mission -rrb- is secondary , " he told reporters . under the agreement reached by nato , allies have the option of performing airlift missions either under nato or the eu 's auspices .
it is expected that france , germany and italy will lend their support through the eu , while the united states would use nato 's military command to conduct its airlift missions . nato 's coordination with the eu will go through an african union cell in the ethiopian capital of addis ababa , staffed with a small number of eu and nato officials . in addition to the air transport , nato has offered to train african union troops with an eye to improving command and control of the force . no nato troops in sudan the african union , which had ruled out direct involvement of western troops in darfur , called on nato and the eu to provide logistical support for the peacekeeping mission , which aims to put an end to the violence now going into its third year . sudan has welcomed nato 's logistics offer , which comes a day before the darfur peace talks resume , but it has also said it will not accept nato troops on its soil . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato discusses nuclear future nato defense ministers , who are meeting in brussles thursday , have responded to a call by german defense minister , peter struck , to review the " status of nuclear forces " in europe .

german president horst köhler has come under fire from senior social democrats accusing him of taking sides with his fellow conservatives and pressing for the resignation of chancellor gerhard schröder . the german capital these days is a hot spot of speculations and rumors intentionally spread to inflict maximum damage to political foes ahead of september 's early elections . the latest allegations have come from the left wing of the ruling social democrats who are accusing the german presidential office of intentionally leaking information from a meeting between the german president and chancellor schröder , held to discuss ways towards early elections . one day after the meeting in may , germany 's leading tabloid bild alleged schröder had called early elections because he feared a leftwing revolt in his party after a crushing defeat in a regional poll in north rhine-westphalia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ludwig stiegler senior spd members such as ludwig stiegler , one of the party 's deputy parliamentary leaders , now assume that there is a conservative network in the vicinity of the president that gave away the details in an attempt to damage the chancellor . " the information must have been leaked by a well-known old-boys network of conservatives surrounding the german president , " stiegler , who has described köhler as the " politically most one-sided president " he has known . " we have to make this public and advise the president to be more watchful about the type of people on his staff , " stiegler added . party revolt or presidential intrigue ? some social democrats are now even suggesting the german president would seek the resignation of the chancellor rather than accept schröder 's plan to deliberately lose a confidence vote in parliament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering the latest accusations have come only one day after rumors that senior spd leaders would be planning to replace schröder with spd party leader franz müntefering and continue ruling until regular elections in 2006 .
on tuesday , schröder publicly dismissed these rumors as utter nonsense and apparently spawned by the opposition conservatives . on wednesday , markus söder , general secretary of the ultra-conservative csu party said that much of what was currently happening clearly reflected a government in dissolution . " all these rumours and allegations are a clear indication of how deeply split the ruling social democrats are , " söder said . " they are showing that the government is totally preoccupied with itself and unable to solve the problems .
what we need now is a clear statement by the chancellor about how he wants to bring about early elections . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler -lrb- left -rrb- was angered by schröder 's failure to inform him of his early election plans ahead of going to the press .
the german chancellor , however , continues to remain silent .
there is speculation that cabinet ministers could abstain in the vote of confidence and so undo schröder 's three-seat majority in parliament .
but questions are arising whether this plan is in line with germany 's constitution . president horst köhler plays a key role in the unfolding events because he must decide whether to dissolve parliament after such a vote of confidence .
theoretically , he could reject it , throwing the timetable for september 's election into doubt and maybe still forcing the chancellor to resign in the end . uwe hessler -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder quiet on confidence vote german chancellor gerhard schröder continues to keep silent about the logistics of a confidence vote needed for proposed early elections much to the chagrin of members of his own center-left coalition .
-lrb- june 7 , 2005 -rrb- merkel chosen as chancellor candidate angela merkel , the leader of germany 's opposition christian democrats , has officially been chosen as the conservative challenger to chancellor gerhard schröder in early elections in the fall .

the chancellor 's call to germans to seal his fate is one of his greatest political gambles yet .

most also attract little notice much less controversy .
but one zoo in southern germany is causing an uproar with a new event , an " african village . " an " african village " in a german zoo sounds a bit strange .
still , a zoo in augsburg in bavaria has created a special exhibit complete with a steppe setting to attract visitors .
but since their intention became public , it has attracted protests .
the group initiative for black people in germany has also called to complain and wants the exhibit stopped .
spokeswoman eleonore wiedenroth-coulibaly said she is bothered not just bay the exhibit but also its name , which is promoting generalizations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the show makes caricatures of africans , critics say " first of all , there is no one ' african ' village , " she said .
" secondly , not all african landscapes are steppe .
this is a reduction of africans in the old colonial tradition - africans as living close to nature with the animals .
it is this colonial viewpoint that bothers us . " worst possible setting the spokeswoman and other critics also from outside germany are also reminded of other exhibits in zoos like ones in the 19th century that were meant to promote a greater understanding of foreign cultures , particularly in newly colonized lands .
these exhibits served , above all , to promote a view for visitors of europeans as having the more civilized culture .
for this reason , critics say , the zoo is the worst possible place to hold such an exhibit . " the zoo also evolved out of colonial tradition , " wiedenroth-coulibaly said .
" and those former exhibits also came out about the same time , ones where people were displayed in a zoo , in nature , with animals , non-european .
and they as such are defamatory .
and some people do n't see that or do n't want to see that . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is no one single african village she is referring to the zoo 's director , barbara jantschke , whose first reaction to the complaints confirmed critics ' complaints .
the augsburg zoo would be the right place to impart an exotic atmosphere , she wrote .
she referred to the show 's organizer , egyptian-born munich-based event manager medhat abdelati .
he said that he in no uncertain terms wanted the show to tie in with colonial and racist traditions , because he , himself , has african heritage . " i do n't find anything objectionable , " he said .
" and if i would stop it now , i would just give their opinions more strength .
i have invited them to visit and see the show before they judge it . " bad choice in the meantime , he understands that the choice of the title was not great and could lead to misunderstandings . " we are treating it as a cultural festival , " he said .
" with art , jewelry , masks , that people can buy .
there is even a program for children . " regardless , critics still believe that a zoo is not an appropriate place to hold a cultural festival and are holding protests against the exhibition .
zoo officials say they wo n't cancel the show : they have offered to hold a workshop to discuss the issues during the festival . thomas mösch -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de köhler calls for more aid for africa ahead of his first trip to africa as german president , horst köhler has called on the international community , including germany , to considerably increase financial help for the struggling continent .

most also attract little notice much less controversy .
but one zoo in southern germany is causing an uproar with a new event , an " african village . " an " african village " in a german zoo sounds a bit strange .
still , a zoo in augsburg in bavaria has created a special exhibit complete with a steppe setting to attract visitors .
but since their intention became public , it has attracted protests .
the group initiative for black people in germany has also called to complain and wants the exhibit stopped .
spokeswoman eleonore wiedenroth-coulibaly said she is bothered not just bay the exhibit but also its name , which is promoting generalizations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the show makes caricatures of africans , critics say " first of all , there is no one ' african ' village , " she said .
" secondly , not all african landscapes are steppe .
this is a reduction of africans in the old colonial tradition - africans as living close to nature with the animals .
it is this colonial viewpoint that bothers us . " worst possible setting the spokeswoman and other critics also from outside germany are also reminded of other exhibits in zoos like ones in the 19th century that were meant to promote a greater understanding of foreign cultures , particularly in newly colonized lands .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 09.06.2005 germans head south in search of jobs großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the austrian hills are alive with employment as euroskeptics across the continent smugly salute france and holland for crushing the eu constitution ratification process , a migratory trend among german workers validates the benefits of cross border labor markets . over the past decade , the austrian and swiss employment markets have become highly attractive for germans who have either failed to find work on their home turf , or for those who simply want to get a taste of life beyond the boundaries of home . statistics compiled by the austrian social insurance holding organization reveal that the number of germans working south of the border has risen from an average of some 13,000 in 1995 to more than 45,000 last month .
it 's a steep hike which is disproportionate to the overall rise in the number of foreigners employed in austria - 300,000 in 1995 compared to 364,000 in 2004 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lyrical lure of the alps traditionally germans are not renowned for roaming the continent in search of work .
although the history of the german people is dotted with emigration episodes , on the whole , there was never a great need for them to leave home in order to make ends meet .
but times , moods and motivations change , and germans now represent the largest group of foreign workers from any european union country in austria . collectively they have a presence in the construction industry , in retail , cleaning , in agriculture , railways and much more , but the biggest single group is employed , albeit seasonally , in the tourist industry . demand beats supply austria has long been wooing tourists with the alps and the likes of vienna and salzburg , however .
so why the sudden surge in foreign workers ? hermann deutsch of austria 's federal ministry for economic affairs and labor said it 's a case of demand outstripping supply . " we quite simply need additional seasonal workers , and see it as a positive thing that we have been able to attract workers from germany during recent seasons , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : salzburg , austria is seasonally home to many german employees it 's a two-way street in which both employers and their guest employees are happy .
for many small businesses , being able to hire german staff is the difference between sinking or swimming , and they go down well with the tourists , a high percentage of which are themselves german . michaela wiatrz , who works as agent for the federal labor office 's placement service for hotel and catering staff , says that many of those who seek out seasonal jobs are young and are looking for a chance to use their freshly gained qualifications . " the industry , by implication , means moving around , and german workers are highly desirable in austria and switzerland , both because they can speak the language and because of the high level of training they take with them , " she said . cause for concern ? although it sounds like a happy marriage , there is a jealous third party involved in this new nomadic trend .
austria has its own unemployment problems to deal with and there are considerable concerns that german cooks and waitresses are in the business of stealing jobs .
but hermann said such claims do not reflect the reality of the situation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " there are always those austrian employees who claim foreign workers put additional pressure on the market and that each additional german is one too many , " he said .
" granted , it is important to do everything we can to fill the market gaps with unemployed austrians , but we ca n't simply fill all the vacancies with all the jobless , that 's too facile . " the expert said he does n't believe there is any ground for the much mooted theory that the german contingent has triggered a wave of wage dumping .
he does , however , concede that because of the high applicant-to-post ratio , there is no need for employers to be excessively generous when it comes to filling the pay packet . good working conditions the fact is that traveling workers who leave germany will find the conditions and collective wage agreement pay rates in austria very similar to those at home . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pulling pints earns the same in austria as germany " rates in austria , which invariably include board and lodging , vary between 1,100 and 1,400 euros -lrb- $ 1,346 and $ 1,713 -rrb- after deductions for a five or six day week , " wiatrz said .
" ' but many germans are financially attracted to the idea of working in switzerland where they only work a five day week and earn 10 percent more . " that said , switzerland is a staggeringly expensive place to live . wiatrz pointed out that the average hospitality industry wage is simply not enough to fill the average swiss wallet , which is part of the reason for the tourist industry vacancies in the first place . tamsin walker , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de doctors defect to blissful britain germany 's health system is a troubled soul .

the preparations are in full flow and the excitement and expectation are already reaching fever pitch with almost a year still to go as teams from around the world slowly book their places at the global soccer showpiece . but for those who ca n't wait until june 2006 , there 's something happening this month which could satisfy the craving for top international soccer action : the confederations cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eight-team competition will be held over two weeks beginning on june 15 , 2005 and will feature some of the world 's top stars from argentina , brazil , tunisia , greece , japan , australia , mexico … and of course hosts germany . the tournament , which is played every two years , involves the host country , the current world champions , the winners of the european championships , the copa america , the oceania nations cup , the african nations cup , the gold cup and asian cup .
it is the play-off competition for the champions of champions , bringing together the ruling nations from the world 's soccer federations in a continental showdown . as brazil qualify as both world champions and holders of the copa america , the south american cup runners-up argentina take the eight spot in the mouth-watering line-up . the contest for the inter-continental crown the confederations cup is an opportunity for the regional champions to come together and challenge each other for the right to claim the inter-continental crown .
the competition also provides a chance for the so-called lesser confederations to test their progress against the nations of the more established and wealthier continents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world soccer governing body fifa president sepp blatter " the confederations cup is a wonderful competition because it is a symbol of solidarity between the confederations , " said fifa president sepp blatter .
" with the exception of the world cup , it is the only official international competition in which teams from all the continents can test themselves against one another . " france victory marred by tragedy in 2003 the last tournament in 2003 was won by then european champions and hosts france but was marred by the tragic death of cameroon player marc-vivien foe who collapsed on the pitch during a semi-final against colombia played in the soaring temperatures of that year 's extreme french summer . the first confederations cups , known the as the king fahd cup , were held in saudi arabia in 1992 , 1995 and 1997 .
mexico hosted the tournament in 1999 and japan and south korea did so in 2001 .
since the inaugural fifa confederations cup , each tournament has seen a different confederation emerge triumphant , adding to the excitement and unpredictability of the showcase competition . germany as hosts , however , will be hoping that they will break the trend of passing the title between the confederations and retain the cup for european federation uefa . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de coaches wrapped up in mini world cup even though only eight teams are invited , the confederations cup , little brother to the world cup 's 32 teams , is a big enough title to keep brazilian players from being able to enjoy the summer holidays .

washington has thrown a wrench into berlin ’ s aspirations of becoming a permanent member of the un security council , arguing that the expansion of the body is not its top reform priority . at a joint press conference with german foreign minister joschka fischer on wednesday , us secretary of state condoleezza rice held back on endorsing germany 's bid to become a permanent member of the un security council , arguing that other un reforms such as streamlining management were more important than the expansion of the top decision-making body from the current 15 members to 25 , as proposed by germany , japan , india and brazil . while generally acknowledging the need of a reform , rice , however , said the united states was looking closely at the various proposals to have " a sober and reflective discussion " aimed at achieving " the broadest possible consensus on how to move forward on what would be a very fundamental change . " and so our plan at this point is to try , through the appropriate channels at the un , the presidency of the general assembly and so forth , to promote that dialogue on what it is that we are trying to achieve in security council reform as well as in the broader un reform , " she said . support for one of four support for the reform initiative and the four contenders for permanent seats is far from certain .
on wednesday , rice said the us was not ready to endorse all four countries and their bid for permanent seats .
although she reiterated washington 's interest in reforming the council , she left the door wide open in terms of the exact context of the expansion proposal . " the only country that we have said unequivocally that we support is japan , having to do with japan 's special role in the un and support for the un , " rice said .
" but obviously , we are going to look at how to think about un security council expansion within the context of … broader reforms . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flags wave in front of un headquarters in new york despite the stated preference for only one of the four bidders , german officials interpreted rice 's statements as less of a rebuff of berlin 's efforts to join the council , and more of a general wariness to expansion . " we were given to understand by the united states that their concerns about this procedure are not motivated by any anti-german considerations , " said wolfgang ischinger , the german ambassador to the united states , who attended the meeting with rice and fischer . however , several other european and asian diplomats who asked to remain anonymous have indicated that one of the factors in the us position on security council expansion was its continuing distrust of german chancellor gerhard schöder 's strong opposition to the us-led war in iraq . back to the drafting board ? the reform proposal favored by germany , japan , india and brazil initially called for the adoption of a resolution which would add 10 new members to the council , six permanent members and four non-permanent ones , which would rotate for two-year terms .
the council currently consists of five permanent members , france , britain , china , russia and the united states , and 10 non-permanent rotating members . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leaders from india , japan , brazil and germany team up to lobby for un reform the four chief contenders for permanent seats , germany , japan , india and brazil , had joined forces to lobby for their reform plans over the past year , arguing that the un 's highest body needed to better reflect the current geo-political situation and the amount each of them contributes financially and otherwise to the un . but on wednesday , the initiative was shaken up a bit after the four chief contenders revised their proposal and dropped the right to a veto for the first 15 years for new permanent members , in the hopes that their resolution would be adopted as early as this month .
diplomats speculate that the four contenders have about 100 of the 191 un members behind them , far short of the two-thirds majority needed to pass the reform resolution . five powers divided among the current five council members , only france and britain support all four of the new bidders .

german president horst köhler has come under fire from senior social democrats accusing him of taking sides with his fellow conservatives and pressing for the resignation of chancellor gerhard schröder . the german capital these days is a hot spot of speculations and rumors intentionally spread to inflict maximum damage to political foes ahead of september 's early elections . the latest allegations have come from the left wing of the ruling social democrats who are accusing the german presidential office of intentionally leaking information from a meeting between the german president and chancellor schröder , held to discuss ways towards early elections . one day after the meeting in may , germany 's leading tabloid bild alleged schröder had called early elections because he feared a leftwing revolt in his party after a crushing defeat in a regional poll in north rhine-westphalia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ludwig stiegler senior spd members such as ludwig stiegler , one of the party 's deputy parliamentary leaders , now assume that there is a conservative network in the vicinity of the president that gave away the details in an attempt to damage the chancellor . " the information must have been leaked by a well-known old-boys network of conservatives surrounding the german president , " stiegler , who has described köhler as the " politically most one-sided president " he has known . " we have to make this public and advise the president to be more watchful about the type of people on his staff , " stiegler added . party revolt or presidential intrigue ? some social democrats are now even suggesting the german president would seek the resignation of the chancellor rather than accept schröder 's plan to deliberately lose a confidence vote in parliament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering the latest accusations have come only one day after rumors that senior spd leaders would be planning to replace schröder with spd party leader franz müntefering and continue ruling until regular elections in 2006 .
on tuesday , schröder publicly dismissed these rumors as utter nonsense and apparently spawned by the opposition conservatives . on wednesday , markus söder , general secretary of the ultra-conservative csu party said that much of what was currently happening clearly reflected a government in dissolution . " all these rumours and allegations are a clear indication of how deeply split the ruling social democrats are , " söder said .

there is speculation that cabinet ministers could abstain in the vote of confidence and so undo schröder 's three-seat majority in parliament .
but questions are arising whether this plan is in line with germany 's constitution . president horst köhler plays a key role in the unfolding events because he must decide whether to dissolve parliament after such a vote of confidence .

german president horst köhler has come under fire from senior social democrats accusing him of taking sides with his fellow conservatives and pressing for the resignation of chancellor gerhard schröder . the german capital these days is a hot spot of speculations and rumors intentionally spread to inflict maximum damage to political foes ahead of september 's early elections . the latest allegations have come from the left wing of the ruling social democrats who are accusing the german presidential office of intentionally leaking information from a meeting between the german president and chancellor schröder , held to discuss ways towards early elections . one day after the meeting in may , germany 's leading tabloid bild alleged schröder had called early elections because he feared a leftwing revolt in his party after a crushing defeat in a regional poll in north rhine-westphalia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ludwig stiegler senior spd members such as ludwig stiegler , one of the party 's deputy parliamentary leaders , now assume that there is a conservative network in the vicinity of the president that gave away the details in an attempt to damage the chancellor .

washington has thrown a wrench into berlin ’ s aspirations of becoming a permanent member of the un security council , arguing that the expansion of the body is not its top reform priority . at a joint press conference with german foreign minister joschka fischer on wednesday , us secretary of state condoleezza rice held back on endorsing germany 's bid to become a permanent member of the un security council , arguing that other un reforms such as streamlining management were more important than the expansion of the top decision-making body from the current 15 members to 25 , as proposed by germany , japan , india and brazil . while generally acknowledging the need of a reform , rice , however , said the united states was looking closely at the various proposals to have " a sober and reflective discussion " aimed at achieving " the broadest possible consensus on how to move forward on what would be a very fundamental change . " and so our plan at this point is to try , through the appropriate channels at the un , the presidency of the general assembly and so forth , to promote that dialogue on what it is that we are trying to achieve in security council reform as well as in the broader un reform , " she said . support for one of four support for the reform initiative and the four contenders for permanent seats is far from certain .
on wednesday , rice said the us was not ready to endorse all four countries and their bid for permanent seats .
although she reiterated washington 's interest in reforming the council , she left the door wide open in terms of the exact context of the expansion proposal . " the only country that we have said unequivocally that we support is japan , having to do with japan 's special role in the un and support for the un , " rice said .
" but obviously , we are going to look at how to think about un security council expansion within the context of … broader reforms . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flags wave in front of un headquarters in new york despite the stated preference for only one of the four bidders , german officials interpreted rice 's statements as less of a rebuff of berlin 's efforts to join the council , and more of a general wariness to expansion . " we were given to understand by the united states that their concerns about this procedure are not motivated by any anti-german considerations , " said wolfgang ischinger , the german ambassador to the united states , who attended the meeting with rice and fischer . however , several other european and asian diplomats who asked to remain anonymous have indicated that one of the factors in the us position on security council expansion was its continuing distrust of german chancellor gerhard schöder 's strong opposition to the us-led war in iraq . back to the drafting board ? the reform proposal favored by germany , japan , india and brazil initially called for the adoption of a resolution which would add 10 new members to the council , six permanent members and four non-permanent ones , which would rotate for two-year terms .

washington has thrown a wrench into berlin ’ s aspirations of becoming a permanent member of the un security council , arguing that the expansion of the body is not its top reform priority . at a joint press conference with german foreign minister joschka fischer on wednesday , us secretary of state condoleezza rice held back on endorsing germany 's bid to become a permanent member of the un security council , arguing that other un reforms such as streamlining management were more important than the expansion of the top decision-making body from the current 15 members to 25 , as proposed by germany , japan , india and brazil . while generally acknowledging the need of a reform , rice , however , said the united states was looking closely at the various proposals to have " a sober and reflective discussion " aimed at achieving " the broadest possible consensus on how to move forward on what would be a very fundamental change . " and so our plan at this point is to try , through the appropriate channels at the un , the presidency of the general assembly and so forth , to promote that dialogue on what it is that we are trying to achieve in security council reform as well as in the broader un reform , " she said . support for one of four support for the reform initiative and the four contenders for permanent seats is far from certain .
on wednesday , rice said the us was not ready to endorse all four countries and their bid for permanent seats .
although she reiterated washington 's interest in reforming the council , she left the door wide open in terms of the exact context of the expansion proposal . " the only country that we have said unequivocally that we support is japan , having to do with japan 's special role in the un and support for the un , " rice said .
" but obviously , we are going to look at how to think about un security council expansion within the context of … broader reforms . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flags wave in front of un headquarters in new york despite the stated preference for only one of the four bidders , german officials interpreted rice 's statements as less of a rebuff of berlin 's efforts to join the council , and more of a general wariness to expansion . " we were given to understand by the united states that their concerns about this procedure are not motivated by any anti-german considerations , " said wolfgang ischinger , the german ambassador to the united states , who attended the meeting with rice and fischer . however , several other european and asian diplomats who asked to remain anonymous have indicated that one of the factors in the us position on security council expansion was its continuing distrust of german chancellor gerhard schöder 's strong opposition to the us-led war in iraq . back to the drafting board ? the reform proposal favored by germany , japan , india and brazil initially called for the adoption of a resolution which would add 10 new members to the council , six permanent members and four non-permanent ones , which would rotate for two-year terms .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 09.06.2005 germans head south in search of jobs großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the austrian hills are alive with employment as euroskeptics across the continent smugly salute france and holland for crushing the eu constitution ratification process , a migratory trend among german workers validates the benefits of cross border labor markets . over the past decade , the austrian and swiss employment markets have become highly attractive for germans who have either failed to find work on their home turf , or for those who simply want to get a taste of life beyond the boundaries of home . statistics compiled by the austrian social insurance holding organization reveal that the number of germans working south of the border has risen from an average of some 13,000 in 1995 to more than 45,000 last month .
it 's a steep hike which is disproportionate to the overall rise in the number of foreigners employed in austria - 300,000 in 1995 compared to 364,000 in 2004 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lyrical lure of the alps traditionally germans are not renowned for roaming the continent in search of work .
although the history of the german people is dotted with emigration episodes , on the whole , there was never a great need for them to leave home in order to make ends meet .
but times , moods and motivations change , and germans now represent the largest group of foreign workers from any european union country in austria . collectively they have a presence in the construction industry , in retail , cleaning , in agriculture , railways and much more , but the biggest single group is employed , albeit seasonally , in the tourist industry . demand beats supply austria has long been wooing tourists with the alps and the likes of vienna and salzburg , however .
so why the sudden surge in foreign workers ? hermann deutsch of austria 's federal ministry for economic affairs and labor said it 's a case of demand outstripping supply . " we quite simply need additional seasonal workers , and see it as a positive thing that we have been able to attract workers from germany during recent seasons , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : salzburg , austria is seasonally home to many german employees it 's a two-way street in which both employers and their guest employees are happy .
for many small businesses , being able to hire german staff is the difference between sinking or swimming , and they go down well with the tourists , a high percentage of which are themselves german . michaela wiatrz , who works as agent for the federal labor office 's placement service for hotel and catering staff , says that many of those who seek out seasonal jobs are young and are looking for a chance to use their freshly gained qualifications .

it 's a steep hike which is disproportionate to the overall rise in the number of foreigners employed in austria - 300,000 in 1995 compared to 364,000 in 2004 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lyrical lure of the alps traditionally germans are not renowned for roaming the continent in search of work .
although the history of the german people is dotted with emigration episodes , on the whole , there was never a great need for them to leave home in order to make ends meet .
but times , moods and motivations change , and germans now represent the largest group of foreign workers from any european union country in austria . collectively they have a presence in the construction industry , in retail , cleaning , in agriculture , railways and much more , but the biggest single group is employed , albeit seasonally , in the tourist industry . demand beats supply austria has long been wooing tourists with the alps and the likes of vienna and salzburg , however .
so why the sudden surge in foreign workers ? hermann deutsch of austria 's federal ministry for economic affairs and labor said it 's a case of demand outstripping supply . " we quite simply need additional seasonal workers , and see it as a positive thing that we have been able to attract workers from germany during recent seasons , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : salzburg , austria is seasonally home to many german employees it 's a two-way street in which both employers and their guest employees are happy .
for many small businesses , being able to hire german staff is the difference between sinking or swimming , and they go down well with the tourists , a high percentage of which are themselves german . michaela wiatrz , who works as agent for the federal labor office 's placement service for hotel and catering staff , says that many of those who seek out seasonal jobs are young and are looking for a chance to use their freshly gained qualifications . " the industry , by implication , means moving around , and german workers are highly desirable in austria and switzerland , both because they can speak the language and because of the high level of training they take with them , " she said . cause for concern ? although it sounds like a happy marriage , there is a jealous third party involved in this new nomadic trend .

most also attract little notice much less controversy .
but one zoo in southern germany is causing an uproar with a new event , an " african village . " an " african village " in a german zoo sounds a bit strange .
still , a zoo in augsburg in bavaria has created a special exhibit complete with a steppe setting to attract visitors .
but since their intention became public , it has attracted protests .
the group initiative for black people in germany has also called to complain and wants the exhibit stopped .
spokeswoman eleonore wiedenroth-coulibaly said she is bothered not just bay the exhibit but also its name , which is promoting generalizations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the show makes caricatures of africans , critics say " first of all , there is no one ' african ' village , " she said .
" secondly , not all african landscapes are steppe .
this is a reduction of africans in the old colonial tradition - africans as living close to nature with the animals .
it is this colonial viewpoint that bothers us . " worst possible setting the spokeswoman and other critics also from outside germany are also reminded of other exhibits in zoos like ones in the 19th century that were meant to promote a greater understanding of foreign cultures , particularly in newly colonized lands .
these exhibits served , above all , to promote a view for visitors of europeans as having the more civilized culture .
for this reason , critics say , the zoo is the worst possible place to hold such an exhibit . " the zoo also evolved out of colonial tradition , " wiedenroth-coulibaly said .
" and those former exhibits also came out about the same time , ones where people were displayed in a zoo , in nature , with animals , non-european .
and they as such are defamatory .
and some people do n't see that or do n't want to see that . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is no one single african village she is referring to the zoo 's director , barbara jantschke , whose first reaction to the complaints confirmed critics ' complaints .
the augsburg zoo would be the right place to impart an exotic atmosphere , she wrote .
she referred to the show 's organizer , egyptian-born munich-based event manager medhat abdelati .
he said that he in no uncertain terms wanted the show to tie in with colonial and racist traditions , because he , himself , has african heritage . " i do n't find anything objectionable , " he said .
" and if i would stop it now , i would just give their opinions more strength .
i have invited them to visit and see the show before they judge it . " bad choice in the meantime , he understands that the choice of the title was not great and could lead to misunderstandings . " we are treating it as a cultural festival , " he said .
" with art , jewelry , masks , that people can buy .
there is even a program for children . " regardless , critics still believe that a zoo is not an appropriate place to hold a cultural festival and are holding protests against the exhibition .
zoo officials say they wo n't cancel the show : they have offered to hold a workshop to discuss the issues during the festival . thomas mösch -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de köhler calls for more aid for africa ahead of his first trip to africa as german president , horst köhler has called on the international community , including germany , to considerably increase financial help for the struggling continent .

german president horst köhler has come under fire from senior social democrats accusing him of taking sides with his fellow conservatives and pressing for the resignation of chancellor gerhard schröder . the german capital these days is a hot spot of speculations and rumors intentionally spread to inflict maximum damage to political foes ahead of september 's early elections . the latest allegations have come from the left wing of the ruling social democrats who are accusing the german presidential office of intentionally leaking information from a meeting between the german president and chancellor schröder , held to discuss ways towards early elections . one day after the meeting in may , germany 's leading tabloid bild alleged schröder had called early elections because he feared a leftwing revolt in his party after a crushing defeat in a regional poll in north rhine-westphalia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ludwig stiegler senior spd members such as ludwig stiegler , one of the party 's deputy parliamentary leaders , now assume that there is a conservative network in the vicinity of the president that gave away the details in an attempt to damage the chancellor . " the information must have been leaked by a well-known old-boys network of conservatives surrounding the german president , " stiegler , who has described köhler as the " politically most one-sided president " he has known . " we have to make this public and advise the president to be more watchful about the type of people on his staff , " stiegler added . party revolt or presidential intrigue ? some social democrats are now even suggesting the german president would seek the resignation of the chancellor rather than accept schröder 's plan to deliberately lose a confidence vote in parliament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering the latest accusations have come only one day after rumors that senior spd leaders would be planning to replace schröder with spd party leader franz müntefering and continue ruling until regular elections in 2006 .
on tuesday , schröder publicly dismissed these rumors as utter nonsense and apparently spawned by the opposition conservatives . on wednesday , markus söder , general secretary of the ultra-conservative csu party said that much of what was currently happening clearly reflected a government in dissolution . " all these rumours and allegations are a clear indication of how deeply split the ruling social democrats are , " söder said . " they are showing that the government is totally preoccupied with itself and unable to solve the problems .
what we need now is a clear statement by the chancellor about how he wants to bring about early elections . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler -lrb- left -rrb- was angered by schröder 's failure to inform him of his early election plans ahead of going to the press .
the german chancellor , however , continues to remain silent .
there is speculation that cabinet ministers could abstain in the vote of confidence and so undo schröder 's three-seat majority in parliament .
but questions are arising whether this plan is in line with germany 's constitution . president horst köhler plays a key role in the unfolding events because he must decide whether to dissolve parliament after such a vote of confidence .
theoretically , he could reject it , throwing the timetable for september 's election into doubt and maybe still forcing the chancellor to resign in the end . uwe hessler -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder quiet on confidence vote german chancellor gerhard schröder continues to keep silent about the logistics of a confidence vote needed for proposed early elections much to the chagrin of members of his own center-left coalition .
-lrb- june 7 , 2005 -rrb- merkel chosen as chancellor candidate angela merkel , the leader of germany 's opposition christian democrats , has officially been chosen as the conservative challenger to chancellor gerhard schröder in early elections in the fall .
-lrb- may 31 , 2005 -rrb- early elections : strategy or slow suicide ?
the chancellor 's call to germans to seal his fate is one of his greatest political gambles yet .
public opinion is behind early elections , but does gerhard schröder really stand any chance of being re-elected ?

these are the questions that the curators of the karl marx house in trier want to try and answer with the new multi-media installation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl marx gets a good cleaning while the house still displays the well-known quotations from the man himself alongside objective critiques and criticisms of his ideas , the new exhibition includes computerized data terminals which allow visitors to dig deeper into the thinking behind marx 's concepts and what was happening in the world at the time of his writings . exhibition looks at global influence the exhibition also expands the theme of marx 's life and work into his influence on world ideologies and politics , beyond europe , specifically in countries like china , cuba , chile , vietnam , and also countries in africa . marx 's appeal and influence is still strong in these countries , especially in china .
almost a third of the 35,000 visitors which visit the karl marx house every year are asian guests , with the majority coming from china .
for most of them it is almost a pilgrimage , according to elisabeth neu , the museum 's head guide . " they come with such reverence , " neu said .
" there was a professor and his wife who visited last year and they were so overawed and reverential , it was something new to us . " bildunterschrift : the renovated karl marx house criticism prompts new approach while there are some who still revere marx , the guestbook reveals there are an equal number who are more critical about the man , his work and the museum itself .
" one can see from the reactions in the visitor 's book that some people are critical , saying that ' the museum is well intentioned but -lrb- marx -rrb- brought repression to our country ' , " neu added . in an attempt to offer a balanced view of karl marx and his influence , the new museum now includes an audio guide in four languages - german , english , french and chinese - which contains critical remarks about the man and his ideology , and also includes comments that criticize the application of his works in countries such as china . this is a new approach by the curators of the museum and one which is yet untested .
how the new , more critical exhibition will be received will be revealed once the house reopens on june 9 . marie mévellec -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a philosopher for the modern age anyone asked to give a list of german philosophers will always include his name .

it is the alliance 's first mission in africa . putting a dispute within the alliance behind them , nato representatives at the brussels meeting agreed late wednesday to airlift some 5,000 african union peacekeepers to the troubled region in western sudan .
the mission , which will be carried out by nato as well as the european union , is the first such operation on the african continent . " as you know , the situation in that region is appalling , and we must do all that is in our power , in coordination with other organizations , starting with the eu , to assist the african union in its efforts , " nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer in a final communiqué on the issue , nato said " we are committed to implementing speedily our logistical support to the african union mission in sudan in the areas of strategic deployment and self capacity building . " no firm dates have been set for the start of the mission , but officials said they hope to meet the african union 's goal of a july start . dispute over alliances in the run-up to thursday 's announcement , france had objected to a mission under nato command on the grounds that the european union was already assisting the african union in sudan .
france had argued that its offer to transport two battalions of senegalese troops was made under an eu , not a nato , banner . while washington wanted nato to coordinate the entire mission , defense chiefs in brussels were at pains to stress that there was no competition between its mission and that of the eu , and both organizations were working to avoid squabbling over alliances while people continue to die in darfur . " i believe that all sides here have the same aim : to help the sudan , " said german defense minister peter struck .
" there is no sense in arguing over competencies , over who should do what .
the main thing is that action is taken . " " who takes the lead in coordinating -lrb- the mission -rrb- is secondary , " he told reporters . under the agreement reached by nato , allies have the option of performing airlift missions either under nato or the eu 's auspices .
it is expected that france , germany and italy will lend their support through the eu , while the united states would use nato 's military command to conduct its airlift missions . nato 's coordination with the eu will go through an african union cell in the ethiopian capital of addis ababa , staffed with a small number of eu and nato officials . in addition to the air transport , nato has offered to train african union troops with an eye to improving command and control of the force . no nato troops in sudan the african union , which had ruled out direct involvement of western troops in darfur , called on nato and the eu to provide logistical support for the peacekeeping mission , which aims to put an end to the violence now going into its third year . sudan has welcomed nato 's logistics offer , which comes a day before the darfur peace talks resume , but it has also said it will not accept nato troops on its soil . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato discusses nuclear future nato defense ministers , who are meeting in brussles thursday , have responded to a call by german defense minister , peter struck , to review the " status of nuclear forces " in europe .

washington has thrown a wrench into berlin ’ s aspirations of becoming a permanent member of the un security council , arguing that the expansion of the body is not its top reform priority . at a joint press conference with german foreign minister joschka fischer on wednesday , us secretary of state condoleezza rice held back on endorsing germany 's bid to become a permanent member of the un security council , arguing that other un reforms such as streamlining management were more important than the expansion of the top decision-making body from the current 15 members to 25 , as proposed by germany , japan , india and brazil . while generally acknowledging the need of a reform , rice , however , said the united states was looking closely at the various proposals to have " a sober and reflective discussion " aimed at achieving " the broadest possible consensus on how to move forward on what would be a very fundamental change . " and so our plan at this point is to try , through the appropriate channels at the un , the presidency of the general assembly and so forth , to promote that dialogue on what it is that we are trying to achieve in security council reform as well as in the broader un reform , " she said . support for one of four support for the reform initiative and the four contenders for permanent seats is far from certain .
on wednesday , rice said the us was not ready to endorse all four countries and their bid for permanent seats .
although she reiterated washington 's interest in reforming the council , she left the door wide open in terms of the exact context of the expansion proposal . " the only country that we have said unequivocally that we support is japan , having to do with japan 's special role in the un and support for the un , " rice said .
" but obviously , we are going to look at how to think about un security council expansion within the context of … broader reforms . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flags wave in front of un headquarters in new york despite the stated preference for only one of the four bidders , german officials interpreted rice 's statements as less of a rebuff of berlin 's efforts to join the council , and more of a general wariness to expansion . " we were given to understand by the united states that their concerns about this procedure are not motivated by any anti-german considerations , " said wolfgang ischinger , the german ambassador to the united states , who attended the meeting with rice and fischer . however , several other european and asian diplomats who asked to remain anonymous have indicated that one of the factors in the us position on security council expansion was its continuing distrust of german chancellor gerhard schöder 's strong opposition to the us-led war in iraq . back to the drafting board ? the reform proposal favored by germany , japan , india and brazil initially called for the adoption of a resolution which would add 10 new members to the council , six permanent members and four non-permanent ones , which would rotate for two-year terms .

washington has thrown a wrench into berlin ’ s aspirations of becoming a permanent member of the un security council , arguing that the expansion of the body is not its top reform priority . at a joint press conference with german foreign minister joschka fischer on wednesday , us secretary of state condoleezza rice held back on endorsing germany 's bid to become a permanent member of the un security council , arguing that other un reforms such as streamlining management were more important than the expansion of the top decision-making body from the current 15 members to 25 , as proposed by germany , japan , india and brazil . while generally acknowledging the need of a reform , rice , however , said the united states was looking closely at the various proposals to have " a sober and reflective discussion " aimed at achieving " the broadest possible consensus on how to move forward on what would be a very fundamental change . " and so our plan at this point is to try , through the appropriate channels at the un , the presidency of the general assembly and so forth , to promote that dialogue on what it is that we are trying to achieve in security council reform as well as in the broader un reform , " she said . support for one of four support for the reform initiative and the four contenders for permanent seats is far from certain .
on wednesday , rice said the us was not ready to endorse all four countries and their bid for permanent seats .
although she reiterated washington 's interest in reforming the council , she left the door wide open in terms of the exact context of the expansion proposal . " the only country that we have said unequivocally that we support is japan , having to do with japan 's special role in the un and support for the un , " rice said .
" but obviously , we are going to look at how to think about un security council expansion within the context of … broader reforms . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flags wave in front of un headquarters in new york despite the stated preference for only one of the four bidders , german officials interpreted rice 's statements as less of a rebuff of berlin 's efforts to join the council , and more of a general wariness to expansion . " we were given to understand by the united states that their concerns about this procedure are not motivated by any anti-german considerations , " said wolfgang ischinger , the german ambassador to the united states , who attended the meeting with rice and fischer . however , several other european and asian diplomats who asked to remain anonymous have indicated that one of the factors in the us position on security council expansion was its continuing distrust of german chancellor gerhard schöder 's strong opposition to the us-led war in iraq . back to the drafting board ? the reform proposal favored by germany , japan , india and brazil initially called for the adoption of a resolution which would add 10 new members to the council , six permanent members and four non-permanent ones , which would rotate for two-year terms .
the council currently consists of five permanent members , france , britain , china , russia and the united states , and 10 non-permanent rotating members . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leaders from india , japan , brazil and germany team up to lobby for un reform the four chief contenders for permanent seats , germany , japan , india and brazil , had joined forces to lobby for their reform plans over the past year , arguing that the un 's highest body needed to better reflect the current geo-political situation and the amount each of them contributes financially and otherwise to the un . but on wednesday , the initiative was shaken up a bit after the four chief contenders revised their proposal and dropped the right to a veto for the first 15 years for new permanent members , in the hopes that their resolution would be adopted as early as this month .
diplomats speculate that the four contenders have about 100 of the 191 un members behind them , far short of the two-thirds majority needed to pass the reform resolution . five powers divided among the current five council members , only france and britain support all four of the new bidders .
china openly opposes any seat for japan while russia 's position remains unclear . within the general assembly , diplomats say germany faces the least opposition , while muslim nations are expected to organize against india and developing nations are believed to want to block japan 's aspirations . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer discusses eu future in us on what could be his farewell trip to the united states as germany 's foreign minister , joschka fischer discussed turkish membership in the eu and the eu role in the world in the aftermath of the consitutional crisis .

the preparations are in full flow and the excitement and expectation are already reaching fever pitch with almost a year still to go as teams from around the world slowly book their places at the global soccer showpiece . but for those who ca n't wait until june 2006 , there 's something happening this month which could satisfy the craving for top international soccer action : the confederations cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eight-team competition will be held over two weeks beginning on june 15 , 2005 and will feature some of the world 's top stars from argentina , brazil , tunisia , greece , japan , australia , mexico … and of course hosts germany . the tournament , which is played every two years , involves the host country , the current world champions , the winners of the european championships , the copa america , the oceania nations cup , the african nations cup , the gold cup and asian cup .
it is the play-off competition for the champions of champions , bringing together the ruling nations from the world 's soccer federations in a continental showdown . as brazil qualify as both world champions and holders of the copa america , the south american cup runners-up argentina take the eight spot in the mouth-watering line-up . the contest for the inter-continental crown the confederations cup is an opportunity for the regional champions to come together and challenge each other for the right to claim the inter-continental crown .
the competition also provides a chance for the so-called lesser confederations to test their progress against the nations of the more established and wealthier continents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world soccer governing body fifa president sepp blatter " the confederations cup is a wonderful competition because it is a symbol of solidarity between the confederations , " said fifa president sepp blatter .
" with the exception of the world cup , it is the only official international competition in which teams from all the continents can test themselves against one another . " france victory marred by tragedy in 2003 the last tournament in 2003 was won by then european champions and hosts france but was marred by the tragic death of cameroon player marc-vivien foe who collapsed on the pitch during a semi-final against colombia played in the soaring temperatures of that year 's extreme french summer . the first confederations cups , known the as the king fahd cup , were held in saudi arabia in 1992 , 1995 and 1997 .
mexico hosted the tournament in 1999 and japan and south korea did so in 2001 .
since the inaugural fifa confederations cup , each tournament has seen a different confederation emerge triumphant , adding to the excitement and unpredictability of the showcase competition . germany as hosts , however , will be hoping that they will break the trend of passing the title between the confederations and retain the cup for european federation uefa . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de coaches wrapped up in mini world cup even though only eight teams are invited , the confederations cup , little brother to the world cup 's 32 teams , is a big enough title to keep brazilian players from being able to enjoy the summer holidays .

german president horst köhler has come under fire from senior social democrats accusing him of taking sides with his fellow conservatives and pressing for the resignation of chancellor gerhard schröder . the german capital these days is a hot spot of speculations and rumors intentionally spread to inflict maximum damage to political foes ahead of september 's early elections . the latest allegations have come from the left wing of the ruling social democrats who are accusing the german presidential office of intentionally leaking information from a meeting between the german president and chancellor schröder , held to discuss ways towards early elections . one day after the meeting in may , germany 's leading tabloid bild alleged schröder had called early elections because he feared a leftwing revolt in his party after a crushing defeat in a regional poll in north rhine-westphalia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ludwig stiegler senior spd members such as ludwig stiegler , one of the party 's deputy parliamentary leaders , now assume that there is a conservative network in the vicinity of the president that gave away the details in an attempt to damage the chancellor . " the information must have been leaked by a well-known old-boys network of conservatives surrounding the german president , " stiegler , who has described köhler as the " politically most one-sided president " he has known . " we have to make this public and advise the president to be more watchful about the type of people on his staff , " stiegler added . party revolt or presidential intrigue ? some social democrats are now even suggesting the german president would seek the resignation of the chancellor rather than accept schröder 's plan to deliberately lose a confidence vote in parliament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering the latest accusations have come only one day after rumors that senior spd leaders would be planning to replace schröder with spd party leader franz müntefering and continue ruling until regular elections in 2006 .
on tuesday , schröder publicly dismissed these rumors as utter nonsense and apparently spawned by the opposition conservatives . on wednesday , markus söder , general secretary of the ultra-conservative csu party said that much of what was currently happening clearly reflected a government in dissolution . " all these rumours and allegations are a clear indication of how deeply split the ruling social democrats are , " söder said . " they are showing that the government is totally preoccupied with itself and unable to solve the problems .

the german chancellor , however , continues to remain silent .
there is speculation that cabinet ministers could abstain in the vote of confidence and so undo schröder 's three-seat majority in parliament .
but questions are arising whether this plan is in line with germany 's constitution . president horst köhler plays a key role in the unfolding events because he must decide whether to dissolve parliament after such a vote of confidence .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 09.06.2005 colonial cliches in a german zoo ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maybe not the best setting for an exhibit of african culture many zoos put on special exhibits in order to attract visitors .
most also attract little notice much less controversy .
but one zoo in southern germany is causing an uproar with a new event , an " african village . " an " african village " in a german zoo sounds a bit strange .
still , a zoo in augsburg in bavaria has created a special exhibit complete with a steppe setting to attract visitors .
but since their intention became public , it has attracted protests .
the group initiative for black people in germany has also called to complain and wants the exhibit stopped .
spokeswoman eleonore wiedenroth-coulibaly said she is bothered not just bay the exhibit but also its name , which is promoting generalizations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the show makes caricatures of africans , critics say " first of all , there is no one ' african ' village , " she said .
" secondly , not all african landscapes are steppe .
this is a reduction of africans in the old colonial tradition - africans as living close to nature with the animals .
it is this colonial viewpoint that bothers us . " worst possible setting the spokeswoman and other critics also from outside germany are also reminded of other exhibits in zoos like ones in the 19th century that were meant to promote a greater understanding of foreign cultures , particularly in newly colonized lands .
these exhibits served , above all , to promote a view for visitors of europeans as having the more civilized culture .
for this reason , critics say , the zoo is the worst possible place to hold such an exhibit . " the zoo also evolved out of colonial tradition , " wiedenroth-coulibaly said .
" and those former exhibits also came out about the same time , ones where people were displayed in a zoo , in nature , with animals , non-european .
and they as such are defamatory .
and some people do n't see that or do n't want to see that . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is no one single african village she is referring to the zoo 's director , barbara jantschke , whose first reaction to the complaints confirmed critics ' complaints .
the augsburg zoo would be the right place to impart an exotic atmosphere , she wrote .
she referred to the show 's organizer , egyptian-born munich-based event manager medhat abdelati .
he said that he in no uncertain terms wanted the show to tie in with colonial and racist traditions , because he , himself , has african heritage . " i do n't find anything objectionable , " he said .
" and if i would stop it now , i would just give their opinions more strength .
i have invited them to visit and see the show before they judge it . " bad choice in the meantime , he understands that the choice of the title was not great and could lead to misunderstandings . " we are treating it as a cultural festival , " he said .
" with art , jewelry , masks , that people can buy .
there is even a program for children . " regardless , critics still believe that a zoo is not an appropriate place to hold a cultural festival and are holding protests against the exhibition .
zoo officials say they wo n't cancel the show : they have offered to hold a workshop to discuss the issues during the festival . thomas mösch -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de köhler calls for more aid for africa ahead of his first trip to africa as german president , horst köhler has called on the international community , including germany , to considerably increase financial help for the struggling continent .

the preparations are in full flow and the excitement and expectation are already reaching fever pitch with almost a year still to go as teams from around the world slowly book their places at the global soccer showpiece . but for those who ca n't wait until june 2006 , there 's something happening this month which could satisfy the craving for top international soccer action : the confederations cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eight-team competition will be held over two weeks beginning on june 15 , 2005 and will feature some of the world 's top stars from argentina , brazil , tunisia , greece , japan , australia , mexico … and of course hosts germany . the tournament , which is played every two years , involves the host country , the current world champions , the winners of the european championships , the copa america , the oceania nations cup , the african nations cup , the gold cup and asian cup .
it is the play-off competition for the champions of champions , bringing together the ruling nations from the world 's soccer federations in a continental showdown . as brazil qualify as both world champions and holders of the copa america , the south american cup runners-up argentina take the eight spot in the mouth-watering line-up . the contest for the inter-continental crown the confederations cup is an opportunity for the regional champions to come together and challenge each other for the right to claim the inter-continental crown .
the competition also provides a chance for the so-called lesser confederations to test their progress against the nations of the more established and wealthier continents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world soccer governing body fifa president sepp blatter " the confederations cup is a wonderful competition because it is a symbol of solidarity between the confederations , " said fifa president sepp blatter .

mexico hosted the tournament in 1999 and japan and south korea did so in 2001 .
since the inaugural fifa confederations cup , each tournament has seen a different confederation emerge triumphant , adding to the excitement and unpredictability of the showcase competition . germany as hosts , however , will be hoping that they will break the trend of passing the title between the confederations and retain the cup for european federation uefa . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de coaches wrapped up in mini world cup even though only eight teams are invited , the confederations cup , little brother to the world cup 's 32 teams , is a big enough title to keep brazilian players from being able to enjoy the summer holidays .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 09.06.2005 germans head south in search of jobs großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the austrian hills are alive with employment as euroskeptics across the continent smugly salute france and holland for crushing the eu constitution ratification process , a migratory trend among german workers validates the benefits of cross border labor markets . over the past decade , the austrian and swiss employment markets have become highly attractive for germans who have either failed to find work on their home turf , or for those who simply want to get a taste of life beyond the boundaries of home . statistics compiled by the austrian social insurance holding organization reveal that the number of germans working south of the border has risen from an average of some 13,000 in 1995 to more than 45,000 last month .
it 's a steep hike which is disproportionate to the overall rise in the number of foreigners employed in austria - 300,000 in 1995 compared to 364,000 in 2004 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lyrical lure of the alps traditionally germans are not renowned for roaming the continent in search of work .
although the history of the german people is dotted with emigration episodes , on the whole , there was never a great need for them to leave home in order to make ends meet .
but times , moods and motivations change , and germans now represent the largest group of foreign workers from any european union country in austria . collectively they have a presence in the construction industry , in retail , cleaning , in agriculture , railways and much more , but the biggest single group is employed , albeit seasonally , in the tourist industry . demand beats supply austria has long been wooing tourists with the alps and the likes of vienna and salzburg , however .
so why the sudden surge in foreign workers ? hermann deutsch of austria 's federal ministry for economic affairs and labor said it 's a case of demand outstripping supply . " we quite simply need additional seasonal workers , and see it as a positive thing that we have been able to attract workers from germany during recent seasons , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : salzburg , austria is seasonally home to many german employees it 's a two-way street in which both employers and their guest employees are happy .
for many small businesses , being able to hire german staff is the difference between sinking or swimming , and they go down well with the tourists , a high percentage of which are themselves german . michaela wiatrz , who works as agent for the federal labor office 's placement service for hotel and catering staff , says that many of those who seek out seasonal jobs are young and are looking for a chance to use their freshly gained qualifications . " the industry , by implication , means moving around , and german workers are highly desirable in austria and switzerland , both because they can speak the language and because of the high level of training they take with them , " she said . cause for concern ? although it sounds like a happy marriage , there is a jealous third party involved in this new nomadic trend .
austria has its own unemployment problems to deal with and there are considerable concerns that german cooks and waitresses are in the business of stealing jobs .
but hermann said such claims do not reflect the reality of the situation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " there are always those austrian employees who claim foreign workers put additional pressure on the market and that each additional german is one too many , " he said .
" granted , it is important to do everything we can to fill the market gaps with unemployed austrians , but we ca n't simply fill all the vacancies with all the jobless , that 's too facile .

it 's a steep hike which is disproportionate to the overall rise in the number of foreigners employed in austria - 300,000 in 1995 compared to 364,000 in 2004 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lyrical lure of the alps traditionally germans are not renowned for roaming the continent in search of work .
although the history of the german people is dotted with emigration episodes , on the whole , there was never a great need for them to leave home in order to make ends meet .
but times , moods and motivations change , and germans now represent the largest group of foreign workers from any european union country in austria . collectively they have a presence in the construction industry , in retail , cleaning , in agriculture , railways and much more , but the biggest single group is employed , albeit seasonally , in the tourist industry . demand beats supply austria has long been wooing tourists with the alps and the likes of vienna and salzburg , however .
so why the sudden surge in foreign workers ? hermann deutsch of austria 's federal ministry for economic affairs and labor said it 's a case of demand outstripping supply . " we quite simply need additional seasonal workers , and see it as a positive thing that we have been able to attract workers from germany during recent seasons , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : salzburg , austria is seasonally home to many german employees it 's a two-way street in which both employers and their guest employees are happy .
for many small businesses , being able to hire german staff is the difference between sinking or swimming , and they go down well with the tourists , a high percentage of which are themselves german . michaela wiatrz , who works as agent for the federal labor office 's placement service for hotel and catering staff , says that many of those who seek out seasonal jobs are young and are looking for a chance to use their freshly gained qualifications . " the industry , by implication , means moving around , and german workers are highly desirable in austria and switzerland , both because they can speak the language and because of the high level of training they take with them , " she said . cause for concern ? although it sounds like a happy marriage , there is a jealous third party involved in this new nomadic trend .
austria has its own unemployment problems to deal with and there are considerable concerns that german cooks and waitresses are in the business of stealing jobs .
but hermann said such claims do not reflect the reality of the situation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " there are always those austrian employees who claim foreign workers put additional pressure on the market and that each additional german is one too many , " he said .
" granted , it is important to do everything we can to fill the market gaps with unemployed austrians , but we ca n't simply fill all the vacancies with all the jobless , that 's too facile . " the expert said he does n't believe there is any ground for the much mooted theory that the german contingent has triggered a wave of wage dumping .
he does , however , concede that because of the high applicant-to-post ratio , there is no need for employers to be excessively generous when it comes to filling the pay packet . good working conditions the fact is that traveling workers who leave germany will find the conditions and collective wage agreement pay rates in austria very similar to those at home . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pulling pints earns the same in austria as germany " rates in austria , which invariably include board and lodging , vary between 1,100 and 1,400 euros -lrb- $ 1,346 and $ 1,713 -rrb- after deductions for a five or six day week , " wiatrz said .

" " i 'm not going to talk about details of what the discussions will be , but we are not expecting radical changes , " the nato official added . in berlin , a spokesman for the defense ministry declined to say if struck would raise the issue but did say " i can imagine this subject will be talked about .

most also attract little notice much less controversy .
but one zoo in southern germany is causing an uproar with a new event , an " african village . " an " african village " in a german zoo sounds a bit strange .
still , a zoo in augsburg in bavaria has created a special exhibit complete with a steppe setting to attract visitors .
but since their intention became public , it has attracted protests .
the group initiative for black people in germany has also called to complain and wants the exhibit stopped .
spokeswoman eleonore wiedenroth-coulibaly said she is bothered not just bay the exhibit but also its name , which is promoting generalizations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the show makes caricatures of africans , critics say " first of all , there is no one ' african ' village , " she said .
" secondly , not all african landscapes are steppe .
this is a reduction of africans in the old colonial tradition - africans as living close to nature with the animals .
it is this colonial viewpoint that bothers us . " worst possible setting the spokeswoman and other critics also from outside germany are also reminded of other exhibits in zoos like ones in the 19th century that were meant to promote a greater understanding of foreign cultures , particularly in newly colonized lands .
these exhibits served , above all , to promote a view for visitors of europeans as having the more civilized culture .
for this reason , critics say , the zoo is the worst possible place to hold such an exhibit . " the zoo also evolved out of colonial tradition , " wiedenroth-coulibaly said .
" and those former exhibits also came out about the same time , ones where people were displayed in a zoo , in nature , with animals , non-european .
and they as such are defamatory .
and some people do n't see that or do n't want to see that . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is no one single african village she is referring to the zoo 's director , barbara jantschke , whose first reaction to the complaints confirmed critics ' complaints .
the augsburg zoo would be the right place to impart an exotic atmosphere , she wrote .
she referred to the show 's organizer , egyptian-born munich-based event manager medhat abdelati .
he said that he in no uncertain terms wanted the show to tie in with colonial and racist traditions , because he , himself , has african heritage . " i do n't find anything objectionable , " he said .
" and if i would stop it now , i would just give their opinions more strength .
i have invited them to visit and see the show before they judge it . " bad choice in the meantime , he understands that the choice of the title was not great and could lead to misunderstandings . " we are treating it as a cultural festival , " he said .
" with art , jewelry , masks , that people can buy .
there is even a program for children . " regardless , critics still believe that a zoo is not an appropriate place to hold a cultural festival and are holding protests against the exhibition .
zoo officials say they wo n't cancel the show : they have offered to hold a workshop to discuss the issues during the festival . thomas mösch -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de köhler calls for more aid for africa ahead of his first trip to africa as german president , horst köhler has called on the international community , including germany , to considerably increase financial help for the struggling continent .

washington has thrown a wrench into berlin ’ s aspirations of becoming a permanent member of the un security council , arguing that the expansion of the body is not its top reform priority . at a joint press conference with german foreign minister joschka fischer on wednesday , us secretary of state condoleezza rice held back on endorsing germany 's bid to become a permanent member of the un security council , arguing that other un reforms such as streamlining management were more important than the expansion of the top decision-making body from the current 15 members to 25 , as proposed by germany , japan , india and brazil . while generally acknowledging the need of a reform , rice , however , said the united states was looking closely at the various proposals to have " a sober and reflective discussion " aimed at achieving " the broadest possible consensus on how to move forward on what would be a very fundamental change . " and so our plan at this point is to try , through the appropriate channels at the un , the presidency of the general assembly and so forth , to promote that dialogue on what it is that we are trying to achieve in security council reform as well as in the broader un reform , " she said . support for one of four support for the reform initiative and the four contenders for permanent seats is far from certain .
on wednesday , rice said the us was not ready to endorse all four countries and their bid for permanent seats .
although she reiterated washington 's interest in reforming the council , she left the door wide open in terms of the exact context of the expansion proposal . " the only country that we have said unequivocally that we support is japan , having to do with japan 's special role in the un and support for the un , " rice said .

washington has thrown a wrench into berlin ’ s aspirations of becoming a permanent member of the un security council , arguing that the expansion of the body is not its top reform priority . at a joint press conference with german foreign minister joschka fischer on wednesday , us secretary of state condoleezza rice held back on endorsing germany 's bid to become a permanent member of the un security council , arguing that other un reforms such as streamlining management were more important than the expansion of the top decision-making body from the current 15 members to 25 , as proposed by germany , japan , india and brazil . while generally acknowledging the need of a reform , rice , however , said the united states was looking closely at the various proposals to have " a sober and reflective discussion " aimed at achieving " the broadest possible consensus on how to move forward on what would be a very fundamental change . " and so our plan at this point is to try , through the appropriate channels at the un , the presidency of the general assembly and so forth , to promote that dialogue on what it is that we are trying to achieve in security council reform as well as in the broader un reform , " she said . support for one of four support for the reform initiative and the four contenders for permanent seats is far from certain .
on wednesday , rice said the us was not ready to endorse all four countries and their bid for permanent seats .
although she reiterated washington 's interest in reforming the council , she left the door wide open in terms of the exact context of the expansion proposal . " the only country that we have said unequivocally that we support is japan , having to do with japan 's special role in the un and support for the un , " rice said .

nato defense ministers , who are meeting in brussles thursday , have responded to a call by german defense minister , peter struck , to review the " status of nuclear forces " in europe . last month , struck said he wanted to bring up the issue of us nuclear weapons stationed in germany with his partners at the military alliance . when asked if one germany would raise the issue of us nuclear arms on its territory , one nato official , speaking on condition of anonymity , said " the meeting will address the status of nuclear forces . " " i 'm not going to talk about details of what the discussions will be , but we are not expecting radical changes , " the nato official added . in berlin , a spokesman for the defense ministry declined to say if struck would raise the issue but did say " i can imagine this subject will be talked about . " confidential debate although a meeting of nato 's nuclear planning committee is not unusual , it has not met for 18 months .
the committee brings together all nato states except france , since paris left the alliance 's integrated command structure in 1966 . the committee members hold highly confidential debates about nuclear questions , generally consisting of presentations by the united states or britain , the only nato members on the committee with nuclear weapons . about 95 percent of the nuclear weapons stationed in europe have been withdrawn since the collapse of the iron curtain . dw staff / afp -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tough talking behind the smiles president george w. bush continued his hectic schedule in brussels on tuesday when he met with european union officials to tackle a number of thorny issues .

it 's a steep hike which is disproportionate to the overall rise in the number of foreigners employed in austria - 300,000 in 1995 compared to 364,000 in 2004 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lyrical lure of the alps traditionally germans are not renowned for roaming the continent in search of work .
although the history of the german people is dotted with emigration episodes , on the whole , there was never a great need for them to leave home in order to make ends meet .
but times , moods and motivations change , and germans now represent the largest group of foreign workers from any european union country in austria . collectively they have a presence in the construction industry , in retail , cleaning , in agriculture , railways and much more , but the biggest single group is employed , albeit seasonally , in the tourist industry . demand beats supply austria has long been wooing tourists with the alps and the likes of vienna and salzburg , however .
so why the sudden surge in foreign workers ? hermann deutsch of austria 's federal ministry for economic affairs and labor said it 's a case of demand outstripping supply . " we quite simply need additional seasonal workers , and see it as a positive thing that we have been able to attract workers from germany during recent seasons , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : salzburg , austria is seasonally home to many german employees it 's a two-way street in which both employers and their guest employees are happy .
for many small businesses , being able to hire german staff is the difference between sinking or swimming , and they go down well with the tourists , a high percentage of which are themselves german . michaela wiatrz , who works as agent for the federal labor office 's placement service for hotel and catering staff , says that many of those who seek out seasonal jobs are young and are looking for a chance to use their freshly gained qualifications . " the industry , by implication , means moving around , and german workers are highly desirable in austria and switzerland , both because they can speak the language and because of the high level of training they take with them , " she said . cause for concern ? although it sounds like a happy marriage , there is a jealous third party involved in this new nomadic trend .
austria has its own unemployment problems to deal with and there are considerable concerns that german cooks and waitresses are in the business of stealing jobs .
but hermann said such claims do not reflect the reality of the situation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " there are always those austrian employees who claim foreign workers put additional pressure on the market and that each additional german is one too many , " he said .
" granted , it is important to do everything we can to fill the market gaps with unemployed austrians , but we ca n't simply fill all the vacancies with all the jobless , that 's too facile . " the expert said he does n't believe there is any ground for the much mooted theory that the german contingent has triggered a wave of wage dumping .
he does , however , concede that because of the high applicant-to-post ratio , there is no need for employers to be excessively generous when it comes to filling the pay packet . good working conditions the fact is that traveling workers who leave germany will find the conditions and collective wage agreement pay rates in austria very similar to those at home . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pulling pints earns the same in austria as germany " rates in austria , which invariably include board and lodging , vary between 1,100 and 1,400 euros -lrb- $ 1,346 and $ 1,713 -rrb- after deductions for a five or six day week , " wiatrz said .
" ' but many germans are financially attracted to the idea of working in switzerland where they only work a five day week and earn 10 percent more . " that said , switzerland is a staggeringly expensive place to live . wiatrz pointed out that the average hospitality industry wage is simply not enough to fill the average swiss wallet , which is part of the reason for the tourist industry vacancies in the first place . tamsin walker , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de doctors defect to blissful britain germany 's health system is a troubled soul .

most also attract little notice much less controversy .
but one zoo in southern germany is causing an uproar with a new event , an " african village . " an " african village " in a german zoo sounds a bit strange .
still , a zoo in augsburg in bavaria has created a special exhibit complete with a steppe setting to attract visitors .
but since their intention became public , it has attracted protests .
the group initiative for black people in germany has also called to complain and wants the exhibit stopped .
spokeswoman eleonore wiedenroth-coulibaly said she is bothered not just bay the exhibit but also its name , which is promoting generalizations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the show makes caricatures of africans , critics say " first of all , there is no one ' african ' village , " she said .
" secondly , not all african landscapes are steppe .
this is a reduction of africans in the old colonial tradition - africans as living close to nature with the animals .
it is this colonial viewpoint that bothers us .

an immigration and refugee office spokesperson , contacted by afp news service , refused to comment on the case .

the preparations are in full flow and the excitement and expectation are already reaching fever pitch with almost a year still to go as teams from around the world slowly book their places at the global soccer showpiece . but for those who ca n't wait until june 2006 , there 's something happening this month which could satisfy the craving for top international soccer action : the confederations cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eight-team competition will be held over two weeks beginning on june 15 , 2005 and will feature some of the world 's top stars from argentina , brazil , tunisia , greece , japan , australia , mexico … and of course hosts germany . the tournament , which is played every two years , involves the host country , the current world champions , the winners of the european championships , the copa america , the oceania nations cup , the african nations cup , the gold cup and asian cup .
it is the play-off competition for the champions of champions , bringing together the ruling nations from the world 's soccer federations in a continental showdown . as brazil qualify as both world champions and holders of the copa america , the south american cup runners-up argentina take the eight spot in the mouth-watering line-up . the contest for the inter-continental crown the confederations cup is an opportunity for the regional champions to come together and challenge each other for the right to claim the inter-continental crown .

mexico hosted the tournament in 1999 and japan and south korea did so in 2001 .
since the inaugural fifa confederations cup , each tournament has seen a different confederation emerge triumphant , adding to the excitement and unpredictability of the showcase competition . germany as hosts , however , will be hoping that they will break the trend of passing the title between the confederations and retain the cup for european federation uefa . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de coaches wrapped up in mini world cup even though only eight teams are invited , the confederations cup , little brother to the world cup 's 32 teams , is a big enough title to keep brazilian players from being able to enjoy the summer holidays .

it is the play-off competition for the champions of champions , bringing together the ruling nations from the world 's soccer federations in a continental showdown . as brazil qualify as both world champions and holders of the copa america , the south american cup runners-up argentina take the eight spot in the mouth-watering line-up . the contest for the inter-continental crown the confederations cup is an opportunity for the regional champions to come together and challenge each other for the right to claim the inter-continental crown .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 09.06.2005 us wary of german security council bid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how many seats are open for expansion of the security council ?
washington has thrown a wrench into berlin ’ s aspirations of becoming a permanent member of the un security council , arguing that the expansion of the body is not its top reform priority . at a joint press conference with german foreign minister joschka fischer on wednesday , us secretary of state condoleezza rice held back on endorsing germany 's bid to become a permanent member of the un security council , arguing that other un reforms such as streamlining management were more important than the expansion of the top decision-making body from the current 15 members to 25 , as proposed by germany , japan , india and brazil . while generally acknowledging the need of a reform , rice , however , said the united states was looking closely at the various proposals to have " a sober and reflective discussion " aimed at achieving " the broadest possible consensus on how to move forward on what would be a very fundamental change . " and so our plan at this point is to try , through the appropriate channels at the un , the presidency of the general assembly and so forth , to promote that dialogue on what it is that we are trying to achieve in security council reform as well as in the broader un reform , " she said . support for one of four support for the reform initiative and the four contenders for permanent seats is far from certain .
on wednesday , rice said the us was not ready to endorse all four countries and their bid for permanent seats .
although she reiterated washington 's interest in reforming the council , she left the door wide open in terms of the exact context of the expansion proposal . " the only country that we have said unequivocally that we support is japan , having to do with japan 's special role in the un and support for the un , " rice said .
" but obviously , we are going to look at how to think about un security council expansion within the context of … broader reforms . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flags wave in front of un headquarters in new york despite the stated preference for only one of the four bidders , german officials interpreted rice 's statements as less of a rebuff of berlin 's efforts to join the council , and more of a general wariness to expansion . " we were given to understand by the united states that their concerns about this procedure are not motivated by any anti-german considerations , " said wolfgang ischinger , the german ambassador to the united states , who attended the meeting with rice and fischer . however , several other european and asian diplomats who asked to remain anonymous have indicated that one of the factors in the us position on security council expansion was its continuing distrust of german chancellor gerhard schöder 's strong opposition to the us-led war in iraq . back to the drafting board ? the reform proposal favored by germany , japan , india and brazil initially called for the adoption of a resolution which would add 10 new members to the council , six permanent members and four non-permanent ones , which would rotate for two-year terms .
the council currently consists of five permanent members , france , britain , china , russia and the united states , and 10 non-permanent rotating members . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leaders from india , japan , brazil and germany team up to lobby for un reform the four chief contenders for permanent seats , germany , japan , india and brazil , had joined forces to lobby for their reform plans over the past year , arguing that the un 's highest body needed to better reflect the current geo-political situation and the amount each of them contributes financially and otherwise to the un . but on wednesday , the initiative was shaken up a bit after the four chief contenders revised their proposal and dropped the right to a veto for the first 15 years for new permanent members , in the hopes that their resolution would be adopted as early as this month .
diplomats speculate that the four contenders have about 100 of the 191 un members behind them , far short of the two-thirds majority needed to pass the reform resolution . five powers divided among the current five council members , only france and britain support all four of the new bidders .
china openly opposes any seat for japan while russia 's position remains unclear . within the general assembly , diplomats say germany faces the least opposition , while muslim nations are expected to organize against india and developing nations are believed to want to block japan 's aspirations . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer discusses eu future in us on what could be his farewell trip to the united states as germany 's foreign minister , joschka fischer discussed turkish membership in the eu and the eu role in the world in the aftermath of the consitutional crisis .

german president horst köhler has come under fire from senior social democrats accusing him of taking sides with his fellow conservatives and pressing for the resignation of chancellor gerhard schröder . the german capital these days is a hot spot of speculations and rumors intentionally spread to inflict maximum damage to political foes ahead of september 's early elections . the latest allegations have come from the left wing of the ruling social democrats who are accusing the german presidential office of intentionally leaking information from a meeting between the german president and chancellor schröder , held to discuss ways towards early elections . one day after the meeting in may , germany 's leading tabloid bild alleged schröder had called early elections because he feared a leftwing revolt in his party after a crushing defeat in a regional poll in north rhine-westphalia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ludwig stiegler senior spd members such as ludwig stiegler , one of the party 's deputy parliamentary leaders , now assume that there is a conservative network in the vicinity of the president that gave away the details in an attempt to damage the chancellor .

on tuesday , schröder publicly dismissed these rumors as utter nonsense and apparently spawned by the opposition conservatives . on wednesday , markus söder , general secretary of the ultra-conservative csu party said that much of what was currently happening clearly reflected a government in dissolution . " all these rumours and allegations are a clear indication of how deeply split the ruling social democrats are , " söder said .

german president horst köhler has come under fire from senior social democrats accusing him of taking sides with his fellow conservatives and pressing for the resignation of chancellor gerhard schröder . the german capital these days is a hot spot of speculations and rumors intentionally spread to inflict maximum damage to political foes ahead of september 's early elections . the latest allegations have come from the left wing of the ruling social democrats who are accusing the german presidential office of intentionally leaking information from a meeting between the german president and chancellor schröder , held to discuss ways towards early elections . one day after the meeting in may , germany 's leading tabloid bild alleged schröder had called early elections because he feared a leftwing revolt in his party after a crushing defeat in a regional poll in north rhine-westphalia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ludwig stiegler senior spd members such as ludwig stiegler , one of the party 's deputy parliamentary leaders , now assume that there is a conservative network in the vicinity of the president that gave away the details in an attempt to damage the chancellor . " the information must have been leaked by a well-known old-boys network of conservatives surrounding the german president , " stiegler , who has described köhler as the " politically most one-sided president " he has known . " we have to make this public and advise the president to be more watchful about the type of people on his staff , " stiegler added . party revolt or presidential intrigue ? some social democrats are now even suggesting the german president would seek the resignation of the chancellor rather than accept schröder 's plan to deliberately lose a confidence vote in parliament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering the latest accusations have come only one day after rumors that senior spd leaders would be planning to replace schröder with spd party leader franz müntefering and continue ruling until regular elections in 2006 .
on tuesday , schröder publicly dismissed these rumors as utter nonsense and apparently spawned by the opposition conservatives . on wednesday , markus söder , general secretary of the ultra-conservative csu party said that much of what was currently happening clearly reflected a government in dissolution . " all these rumours and allegations are a clear indication of how deeply split the ruling social democrats are , " söder said . " they are showing that the government is totally preoccupied with itself and unable to solve the problems .
what we need now is a clear statement by the chancellor about how he wants to bring about early elections . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler -lrb- left -rrb- was angered by schröder 's failure to inform him of his early election plans ahead of going to the press .
the german chancellor , however , continues to remain silent .
there is speculation that cabinet ministers could abstain in the vote of confidence and so undo schröder 's three-seat majority in parliament .
but questions are arising whether this plan is in line with germany 's constitution . president horst köhler plays a key role in the unfolding events because he must decide whether to dissolve parliament after such a vote of confidence .
theoretically , he could reject it , throwing the timetable for september 's election into doubt and maybe still forcing the chancellor to resign in the end . uwe hessler -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder quiet on confidence vote german chancellor gerhard schröder continues to keep silent about the logistics of a confidence vote needed for proposed early elections much to the chagrin of members of his own center-left coalition .
-lrb- june 7 , 2005 -rrb- merkel chosen as chancellor candidate angela merkel , the leader of germany 's opposition christian democrats , has officially been chosen as the conservative challenger to chancellor gerhard schröder in early elections in the fall .
-lrb- may 31 , 2005 -rrb- early elections : strategy or slow suicide ?
the chancellor 's call to germans to seal his fate is one of his greatest political gambles yet .
public opinion is behind early elections , but does gerhard schröder really stand any chance of being re-elected ?
-lrb- may 23 , 2005 -rrb- feedback do you think köhler should refuse to go along with the early election plans ?

washington has thrown a wrench into berlin ’ s aspirations of becoming a permanent member of the un security council , arguing that the expansion of the body is not its top reform priority . at a joint press conference with german foreign minister joschka fischer on wednesday , us secretary of state condoleezza rice held back on endorsing germany 's bid to become a permanent member of the un security council , arguing that other un reforms such as streamlining management were more important than the expansion of the top decision-making body from the current 15 members to 25 , as proposed by germany , japan , india and brazil . while generally acknowledging the need of a reform , rice , however , said the united states was looking closely at the various proposals to have " a sober and reflective discussion " aimed at achieving " the broadest possible consensus on how to move forward on what would be a very fundamental change . " and so our plan at this point is to try , through the appropriate channels at the un , the presidency of the general assembly and so forth , to promote that dialogue on what it is that we are trying to achieve in security council reform as well as in the broader un reform , " she said . support for one of four support for the reform initiative and the four contenders for permanent seats is far from certain .
on wednesday , rice said the us was not ready to endorse all four countries and their bid for permanent seats .
although she reiterated washington 's interest in reforming the council , she left the door wide open in terms of the exact context of the expansion proposal . " the only country that we have said unequivocally that we support is japan , having to do with japan 's special role in the un and support for the un , " rice said .
" but obviously , we are going to look at how to think about un security council expansion within the context of … broader reforms . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flags wave in front of un headquarters in new york despite the stated preference for only one of the four bidders , german officials interpreted rice 's statements as less of a rebuff of berlin 's efforts to join the council , and more of a general wariness to expansion . " we were given to understand by the united states that their concerns about this procedure are not motivated by any anti-german considerations , " said wolfgang ischinger , the german ambassador to the united states , who attended the meeting with rice and fischer . however , several other european and asian diplomats who asked to remain anonymous have indicated that one of the factors in the us position on security council expansion was its continuing distrust of german chancellor gerhard schöder 's strong opposition to the us-led war in iraq . back to the drafting board ? the reform proposal favored by germany , japan , india and brazil initially called for the adoption of a resolution which would add 10 new members to the council , six permanent members and four non-permanent ones , which would rotate for two-year terms .
the council currently consists of five permanent members , france , britain , china , russia and the united states , and 10 non-permanent rotating members . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leaders from india , japan , brazil and germany team up to lobby for un reform the four chief contenders for permanent seats , germany , japan , india and brazil , had joined forces to lobby for their reform plans over the past year , arguing that the un 's highest body needed to better reflect the current geo-political situation and the amount each of them contributes financially and otherwise to the un . but on wednesday , the initiative was shaken up a bit after the four chief contenders revised their proposal and dropped the right to a veto for the first 15 years for new permanent members , in the hopes that their resolution would be adopted as early as this month .
diplomats speculate that the four contenders have about 100 of the 191 un members behind them , far short of the two-thirds majority needed to pass the reform resolution . five powers divided among the current five council members , only france and britain support all four of the new bidders .
china openly opposes any seat for japan while russia 's position remains unclear . within the general assembly , diplomats say germany faces the least opposition , while muslim nations are expected to organize against india and developing nations are believed to want to block japan 's aspirations . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer discusses eu future in us on what could be his farewell trip to the united states as germany 's foreign minister , joschka fischer discussed turkish membership in the eu and the eu role in the world in the aftermath of the consitutional crisis .

an immigration and refugee office spokesperson , contacted by afp news service , refused to comment on the case .

" " i 'm not going to talk about details of what the discussions will be , but we are not expecting radical changes , " the nato official added . in berlin , a spokesman for the defense ministry declined to say if struck would raise the issue but did say " i can imagine this subject will be talked about .

it is the alliance 's first mission in africa . putting a dispute within the alliance behind them , nato representatives at the brussels meeting agreed late wednesday to airlift some 5,000 african union peacekeepers to the troubled region in western sudan .
the mission , which will be carried out by nato as well as the european union , is the first such operation on the african continent . " as you know , the situation in that region is appalling , and we must do all that is in our power , in coordination with other organizations , starting with the eu , to assist the african union in its efforts , " nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer in a final communiqué on the issue , nato said " we are committed to implementing speedily our logistical support to the african union mission in sudan in the areas of strategic deployment and self capacity building . " no firm dates have been set for the start of the mission , but officials said they hope to meet the african union 's goal of a july start . dispute over alliances in the run-up to thursday 's announcement , france had objected to a mission under nato command on the grounds that the european union was already assisting the african union in sudan .
france had argued that its offer to transport two battalions of senegalese troops was made under an eu , not a nato , banner . while washington wanted nato to coordinate the entire mission , defense chiefs in brussels were at pains to stress that there was no competition between its mission and that of the eu , and both organizations were working to avoid squabbling over alliances while people continue to die in darfur . " i believe that all sides here have the same aim : to help the sudan , " said german defense minister peter struck .
" there is no sense in arguing over competencies , over who should do what .
the main thing is that action is taken . " " who takes the lead in coordinating -lrb- the mission -rrb- is secondary , " he told reporters . under the agreement reached by nato , allies have the option of performing airlift missions either under nato or the eu 's auspices .
it is expected that france , germany and italy will lend their support through the eu , while the united states would use nato 's military command to conduct its airlift missions . nato 's coordination with the eu will go through an african union cell in the ethiopian capital of addis ababa , staffed with a small number of eu and nato officials . in addition to the air transport , nato has offered to train african union troops with an eye to improving command and control of the force . no nato troops in sudan the african union , which had ruled out direct involvement of western troops in darfur , called on nato and the eu to provide logistical support for the peacekeeping mission , which aims to put an end to the violence now going into its third year . sudan has welcomed nato 's logistics offer , which comes a day before the darfur peace talks resume , but it has also said it will not accept nato troops on its soil . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato discusses nuclear future nato defense ministers , who are meeting in brussles thursday , have responded to a call by german defense minister , peter struck , to review the " status of nuclear forces " in europe .

german president horst köhler has come under fire from senior social democrats accusing him of taking sides with his fellow conservatives and pressing for the resignation of chancellor gerhard schröder . the german capital these days is a hot spot of speculations and rumors intentionally spread to inflict maximum damage to political foes ahead of september 's early elections . the latest allegations have come from the left wing of the ruling social democrats who are accusing the german presidential office of intentionally leaking information from a meeting between the german president and chancellor schröder , held to discuss ways towards early elections . one day after the meeting in may , germany 's leading tabloid bild alleged schröder had called early elections because he feared a leftwing revolt in his party after a crushing defeat in a regional poll in north rhine-westphalia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ludwig stiegler senior spd members such as ludwig stiegler , one of the party 's deputy parliamentary leaders , now assume that there is a conservative network in the vicinity of the president that gave away the details in an attempt to damage the chancellor .

on tuesday , schröder publicly dismissed these rumors as utter nonsense and apparently spawned by the opposition conservatives . on wednesday , markus söder , general secretary of the ultra-conservative csu party said that much of what was currently happening clearly reflected a government in dissolution . " all these rumours and allegations are a clear indication of how deeply split the ruling social democrats are , " söder said .

german president horst köhler has come under fire from senior social democrats accusing him of taking sides with his fellow conservatives and pressing for the resignation of chancellor gerhard schröder . the german capital these days is a hot spot of speculations and rumors intentionally spread to inflict maximum damage to political foes ahead of september 's early elections . the latest allegations have come from the left wing of the ruling social democrats who are accusing the german presidential office of intentionally leaking information from a meeting between the german president and chancellor schröder , held to discuss ways towards early elections . one day after the meeting in may , germany 's leading tabloid bild alleged schröder had called early elections because he feared a leftwing revolt in his party after a crushing defeat in a regional poll in north rhine-westphalia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ludwig stiegler senior spd members such as ludwig stiegler , one of the party 's deputy parliamentary leaders , now assume that there is a conservative network in the vicinity of the president that gave away the details in an attempt to damage the chancellor . " the information must have been leaked by a well-known old-boys network of conservatives surrounding the german president , " stiegler , who has described köhler as the " politically most one-sided president " he has known .

" all these rumours and allegations are a clear indication of how deeply split the ruling social democrats are , " söder said .

most also attract little notice much less controversy .
but one zoo in southern germany is causing an uproar with a new event , an " african village . " an " african village " in a german zoo sounds a bit strange .
still , a zoo in augsburg in bavaria has created a special exhibit complete with a steppe setting to attract visitors .
but since their intention became public , it has attracted protests .
the group initiative for black people in germany has also called to complain and wants the exhibit stopped .
spokeswoman eleonore wiedenroth-coulibaly said she is bothered not just bay the exhibit but also its name , which is promoting generalizations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the show makes caricatures of africans , critics say " first of all , there is no one ' african ' village , " she said .
" secondly , not all african landscapes are steppe .
this is a reduction of africans in the old colonial tradition - africans as living close to nature with the animals .
it is this colonial viewpoint that bothers us . " worst possible setting the spokeswoman and other critics also from outside germany are also reminded of other exhibits in zoos like ones in the 19th century that were meant to promote a greater understanding of foreign cultures , particularly in newly colonized lands .
these exhibits served , above all , to promote a view for visitors of europeans as having the more civilized culture .
for this reason , critics say , the zoo is the worst possible place to hold such an exhibit . " the zoo also evolved out of colonial tradition , " wiedenroth-coulibaly said .
" and those former exhibits also came out about the same time , ones where people were displayed in a zoo , in nature , with animals , non-european .
and they as such are defamatory .
and some people do n't see that or do n't want to see that . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is no one single african village she is referring to the zoo 's director , barbara jantschke , whose first reaction to the complaints confirmed critics ' complaints .
the augsburg zoo would be the right place to impart an exotic atmosphere , she wrote .
she referred to the show 's organizer , egyptian-born munich-based event manager medhat abdelati .
he said that he in no uncertain terms wanted the show to tie in with colonial and racist traditions , because he , himself , has african heritage . " i do n't find anything objectionable , " he said .
" and if i would stop it now , i would just give their opinions more strength .
i have invited them to visit and see the show before they judge it . " bad choice in the meantime , he understands that the choice of the title was not great and could lead to misunderstandings . " we are treating it as a cultural festival , " he said .
" with art , jewelry , masks , that people can buy .
there is even a program for children . " regardless , critics still believe that a zoo is not an appropriate place to hold a cultural festival and are holding protests against the exhibition .
zoo officials say they wo n't cancel the show : they have offered to hold a workshop to discuss the issues during the festival . thomas mösch -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de köhler calls for more aid for africa ahead of his first trip to africa as german president , horst köhler has called on the international community , including germany , to considerably increase financial help for the struggling continent .

most also attract little notice much less controversy .
but one zoo in southern germany is causing an uproar with a new event , an " african village . " an " african village " in a german zoo sounds a bit strange .
still , a zoo in augsburg in bavaria has created a special exhibit complete with a steppe setting to attract visitors .
but since their intention became public , it has attracted protests .
the group initiative for black people in germany has also called to complain and wants the exhibit stopped .
spokeswoman eleonore wiedenroth-coulibaly said she is bothered not just bay the exhibit but also its name , which is promoting generalizations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the show makes caricatures of africans , critics say " first of all , there is no one ' african ' village , " she said .
" secondly , not all african landscapes are steppe .
this is a reduction of africans in the old colonial tradition - africans as living close to nature with the animals .
it is this colonial viewpoint that bothers us . " worst possible setting the spokeswoman and other critics also from outside germany are also reminded of other exhibits in zoos like ones in the 19th century that were meant to promote a greater understanding of foreign cultures , particularly in newly colonized lands .
these exhibits served , above all , to promote a view for visitors of europeans as having the more civilized culture .
for this reason , critics say , the zoo is the worst possible place to hold such an exhibit . " the zoo also evolved out of colonial tradition , " wiedenroth-coulibaly said .
" and those former exhibits also came out about the same time , ones where people were displayed in a zoo , in nature , with animals , non-european .
and they as such are defamatory .
and some people do n't see that or do n't want to see that . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is no one single african village she is referring to the zoo 's director , barbara jantschke , whose first reaction to the complaints confirmed critics ' complaints .
the augsburg zoo would be the right place to impart an exotic atmosphere , she wrote .
she referred to the show 's organizer , egyptian-born munich-based event manager medhat abdelati .
he said that he in no uncertain terms wanted the show to tie in with colonial and racist traditions , because he , himself , has african heritage . " i do n't find anything objectionable , " he said .
" and if i would stop it now , i would just give their opinions more strength .
i have invited them to visit and see the show before they judge it . " bad choice in the meantime , he understands that the choice of the title was not great and could lead to misunderstandings . " we are treating it as a cultural festival , " he said .
" with art , jewelry , masks , that people can buy .
there is even a program for children . " regardless , critics still believe that a zoo is not an appropriate place to hold a cultural festival and are holding protests against the exhibition .
zoo officials say they wo n't cancel the show : they have offered to hold a workshop to discuss the issues during the festival . thomas mösch -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de köhler calls for more aid for africa ahead of his first trip to africa as german president , horst köhler has called on the international community , including germany , to considerably increase financial help for the struggling continent .

it also offers a critical view of his influence on global ideologies and politics . the birthplace of karl marx reopens to the public on june 9 with a new permanent exhibition which follows the life of the founder of socialism through his work and his worldwide effect on history from the 19th century to the present day .
the use of modern media in the renovated home of marx is expected to bring his remarkable life to a new audience . but how relevant is marx in the 21st century ?
why should someone spend time and money presenting his life to a new audience ?
these are the questions that the curators of the karl marx house in trier want to try and answer with the new multi-media installation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl marx gets a good cleaning while the house still displays the well-known quotations from the man himself alongside objective critiques and criticisms of his ideas , the new exhibition includes computerized data terminals which allow visitors to dig deeper into the thinking behind marx 's concepts and what was happening in the world at the time of his writings . exhibition looks at global influence the exhibition also expands the theme of marx 's life and work into his influence on world ideologies and politics , beyond europe , specifically in countries like china , cuba , chile , vietnam , and also countries in africa . marx 's appeal and influence is still strong in these countries , especially in china .
almost a third of the 35,000 visitors which visit the karl marx house every year are asian guests , with the majority coming from china .
for most of them it is almost a pilgrimage , according to elisabeth neu , the museum 's head guide . " they come with such reverence , " neu said .
" there was a professor and his wife who visited last year and they were so overawed and reverential , it was something new to us . " bildunterschrift : the renovated karl marx house criticism prompts new approach while there are some who still revere marx , the guestbook reveals there are an equal number who are more critical about the man , his work and the museum itself .
" one can see from the reactions in the visitor 's book that some people are critical , saying that ' the museum is well intentioned but -lrb- marx -rrb- brought repression to our country ' , " neu added . in an attempt to offer a balanced view of karl marx and his influence , the new museum now includes an audio guide in four languages - german , english , french and chinese - which contains critical remarks about the man and his ideology , and also includes comments that criticize the application of his works in countries such as china . this is a new approach by the curators of the museum and one which is yet untested .
how the new , more critical exhibition will be received will be revealed once the house reopens on june 9 . marie mévellec -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a philosopher for the modern age anyone asked to give a list of german philosophers will always include his name .
right up next to hegel and marx , kant is one of germany 's - if not the world 's - most famous thinkers .

anyone visiting the city today literally stumbles over ancient traces at nearly every corner .

it is the alliance 's first mission in africa . putting a dispute within the alliance behind them , nato representatives at the brussels meeting agreed late wednesday to airlift some 5,000 african union peacekeepers to the troubled region in western sudan .
the mission , which will be carried out by nato as well as the european union , is the first such operation on the african continent . " as you know , the situation in that region is appalling , and we must do all that is in our power , in coordination with other organizations , starting with the eu , to assist the african union in its efforts , " nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer in a final communiqué on the issue , nato said " we are committed to implementing speedily our logistical support to the african union mission in sudan in the areas of strategic deployment and self capacity building . " no firm dates have been set for the start of the mission , but officials said they hope to meet the african union 's goal of a july start . dispute over alliances in the run-up to thursday 's announcement , france had objected to a mission under nato command on the grounds that the european union was already assisting the african union in sudan .
france had argued that its offer to transport two battalions of senegalese troops was made under an eu , not a nato , banner . while washington wanted nato to coordinate the entire mission , defense chiefs in brussels were at pains to stress that there was no competition between its mission and that of the eu , and both organizations were working to avoid squabbling over alliances while people continue to die in darfur . " i believe that all sides here have the same aim : to help the sudan , " said german defense minister peter struck .
" there is no sense in arguing over competencies , over who should do what .
the main thing is that action is taken . " " who takes the lead in coordinating -lrb- the mission -rrb- is secondary , " he told reporters . under the agreement reached by nato , allies have the option of performing airlift missions either under nato or the eu 's auspices .
it is expected that france , germany and italy will lend their support through the eu , while the united states would use nato 's military command to conduct its airlift missions . nato 's coordination with the eu will go through an african union cell in the ethiopian capital of addis ababa , staffed with a small number of eu and nato officials . in addition to the air transport , nato has offered to train african union troops with an eye to improving command and control of the force . no nato troops in sudan the african union , which had ruled out direct involvement of western troops in darfur , called on nato and the eu to provide logistical support for the peacekeeping mission , which aims to put an end to the violence now going into its third year . sudan has welcomed nato 's logistics offer , which comes a day before the darfur peace talks resume , but it has also said it will not accept nato troops on its soil . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato discusses nuclear future nato defense ministers , who are meeting in brussles thursday , have responded to a call by german defense minister , peter struck , to review the " status of nuclear forces " in europe .

the committee brings together all nato states except france , since paris left the alliance 's integrated command structure in 1966 . the committee members hold highly confidential debates about nuclear questions , generally consisting of presentations by the united states or britain , the only nato members on the committee with nuclear weapons . about 95 percent of the nuclear weapons stationed in europe have been withdrawn since the collapse of the iron curtain . dw staff / afp -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tough talking behind the smiles president george w. bush continued his hectic schedule in brussels on tuesday when he met with european union officials to tackle a number of thorny issues .

it 's a steep hike which is disproportionate to the overall rise in the number of foreigners employed in austria - 300,000 in 1995 compared to 364,000 in 2004 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lyrical lure of the alps traditionally germans are not renowned for roaming the continent in search of work .
although the history of the german people is dotted with emigration episodes , on the whole , there was never a great need for them to leave home in order to make ends meet .
but times , moods and motivations change , and germans now represent the largest group of foreign workers from any european union country in austria . collectively they have a presence in the construction industry , in retail , cleaning , in agriculture , railways and much more , but the biggest single group is employed , albeit seasonally , in the tourist industry . demand beats supply austria has long been wooing tourists with the alps and the likes of vienna and salzburg , however .
so why the sudden surge in foreign workers ? hermann deutsch of austria 's federal ministry for economic affairs and labor said it 's a case of demand outstripping supply . " we quite simply need additional seasonal workers , and see it as a positive thing that we have been able to attract workers from germany during recent seasons , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : salzburg , austria is seasonally home to many german employees it 's a two-way street in which both employers and their guest employees are happy .
for many small businesses , being able to hire german staff is the difference between sinking or swimming , and they go down well with the tourists , a high percentage of which are themselves german . michaela wiatrz , who works as agent for the federal labor office 's placement service for hotel and catering staff , says that many of those who seek out seasonal jobs are young and are looking for a chance to use their freshly gained qualifications . " the industry , by implication , means moving around , and german workers are highly desirable in austria and switzerland , both because they can speak the language and because of the high level of training they take with them , " she said . cause for concern ? although it sounds like a happy marriage , there is a jealous third party involved in this new nomadic trend .
austria has its own unemployment problems to deal with and there are considerable concerns that german cooks and waitresses are in the business of stealing jobs .
but hermann said such claims do not reflect the reality of the situation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " there are always those austrian employees who claim foreign workers put additional pressure on the market and that each additional german is one too many , " he said .
" granted , it is important to do everything we can to fill the market gaps with unemployed austrians , but we ca n't simply fill all the vacancies with all the jobless , that 's too facile . " the expert said he does n't believe there is any ground for the much mooted theory that the german contingent has triggered a wave of wage dumping .
he does , however , concede that because of the high applicant-to-post ratio , there is no need for employers to be excessively generous when it comes to filling the pay packet . good working conditions the fact is that traveling workers who leave germany will find the conditions and collective wage agreement pay rates in austria very similar to those at home . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pulling pints earns the same in austria as germany " rates in austria , which invariably include board and lodging , vary between 1,100 and 1,400 euros -lrb- $ 1,346 and $ 1,713 -rrb- after deductions for a five or six day week , " wiatrz said .
" ' but many germans are financially attracted to the idea of working in switzerland where they only work a five day week and earn 10 percent more . " that said , switzerland is a staggeringly expensive place to live . wiatrz pointed out that the average hospitality industry wage is simply not enough to fill the average swiss wallet , which is part of the reason for the tourist industry vacancies in the first place . tamsin walker , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de doctors defect to blissful britain germany 's health system is a troubled soul .

the preparations are in full flow and the excitement and expectation are already reaching fever pitch with almost a year still to go as teams from around the world slowly book their places at the global soccer showpiece . but for those who ca n't wait until june 2006 , there 's something happening this month which could satisfy the craving for top international soccer action : the confederations cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eight-team competition will be held over two weeks beginning on june 15 , 2005 and will feature some of the world 's top stars from argentina , brazil , tunisia , greece , japan , australia , mexico … and of course hosts germany . the tournament , which is played every two years , involves the host country , the current world champions , the winners of the european championships , the copa america , the oceania nations cup , the african nations cup , the gold cup and asian cup .
it is the play-off competition for the champions of champions , bringing together the ruling nations from the world 's soccer federations in a continental showdown . as brazil qualify as both world champions and holders of the copa america , the south american cup runners-up argentina take the eight spot in the mouth-watering line-up . the contest for the inter-continental crown the confederations cup is an opportunity for the regional champions to come together and challenge each other for the right to claim the inter-continental crown .
the competition also provides a chance for the so-called lesser confederations to test their progress against the nations of the more established and wealthier continents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world soccer governing body fifa president sepp blatter " the confederations cup is a wonderful competition because it is a symbol of solidarity between the confederations , " said fifa president sepp blatter .

" france victory marred by tragedy in 2003 the last tournament in 2003 was won by then european champions and hosts france but was marred by the tragic death of cameroon player marc-vivien foe who collapsed on the pitch during a semi-final against colombia played in the soaring temperatures of that year 's extreme french summer . the first confederations cups , known the as the king fahd cup , were held in saudi arabia in 1992 , 1995 and 1997 .
mexico hosted the tournament in 1999 and japan and south korea did so in 2001 .
since the inaugural fifa confederations cup , each tournament has seen a different confederation emerge triumphant , adding to the excitement and unpredictability of the showcase competition . germany as hosts , however , will be hoping that they will break the trend of passing the title between the confederations and retain the cup for european federation uefa . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de coaches wrapped up in mini world cup even though only eight teams are invited , the confederations cup , little brother to the world cup 's 32 teams , is a big enough title to keep brazilian players from being able to enjoy the summer holidays .

washington has thrown a wrench into berlin ’ s aspirations of becoming a permanent member of the un security council , arguing that the expansion of the body is not its top reform priority . at a joint press conference with german foreign minister joschka fischer on wednesday , us secretary of state condoleezza rice held back on endorsing germany 's bid to become a permanent member of the un security council , arguing that other un reforms such as streamlining management were more important than the expansion of the top decision-making body from the current 15 members to 25 , as proposed by germany , japan , india and brazil . while generally acknowledging the need of a reform , rice , however , said the united states was looking closely at the various proposals to have " a sober and reflective discussion " aimed at achieving " the broadest possible consensus on how to move forward on what would be a very fundamental change . " and so our plan at this point is to try , through the appropriate channels at the un , the presidency of the general assembly and so forth , to promote that dialogue on what it is that we are trying to achieve in security council reform as well as in the broader un reform , " she said . support for one of four support for the reform initiative and the four contenders for permanent seats is far from certain .
on wednesday , rice said the us was not ready to endorse all four countries and their bid for permanent seats .
although she reiterated washington 's interest in reforming the council , she left the door wide open in terms of the exact context of the expansion proposal . " the only country that we have said unequivocally that we support is japan , having to do with japan 's special role in the un and support for the un , " rice said .
" but obviously , we are going to look at how to think about un security council expansion within the context of … broader reforms . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flags wave in front of un headquarters in new york despite the stated preference for only one of the four bidders , german officials interpreted rice 's statements as less of a rebuff of berlin 's efforts to join the council , and more of a general wariness to expansion . " we were given to understand by the united states that their concerns about this procedure are not motivated by any anti-german considerations , " said wolfgang ischinger , the german ambassador to the united states , who attended the meeting with rice and fischer . however , several other european and asian diplomats who asked to remain anonymous have indicated that one of the factors in the us position on security council expansion was its continuing distrust of german chancellor gerhard schöder 's strong opposition to the us-led war in iraq . back to the drafting board ? the reform proposal favored by germany , japan , india and brazil initially called for the adoption of a resolution which would add 10 new members to the council , six permanent members and four non-permanent ones , which would rotate for two-year terms .
the council currently consists of five permanent members , france , britain , china , russia and the united states , and 10 non-permanent rotating members . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leaders from india , japan , brazil and germany team up to lobby for un reform the four chief contenders for permanent seats , germany , japan , india and brazil , had joined forces to lobby for their reform plans over the past year , arguing that the un 's highest body needed to better reflect the current geo-political situation and the amount each of them contributes financially and otherwise to the un . but on wednesday , the initiative was shaken up a bit after the four chief contenders revised their proposal and dropped the right to a veto for the first 15 years for new permanent members , in the hopes that their resolution would be adopted as early as this month .
diplomats speculate that the four contenders have about 100 of the 191 un members behind them , far short of the two-thirds majority needed to pass the reform resolution . five powers divided among the current five council members , only france and britain support all four of the new bidders .

washington has thrown a wrench into berlin ’ s aspirations of becoming a permanent member of the un security council , arguing that the expansion of the body is not its top reform priority . at a joint press conference with german foreign minister joschka fischer on wednesday , us secretary of state condoleezza rice held back on endorsing germany 's bid to become a permanent member of the un security council , arguing that other un reforms such as streamlining management were more important than the expansion of the top decision-making body from the current 15 members to 25 , as proposed by germany , japan , india and brazil . while generally acknowledging the need of a reform , rice , however , said the united states was looking closely at the various proposals to have " a sober and reflective discussion " aimed at achieving " the broadest possible consensus on how to move forward on what would be a very fundamental change . " and so our plan at this point is to try , through the appropriate channels at the un , the presidency of the general assembly and so forth , to promote that dialogue on what it is that we are trying to achieve in security council reform as well as in the broader un reform , " she said . support for one of four support for the reform initiative and the four contenders for permanent seats is far from certain .
on wednesday , rice said the us was not ready to endorse all four countries and their bid for permanent seats .
although she reiterated washington 's interest in reforming the council , she left the door wide open in terms of the exact context of the expansion proposal . " the only country that we have said unequivocally that we support is japan , having to do with japan 's special role in the un and support for the un , " rice said .
" but obviously , we are going to look at how to think about un security council expansion within the context of … broader reforms . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flags wave in front of un headquarters in new york despite the stated preference for only one of the four bidders , german officials interpreted rice 's statements as less of a rebuff of berlin 's efforts to join the council , and more of a general wariness to expansion . " we were given to understand by the united states that their concerns about this procedure are not motivated by any anti-german considerations , " said wolfgang ischinger , the german ambassador to the united states , who attended the meeting with rice and fischer . however , several other european and asian diplomats who asked to remain anonymous have indicated that one of the factors in the us position on security council expansion was its continuing distrust of german chancellor gerhard schöder 's strong opposition to the us-led war in iraq . back to the drafting board ? the reform proposal favored by germany , japan , india and brazil initially called for the adoption of a resolution which would add 10 new members to the council , six permanent members and four non-permanent ones , which would rotate for two-year terms .
the council currently consists of five permanent members , france , britain , china , russia and the united states , and 10 non-permanent rotating members . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leaders from india , japan , brazil and germany team up to lobby for un reform the four chief contenders for permanent seats , germany , japan , india and brazil , had joined forces to lobby for their reform plans over the past year , arguing that the un 's highest body needed to better reflect the current geo-political situation and the amount each of them contributes financially and otherwise to the un . but on wednesday , the initiative was shaken up a bit after the four chief contenders revised their proposal and dropped the right to a veto for the first 15 years for new permanent members , in the hopes that their resolution would be adopted as early as this month .
diplomats speculate that the four contenders have about 100 of the 191 un members behind them , far short of the two-thirds majority needed to pass the reform resolution . five powers divided among the current five council members , only france and britain support all four of the new bidders .
china openly opposes any seat for japan while russia 's position remains unclear . within the general assembly , diplomats say germany faces the least opposition , while muslim nations are expected to organize against india and developing nations are believed to want to block japan 's aspirations . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer discusses eu future in us on what could be his farewell trip to the united states as germany 's foreign minister , joschka fischer discussed turkish membership in the eu and the eu role in the world in the aftermath of the consitutional crisis .

it is the play-off competition for the champions of champions , bringing together the ruling nations from the world 's soccer federations in a continental showdown . as brazil qualify as both world champions and holders of the copa america , the south american cup runners-up argentina take the eight spot in the mouth-watering line-up . the contest for the inter-continental crown the confederations cup is an opportunity for the regional champions to come together and challenge each other for the right to claim the inter-continental crown .

since the inaugural fifa confederations cup , each tournament has seen a different confederation emerge triumphant , adding to the excitement and unpredictability of the showcase competition . germany as hosts , however , will be hoping that they will break the trend of passing the title between the confederations and retain the cup for european federation uefa . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de coaches wrapped up in mini world cup even though only eight teams are invited , the confederations cup , little brother to the world cup 's 32 teams , is a big enough title to keep brazilian players from being able to enjoy the summer holidays .

washington has thrown a wrench into berlin ’ s aspirations of becoming a permanent member of the un security council , arguing that the expansion of the body is not its top reform priority . at a joint press conference with german foreign minister joschka fischer on wednesday , us secretary of state condoleezza rice held back on endorsing germany 's bid to become a permanent member of the un security council , arguing that other un reforms such as streamlining management were more important than the expansion of the top decision-making body from the current 15 members to 25 , as proposed by germany , japan , india and brazil . while generally acknowledging the need of a reform , rice , however , said the united states was looking closely at the various proposals to have " a sober and reflective discussion " aimed at achieving " the broadest possible consensus on how to move forward on what would be a very fundamental change . " and so our plan at this point is to try , through the appropriate channels at the un , the presidency of the general assembly and so forth , to promote that dialogue on what it is that we are trying to achieve in security council reform as well as in the broader un reform , " she said . support for one of four support for the reform initiative and the four contenders for permanent seats is far from certain .
on wednesday , rice said the us was not ready to endorse all four countries and their bid for permanent seats .
although she reiterated washington 's interest in reforming the council , she left the door wide open in terms of the exact context of the expansion proposal . " the only country that we have said unequivocally that we support is japan , having to do with japan 's special role in the un and support for the un , " rice said .
" but obviously , we are going to look at how to think about un security council expansion within the context of … broader reforms . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flags wave in front of un headquarters in new york despite the stated preference for only one of the four bidders , german officials interpreted rice 's statements as less of a rebuff of berlin 's efforts to join the council , and more of a general wariness to expansion . " we were given to understand by the united states that their concerns about this procedure are not motivated by any anti-german considerations , " said wolfgang ischinger , the german ambassador to the united states , who attended the meeting with rice and fischer . however , several other european and asian diplomats who asked to remain anonymous have indicated that one of the factors in the us position on security council expansion was its continuing distrust of german chancellor gerhard schöder 's strong opposition to the us-led war in iraq . back to the drafting board ? the reform proposal favored by germany , japan , india and brazil initially called for the adoption of a resolution which would add 10 new members to the council , six permanent members and four non-permanent ones , which would rotate for two-year terms .
the council currently consists of five permanent members , france , britain , china , russia and the united states , and 10 non-permanent rotating members . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leaders from india , japan , brazil and germany team up to lobby for un reform the four chief contenders for permanent seats , germany , japan , india and brazil , had joined forces to lobby for their reform plans over the past year , arguing that the un 's highest body needed to better reflect the current geo-political situation and the amount each of them contributes financially and otherwise to the un . but on wednesday , the initiative was shaken up a bit after the four chief contenders revised their proposal and dropped the right to a veto for the first 15 years for new permanent members , in the hopes that their resolution would be adopted as early as this month .
diplomats speculate that the four contenders have about 100 of the 191 un members behind them , far short of the two-thirds majority needed to pass the reform resolution . five powers divided among the current five council members , only france and britain support all four of the new bidders .

washington has thrown a wrench into berlin ’ s aspirations of becoming a permanent member of the un security council , arguing that the expansion of the body is not its top reform priority . at a joint press conference with german foreign minister joschka fischer on wednesday , us secretary of state condoleezza rice held back on endorsing germany 's bid to become a permanent member of the un security council , arguing that other un reforms such as streamlining management were more important than the expansion of the top decision-making body from the current 15 members to 25 , as proposed by germany , japan , india and brazil . while generally acknowledging the need of a reform , rice , however , said the united states was looking closely at the various proposals to have " a sober and reflective discussion " aimed at achieving " the broadest possible consensus on how to move forward on what would be a very fundamental change . " and so our plan at this point is to try , through the appropriate channels at the un , the presidency of the general assembly and so forth , to promote that dialogue on what it is that we are trying to achieve in security council reform as well as in the broader un reform , " she said . support for one of four support for the reform initiative and the four contenders for permanent seats is far from certain .
on wednesday , rice said the us was not ready to endorse all four countries and their bid for permanent seats .
although she reiterated washington 's interest in reforming the council , she left the door wide open in terms of the exact context of the expansion proposal . " the only country that we have said unequivocally that we support is japan , having to do with japan 's special role in the un and support for the un , " rice said .
" but obviously , we are going to look at how to think about un security council expansion within the context of … broader reforms . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flags wave in front of un headquarters in new york despite the stated preference for only one of the four bidders , german officials interpreted rice 's statements as less of a rebuff of berlin 's efforts to join the council , and more of a general wariness to expansion .

2004 germany ’ s federal appeals court on thursday upheld alower court 's acquittal of abdelghani mzoudi , who was accused of involvement in the sept .
11 attacks on the united states . the german federal appeals court in karlsruhe upheld an earlier court decision to acquit the 32-year-old moroccan student of all charges of aiding the hamburg terror cell which launched the sept .
11 , 2001 , terror attacks on new york and washington . abdelghani mzoudi was first brought to trial in 2003 on charges of aiding and abetting in the murder of more than 3,000 people .

2004 trial described the moroccan student as a “ fringe figure ” and justified the acquittal because there was insufficient proof against mzoudi , not because the court was convinced of his innocence . the ongoing case against mzoudi has led to tensions between germany and the united states because of washington ’ s refusal , on security grounds , to allow captured al qaeda leaders to testify or to provide information from their interrogations .
the lack of such input is largely believed to have lead to the prosecution ’ s failure to convict .

german president horst köhler has come under fire from senior social democrats accusing him of taking sides with his fellow conservatives and pressing for the resignation of chancellor gerhard schröder . the german capital these days is a hot spot of speculations and rumors intentionally spread to inflict maximum damage to political foes ahead of september 's early elections . the latest allegations have come from the left wing of the ruling social democrats who are accusing the german presidential office of intentionally leaking information from a meeting between the german president and chancellor schröder , held to discuss ways towards early elections . one day after the meeting in may , germany 's leading tabloid bild alleged schröder had called early elections because he feared a leftwing revolt in his party after a crushing defeat in a regional poll in north rhine-westphalia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ludwig stiegler senior spd members such as ludwig stiegler , one of the party 's deputy parliamentary leaders , now assume that there is a conservative network in the vicinity of the president that gave away the details in an attempt to damage the chancellor .

" we have to make this public and advise the president to be more watchful about the type of people on his staff , " stiegler added . party revolt or presidential intrigue ? some social democrats are now even suggesting the german president would seek the resignation of the chancellor rather than accept schröder 's plan to deliberately lose a confidence vote in parliament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering the latest accusations have come only one day after rumors that senior spd leaders would be planning to replace schröder with spd party leader franz müntefering and continue ruling until regular elections in 2006 .
on tuesday , schröder publicly dismissed these rumors as utter nonsense and apparently spawned by the opposition conservatives . on wednesday , markus söder , general secretary of the ultra-conservative csu party said that much of what was currently happening clearly reflected a government in dissolution . " all these rumours and allegations are a clear indication of how deeply split the ruling social democrats are , " söder said .

it also offers a critical view of his influence on global ideologies and politics . the birthplace of karl marx reopens to the public on june 9 with a new permanent exhibition which follows the life of the founder of socialism through his work and his worldwide effect on history from the 19th century to the present day .
the use of modern media in the renovated home of marx is expected to bring his remarkable life to a new audience . but how relevant is marx in the 21st century ?
why should someone spend time and money presenting his life to a new audience ?
these are the questions that the curators of the karl marx house in trier want to try and answer with the new multi-media installation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl marx gets a good cleaning while the house still displays the well-known quotations from the man himself alongside objective critiques and criticisms of his ideas , the new exhibition includes computerized data terminals which allow visitors to dig deeper into the thinking behind marx 's concepts and what was happening in the world at the time of his writings . exhibition looks at global influence the exhibition also expands the theme of marx 's life and work into his influence on world ideologies and politics , beyond europe , specifically in countries like china , cuba , chile , vietnam , and also countries in africa . marx 's appeal and influence is still strong in these countries , especially in china .

it also offers a critical view of his influence on global ideologies and politics . the birthplace of karl marx reopens to the public on june 9 with a new permanent exhibition which follows the life of the founder of socialism through his work and his worldwide effect on history from the 19th century to the present day .
the use of modern media in the renovated home of marx is expected to bring his remarkable life to a new audience . but how relevant is marx in the 21st century ?
why should someone spend time and money presenting his life to a new audience ?
these are the questions that the curators of the karl marx house in trier want to try and answer with the new multi-media installation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl marx gets a good cleaning while the house still displays the well-known quotations from the man himself alongside objective critiques and criticisms of his ideas , the new exhibition includes computerized data terminals which allow visitors to dig deeper into the thinking behind marx 's concepts and what was happening in the world at the time of his writings . exhibition looks at global influence the exhibition also expands the theme of marx 's life and work into his influence on world ideologies and politics , beyond europe , specifically in countries like china , cuba , chile , vietnam , and also countries in africa . marx 's appeal and influence is still strong in these countries , especially in china .
almost a third of the 35,000 visitors which visit the karl marx house every year are asian guests , with the majority coming from china .
for most of them it is almost a pilgrimage , according to elisabeth neu , the museum 's head guide . " they come with such reverence , " neu said .
" there was a professor and his wife who visited last year and they were so overawed and reverential , it was something new to us . " bildunterschrift : the renovated karl marx house criticism prompts new approach while there are some who still revere marx , the guestbook reveals there are an equal number who are more critical about the man , his work and the museum itself .
" one can see from the reactions in the visitor 's book that some people are critical , saying that ' the museum is well intentioned but -lrb- marx -rrb- brought repression to our country ' , " neu added . in an attempt to offer a balanced view of karl marx and his influence , the new museum now includes an audio guide in four languages - german , english , french and chinese - which contains critical remarks about the man and his ideology , and also includes comments that criticize the application of his works in countries such as china . this is a new approach by the curators of the museum and one which is yet untested .
how the new , more critical exhibition will be received will be revealed once the house reopens on june 9 . marie mévellec -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a philosopher for the modern age anyone asked to give a list of german philosophers will always include his name .

german president horst köhler has come under fire from senior social democrats accusing him of taking sides with his fellow conservatives and pressing for the resignation of chancellor gerhard schröder . the german capital these days is a hot spot of speculations and rumors intentionally spread to inflict maximum damage to political foes ahead of september 's early elections . the latest allegations have come from the left wing of the ruling social democrats who are accusing the german presidential office of intentionally leaking information from a meeting between the german president and chancellor schröder , held to discuss ways towards early elections . one day after the meeting in may , germany 's leading tabloid bild alleged schröder had called early elections because he feared a leftwing revolt in his party after a crushing defeat in a regional poll in north rhine-westphalia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ludwig stiegler senior spd members such as ludwig stiegler , one of the party 's deputy parliamentary leaders , now assume that there is a conservative network in the vicinity of the president that gave away the details in an attempt to damage the chancellor . " the information must have been leaked by a well-known old-boys network of conservatives surrounding the german president , " stiegler , who has described köhler as the " politically most one-sided president " he has known . " we have to make this public and advise the president to be more watchful about the type of people on his staff , " stiegler added . party revolt or presidential intrigue ? some social democrats are now even suggesting the german president would seek the resignation of the chancellor rather than accept schröder 's plan to deliberately lose a confidence vote in parliament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering the latest accusations have come only one day after rumors that senior spd leaders would be planning to replace schröder with spd party leader franz müntefering and continue ruling until regular elections in 2006 .
on tuesday , schröder publicly dismissed these rumors as utter nonsense and apparently spawned by the opposition conservatives . on wednesday , markus söder , general secretary of the ultra-conservative csu party said that much of what was currently happening clearly reflected a government in dissolution . " all these rumours and allegations are a clear indication of how deeply split the ruling social democrats are , " söder said . " they are showing that the government is totally preoccupied with itself and unable to solve the problems .
what we need now is a clear statement by the chancellor about how he wants to bring about early elections . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler -lrb- left -rrb- was angered by schröder 's failure to inform him of his early election plans ahead of going to the press .
the german chancellor , however , continues to remain silent .
there is speculation that cabinet ministers could abstain in the vote of confidence and so undo schröder 's three-seat majority in parliament .
but questions are arising whether this plan is in line with germany 's constitution . president horst köhler plays a key role in the unfolding events because he must decide whether to dissolve parliament after such a vote of confidence .
theoretically , he could reject it , throwing the timetable for september 's election into doubt and maybe still forcing the chancellor to resign in the end . uwe hessler -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder quiet on confidence vote german chancellor gerhard schröder continues to keep silent about the logistics of a confidence vote needed for proposed early elections much to the chagrin of members of his own center-left coalition .

most also attract little notice much less controversy .
but one zoo in southern germany is causing an uproar with a new event , an " african village . " an " african village " in a german zoo sounds a bit strange .
still , a zoo in augsburg in bavaria has created a special exhibit complete with a steppe setting to attract visitors .
but since their intention became public , it has attracted protests .
the group initiative for black people in germany has also called to complain and wants the exhibit stopped .
spokeswoman eleonore wiedenroth-coulibaly said she is bothered not just bay the exhibit but also its name , which is promoting generalizations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the show makes caricatures of africans , critics say " first of all , there is no one ' african ' village , " she said .
" secondly , not all african landscapes are steppe .
this is a reduction of africans in the old colonial tradition - africans as living close to nature with the animals .
it is this colonial viewpoint that bothers us . " worst possible setting the spokeswoman and other critics also from outside germany are also reminded of other exhibits in zoos like ones in the 19th century that were meant to promote a greater understanding of foreign cultures , particularly in newly colonized lands .
these exhibits served , above all , to promote a view for visitors of europeans as having the more civilized culture .
for this reason , critics say , the zoo is the worst possible place to hold such an exhibit . " the zoo also evolved out of colonial tradition , " wiedenroth-coulibaly said .
" and those former exhibits also came out about the same time , ones where people were displayed in a zoo , in nature , with animals , non-european .
and they as such are defamatory .

the augsburg zoo would be the right place to impart an exotic atmosphere , she wrote .
she referred to the show 's organizer , egyptian-born munich-based event manager medhat abdelati .
he said that he in no uncertain terms wanted the show to tie in with colonial and racist traditions , because he , himself , has african heritage . " i do n't find anything objectionable , " he said .
" and if i would stop it now , i would just give their opinions more strength .
i have invited them to visit and see the show before they judge it . " bad choice in the meantime , he understands that the choice of the title was not great and could lead to misunderstandings . " we are treating it as a cultural festival , " he said .
" with art , jewelry , masks , that people can buy .
there is even a program for children . " regardless , critics still believe that a zoo is not an appropriate place to hold a cultural festival and are holding protests against the exhibition .
zoo officials say they wo n't cancel the show : they have offered to hold a workshop to discuss the issues during the festival . thomas mösch -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : köhler calls for more aid for africa ahead of his first trip to africa as german president , horst köhler has called on the international community , including germany , to considerably increase financial help for the struggling continent .

the use of modern media in the renovated home of marx is expected to bring his remarkable life to a new audience . but how relevant is marx in the 21st century ?

almost a third of the 35,000 visitors which visit the karl marx house every year are asian guests , with the majority coming from china .
for most of them it is almost a pilgrimage , according to elisabeth neu , the museum 's head guide . " they come with such reverence , " neu said .

the current account surplus , a measure of the difference between what japan earns and pays , rose 5.2 % year-on-year to 1.63 trillion yen -lrb- $ 15bn ; £ 8.3bn -rrb- .
the figure contrasts with huge deficits for the us funded largely by investment from japan and other asian states .
but japan 's trade balance was weak , amid ongoing concern about the economy .
the growth in the current account surplus was mostly the result of a surge in income from japanese investments overseas , the finance ministry 's figures showed .
much of the 18.3 % growth from april 2004 in investment income came from us and european bonds .
japan is one of the world 's biggest buyers of us government debt .
trade turnaround on the other hand , while exports grew 7 % , imports were up 12 % .
japan has traditionally shown strength in export industries such as cars and electronics which has helped it counteract weakness in domestic demand .
although the consumer at home is spending more and corporate investment has also grown , economists said the export picture remained gloomy .
" i do n't expect a clear recovery in export growth until the second half of this fiscal year -lrb- which ends in march -rrb- , " said naoki iizuka , chief economist at dai-ichi research institute .
the japanese fiscal year finishes in march .
high prices for raw materials such as oil also contributed to the trade problems .

the combined firm , called resolution , will have about six million policies and £ 35bn of life company assets .
both companies have been buying up closed life insurance funds .
the new company will remain on the london stock market and could soon be a candidate for entry into the top-flight ftse 100 index .

he will be chairman of the enlarged resolution , while the chief executive of britannic , paul thompson , will be chief executive .
heavy share losses have prompted many long-term insurance funds to close to new business and these closed funds have been attracting investor interest recently .
in february , pub entrepreneur hugh osmond bought hhg 's closed life funds for £ 1bn , beating resolution to the deal .
mr thompson said : " this is a compelling fit of two complementary companies ... it positions the enlarged business as the leading consolidator of closed life funds , a sector we expect to show considerable growth . "
resolution and britannic estimate that the merger , which is roughly a merger of equals , will boost annual pre-tax operating profits by £ 30m a year , partly due to cost savings of £ 20m .
however , there will be a one-off integration cost of £ 28m .

heavy share losses have prompted many long-term insurance funds to close to new business and these closed funds have been attracting investor interest recently .
in february , pub entrepreneur hugh osmond bought hhg 's closed life funds for £ 1bn , beating resolution to the deal .
mr thompson said : " this is a compelling fit of two complementary companies ... it positions the enlarged business as the leading consolidator of closed life funds , a sector we expect to show considerable growth . "
resolution and britannic estimate that the merger , which is roughly a merger of equals , will boost annual pre-tax operating profits by £ 30m a year , partly due to cost savings of £ 20m .
however , there will be a one-off integration cost of £ 28m .

they joined the board on tuesday , just weeks after malcolm glazer bought the club for £ 790m in may .
fans are anxious about what they intend to do with the club and a closer look at the vast and varied family business may provide some clues as to what is in store .
the glazers ' interests range from fish oil to sports to property .
the first allied property empire - a huge shopping centre and apartment business - is said to be worth about $ 500m .
with sporting interests , the glazer businesses could be worth several billion dollars .
keeping it close all glazer 's six children - sons , ed and kevin , and daughter darcie also work for dad - have property and sports management experience .
malcolm glazer cuts down on scrutiny by keeping it in the family the family are said to adopt a low-key approach to business , preferring not to talk up what they do .
they just get on with it and it 's a style that works for them , so why change it , bryan glazer told a florida newspaper .
working together means there is not a lot of loose talk outside the family , which often acts through consultants .
of course , keeping it in the family may also reduce transparency , making analysis of the businesses difficult .

zapata was originally started in 1954 by former us president george h w bush as an oil-and-gas firm .
he sold out in the mid-60s and malcolm glazer started buying up shares in the company in the early 1990s .
he ditched the oil and gas interests after he and avram came on to the company 's board in 1994 .
they then got into all sorts of businesses , including sausages , most of which lost money .
the glazer family have been taught to think positive - always in 1995 , avram became chief executive officer of zapata corporation .
in 2004 , business week reported that zapata and its omega protein corporation , which sells fish oil , were being investigated by the securities and exchange commission over unexplained spikes in their share prices .
the spikes took place at similar times to glazer family purchases of manchester united shares .
there is no suggestion the family sold zapata shares to fund man utd purchases but there has been some unproven suspicion the zapata shares could have been used as collateral -lrb- security -rrb- against loans to fund share purchases .
avram has dismissed suggestions that the companies were involved in market manipulation - perhaps through a third party - as absurd .
baby zap joel -lrb- left -rrb- and bryan glazer -lrb- centre -rrb- talk strategy with dad malcolm the family 's operations at zapata signalled a similar audacity to that which characterised the manchester united bid .
zapata gave birth during the dotcom bubble to zap.com , which made a bid for excite.com , a company more than six times its size .
excite described the bid as a publicity stunt and zap - 98 % owned by zapata - then went the way of most internet bubble companies , and closed with losses .
mr glazer has since stepped down from zapata but will get a monthly payout from the company till april 2006 , adding up to a total of $ 6m , according to business week .
success secrets the work at zapata and the bid for manchester united make clear the family 's ' hard-nosed approach to acquisitions and their indifference to public opinion .
bob leffler , a longtime associate of mr glazer , said : " they 're not going to not do something because somebody 's upset about it . "
nor are they going to part with too much of their own money , preferring to use debt - as they have with manchester united - to fund purchases wherever possible .
perhaps the most critical factor in the family 's ability to take over companies to date is determination .
this seems to be fuelled by a positive attitude to life .

proposals to reorganise education in the city , which could affect dylan thomas community school , are discussed by the council cabinet on thursday .
falling pupil numbers have been blamed but parents believe it has been chosen because it serves a more deprived area .
the council said its decision would be made on educational grounds only .
the school in cockett has around 1,500 in its catchment area but only attracts around 550 pupils .
many of them are from the townhill housing estate , one of wales ' most deprived areas , and around half of them have special educational needs .
if the school was to close , pupils would have to travel to bishop gore comprehensive in the more affluent sketty area and next to singleton park , which will not be shut down although it too has falling pupil numbers . "

the west becomes more affluent at the expense of the east .
and it 's just reinforcing it time and time again .
" it 's one of the things the council said it has got to address , well it 's not addressing that issue by proposing to close the school . "
a recent report by the welsh schools inspection body , estyn , said dylan thomas secondary was improving rapidly and progress was evident despite significant challenges .
' empty desks ' parent governor robin lowe is leading the action campaign against the closure and claimed it was about the relative value of the two locations .
he said : " it 's about money , what we can get for the site .
the site at bishop gore is virtually worthless .
it 's part of the singleton estate .
there are covenants on the land .

education cabinet member mike day said the local authority 's decision would only be based on educational grounds .
he said : " money is going into servicing surplus spaces .
we want to see money being directed towards pupils ' needs rather than servicing empty desks . "
meanwhile , in powys , councillors are to discuss a report which said 40 schools were only three-quarters full .
education managers want to cut that to 15 schools with no more than 15 % spare capacity by the year 2008 .

proposals to reorganise education in the city , which could affect dylan thomas community school , are discussed by the council cabinet on thursday .
falling pupil numbers have been blamed but parents believe it has been chosen because it serves a more deprived area .
the council said its decision would be made on educational grounds only .
the school in cockett has around 1,500 in its catchment area but only attracts around 550 pupils .
many of them are from the townhill housing estate , one of wales ' most deprived areas , and around half of them have special educational needs .
if the school was to close , pupils would have to travel to bishop gore comprehensive in the more affluent sketty area and next to singleton park , which will not be shut down although it too has falling pupil numbers .
they see it as a soft target because of the position of the school and the community it serves and the background of the kids governors ' chairman dereck roberts the chairman of governors at dylan thomas , dereck roberts , has accused the local authority of social bias .
he said : " they see it as a soft target because of the position of the school and the community it serves and the background of the kids .
" it 's a classic example of what 's happened in swansea over the years .
the west becomes more affluent at the expense of the east .
and it 's just reinforcing it time and time again .
" it 's one of the things the council said it has got to address , well it 's not addressing that issue by proposing to close the school . "
a recent report by the welsh schools inspection body , estyn , said dylan thomas secondary was improving rapidly and progress was evident despite significant challenges .
' empty desks ' parent governor robin lowe is leading the action campaign against the closure and claimed it was about the relative value of the two locations .
he said : " it 's about money , what we can get for the site .
the site at bishop gore is virtually worthless .
it 's part of the singleton estate .
there are covenants on the land .
" on the dylan thomas site , the council have bought up any restrictve convants .
this development has been on the cards for some time . "
education cabinet member mike day said the local authority 's decision would only be based on educational grounds .
he said : " money is going into servicing surplus spaces .
we want to see money being directed towards pupils ' needs rather than servicing empty desks . "
meanwhile , in powys , councillors are to discuss a report which said 40 schools were only three-quarters full .
education managers want to cut that to 15 schools with no more than 15 % spare capacity by the year 2008 .

deputy jerry dorey , a member of the housing committee , said at least 900 of the island 's 4,500 states tenanted homes were in disrepair and did not meet the uk 's decent homes standard .

thermal comfort means a house must have both effective insulation and efficient heating .

the much-hyped probe was " doomed from the start " , the public accounts committee said while criticising the management of civil space activities .
the projects , in partnerships with the government , were " expensive , uncertain , and over-ambitious " , it said .
the uk government spent £ 188m on civil space activities in 2003/04 .
the beagle 2 mission cost an estimated £ 50m . "
it is public money and we are spending a lot of money on this -lrb- space activities -rrb- " edward leigh , committee chairman at time of report the much-trumpeted beagle 2 probe was supposed to have landed on mars to look for signs of life on the red planet , but nothing was heard from the probe after it was ejected from its mothership , the mars express orbiter .
the failure of the mission was a huge blow to britain 's space community and the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- .
in a report on thursday , the committee said poor risk management left the project with " no real prospect of success " .
" the project suffered from an over-ambitious time schedule , punishing weight constraints , poor management and uncertain funding , " it said .
' allowance for risk ' speaking on bbc radio five live breakfast , edward leigh , who chaired the committee when it carried out the inquiry , said : " you probably think we 're just boring bean counters but it is public money and we are spending a lot of money on this and frankly the beagle 2 project failed because , as we said , there was an over-ambitious time-table , there were last-minute technical changes , there was uncertain funding , -lsb- and -rsb- there was poor risk management .
" of course it 's an ambitious project , of course it 's a good project but it 's got to be run properly on behalf of the taxpayer . "
" the research involved was to answer a question that has puzzled people for thousands of years " beagle 2 project creator prof colin pillinger the government 's space activities are carried out by a partnership of 10 government departments , agencies and research councils .
" the british national space centre and the department -lsb- of trade and industry -rsb- should only proceed with such ambitious projects if sufficient resources can be committed from the outset to give a reasonable prospect of success , making due allowance for risk , the committee said .
but open university planetary scientist professor colin pillinger , who first proposed the beagle 2 project , told bbc news it was " not a waste of money " .
earlier he defended the right to take risks .
" you do not inspire anybody if it is a forgone conclusion and we are in the business of doing research , he told five live : " the research involved was to answer a question that has puzzled people for thousands of years . "
in its report on the activities , the public accounts committee acknowledged space projects were expensive and uncertain , saying some , such as beagle 2 , had failed and others had been delayed .
but it said the partnership had to improve its risk management , and the agencies involved should put in sufficient funding at the outset of a project to identify and mitigate technical and construction risks .
they should also address the risks posed by collaborating with other bodies such as esa and the us space agency -lrb- nasa -rrb- , and they should deal with risks explicitly in appraising project funding .
the committee also called on the partnership to look again at the costs of the galileo project - the european satellite-navigation system .
the partnership has estimated the uk would benefit by £ 6bn from the project , with an outlay of £ 78m .
but the committee backed the findings of a previous report which queried the cost and benefits analysis .
it also questioned the procurement system used by esa .
the cost of space programmes are increased by the system which means contracts are not always awarded to the most cost-effective bidder , the committee said .

the much-hyped probe was " doomed from the start " , the public accounts committee said while criticising the management of civil space activities .
the projects , in partnerships with the government , were " expensive , uncertain , and over-ambitious " , it said .
the uk government spent £ 188m on civil space activities in 2003/04 .
the beagle 2 mission cost an estimated £ 50m .
it is public money and we are spending a lot of money on this -lrb- space activities -rrb- edward leigh , committee chairman at time of report the much-trumpeted beagle 2 probe was supposed to have landed on mars to look for signs of life on the red planet , but nothing was heard from the probe after it was ejected from its mothership , the mars express orbiter .
the failure of the mission was a huge blow to britain 's space community and the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- .
in a report on thursday , the committee said poor risk management left the project with " no real prospect of success " .
" the project suffered from an over-ambitious time schedule , punishing weight constraints , poor management and uncertain funding , " it said .
' allowance for risk ' speaking on bbc radio five live breakfast , edward leigh , who chaired the committee when it carried out the inquiry , said : " you probably think we 're just boring bean counters but it is public money and we are spending a lot of money on this and frankly the beagle 2 project failed because , as we said , there was an over-ambitious time-table , there were last-minute technical changes , there was uncertain funding , -lsb- and -rsb- there was poor risk management .
" of course it 's an ambitious project , of course it 's a good project but it 's got to be run properly on behalf of the taxpayer . "
the research involved was to answer a question that has puzzled people for thousands of years beagle 2 project creator prof colin pillinger the government 's space activities are carried out by a partnership of 10 government departments , agencies and research councils .
" the british national space centre and the department -lsb- of trade and industry -rsb- should only proceed with such ambitious projects if sufficient resources can be committed from the outset to give a reasonable prospect of success , making due allowance for risk , the committee said .
but open university planetary scientist professor colin pillinger , who first proposed the beagle 2 project , told bbc news it was " not a waste of money " .
earlier he defended the right to take risks .
" you do not inspire anybody if it is a forgone conclusion and we are in the business of doing research , he told five live : " the research involved was to answer a question that has puzzled people for thousands of years . "
