berlin hails ukrainian decision ; russia slams west yushchenko poisoned , doctors say court orders new ukrainian election europe -pipe- 13.01.2005 appeal delays inauguration in ukraine großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yushchenko still has to wait to accept toasts to his presidency with the tables turned in the ukraine presidential race and opposition candidate yuschenko waiting to take the oath of office , defeated candidate yanukovych is pulling out the delaying tactics . hopes that the long-awaited inauguration of viktor yushchenko would be staged this week have again been dashed .
his opponent , viktor yanukovych , has once again used the courts to put off the transfer of power . stall tactics the inauguration can only take place after the election result is published in one of the two official newspapers , and the ukraine supreme court has barred both papers from printing it until former prime minister viktor yanukovych has a last chance to appeal the outcome in a court of law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yushchenko declaring victory , with ukrainian pop star .
but how soon yanukovych 's latest appeal will finally be filed and decided on is uncertain . yushchenko was finally declared the winner of the ukraine presidential election on jan .
10 , two weeks after the re-run of an earlier election that was declared invalid because of voter fraud .
but yanukovych - who agreed to a new election only after his hand was forced by a massive popular uprising – has managed to hold up the poll result at every turn . currently , yanukovych is appealing the election , claiming it was invalid . ' we will never be satisfied ' “ if the court fails to comply with our demands , we have the right to act within the framework of our legislation , " yanukovych said .
" we ’ ll appeal to the european court of justice .
we will never be satisfied with the result of the so-called third round of the election . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yanukovych leaving voting booth during the repeat election in december all the former prime minister 's previous appeals have been quickly dismissed by the court .
but it can not rule on a complaint until he officially submits it .
and yanukovych ’ s representative in the election commission , nestor shufritch , said he thinks ukraine ’ s weary voters may be called upon yet again to go to the polls . “ if the supreme court does makes a legal rather than a political decision i am personally convinced that , unfortunately , a new election process will be necessary , ” sufritch said . swiss lawyers it is not quite clear what is driving yanukovych in his refusal to cede the election .
but the yanukovych camp does n't seeem to be running out of energy – or money .
they are paying swiss lawyers for advice . the lawyers had promised to hand over to the supreme court on wednesday some 800 files allegedly containing proof of vote rigging in the latest poll , but the process has been delayed . yanukovych now has until friday to submit the evidence .
if the court accepts the complaint , it can take up to 10 days to examine it , which would delay yushchenko ’ s inauguration still further . olive branch from russia but andrei shkill , parliamentary deputy from president-elect yushchenko ’ s party , said he is optimistic that his candidate will someday take office . “ the european court of justice , the swiss lawyers , they are just obvious attempts to make yanukovych and his crew important , " he said .
" to show there are people who refuse to accept the election result and intend to challenge it . " moscow – which strongly supported yanukovych 's candidacy - meanwhile has broken its frosty silence over yuschenko 's victory .
the russians finally held out an olive branch when russian defense minister sergei ivanov told reporters on a visit to washington that his country was ready to cooperate with the newly elected leadership of ukraine . ivanov , whose comments indicate russia wants to retain its influence over the ex-soviet state , noted yushchenko had announced his first foreign visit would be to moscow . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de yushchenko reaches out to russia the winner of ukraine 's bitterly-fought presidential poll , yushchenko , moved tuesday to repair damage to relations with russia while his opponent , yanukovych , persisted in blaming the west for his defeat . -lrb- dec .

now , it is up to the bloc 's 25 member states to ratify the historic treaty . there was a standing ovation in the european parliament in strasbourg as the results of wednesday 's poll were announced : 500 votes in favor to 137 against , with 40 abstentions - a massive show of support for a resolution backing the constitutional treaty . " the result of the vote leaves no room for doubt about the support that this european parliament has expressed for the constitution , " parliament president josep borrell said . while all the mainstream parties in the parliament supported the text , a few dozen right-wing and nationalist lawmakers jeered and waved banners proclaiming " not in my name . " " in the name of the 25 heads of state of the european union who signed the constitution in october , i would like to express my great joy , " retorted luxembourg 's prime minister and current eu president , jean-claude juncker , following the vote . attacks from left and right the new constitution will boost the assembly 's powers , create a long-term president of the european council of eu leaders and an eu foreign minister , as well as streamline decision-making .
but the far left reject it as a global capitalist charter without adequate social protection , while the far right and nationalists have attacked it as a blueprint for a european " superstate " that would give too much power to brussels - views that are far from reality , according to german eu parliamentarian , elmar brock . “ it brings european countries together in order to make them strong enough to survive as democracies in this global environment , " brock said .
" it gives europe not only this efficiency , but also the transparency so that people can check the policy – and also the competence order , which makes sure that the european union can not grow as it wants , but that the competence is given by the member states .
and therefore it ’ s just the opposite of a superstate . ” the constitution still faces a long and bumpy ride .
two countries , lithuania and hungary , have ratified the charter by parliamentary vote so far .
but its fate will be sealed in referendums in countries including france , the netherlands , denmark , the czech republic , poland and above all britain , where approval is far from certain .
a rejection in just one of the countries would be a major blow as it would send the constitution back to the drawing board and start an entire new round of negotiations . juncker has urged national parliaments and eu citizens to support the ratification process , which could take as long as two years . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : the constitution is n't perfect but must do although the eu constitution has plenty of flaws and it still has to be ratified by member states , it reflects a compromise and marks the dawning of a new era , says dw 's bernd riegert .

" there is a list of up to 100 persons in different parliaments , on several levels , on state level , on regional level , being paid by carmaker volkswagen , " resch said .
" for example the mayor of wolfsburg , the city where volkswagen is situated , gets a salary by this company . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw manufacturing factory in wolfsburg volkswagen has also had its hand in watering down recent legislation for higher environmental standards proposed by the green party , which would have required fine particle dust filters in diesel motors . all it took , resch said , was a letter from volkswagen head bernd pischetsrieder to members of parliament . " in this letter pischetsrieder complained that tax incentives for particle filters would harm his company and the car industry in germany and would be bad for the economy , " resch said .
" with this letter he -lrb- pischetsrieder -rrb- was able to stop the entire parliamentary process . " a lobbyist in disguise ? deutsche umwelthilfe 's allegations against german companies come at a time of intense debate in the country about whether politicians should be allowed to hold down a normal job while carrying out their duties as an elected member of parliament or whether that would inevitably lead to a conflict of interests and turn parliamentarians into mere lobbyist for industry . under german law , parliamentarians are indeed allowed to work " on the side " as long as they do not earn more than € 3,000 a month or € 18,000 a year on top of their salaries as a member of parliament . but the system 's critics claim that such a practice could easily give rise to a conflict of interest . " the parliamentarian must not be a lobbyist in disguise , " jochen bäumel of transparency international told news agency afp .
" only by publishing their additional income can the electorate know whose interests they really represent . " companies under pressure spearheaded by mass-selling daily bild , the campaign to publish fat-cat corporate salaries has put pressure on german companies to reveal details of their links with politicians . volkswagen has already announced that it plans to release a list of employees on its books who also hold a political office .
vw ceo pischetsrieder is expected to announce the details on thursday .
bild reported this week that vw had six social democratic parliamentarians on its payrolls over the last six years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : laurenz meyer the issue has already caused heads to roll in the conservative opposition christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
secretary general of the party , laurenz meyer stepped down last month after it emerged that he had received substantial payouts from energy giant rwe , his former employer , while holding political office . harmful for economy too however , deutsche umwelthilfe claims that the dilution of climate-friendly laws through the nexus of politicians and car industry officials is not only harmful to the german environment , but may hurt the economy in the long run as well . countries like china and japan have lowered the ceilings for acceptable fuel consumption in automobiles , and even the us has stricter emissions standards than germany .
many german luxury cars do not meet the new guidelines .
jürgen resch warns that “ made in germany ” may lose its selling power abroad . “ earlier german cars stood for high quality , for security , and for a while , even for high environmental standards , " resch said .
" but , we 're now noticing that even in the united states , more and more cars are not being able to sell , because the emissions are too high .
we see a big danger if the very high priced cars in germany can ’ t be sold in the whole asian market anymore because of environmental regulations . " tighter regulations needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opel astra diesel hybrid concept vehicle is shown during media previews at the north american international auto show in detroit , jan .
9 , 2005 .
instead of hyping faster motors and new state-of-art fuel pumps , deutsche umwelthilfe says that the german automobile industry need more incentive to focus on the development of alternatives to traditional engines , like environmentally-friendly hybrid models and more energy-efficient diesel motors . it has proposed tighter regulations similar to those being implemented in japan and china within the next few years .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 13.01.2005 a silver jubilee for germany 's greens großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : looking ahead to a bright future : claudia roth , the green 's co-chair the german government 's junior coalition partner has come a long way since its birth 25 years ago : the formerly pacifist green party now supports military missions , but the environment still tops its agenda . " a danger for democracy " - that 's what a leading german social democrat called so-called " green lists " - a conglomeration of environmentalist , peace and anti-nuclear groups - back in 1977 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the greens first leadership at the founding convention on jan .
13 , 1980 just three years later , on jan .
13 , 1980 , some of these " dangerous organizations " joined forces after a long debate about the necessity of founding a new party : " die grünen " or " the greens " were born .
few believed that the party would survive .
debates over the inclusion of left-wing radicals foreshadowed the later power struggles between ecological radicals , the so-called " fundis , " and pragmatic " realos . "
politically , the greens questioned the status quo from the start : calls for an immediate end to the use of nuclear power , the dissolution of nato and an ecologically oriented economy scared away potential voters .
environment first but the greens deserve the biggest credit for putting the protection of the environment at the center of their agenda , according to karl-rudolf korte , a political scientist at the university of duisburg / essen .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the phasing out of nuclear power has been a priority for the greens " this led established parties to take up these topics , " he said , adding that state and federal governments responded by setting up ministries for the environment .
the success became a danger for the greens , however , as others adopted their agenda and made it their own , korte said .
additionally , the party limited itself by imposing a strict political culture .
for many years , elected members of parliament had to give up their seats mid-term to make room for others .
until recently the greens also did not allow party functionaries to hold public office at the same time .
joschka 's sneakers still , german society quickly warmed to the party 's ecologically-oriented politics at the beginning of the 1980s while the big parties still did n't have the subject on their agenda .
because of this , the greens were able to get enough votes to enter local and state parliaments throughout germany , culminating in the first " red-green " coalition government with the social democrats in the central state of hesse in 1985 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer -lrb- right -rrb- taking the oath of office as hesse 's environmental minister on dec .
12 , 1985 that government 's environmental minister - the first in germany - later became the country 's foreign minister .
at the time , though , joschka fischer caused an uproar when he took his oath of office wearing jeans and sneakers .
while successful with voters , the greens began falling apart from the inside as " fundis " and " realos " kept fighting about the future of the party .
the low point was reached with german unification in 1990 : campaigning with the slogan " everyone talks about germany .
we talk about climate , " the greens failed to win over voters and were kicked out of parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the united party 's logo only members of the greens ' eastern german sister party , " bündnis 90 , " or alliance 90 , managed to garner seats .
the two parties finally merged in 1993 and the greens are now officially called " bündnis 90 / die grünen . "
reaching for power a year later , the party , now led by " realos " around joschka fischer , re-entered parliament and reached its high point in 1998 , when the greens became the junior partner in germany 's governing coalition with the social democrats for the first time .
by then , the party had gone through a tremendous process of transformation , reflected in its approval of the participation of german soldiers in the nato-led kosovo mission in 1999 .
fischer can take the credit for the turn-around in the party , according to korte .
" this was probably the biggest challenge for a party that was founded on a pacifist platform , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer -lrb- left -rrb- and german chancellor gerhard schröder together with the social democrats , the greens made a number of difficult decisions in the following years .
they opted for reforms to germany 's tax and social welfare systems and approved other military missions to macedonia and afghanistan .
while social democrats have lost voters in elections since 2002 , the greens managed to hold onto their seats or increase them almost everywhere .
and for years , fischer has led the list of germany 's most popular politicians .
black future ?
but the party 's base remains a distinctly western german one - a fact that does n't surprise danial cohn-bendit -lrb- photo below -rrb- , a prominent green member of the european parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel cohn-bendit " it will take some time for people in eastern germany to realize that economic growth comes with an increased social-ecological responsibility , " he told die welt newspaper .
" it 's a cultural development .
we 're a modern party which requires a modern civil society and the latter 's still emerging in -lrb- eastern germany -rrb- . "
and while the social democrats still seem to be the greens ' natural coalition partner , that could change in the future , according to korte .
on the municipal level , coalitions with the conservative christian democrats already exist - cologne is the most prominent example .
the southwestern state of baden-württemberg is the most likely candidate for a " black-green " coalition , korte said .
maybe it 'll take a bit longer than the next election , however , as it 's taking place near the time when fischer and german chancellor gerhard schröder will fight for re-election on the national level in 2006 . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the green view on german politics foreign minister joschka fischer has been busy campaigning for a permanent seat on the un security council .

" a danger for democracy " - that 's what a leading german social democrat called so-called " green lists " - a conglomeration of environmentalist , peace and anti-nuclear groups - back in 1977 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the greens first leadership at the founding convention on jan .
13 , 1980 just three years later , on jan .
13 , 1980 , some of these " dangerous organizations " joined forces after a long debate about the necessity of founding a new party : " die grünen " or " the greens " were born .
few believed that the party would survive .
debates over the inclusion of left-wing radicals foreshadowed the later power struggles between ecological radicals , the so-called " fundis , " and pragmatic " realos . "
politically , the greens questioned the status quo from the start : calls for an immediate end to the use of nuclear power , the dissolution of nato and an ecologically oriented economy scared away potential voters .
environment first but the greens deserve the biggest credit for putting the protection of the environment at the center of their agenda , according to karl-rudolf korte , a political scientist at the university of duisburg / essen .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the phasing out of nuclear power has been a priority for the greens " this led established parties to take up these topics , " he said , adding that state and federal governments responded by setting up ministries for the environment .
the success became a danger for the greens , however , as others adopted their agenda and made it their own , korte said .
additionally , the party limited itself by imposing a strict political culture .
for many years , elected members of parliament had to give up their seats mid-term to make room for others .
until recently the greens also did not allow party functionaries to hold public office at the same time .
joschka 's sneakers still , german society quickly warmed to the party 's ecologically-oriented politics at the beginning of the 1980s while the big parties still did n't have the subject on their agenda .
because of this , the greens were able to get enough votes to enter local and state parliaments throughout germany , culminating in the first " red-green " coalition government with the social democrats in the central state of hesse in 1985 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer -lrb- right -rrb- taking the oath of office as hesse 's environmental minister on dec .
12 , 1985 that government 's environmental minister - the first in germany - later became the country 's foreign minister .
at the time , though , joschka fischer caused an uproar when he took his oath of office wearing jeans and sneakers .
while successful with voters , the greens began falling apart from the inside as " fundis " and " realos " kept fighting about the future of the party .
the low point was reached with german unification in 1990 : campaigning with the slogan " everyone talks about germany .
we talk about climate , " the greens failed to win over voters and were kicked out of parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the united party 's logo only members of the greens ' eastern german sister party , " bündnis 90 , " or alliance 90 , managed to garner seats .

" a danger for democracy " - that 's what a leading german social democrat called so-called " green lists " - a conglomeration of environmentalist , peace and anti-nuclear groups - back in 1977 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the greens first leadership at the founding convention on jan .
13 , 1980 just three years later , on jan .
13 , 1980 , some of these " dangerous organizations " joined forces after a long debate about the necessity of founding a new party : " die grünen " or " the greens " were born .
few believed that the party would survive .
debates over the inclusion of left-wing radicals foreshadowed the later power struggles between ecological radicals , the so-called " fundis , " and pragmatic " realos . "
politically , the greens questioned the status quo from the start : calls for an immediate end to the use of nuclear power , the dissolution of nato and an ecologically oriented economy scared away potential voters .
environment first but the greens deserve the biggest credit for putting the protection of the environment at the center of their agenda , according to karl-rudolf korte , a political scientist at the university of duisburg / essen .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the phasing out of nuclear power has been a priority for the greens " this led established parties to take up these topics , " he said , adding that state and federal governments responded by setting up ministries for the environment .
the success became a danger for the greens , however , as others adopted their agenda and made it their own , korte said .
additionally , the party limited itself by imposing a strict political culture .
for many years , elected members of parliament had to give up their seats mid-term to make room for others .
until recently the greens also did not allow party functionaries to hold public office at the same time .
joschka 's sneakers still , german society quickly warmed to the party 's ecologically-oriented politics at the beginning of the 1980s while the big parties still did n't have the subject on their agenda .
because of this , the greens were able to get enough votes to enter local and state parliaments throughout germany , culminating in the first " red-green " coalition government with the social democrats in the central state of hesse in 1985 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer -lrb- right -rrb- taking the oath of office as hesse 's environmental minister on dec .
12 , 1985 that government 's environmental minister - the first in germany - later became the country 's foreign minister .
at the time , though , joschka fischer caused an uproar when he took his oath of office wearing jeans and sneakers .
while successful with voters , the greens began falling apart from the inside as " fundis " and " realos " kept fighting about the future of the party .
the low point was reached with german unification in 1990 : campaigning with the slogan " everyone talks about germany .
we talk about climate , " the greens failed to win over voters and were kicked out of parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the united party 's logo only members of the greens ' eastern german sister party , " bündnis 90 , " or alliance 90 , managed to garner seats .
the two parties finally merged in 1993 and the greens are now officially called " bündnis 90 / die grünen . "
reaching for power a year later , the party , now led by " realos " around joschka fischer , re-entered parliament and reached its high point in 1998 , when the greens became the junior partner in germany 's governing coalition with the social democrats for the first time .
by then , the party had gone through a tremendous process of transformation , reflected in its approval of the participation of german soldiers in the nato-led kosovo mission in 1999 .
fischer can take the credit for the turn-around in the party , according to korte .
" this was probably the biggest challenge for a party that was founded on a pacifist platform , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer -lrb- left -rrb- and german chancellor gerhard schröder together with the social democrats , the greens made a number of difficult decisions in the following years .
they opted for reforms to germany 's tax and social welfare systems and approved other military missions to macedonia and afghanistan .
while social democrats have lost voters in elections since 2002 , the greens managed to hold onto their seats or increase them almost everywhere .
and for years , fischer has led the list of germany 's most popular politicians .
black future ?
but the party 's base remains a distinctly western german one - a fact that does n't surprise danial cohn-bendit -lrb- photo below -rrb- , a prominent green member of the european parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel cohn-bendit " it will take some time for people in eastern germany to realize that economic growth comes with an increased social-ecological responsibility , " he told die welt newspaper .
" it 's a cultural development .
we 're a modern party which requires a modern civil society and the latter 's still emerging in -lrb- eastern germany -rrb- . "
and while the social democrats still seem to be the greens ' natural coalition partner , that could change in the future , according to korte .
on the municipal level , coalitions with the conservative christian democrats already exist - cologne is the most prominent example .
the southwestern state of baden-württemberg is the most likely candidate for a " black-green " coalition , korte said .
maybe it 'll take a bit longer than the next election , however , as it 's taking place near the time when fischer and german chancellor gerhard schröder will fight for re-election on the national level in 2006 . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the green view on german politics foreign minister joschka fischer has been busy campaigning for a permanent seat on the un security council .

german politicians seeking to outlaw secret paternity tests won a first battle on wednesday , much to the disappointment of fathers ' rights groups hoping for greater justice in the areas of alimony and child support . the german federal court of justice decided on wednesday that paternity tests carried out in secret are inadmissible as evidence in a lawsuit .
unless the mother gave her consent for the test , the child 's personal rights would be violated , the court in karlsruhe ruled .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lab technician at the " id-labor " in wiesbaden conducts a paternity test .
the decision was welcomed by german justice minister brigitte zypries , who is leading a campaign to make secret paternity tests illegal under a new law regulating the use of genetic data .
" these tests are a serious invasion of the private sphere , " zypries said .
" if a man has doubts about his paternity , he should talk about this with the mother . "
campaigners for fathers ' rights in germany say making secret paternity tests punishable would be yet another blow to men who already get the short end of the stick when it comes to laws regulating alimony , child support , and child custody following a divorce or separation .
" it can not be that , as a woman , i have the right to make my husband pay to support a child that is not his own , or to deny children the right to know who their real father is , " said dr. karin jäckel , an active supporter of the fathers ' rights movement and author of several books on the subject .
" men are , in every respect , held responsible for their children under our laws , which is why they have the right to know who their children are . "
modernizing alimony bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a father walks with his son in a düsseldorf park .
while the battle over paternity tests continues , justice minister zypries has also announced an overhaul of german laws on alimony .
divorced dads are hopeful that the changes will mean more justice for them .
the growing fathers ' rights movement in germany rejects the stereotype of the heartless man who abandons his family for a new relationship .
in reality , they say , the situation is very different .
women file for divorce more frequently than men , and are more often awarded custody of the children .
and in cases where a divorce is contested , fathers frequently become estranged from their children , making it harder for fathers to gain custody rights once the divorce is settled , jäckel said .
despite this emotional strain , fathers are still seen as the familial breadwinner , and can often find themselves burdened for life with child support and alimony payments to ex-wives .
" in cases where the man earns a lot and can pay for everyone , there 's no problem .
but we 're seeing more frequently that the man 's income is n't enough for everyone , " zypries said in an interview with the women 's magazine brigitte .
ideally , she said , both partners would take financial responsibility for themselves after a divorce .
" a man ca n't be expected to support his ex-wife for years , especially if she could go back to work , and as a consequence not have the money to support children from a second marriage , " she said .

he is a member of fathers for justice , who are campaigning for a change in family law in britain .
but jäckel said that those closely involved with the fathers ' rights movement are skeptical that their concerns will be heeded by politicians .
unlike in britain , where the activist group fathers 4 justice has successfully attracted attention to the plight of divorced dads through spectacular stunts , campaigns by similar german groups have " barely registered politically , " jäckel said , adding that ploys aimed at grabbing media attention can make a desperate father 's situation even worse .
" i 've often seen it happen here that fathers who go to the media to publicize their cases are punished by the judges , " she said .
" in the worst case , this can even result in their custody rights being taken away .
the judges ' logic is that dragging a case of unfair treatment into the public eye only damages the child 's rights , and that someone who would do this is a bad father .

" these tests are a serious invasion of the private sphere , " zypries said .
" if a man has doubts about his paternity , he should talk about this with the mother . "
campaigners for fathers ' rights in germany say making secret paternity tests punishable would be yet another blow to men who already get the short end of the stick when it comes to laws regulating alimony , child support , and child custody following a divorce or separation .
" it can not be that , as a woman , i have the right to make my husband pay to support a child that is not his own , or to deny children the right to know who their real father is , " said dr. karin jäckel , an active supporter of the fathers ' rights movement and author of several books on the subject .
" men are , in every respect , held responsible for their children under our laws , which is why they have the right to know who their children are . "
modernizing alimony bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a father walks with his son in a düsseldorf park .
while the battle over paternity tests continues , justice minister zypries has also announced an overhaul of german laws on alimony .
divorced dads are hopeful that the changes will mean more justice for them .
the growing fathers ' rights movement in germany rejects the stereotype of the heartless man who abandons his family for a new relationship .
in reality , they say , the situation is very different .
women file for divorce more frequently than men , and are more often awarded custody of the children .
and in cases where a divorce is contested , fathers frequently become estranged from their children , making it harder for fathers to gain custody rights once the divorce is settled , jäckel said .
despite this emotional strain , fathers are still seen as the familial breadwinner , and can often find themselves burdened for life with child support and alimony payments to ex-wives .
" in cases where the man earns a lot and can pay for everyone , there 's no problem .
but we 're seeing more frequently that the man 's income is n't enough for everyone , " zypries said in an interview with the women 's magazine brigitte .
ideally , she said , both partners would take financial responsibility for themselves after a divorce .
" a man ca n't be expected to support his ex-wife for years , especially if she could go back to work , and as a consequence not have the money to support children from a second marriage , " she said .

he is a member of fathers for justice , who are campaigning for a change in family law in britain .
but jäckel said that those closely involved with the fathers ' rights movement are skeptical that their concerns will be heeded by politicians .
unlike in britain , where the activist group fathers 4 justice has successfully attracted attention to the plight of divorced dads through spectacular stunts , campaigns by similar german groups have " barely registered politically , " jäckel said , adding that ploys aimed at grabbing media attention can make a desperate father 's situation even worse .
" i 've often seen it happen here that fathers who go to the media to publicize their cases are punished by the judges , " she said .
" in the worst case , this can even result in their custody rights being taken away .
the judges ' logic is that dragging a case of unfair treatment into the public eye only damages the child 's rights , and that someone who would do this is a bad father .

father 's rights groups in germany are fighting to retain their right to have secret paternity tests without a mother 's permission .
they say it is the only way to combat " paternity fraud . "

but his latest caper - dressing as a nazi at a costume party , tops them all . the photo splashed across the british tabloid the sun shows a lanky prince harry wearing the tan uniform of the nazi 's afrika korps , complete with red and black swastika armband , holding a drink in one hand and a cigarette in the other .
and it begs the question : " harry , what were you thinking ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's prince harry the youngest son of the late princess diana and heir-to-the-throne prince charles may be the " wild child " of the british royal family , but surely he knows better ?
and if he does n't , then why did n't one of his minders , or at least big brother william , who attended the " native and colonial " party in a much tamer lion costume , warn the wayward redhead ? harry 's timing could n't be worse .
in just two weeks ' time , his grandmother , queen elizabeth , is due to host a reception for survivors of the holocaust before representing the nation at the holocaust memorial day national event . jewish leaders outraged jewish leaders have already spoken out about the incident .
the simon wiesenthal center , one of the world 's leading jewish human rights organizations , called it " a shameful act … displaying insensitivity " to both holocaust victims and allied soldiers " who gave their lives to defeat nazism . " its founder , rabbi marvin hier , said harry ought to go to auschwitz with his uncle , prince edward , head of the british delegation for the 60th anniversary commemorations . " there he will see the results of the hated symbol he so foolishly and brazenly chose to wear , " hier said . a ' poor choice ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the british tabloid " the sun " splashed a photo from the party over its front page in a statement from clarence house , harry apologized for what he called " a poor choice of costume . "
but there have been calls by british politicians for the prince to appear in person to make his own public apology . " if he wants to be considered an adult , he 's got to behave like an adult , and he has got to apologize in person , through radio and television , " said former royal press spokesman dicky arbiter . others , including rabbi dr. jonathan romain of the reform synagogues of great britain , are prepared to put the incident down to the folly of youth and let the prince 's apology stand . the fact that the palace has issued an apology indicates that this was a mistake by the prince , " romain said .
" but having been given , the apology should now be accepted . " career consequences ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prince harry , youngest son of the prince of wales and grandson of britain 's queen elizabeth ii , took charge of a 48-strong parade of military cadets at eton school tuesday night may 26 2003 , fuelling speculation that he may opt for a military career .
harry , 18 , was appointed commander of eton 's combined cadet force 's formal trooping of the colour ceremony.the prince of wales was among those looking on as his youngest son led the guard of honour 's march out on to college field with their colours at the yearly tattoo , held since òthe corpsó was founded in 1860 .

german politicians seeking to outlaw secret paternity tests won a first battle on wednesday , much to the disappointment of fathers ' rights groups hoping for greater justice in the areas of alimony and child support . the german federal court of justice decided on wednesday that paternity tests carried out in secret are inadmissible as evidence in a lawsuit .
unless the mother gave her consent for the test , the child 's personal rights would be violated , the court in karlsruhe ruled .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lab technician at the " id-labor " in wiesbaden conducts a paternity test .
the decision was welcomed by german justice minister brigitte zypries , who is leading a campaign to make secret paternity tests illegal under a new law regulating the use of genetic data .
" these tests are a serious invasion of the private sphere , " zypries said .
" if a man has doubts about his paternity , he should talk about this with the mother . "
campaigners for fathers ' rights in germany say making secret paternity tests punishable would be yet another blow to men who already get the short end of the stick when it comes to laws regulating alimony , child support , and child custody following a divorce or separation .
" it can not be that , as a woman , i have the right to make my husband pay to support a child that is not his own , or to deny children the right to know who their real father is , " said dr. karin jäckel , an active supporter of the fathers ' rights movement and author of several books on the subject .
" men are , in every respect , held responsible for their children under our laws , which is why they have the right to know who their children are . "
modernizing alimony bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a father walks with his son in a düsseldorf park .
while the battle over paternity tests continues , justice minister zypries has also announced an overhaul of german laws on alimony .
divorced dads are hopeful that the changes will mean more justice for them .
the growing fathers ' rights movement in germany rejects the stereotype of the heartless man who abandons his family for a new relationship .
in reality , they say , the situation is very different .
women file for divorce more frequently than men , and are more often awarded custody of the children .
and in cases where a divorce is contested , fathers frequently become estranged from their children , making it harder for fathers to gain custody rights once the divorce is settled , jäckel said .
despite this emotional strain , fathers are still seen as the familial breadwinner , and can often find themselves burdened for life with child support and alimony payments to ex-wives .
" in cases where the man earns a lot and can pay for everyone , there 's no problem .
but we 're seeing more frequently that the man 's income is n't enough for everyone , " zypries said in an interview with the women 's magazine brigitte .
ideally , she said , both partners would take financial responsibility for themselves after a divorce .
" a man ca n't be expected to support his ex-wife for years , especially if she could go back to work , and as a consequence not have the money to support children from a second marriage , " she said .

but jäckel said that those closely involved with the fathers ' rights movement are skeptical that their concerns will be heeded by politicians .
unlike in britain , where the activist group fathers 4 justice has successfully attracted attention to the plight of divorced dads through spectacular stunts , campaigns by similar german groups have " barely registered politically , " jäckel said , adding that ploys aimed at grabbing media attention can make a desperate father 's situation even worse .
" i 've often seen it happen here that fathers who go to the media to publicize their cases are punished by the judges , " she said .
" in the worst case , this can even result in their custody rights being taken away .
the judges ' logic is that dragging a case of unfair treatment into the public eye only damages the child 's rights , and that someone who would do this is a bad father .

26 . indonesia , the nation worst-hit by the tidal wave disaster , has an external debt of $ 132 billion -lrb- € 100 billion -rrb- according to the world bank , of which more than $ 70 billion is owed to public creditors or has been guaranteed by public bodies and is eligible for the paris club offer .
indonesia would have to pay more than $ 3 billion in principal payments alone this year - about the same amount it needs to recover from the crisis . german foreign minister joschka fischer said the debt moratorium was " an important step forward " and " an element of aid that can not be underestimated . " doubts linger however , wirayuda admitted that his country still had lingering doubts about taking up the offer . " we do not want that it harms our economy , " he told reporters in berlin .
" we do n't want the market to go wrongly and we do n't want our creditworthiness to be negatively influenced . " in contrast to indonesia , countries such as india , thailand and malaysia have already decided not to accept the freeze on debt repayment for fear they would lose their credit rating on financial markets . indonesia 's fears were echoed by german finance minister hans eichel , who also held talks with wirayuda on thursday . " one must be very prudent as far as the paris club is concerned , " he said and underlined that any debt measures " could put financial credibility in peril .

" wirayuda plays down troop restrictions on thursday , wirayuda also played down earlier statements by the indonesian government that foreign troops involved in emergency aid operations in the devastated aceh province should not stay longer than three months . the foreign minister stressed that jakarta welcomed the military aid deployments , including germany 's , but added that their presence was a " delicate issue for the indonesian public . " wirayuda said that restrictions on the movement of aid workers in aceh were only for their own safety and denied the rules would hinder international relief operations .

german politicians seeking to outlaw secret paternity tests won a first battle on wednesday , much to the disappointment of fathers ' rights groups hoping for greater justice in the areas of alimony and child support . the german federal court of justice decided on wednesday that paternity tests carried out in secret are inadmissible as evidence in a lawsuit .
unless the mother gave her consent for the test , the child 's personal rights would be violated , the court in karlsruhe ruled .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lab technician at the " id-labor " in wiesbaden conducts a paternity test .
the decision was welcomed by german justice minister brigitte zypries , who is leading a campaign to make secret paternity tests illegal under a new law regulating the use of genetic data .
" these tests are a serious invasion of the private sphere , " zypries said .
" if a man has doubts about his paternity , he should talk about this with the mother . "
campaigners for fathers ' rights in germany say making secret paternity tests punishable would be yet another blow to men who already get the short end of the stick when it comes to laws regulating alimony , child support , and child custody following a divorce or separation .
" it can not be that , as a woman , i have the right to make my husband pay to support a child that is not his own , or to deny children the right to know who their real father is , " said dr. karin jäckel , an active supporter of the fathers ' rights movement and author of several books on the subject .
" men are , in every respect , held responsible for their children under our laws , which is why they have the right to know who their children are . "
modernizing alimony bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a father walks with his son in a düsseldorf park .
while the battle over paternity tests continues , justice minister zypries has also announced an overhaul of german laws on alimony .
divorced dads are hopeful that the changes will mean more justice for them .
the growing fathers ' rights movement in germany rejects the stereotype of the heartless man who abandons his family for a new relationship .
in reality , they say , the situation is very different .
women file for divorce more frequently than men , and are more often awarded custody of the children .
and in cases where a divorce is contested , fathers frequently become estranged from their children , making it harder for fathers to gain custody rights once the divorce is settled , jäckel said .
despite this emotional strain , fathers are still seen as the familial breadwinner , and can often find themselves burdened for life with child support and alimony payments to ex-wives .
" in cases where the man earns a lot and can pay for everyone , there 's no problem .
but we 're seeing more frequently that the man 's income is n't enough for everyone , " zypries said in an interview with the women 's magazine brigitte .
ideally , she said , both partners would take financial responsibility for themselves after a divorce .
" a man ca n't be expected to support his ex-wife for years , especially if she could go back to work , and as a consequence not have the money to support children from a second marriage , " she said .

he is a member of fathers for justice , who are campaigning for a change in family law in britain .
but jäckel said that those closely involved with the fathers ' rights movement are skeptical that their concerns will be heeded by politicians .
unlike in britain , where the activist group fathers 4 justice has successfully attracted attention to the plight of divorced dads through spectacular stunts , campaigns by similar german groups have " barely registered politically , " jäckel said , adding that ploys aimed at grabbing media attention can make a desperate father 's situation even worse .
" i 've often seen it happen here that fathers who go to the media to publicize their cases are punished by the judges , " she said .
" in the worst case , this can even result in their custody rights being taken away .
the judges ' logic is that dragging a case of unfair treatment into the public eye only damages the child 's rights , and that someone who would do this is a bad father .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 13.01.2005 indonesia mulls debt moratorium offer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wirayuda with german foreign minister fischer after meeting with german ministers in berlin thursday , indonesian foreign minister wirayuda said jakarta was considering a debt repayment freeze offer amid misgivings that it could damage its economy . indonesian foreign minister hasan wirayuda said his country was mulling the offer of a debt repayment freeze by the paris club of donor nations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we will continue to have discussions on this offer of a debt moratorium , " wirayuda said after a meeting with fischer in berlin on thursday . his remarks come a day after the paris club of creditor nations offered an unconditional freeze on debt repayments for indonesia , the seychelles and sri lanka to help them rebuild their ravaged coastlines after the tsunami that struck on dec .
26 . indonesia , the nation worst-hit by the tidal wave disaster , has an external debt of $ 132 billion -lrb- € 100 billion -rrb- according to the world bank , of which more than $ 70 billion is owed to public creditors or has been guaranteed by public bodies and is eligible for the paris club offer .
indonesia would have to pay more than $ 3 billion in principal payments alone this year - about the same amount it needs to recover from the crisis . german foreign minister joschka fischer said the debt moratorium was " an important step forward " and " an element of aid that can not be underestimated . " doubts linger however , wirayuda admitted that his country still had lingering doubts about taking up the offer . " we do not want that it harms our economy , " he told reporters in berlin .
" we do n't want the market to go wrongly and we do n't want our creditworthiness to be negatively influenced . " in contrast to indonesia , countries such as india , thailand and malaysia have already decided not to accept the freeze on debt repayment for fear they would lose their credit rating on financial markets . indonesia 's fears were echoed by german finance minister hans eichel , who also held talks with wirayuda on thursday . " one must be very prudent as far as the paris club is concerned , " he said and underlined that any debt measures " could put financial credibility in peril .
and that is something they -lrb- indonesia -rrb- do not want .
indonesia is neither in an economic crisis nor a financial crisis and clearly prefers aid to a debt freeze . " complete waiver problematic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paris club chairman jean pierre jouyet the paris club of donors ' decision to suspend the debts of tsunami-hit nations rather than completely waive it has come in for criticism from aid organizations such as oxfam and anti-globalization group attac . but , experts have pointed out that a complete debt waiver could be problematic .

26 . indonesia , the nation worst-hit by the tidal wave disaster , has an external debt of $ 132 billion -lrb- € 100 billion -rrb- according to the world bank , of which more than $ 70 billion is owed to public creditors or has been guaranteed by public bodies and is eligible for the paris club offer .
indonesia would have to pay more than $ 3 billion in principal payments alone this year - about the same amount it needs to recover from the crisis . german foreign minister joschka fischer said the debt moratorium was " an important step forward " and " an element of aid that can not be underestimated . " doubts linger however , wirayuda admitted that his country still had lingering doubts about taking up the offer . " we do not want that it harms our economy , " he told reporters in berlin .
" we do n't want the market to go wrongly and we do n't want our creditworthiness to be negatively influenced . " in contrast to indonesia , countries such as india , thailand and malaysia have already decided not to accept the freeze on debt repayment for fear they would lose their credit rating on financial markets . indonesia 's fears were echoed by german finance minister hans eichel , who also held talks with wirayuda on thursday . " one must be very prudent as far as the paris club is concerned , " he said and underlined that any debt measures " could put financial credibility in peril .
and that is something they -lrb- indonesia -rrb- do not want .
indonesia is neither in an economic crisis nor a financial crisis and clearly prefers aid to a debt freeze . " complete waiver problematic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paris club chairman jean pierre jouyet the paris club of donors ' decision to suspend the debts of tsunami-hit nations rather than completely waive it has come in for criticism from aid organizations such as oxfam and anti-globalization group attac . but , experts have pointed out that a complete debt waiver could be problematic .
rolf langhammer of the institute for world economics in kiel told deutsche welle that it would n't just damage the credit reputation of the nations , but could also prompt a " chain reaction " with other countries who have also suffered other catastrophes lining up to stake their claim . langhammer also added that it was n't clear whether forgiving debt " would really lead to the money reaching the ones really suffering .

13 , 1980 just three years later , on jan .
13 , 1980 , some of these " dangerous organizations " joined forces after a long debate about the necessity of founding a new party : " die grünen " or " the greens " were born .
few believed that the party would survive .
debates over the inclusion of left-wing radicals foreshadowed the later power struggles between ecological radicals , the so-called " fundis , " and pragmatic " realos . "
politically , the greens questioned the status quo from the start : calls for an immediate end to the use of nuclear power , the dissolution of nato and an ecologically oriented economy scared away potential voters .
environment first but the greens deserve the biggest credit for putting the protection of the environment at the center of their agenda , according to karl-rudolf korte , a political scientist at the university of duisburg / essen .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the phasing out of nuclear power has been a priority for the greens " this led established parties to take up these topics , " he said , adding that state and federal governments responded by setting up ministries for the environment .
the success became a danger for the greens , however , as others adopted their agenda and made it their own , korte said .
additionally , the party limited itself by imposing a strict political culture .
for many years , elected members of parliament had to give up their seats mid-term to make room for others .
until recently the greens also did not allow party functionaries to hold public office at the same time .
joschka 's sneakers still , german society quickly warmed to the party 's ecologically-oriented politics at the beginning of the 1980s while the big parties still did n't have the subject on their agenda .
because of this , the greens were able to get enough votes to enter local and state parliaments throughout germany , culminating in the first " red-green " coalition government with the social democrats in the central state of hesse in 1985 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer -lrb- right -rrb- taking the oath of office as hesse 's environmental minister on dec .
12 , 1985 that government 's environmental minister - the first in germany - later became the country 's foreign minister .
at the time , though , joschka fischer caused an uproar when he took his oath of office wearing jeans and sneakers .
while successful with voters , the greens began falling apart from the inside as " fundis " and " realos " kept fighting about the future of the party .
the low point was reached with german unification in 1990 : campaigning with the slogan " everyone talks about germany .
we talk about climate , " the greens failed to win over voters and were kicked out of parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the united party 's logo only members of the greens ' eastern german sister party , " bündnis 90 , " or alliance 90 , managed to garner seats .
the two parties finally merged in 1993 and the greens are now officially called " bündnis 90 / die grünen . "
reaching for power a year later , the party , now led by " realos " around joschka fischer , re-entered parliament and reached its high point in 1998 , when the greens became the junior partner in germany 's governing coalition with the social democrats for the first time .
by then , the party had gone through a tremendous process of transformation , reflected in its approval of the participation of german soldiers in the nato-led kosovo mission in 1999 .
fischer can take the credit for the turn-around in the party , according to korte .
" this was probably the biggest challenge for a party that was founded on a pacifist platform , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer -lrb- left -rrb- and german chancellor gerhard schröder together with the social democrats , the greens made a number of difficult decisions in the following years .
they opted for reforms to germany 's tax and social welfare systems and approved other military missions to macedonia and afghanistan .
while social democrats have lost voters in elections since 2002 , the greens managed to hold onto their seats or increase them almost everywhere .
and for years , fischer has led the list of germany 's most popular politicians .
black future ?
but the party 's base remains a distinctly western german one - a fact that does n't surprise danial cohn-bendit -lrb- photo below -rrb- , a prominent green member of the european parliament .

" it 's a cultural development .
we 're a modern party which requires a modern civil society and the latter 's still emerging in -lrb- eastern germany -rrb- . "
and while the social democrats still seem to be the greens ' natural coalition partner , that could change in the future , according to korte .
on the municipal level , coalitions with the conservative christian democrats already exist - cologne is the most prominent example .
the southwestern state of baden-württemberg is the most likely candidate for a " black-green " coalition , korte said .
maybe it 'll take a bit longer than the next election , however , as it 's taking place near the time when fischer and german chancellor gerhard schröder will fight for re-election on the national level in 2006 . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the green view on german politics foreign minister joschka fischer has been busy campaigning for a permanent seat on the un security council .

german politicians seeking to outlaw secret paternity tests won a first battle on wednesday , much to the disappointment of fathers ' rights groups hoping for greater justice in the areas of alimony and child support . the german federal court of justice decided on wednesday that paternity tests carried out in secret are inadmissible as evidence in a lawsuit .
unless the mother gave her consent for the test , the child 's personal rights would be violated , the court in karlsruhe ruled .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lab technician at the " id-labor " in wiesbaden conducts a paternity test .
the decision was welcomed by german justice minister brigitte zypries , who is leading a campaign to make secret paternity tests illegal under a new law regulating the use of genetic data .
" these tests are a serious invasion of the private sphere , " zypries said .
" if a man has doubts about his paternity , he should talk about this with the mother . "
campaigners for fathers ' rights in germany say making secret paternity tests punishable would be yet another blow to men who already get the short end of the stick when it comes to laws regulating alimony , child support , and child custody following a divorce or separation .
" it can not be that , as a woman , i have the right to make my husband pay to support a child that is not his own , or to deny children the right to know who their real father is , " said dr. karin jäckel , an active supporter of the fathers ' rights movement and author of several books on the subject .
" men are , in every respect , held responsible for their children under our laws , which is why they have the right to know who their children are . "
modernizing alimony bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a father walks with his son in a düsseldorf park .
while the battle over paternity tests continues , justice minister zypries has also announced an overhaul of german laws on alimony .
divorced dads are hopeful that the changes will mean more justice for them .
the growing fathers ' rights movement in germany rejects the stereotype of the heartless man who abandons his family for a new relationship .
in reality , they say , the situation is very different .
women file for divorce more frequently than men , and are more often awarded custody of the children .
and in cases where a divorce is contested , fathers frequently become estranged from their children , making it harder for fathers to gain custody rights once the divorce is settled , jäckel said .
despite this emotional strain , fathers are still seen as the familial breadwinner , and can often find themselves burdened for life with child support and alimony payments to ex-wives .
" in cases where the man earns a lot and can pay for everyone , there 's no problem .
but we 're seeing more frequently that the man 's income is n't enough for everyone , " zypries said in an interview with the women 's magazine brigitte .
ideally , she said , both partners would take financial responsibility for themselves after a divorce .
" a man ca n't be expected to support his ex-wife for years , especially if she could go back to work , and as a consequence not have the money to support children from a second marriage , " she said .

he is a member of fathers for justice , who are campaigning for a change in family law in britain .
but jäckel said that those closely involved with the fathers ' rights movement are skeptical that their concerns will be heeded by politicians .
unlike in britain , where the activist group fathers 4 justice has successfully attracted attention to the plight of divorced dads through spectacular stunts , campaigns by similar german groups have " barely registered politically , " jäckel said , adding that ploys aimed at grabbing media attention can make a desperate father 's situation even worse .
" i 've often seen it happen here that fathers who go to the media to publicize their cases are punished by the judges , " she said .
" in the worst case , this can even result in their custody rights being taken away .
the judges ' logic is that dragging a case of unfair treatment into the public eye only damages the child 's rights , and that someone who would do this is a bad father .

german politicians seeking to outlaw secret paternity tests won a first battle on wednesday , much to the disappointment of fathers ' rights groups hoping for greater justice in the areas of alimony and child support . the german federal court of justice decided on wednesday that paternity tests carried out in secret are inadmissible as evidence in a lawsuit .
unless the mother gave her consent for the test , the child 's personal rights would be violated , the court in karlsruhe ruled .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lab technician at the " id-labor " in wiesbaden conducts a paternity test .
the decision was welcomed by german justice minister brigitte zypries , who is leading a campaign to make secret paternity tests illegal under a new law regulating the use of genetic data .
" these tests are a serious invasion of the private sphere , " zypries said .
" if a man has doubts about his paternity , he should talk about this with the mother . "
campaigners for fathers ' rights in germany say making secret paternity tests punishable would be yet another blow to men who already get the short end of the stick when it comes to laws regulating alimony , child support , and child custody following a divorce or separation .
" it can not be that , as a woman , i have the right to make my husband pay to support a child that is not his own , or to deny children the right to know who their real father is , " said dr. karin jäckel , an active supporter of the fathers ' rights movement and author of several books on the subject .
" men are , in every respect , held responsible for their children under our laws , which is why they have the right to know who their children are . "
modernizing alimony bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a father walks with his son in a düsseldorf park .
while the battle over paternity tests continues , justice minister zypries has also announced an overhaul of german laws on alimony .
divorced dads are hopeful that the changes will mean more justice for them .
the growing fathers ' rights movement in germany rejects the stereotype of the heartless man who abandons his family for a new relationship .
in reality , they say , the situation is very different .
women file for divorce more frequently than men , and are more often awarded custody of the children .
and in cases where a divorce is contested , fathers frequently become estranged from their children , making it harder for fathers to gain custody rights once the divorce is settled , jäckel said .
despite this emotional strain , fathers are still seen as the familial breadwinner , and can often find themselves burdened for life with child support and alimony payments to ex-wives .
" in cases where the man earns a lot and can pay for everyone , there 's no problem .
but we 're seeing more frequently that the man 's income is n't enough for everyone , " zypries said in an interview with the women 's magazine brigitte .
ideally , she said , both partners would take financial responsibility for themselves after a divorce .
" a man ca n't be expected to support his ex-wife for years , especially if she could go back to work , and as a consequence not have the money to support children from a second marriage , " she said .

he is a member of fathers for justice , who are campaigning for a change in family law in britain .
but jäckel said that those closely involved with the fathers ' rights movement are skeptical that their concerns will be heeded by politicians .
unlike in britain , where the activist group fathers 4 justice has successfully attracted attention to the plight of divorced dads through spectacular stunts , campaigns by similar german groups have " barely registered politically , " jäckel said , adding that ploys aimed at grabbing media attention can make a desperate father 's situation even worse .
" i 've often seen it happen here that fathers who go to the media to publicize their cases are punished by the judges , " she said .
" in the worst case , this can even result in their custody rights being taken away .
the judges ' logic is that dragging a case of unfair treatment into the public eye only damages the child 's rights , and that someone who would do this is a bad father .

" a danger for democracy " - that 's what a leading german social democrat called so-called " green lists " - a conglomeration of environmentalist , peace and anti-nuclear groups - back in 1977 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the greens first leadership at the founding convention on jan .
13 , 1980 just three years later , on jan .
13 , 1980 , some of these " dangerous organizations " joined forces after a long debate about the necessity of founding a new party : " die grünen " or " the greens " were born .
few believed that the party would survive .
debates over the inclusion of left-wing radicals foreshadowed the later power struggles between ecological radicals , the so-called " fundis , " and pragmatic " realos . "
politically , the greens questioned the status quo from the start : calls for an immediate end to the use of nuclear power , the dissolution of nato and an ecologically oriented economy scared away potential voters .
environment first but the greens deserve the biggest credit for putting the protection of the environment at the center of their agenda , according to karl-rudolf korte , a political scientist at the university of duisburg / essen .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the phasing out of nuclear power has been a priority for the greens " this led established parties to take up these topics , " he said , adding that state and federal governments responded by setting up ministries for the environment .
the success became a danger for the greens , however , as others adopted their agenda and made it their own , korte said .
additionally , the party limited itself by imposing a strict political culture .
for many years , elected members of parliament had to give up their seats mid-term to make room for others .
until recently the greens also did not allow party functionaries to hold public office at the same time .
joschka 's sneakers still , german society quickly warmed to the party 's ecologically-oriented politics at the beginning of the 1980s while the big parties still did n't have the subject on their agenda .
because of this , the greens were able to get enough votes to enter local and state parliaments throughout germany , culminating in the first " red-green " coalition government with the social democrats in the central state of hesse in 1985 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer -lrb- right -rrb- taking the oath of office as hesse 's environmental minister on dec .
12 , 1985 that government 's environmental minister - the first in germany - later became the country 's foreign minister .
at the time , though , joschka fischer caused an uproar when he took his oath of office wearing jeans and sneakers .
while successful with voters , the greens began falling apart from the inside as " fundis " and " realos " kept fighting about the future of the party .
the low point was reached with german unification in 1990 : campaigning with the slogan " everyone talks about germany .
we talk about climate , " the greens failed to win over voters and were kicked out of parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the united party 's logo only members of the greens ' eastern german sister party , " bündnis 90 , " or alliance 90 , managed to garner seats .
the two parties finally merged in 1993 and the greens are now officially called " bündnis 90 / die grünen . "
reaching for power a year later , the party , now led by " realos " around joschka fischer , re-entered parliament and reached its high point in 1998 , when the greens became the junior partner in germany 's governing coalition with the social democrats for the first time .
by then , the party had gone through a tremendous process of transformation , reflected in its approval of the participation of german soldiers in the nato-led kosovo mission in 1999 .
fischer can take the credit for the turn-around in the party , according to korte .
" this was probably the biggest challenge for a party that was founded on a pacifist platform , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer -lrb- left -rrb- and german chancellor gerhard schröder together with the social democrats , the greens made a number of difficult decisions in the following years .
they opted for reforms to germany 's tax and social welfare systems and approved other military missions to macedonia and afghanistan .
while social democrats have lost voters in elections since 2002 , the greens managed to hold onto their seats or increase them almost everywhere .
and for years , fischer has led the list of germany 's most popular politicians .
black future ?
but the party 's base remains a distinctly western german one - a fact that does n't surprise danial cohn-bendit -lrb- photo below -rrb- , a prominent green member of the european parliament .

" it 's a cultural development .
we 're a modern party which requires a modern civil society and the latter 's still emerging in -lrb- eastern germany -rrb- . "
and while the social democrats still seem to be the greens ' natural coalition partner , that could change in the future , according to korte .
on the municipal level , coalitions with the conservative christian democrats already exist - cologne is the most prominent example .
the southwestern state of baden-württemberg is the most likely candidate for a " black-green " coalition , korte said .
maybe it 'll take a bit longer than the next election , however , as it 's taking place near the time when fischer and german chancellor gerhard schröder will fight for re-election on the national level in 2006 . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the green view on german politics foreign minister joschka fischer has been busy campaigning for a permanent seat on the un security council .

" a danger for democracy " - that 's what a leading german social democrat called so-called " green lists " - a conglomeration of environmentalist , peace and anti-nuclear groups - back in 1977 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the greens first leadership at the founding convention on jan .
13 , 1980 just three years later , on jan .
13 , 1980 , some of these " dangerous organizations " joined forces after a long debate about the necessity of founding a new party : " die grünen " or " the greens " were born .
few believed that the party would survive .
debates over the inclusion of left-wing radicals foreshadowed the later power struggles between ecological radicals , the so-called " fundis , " and pragmatic " realos . "
politically , the greens questioned the status quo from the start : calls for an immediate end to the use of nuclear power , the dissolution of nato and an ecologically oriented economy scared away potential voters .
environment first but the greens deserve the biggest credit for putting the protection of the environment at the center of their agenda , according to karl-rudolf korte , a political scientist at the university of duisburg / essen .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the phasing out of nuclear power has been a priority for the greens " this led established parties to take up these topics , " he said , adding that state and federal governments responded by setting up ministries for the environment .
the success became a danger for the greens , however , as others adopted their agenda and made it their own , korte said .
additionally , the party limited itself by imposing a strict political culture .
for many years , elected members of parliament had to give up their seats mid-term to make room for others .
until recently the greens also did not allow party functionaries to hold public office at the same time .
joschka 's sneakers still , german society quickly warmed to the party 's ecologically-oriented politics at the beginning of the 1980s while the big parties still did n't have the subject on their agenda .
because of this , the greens were able to get enough votes to enter local and state parliaments throughout germany , culminating in the first " red-green " coalition government with the social democrats in the central state of hesse in 1985 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer -lrb- right -rrb- taking the oath of office as hesse 's environmental minister on dec .
12 , 1985 that government 's environmental minister - the first in germany - later became the country 's foreign minister .
at the time , though , joschka fischer caused an uproar when he took his oath of office wearing jeans and sneakers .
while successful with voters , the greens began falling apart from the inside as " fundis " and " realos " kept fighting about the future of the party .
the low point was reached with german unification in 1990 : campaigning with the slogan " everyone talks about germany .
we talk about climate , " the greens failed to win over voters and were kicked out of parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the united party 's logo only members of the greens ' eastern german sister party , " bündnis 90 , " or alliance 90 , managed to garner seats .
the two parties finally merged in 1993 and the greens are now officially called " bündnis 90 / die grünen . "
reaching for power a year later , the party , now led by " realos " around joschka fischer , re-entered parliament and reached its high point in 1998 , when the greens became the junior partner in germany 's governing coalition with the social democrats for the first time .
by then , the party had gone through a tremendous process of transformation , reflected in its approval of the participation of german soldiers in the nato-led kosovo mission in 1999 .
fischer can take the credit for the turn-around in the party , according to korte .
" this was probably the biggest challenge for a party that was founded on a pacifist platform , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer -lrb- left -rrb- and german chancellor gerhard schröder together with the social democrats , the greens made a number of difficult decisions in the following years .
they opted for reforms to germany 's tax and social welfare systems and approved other military missions to macedonia and afghanistan .
while social democrats have lost voters in elections since 2002 , the greens managed to hold onto their seats or increase them almost everywhere .
and for years , fischer has led the list of germany 's most popular politicians .

" there is a list of up to 100 persons in different parliaments , on several levels , on state level , on regional level , being paid by carmaker volkswagen , " resch said .
" for example the mayor of wolfsburg , the city where volkswagen is situated , gets a salary by this company . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw manufacturing factory in wolfsburg volkswagen has also had its hand in watering down recent legislation for higher environmental standards proposed by the green party , which would have required fine particle dust filters in diesel motors . all it took , resch said , was a letter from volkswagen head bernd pischetsrieder to members of parliament . " in this letter pischetsrieder complained that tax incentives for particle filters would harm his company and the car industry in germany and would be bad for the economy , " resch said .
" with this letter he -lrb- pischetsrieder -rrb- was able to stop the entire parliamentary process . " a lobbyist in disguise ? deutsche umwelthilfe 's allegations against german companies come at a time of intense debate in the country about whether politicians should be allowed to hold down a normal job while carrying out their duties as an elected member of parliament or whether that would inevitably lead to a conflict of interests and turn parliamentarians into mere lobbyist for industry . under german law , parliamentarians are indeed allowed to work " on the side " as long as they do not earn more than € 3,000 a month or € 18,000 a year on top of their salaries as a member of parliament . but the system 's critics claim that such a practice could easily give rise to a conflict of interest . " the parliamentarian must not be a lobbyist in disguise , " jochen bäumel of transparency international told news agency afp .
" only by publishing their additional income can the electorate know whose interests they really represent . " companies under pressure spearheaded by mass-selling daily bild , the campaign to publish fat-cat corporate salaries has put pressure on german companies to reveal details of their links with politicians . volkswagen has already announced that it plans to release a list of employees on its books who also hold a political office .
vw ceo pischetsrieder is expected to announce the details on thursday .
bild reported this week that vw had six social democratic parliamentarians on its payrolls over the last six years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : laurenz meyer the issue has already caused heads to roll in the conservative opposition christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
secretary general of the party , laurenz meyer stepped down last month after it emerged that he had received substantial payouts from energy giant rwe , his former employer , while holding political office . harmful for economy too however , deutsche umwelthilfe claims that the dilution of climate-friendly laws through the nexus of politicians and car industry officials is not only harmful to the german environment , but may hurt the economy in the long run as well . countries like china and japan have lowered the ceilings for acceptable fuel consumption in automobiles , and even the us has stricter emissions standards than germany .
many german luxury cars do not meet the new guidelines .
jürgen resch warns that “ made in germany ” may lose its selling power abroad . “ earlier german cars stood for high quality , for security , and for a while , even for high environmental standards , " resch said .
" but , we 're now noticing that even in the united states , more and more cars are not being able to sell , because the emissions are too high .
we see a big danger if the very high priced cars in germany can ’ t be sold in the whole asian market anymore because of environmental regulations . " tighter regulations needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opel astra diesel hybrid concept vehicle is shown during media previews at the north american international auto show in detroit , jan .
9 , 2005 .
instead of hyping faster motors and new state-of-art fuel pumps , deutsche umwelthilfe says that the german automobile industry need more incentive to focus on the development of alternatives to traditional engines , like environmentally-friendly hybrid models and more energy-efficient diesel motors . it has proposed tighter regulations similar to those being implemented in japan and china within the next few years .
whether these will put german cars on the fast track in asia remains to be seen . kateri jochum -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german opposition deputy resigns german opposition leader angela merkel 's deputy , laurenz meyer , resigned on wednesday after being heavily criticized for failing to fully declare payments and electricity subsidies he received from his former employer .

" a danger for democracy " - that 's what a leading german social democrat called so-called " green lists " - a conglomeration of environmentalist , peace and anti-nuclear groups - back in 1977 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the greens first leadership at the founding convention on jan .
13 , 1980 just three years later , on jan .
13 , 1980 , some of these " dangerous organizations " joined forces after a long debate about the necessity of founding a new party : " die grünen " or " the greens " were born .
few believed that the party would survive .
debates over the inclusion of left-wing radicals foreshadowed the later power struggles between ecological radicals , the so-called " fundis , " and pragmatic " realos . "
politically , the greens questioned the status quo from the start : calls for an immediate end to the use of nuclear power , the dissolution of nato and an ecologically oriented economy scared away potential voters .
environment first but the greens deserve the biggest credit for putting the protection of the environment at the center of their agenda , according to karl-rudolf korte , a political scientist at the university of duisburg / essen .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the phasing out of nuclear power has been a priority for the greens " this led established parties to take up these topics , " he said , adding that state and federal governments responded by setting up ministries for the environment .
the success became a danger for the greens , however , as others adopted their agenda and made it their own , korte said .
additionally , the party limited itself by imposing a strict political culture .
for many years , elected members of parliament had to give up their seats mid-term to make room for others .
until recently the greens also did not allow party functionaries to hold public office at the same time .
joschka 's sneakers still , german society quickly warmed to the party 's ecologically-oriented politics at the beginning of the 1980s while the big parties still did n't have the subject on their agenda .
because of this , the greens were able to get enough votes to enter local and state parliaments throughout germany , culminating in the first " red-green " coalition government with the social democrats in the central state of hesse in 1985 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer -lrb- right -rrb- taking the oath of office as hesse 's environmental minister on dec .
12 , 1985 that government 's environmental minister - the first in germany - later became the country 's foreign minister .
at the time , though , joschka fischer caused an uproar when he took his oath of office wearing jeans and sneakers .
while successful with voters , the greens began falling apart from the inside as " fundis " and " realos " kept fighting about the future of the party .
the low point was reached with german unification in 1990 : campaigning with the slogan " everyone talks about germany .
we talk about climate , " the greens failed to win over voters and were kicked out of parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the united party 's logo only members of the greens ' eastern german sister party , " bündnis 90 , " or alliance 90 , managed to garner seats .
the two parties finally merged in 1993 and the greens are now officially called " bündnis 90 / die grünen . "
reaching for power a year later , the party , now led by " realos " around joschka fischer , re-entered parliament and reached its high point in 1998 , when the greens became the junior partner in germany 's governing coalition with the social democrats for the first time .
by then , the party had gone through a tremendous process of transformation , reflected in its approval of the participation of german soldiers in the nato-led kosovo mission in 1999 .
fischer can take the credit for the turn-around in the party , according to korte .
" this was probably the biggest challenge for a party that was founded on a pacifist platform , " he said .

26 . indonesia , the nation worst-hit by the tidal wave disaster , has an external debt of $ 132 billion -lrb- € 100 billion -rrb- according to the world bank , of which more than $ 70 billion is owed to public creditors or has been guaranteed by public bodies and is eligible for the paris club offer .
indonesia would have to pay more than $ 3 billion in principal payments alone this year - about the same amount it needs to recover from the crisis . german foreign minister joschka fischer said the debt moratorium was " an important step forward " and " an element of aid that can not be underestimated . " doubts linger however , wirayuda admitted that his country still had lingering doubts about taking up the offer . " we do not want that it harms our economy , " he told reporters in berlin .
" we do n't want the market to go wrongly and we do n't want our creditworthiness to be negatively influenced . " in contrast to indonesia , countries such as india , thailand and malaysia have already decided not to accept the freeze on debt repayment for fear they would lose their credit rating on financial markets . indonesia 's fears were echoed by german finance minister hans eichel , who also held talks with wirayuda on thursday . " one must be very prudent as far as the paris club is concerned , " he said and underlined that any debt measures " could put financial credibility in peril .
and that is something they -lrb- indonesia -rrb- do not want .
indonesia is neither in an economic crisis nor a financial crisis and clearly prefers aid to a debt freeze . " complete waiver problematic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paris club chairman jean pierre jouyet the paris club of donors ' decision to suspend the debts of tsunami-hit nations rather than completely waive it has come in for criticism from aid organizations such as oxfam and anti-globalization group attac . but , experts have pointed out that a complete debt waiver could be problematic .
rolf langhammer of the institute for world economics in kiel told deutsche welle that it would n't just damage the credit reputation of the nations , but could also prompt a " chain reaction " with other countries who have also suffered other catastrophes lining up to stake their claim . langhammer also added that it was n't clear whether forgiving debt " would really lead to the money reaching the ones really suffering . " wirayuda plays down troop restrictions on thursday , wirayuda also played down earlier statements by the indonesian government that foreign troops involved in emergency aid operations in the devastated aceh province should not stay longer than three months . the foreign minister stressed that jakarta welcomed the military aid deployments , including germany 's , but added that their presence was a " delicate issue for the indonesian public . " wirayuda said that restrictions on the movement of aid workers in aceh were only for their own safety and denied the rules would hinder international relief operations .
at the same time , he said he was open for the truce offer made by separatist muslim rebels in aceh to the government in jakarta . " there is a silver lining on the horizon , " wirayuda said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers german foreign minister fischer underlined his government 's long-term commitment to help indonesia overcome the devastation wrought by the tsunami disaster and said that german soldiers stationed in aceh with a mobile field hospital and relief supplies ship , would " stay in the region as long as it makes sense and as long as the indonesian government wished .

german politicians seeking to outlaw secret paternity tests won a first battle on wednesday , much to the disappointment of fathers ' rights groups hoping for greater justice in the areas of alimony and child support . the german federal court of justice decided on wednesday that paternity tests carried out in secret are inadmissible as evidence in a lawsuit .
unless the mother gave her consent for the test , the child 's personal rights would be violated , the court in karlsruhe ruled .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lab technician at the " id-labor " in wiesbaden conducts a paternity test .
the decision was welcomed by german justice minister brigitte zypries , who is leading a campaign to make secret paternity tests illegal under a new law regulating the use of genetic data .
" these tests are a serious invasion of the private sphere , " zypries said .
" if a man has doubts about his paternity , he should talk about this with the mother . "
campaigners for fathers ' rights in germany say making secret paternity tests punishable would be yet another blow to men who already get the short end of the stick when it comes to laws regulating alimony , child support , and child custody following a divorce or separation .
" it can not be that , as a woman , i have the right to make my husband pay to support a child that is not his own , or to deny children the right to know who their real father is , " said dr. karin jäckel , an active supporter of the fathers ' rights movement and author of several books on the subject .
" men are , in every respect , held responsible for their children under our laws , which is why they have the right to know who their children are . "
modernizing alimony bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a father walks with his son in a düsseldorf park .
while the battle over paternity tests continues , justice minister zypries has also announced an overhaul of german laws on alimony .
divorced dads are hopeful that the changes will mean more justice for them .
the growing fathers ' rights movement in germany rejects the stereotype of the heartless man who abandons his family for a new relationship .
in reality , they say , the situation is very different .
women file for divorce more frequently than men , and are more often awarded custody of the children .
and in cases where a divorce is contested , fathers frequently become estranged from their children , making it harder for fathers to gain custody rights once the divorce is settled , jäckel said .
despite this emotional strain , fathers are still seen as the familial breadwinner , and can often find themselves burdened for life with child support and alimony payments to ex-wives .
" in cases where the man earns a lot and can pay for everyone , there 's no problem .
but we 're seeing more frequently that the man 's income is n't enough for everyone , " zypries said in an interview with the women 's magazine brigitte .
ideally , she said , both partners would take financial responsibility for themselves after a divorce .
" a man ca n't be expected to support his ex-wife for years , especially if she could go back to work , and as a consequence not have the money to support children from a second marriage , " she said .

he is a member of fathers for justice , who are campaigning for a change in family law in britain .
but jäckel said that those closely involved with the fathers ' rights movement are skeptical that their concerns will be heeded by politicians .
unlike in britain , where the activist group fathers 4 justice has successfully attracted attention to the plight of divorced dads through spectacular stunts , campaigns by similar german groups have " barely registered politically , " jäckel said , adding that ploys aimed at grabbing media attention can make a desperate father 's situation even worse .
" i 've often seen it happen here that fathers who go to the media to publicize their cases are punished by the judges , " she said .
" in the worst case , this can even result in their custody rights being taken away .
the judges ' logic is that dragging a case of unfair treatment into the public eye only damages the child 's rights , and that someone who would do this is a bad father .

indonesia would have to pay more than $ 3 billion in principal payments alone this year - about the same amount it needs to recover from the crisis . german foreign minister joschka fischer said the debt moratorium was " an important step forward " and " an element of aid that can not be underestimated .

german politicians seeking to outlaw secret paternity tests won a first battle on wednesday , much to the disappointment of fathers ' rights groups hoping for greater justice in the areas of alimony and child support . the german federal court of justice decided on wednesday that paternity tests carried out in secret are inadmissible as evidence in a lawsuit .
unless the mother gave her consent for the test , the child 's personal rights would be violated , the court in karlsruhe ruled .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lab technician at the " id-labor " in wiesbaden conducts a paternity test .
the decision was welcomed by german justice minister brigitte zypries , who is leading a campaign to make secret paternity tests illegal under a new law regulating the use of genetic data .
" these tests are a serious invasion of the private sphere , " zypries said .
" if a man has doubts about his paternity , he should talk about this with the mother . "
campaigners for fathers ' rights in germany say making secret paternity tests punishable would be yet another blow to men who already get the short end of the stick when it comes to laws regulating alimony , child support , and child custody following a divorce or separation .
" it can not be that , as a woman , i have the right to make my husband pay to support a child that is not his own , or to deny children the right to know who their real father is , " said dr. karin jäckel , an active supporter of the fathers ' rights movement and author of several books on the subject .
" men are , in every respect , held responsible for their children under our laws , which is why they have the right to know who their children are . "
modernizing alimony bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a father walks with his son in a düsseldorf park .
while the battle over paternity tests continues , justice minister zypries has also announced an overhaul of german laws on alimony .
divorced dads are hopeful that the changes will mean more justice for them .
the growing fathers ' rights movement in germany rejects the stereotype of the heartless man who abandons his family for a new relationship .
in reality , they say , the situation is very different .
women file for divorce more frequently than men , and are more often awarded custody of the children .
and in cases where a divorce is contested , fathers frequently become estranged from their children , making it harder for fathers to gain custody rights once the divorce is settled , jäckel said .
despite this emotional strain , fathers are still seen as the familial breadwinner , and can often find themselves burdened for life with child support and alimony payments to ex-wives .
" in cases where the man earns a lot and can pay for everyone , there 's no problem .
but we 're seeing more frequently that the man 's income is n't enough for everyone , " zypries said in an interview with the women 's magazine brigitte .
ideally , she said , both partners would take financial responsibility for themselves after a divorce .
" a man ca n't be expected to support his ex-wife for years , especially if she could go back to work , and as a consequence not have the money to support children from a second marriage , " she said .

he is a member of fathers for justice , who are campaigning for a change in family law in britain .
but jäckel said that those closely involved with the fathers ' rights movement are skeptical that their concerns will be heeded by politicians .
unlike in britain , where the activist group fathers 4 justice has successfully attracted attention to the plight of divorced dads through spectacular stunts , campaigns by similar german groups have " barely registered politically , " jäckel said , adding that ploys aimed at grabbing media attention can make a desperate father 's situation even worse .
" i 've often seen it happen here that fathers who go to the media to publicize their cases are punished by the judges , " she said .
" in the worst case , this can even result in their custody rights being taken away .
the judges ' logic is that dragging a case of unfair treatment into the public eye only damages the child 's rights , and that someone who would do this is a bad father .

they say it is the only way to combat " paternity fraud . "

but his latest caper - dressing as a nazi at a costume party , tops them all . the photo splashed across the british tabloid the sun shows a lanky prince harry wearing the tan uniform of the nazi 's afrika korps , complete with red and black swastika armband , holding a drink in one hand and a cigarette in the other .
and it begs the question : " harry , what were you thinking ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's prince harry the youngest son of the late princess diana and heir-to-the-throne prince charles may be the " wild child " of the british royal family , but surely he knows better ?
and if he does n't , then why did n't one of his minders , or at least big brother william , who attended the " native and colonial " party in a much tamer lion costume , warn the wayward redhead ? harry 's timing could n't be worse .
in just two weeks ' time , his grandmother , queen elizabeth , is due to host a reception for survivors of the holocaust before representing the nation at the holocaust memorial day national event . jewish leaders outraged jewish leaders have already spoken out about the incident .
the simon wiesenthal center , one of the world 's leading jewish human rights organizations , called it " a shameful act … displaying insensitivity " to both holocaust victims and allied soldiers " who gave their lives to defeat nazism . " its founder , rabbi marvin hier , said harry ought to go to auschwitz with his uncle , prince edward , head of the british delegation for the 60th anniversary commemorations . " there he will see the results of the hated symbol he so foolishly and brazenly chose to wear , " hier said . a ' poor choice ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the british tabloid " the sun " splashed a photo from the party over its front page in a statement from clarence house , harry apologized for what he called " a poor choice of costume . "
but there have been calls by british politicians for the prince to appear in person to make his own public apology . " if he wants to be considered an adult , he 's got to behave like an adult , and he has got to apologize in person , through radio and television , " said former royal press spokesman dicky arbiter . others , including rabbi dr. jonathan romain of the reform synagogues of great britain , are prepared to put the incident down to the folly of youth and let the prince 's apology stand . the fact that the palace has issued an apology indicates that this was a mistake by the prince , " romain said .
" but having been given , the apology should now be accepted . " career consequences ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prince harry , youngest son of the prince of wales and grandson of britain 's queen elizabeth ii , took charge of a 48-strong parade of military cadets at eton school tuesday night may 26 2003 , fuelling speculation that he may opt for a military career .
harry , 18 , was appointed commander of eton 's combined cadet force 's formal trooping of the colour ceremony.the prince of wales was among those looking on as his youngest son led the guard of honour 's march out on to college field with their colours at the yearly tattoo , held since òthe corpsó was founded in 1860 .
-lrb- ap photo / pa -rrb- * * united kingdom out magazines out no sales * * the costume choice could prove to have serious consequences for harry , as already , there have been calls to bar him from attending the elite sandhurst military academy later this year .

" if it was anyone else , the application would n't be considered .
it should be withdrawn immediately . " in germany , the costume scandal is likely to renew complaints that british perceptions of the country remain skewed by the nazi era .

german politicians seeking to outlaw secret paternity tests won a first battle on wednesday , much to the disappointment of fathers ' rights groups hoping for greater justice in the areas of alimony and child support . the german federal court of justice decided on wednesday that paternity tests carried out in secret are inadmissible as evidence in a lawsuit .
unless the mother gave her consent for the test , the child 's personal rights would be violated , the court in karlsruhe ruled .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lab technician at the " id-labor " in wiesbaden conducts a paternity test .
the decision was welcomed by german justice minister brigitte zypries , who is leading a campaign to make secret paternity tests illegal under a new law regulating the use of genetic data .
" these tests are a serious invasion of the private sphere , " zypries said .
" if a man has doubts about his paternity , he should talk about this with the mother . "
campaigners for fathers ' rights in germany say making secret paternity tests punishable would be yet another blow to men who already get the short end of the stick when it comes to laws regulating alimony , child support , and child custody following a divorce or separation .
" it can not be that , as a woman , i have the right to make my husband pay to support a child that is not his own , or to deny children the right to know who their real father is , " said dr. karin jäckel , an active supporter of the fathers ' rights movement and author of several books on the subject .
" men are , in every respect , held responsible for their children under our laws , which is why they have the right to know who their children are . "
modernizing alimony bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a father walks with his son in a düsseldorf park .
while the battle over paternity tests continues , justice minister zypries has also announced an overhaul of german laws on alimony .
divorced dads are hopeful that the changes will mean more justice for them .
the growing fathers ' rights movement in germany rejects the stereotype of the heartless man who abandons his family for a new relationship .
in reality , they say , the situation is very different .
women file for divorce more frequently than men , and are more often awarded custody of the children .
and in cases where a divorce is contested , fathers frequently become estranged from their children , making it harder for fathers to gain custody rights once the divorce is settled , jäckel said .
despite this emotional strain , fathers are still seen as the familial breadwinner , and can often find themselves burdened for life with child support and alimony payments to ex-wives .
" in cases where the man earns a lot and can pay for everyone , there 's no problem .
but we 're seeing more frequently that the man 's income is n't enough for everyone , " zypries said in an interview with the women 's magazine brigitte .
ideally , she said , both partners would take financial responsibility for themselves after a divorce .
" a man ca n't be expected to support his ex-wife for years , especially if she could go back to work , and as a consequence not have the money to support children from a second marriage , " she said .

he is a member of fathers for justice , who are campaigning for a change in family law in britain .
but jäckel said that those closely involved with the fathers ' rights movement are skeptical that their concerns will be heeded by politicians .
unlike in britain , where the activist group fathers 4 justice has successfully attracted attention to the plight of divorced dads through spectacular stunts , campaigns by similar german groups have " barely registered politically , " jäckel said , adding that ploys aimed at grabbing media attention can make a desperate father 's situation even worse .
" i 've often seen it happen here that fathers who go to the media to publicize their cases are punished by the judges , " she said .
" in the worst case , this can even result in their custody rights being taken away .
the judges ' logic is that dragging a case of unfair treatment into the public eye only damages the child 's rights , and that someone who would do this is a bad father .

but his latest caper - dressing as a nazi at a costume party , tops them all . the photo splashed across the british tabloid the sun shows a lanky prince harry wearing the tan uniform of the nazi 's afrika korps , complete with red and black swastika armband , holding a drink in one hand and a cigarette in the other .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 13.01.2005 indonesia mulls debt moratorium offer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wirayuda with german foreign minister fischer after meeting with german ministers in berlin thursday , indonesian foreign minister wirayuda said jakarta was considering a debt repayment freeze offer amid misgivings that it could damage its economy . indonesian foreign minister hasan wirayuda said his country was mulling the offer of a debt repayment freeze by the paris club of donor nations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we will continue to have discussions on this offer of a debt moratorium , " wirayuda said after a meeting with fischer in berlin on thursday . his remarks come a day after the paris club of creditor nations offered an unconditional freeze on debt repayments for indonesia , the seychelles and sri lanka to help them rebuild their ravaged coastlines after the tsunami that struck on dec .
26 . indonesia , the nation worst-hit by the tidal wave disaster , has an external debt of $ 132 billion -lrb- € 100 billion -rrb- according to the world bank , of which more than $ 70 billion is owed to public creditors or has been guaranteed by public bodies and is eligible for the paris club offer .
indonesia would have to pay more than $ 3 billion in principal payments alone this year - about the same amount it needs to recover from the crisis . german foreign minister joschka fischer said the debt moratorium was " an important step forward " and " an element of aid that can not be underestimated . " doubts linger however , wirayuda admitted that his country still had lingering doubts about taking up the offer . " we do not want that it harms our economy , " he told reporters in berlin .
" we do n't want the market to go wrongly and we do n't want our creditworthiness to be negatively influenced . " in contrast to indonesia , countries such as india , thailand and malaysia have already decided not to accept the freeze on debt repayment for fear they would lose their credit rating on financial markets . indonesia 's fears were echoed by german finance minister hans eichel , who also held talks with wirayuda on thursday . " one must be very prudent as far as the paris club is concerned , " he said and underlined that any debt measures " could put financial credibility in peril .
and that is something they -lrb- indonesia -rrb- do not want .
indonesia is neither in an economic crisis nor a financial crisis and clearly prefers aid to a debt freeze . " complete waiver problematic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paris club chairman jean pierre jouyet the paris club of donors ' decision to suspend the debts of tsunami-hit nations rather than completely waive it has come in for criticism from aid organizations such as oxfam and anti-globalization group attac . but , experts have pointed out that a complete debt waiver could be problematic .
rolf langhammer of the institute for world economics in kiel told deutsche welle that it would n't just damage the credit reputation of the nations , but could also prompt a " chain reaction " with other countries who have also suffered other catastrophes lining up to stake their claim . langhammer also added that it was n't clear whether forgiving debt " would really lead to the money reaching the ones really suffering . " wirayuda plays down troop restrictions on thursday , wirayuda also played down earlier statements by the indonesian government that foreign troops involved in emergency aid operations in the devastated aceh province should not stay longer than three months . the foreign minister stressed that jakarta welcomed the military aid deployments , including germany 's , but added that their presence was a " delicate issue for the indonesian public . " wirayuda said that restrictions on the movement of aid workers in aceh were only for their own safety and denied the rules would hinder international relief operations .
at the same time , he said he was open for the truce offer made by separatist muslim rebels in aceh to the government in jakarta . " there is a silver lining on the horizon , " wirayuda said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers german foreign minister fischer underlined his government 's long-term commitment to help indonesia overcome the devastation wrought by the tsunami disaster and said that german soldiers stationed in aceh with a mobile field hospital and relief supplies ship , would " stay in the region as long as it makes sense and as long as the indonesian government wished .

german politicians seeking to outlaw secret paternity tests won a first battle on wednesday , much to the disappointment of fathers ' rights groups hoping for greater justice in the areas of alimony and child support . the german federal court of justice decided on wednesday that paternity tests carried out in secret are inadmissible as evidence in a lawsuit .
unless the mother gave her consent for the test , the child 's personal rights would be violated , the court in karlsruhe ruled .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lab technician at the " id-labor " in wiesbaden conducts a paternity test .
the decision was welcomed by german justice minister brigitte zypries , who is leading a campaign to make secret paternity tests illegal under a new law regulating the use of genetic data .
" these tests are a serious invasion of the private sphere , " zypries said .
" if a man has doubts about his paternity , he should talk about this with the mother . "
campaigners for fathers ' rights in germany say making secret paternity tests punishable would be yet another blow to men who already get the short end of the stick when it comes to laws regulating alimony , child support , and child custody following a divorce or separation .
" it can not be that , as a woman , i have the right to make my husband pay to support a child that is not his own , or to deny children the right to know who their real father is , " said dr. karin jäckel , an active supporter of the fathers ' rights movement and author of several books on the subject .
" men are , in every respect , held responsible for their children under our laws , which is why they have the right to know who their children are . "
modernizing alimony bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a father walks with his son in a düsseldorf park .
while the battle over paternity tests continues , justice minister zypries has also announced an overhaul of german laws on alimony .
divorced dads are hopeful that the changes will mean more justice for them .
the growing fathers ' rights movement in germany rejects the stereotype of the heartless man who abandons his family for a new relationship .
in reality , they say , the situation is very different .
women file for divorce more frequently than men , and are more often awarded custody of the children .
and in cases where a divorce is contested , fathers frequently become estranged from their children , making it harder for fathers to gain custody rights once the divorce is settled , jäckel said .
despite this emotional strain , fathers are still seen as the familial breadwinner , and can often find themselves burdened for life with child support and alimony payments to ex-wives .
" in cases where the man earns a lot and can pay for everyone , there 's no problem .
but we 're seeing more frequently that the man 's income is n't enough for everyone , " zypries said in an interview with the women 's magazine brigitte .
ideally , she said , both partners would take financial responsibility for themselves after a divorce .
" a man ca n't be expected to support his ex-wife for years , especially if she could go back to work , and as a consequence not have the money to support children from a second marriage , " she said .

he is a member of fathers for justice , who are campaigning for a change in family law in britain .
but jäckel said that those closely involved with the fathers ' rights movement are skeptical that their concerns will be heeded by politicians .
unlike in britain , where the activist group fathers 4 justice has successfully attracted attention to the plight of divorced dads through spectacular stunts , campaigns by similar german groups have " barely registered politically , " jäckel said , adding that ploys aimed at grabbing media attention can make a desperate father 's situation even worse .
" i 've often seen it happen here that fathers who go to the media to publicize their cases are punished by the judges , " she said .
" in the worst case , this can even result in their custody rights being taken away .
the judges ' logic is that dragging a case of unfair treatment into the public eye only damages the child 's rights , and that someone who would do this is a bad father .

they say it is the only way to combat " paternity fraud . "

26 . indonesia , the nation worst-hit by the tidal wave disaster , has an external debt of $ 132 billion -lrb- € 100 billion -rrb- according to the world bank , of which more than $ 70 billion is owed to public creditors or has been guaranteed by public bodies and is eligible for the paris club offer .
indonesia would have to pay more than $ 3 billion in principal payments alone this year - about the same amount it needs to recover from the crisis . german foreign minister joschka fischer said the debt moratorium was " an important step forward " and " an element of aid that can not be underestimated . " doubts linger however , wirayuda admitted that his country still had lingering doubts about taking up the offer . " we do not want that it harms our economy , " he told reporters in berlin .
" we do n't want the market to go wrongly and we do n't want our creditworthiness to be negatively influenced . " in contrast to indonesia , countries such as india , thailand and malaysia have already decided not to accept the freeze on debt repayment for fear they would lose their credit rating on financial markets . indonesia 's fears were echoed by german finance minister hans eichel , who also held talks with wirayuda on thursday . " one must be very prudent as far as the paris club is concerned , " he said and underlined that any debt measures " could put financial credibility in peril .
and that is something they -lrb- indonesia -rrb- do not want .
indonesia is neither in an economic crisis nor a financial crisis and clearly prefers aid to a debt freeze . " complete waiver problematic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paris club chairman jean pierre jouyet the paris club of donors ' decision to suspend the debts of tsunami-hit nations rather than completely waive it has come in for criticism from aid organizations such as oxfam and anti-globalization group attac . but , experts have pointed out that a complete debt waiver could be problematic .
rolf langhammer of the institute for world economics in kiel told deutsche welle that it would n't just damage the credit reputation of the nations , but could also prompt a " chain reaction " with other countries who have also suffered other catastrophes lining up to stake their claim . langhammer also added that it was n't clear whether forgiving debt " would really lead to the money reaching the ones really suffering . " wirayuda plays down troop restrictions on thursday , wirayuda also played down earlier statements by the indonesian government that foreign troops involved in emergency aid operations in the devastated aceh province should not stay longer than three months . the foreign minister stressed that jakarta welcomed the military aid deployments , including germany 's , but added that their presence was a " delicate issue for the indonesian public . " wirayuda said that restrictions on the movement of aid workers in aceh were only for their own safety and denied the rules would hinder international relief operations .
at the same time , he said he was open for the truce offer made by separatist muslim rebels in aceh to the government in jakarta . " there is a silver lining on the horizon , " wirayuda said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers german foreign minister fischer underlined his government 's long-term commitment to help indonesia overcome the devastation wrought by the tsunami disaster and said that german soldiers stationed in aceh with a mobile field hospital and relief supplies ship , would " stay in the region as long as it makes sense and as long as the indonesian government wished .

" there is a list of up to 100 persons in different parliaments , on several levels , on state level , on regional level , being paid by carmaker volkswagen , " resch said .
" for example the mayor of wolfsburg , the city where volkswagen is situated , gets a salary by this company . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw manufacturing factory in wolfsburg volkswagen has also had its hand in watering down recent legislation for higher environmental standards proposed by the green party , which would have required fine particle dust filters in diesel motors . all it took , resch said , was a letter from volkswagen head bernd pischetsrieder to members of parliament . " in this letter pischetsrieder complained that tax incentives for particle filters would harm his company and the car industry in germany and would be bad for the economy , " resch said .
" with this letter he -lrb- pischetsrieder -rrb- was able to stop the entire parliamentary process . " a lobbyist in disguise ? deutsche umwelthilfe 's allegations against german companies come at a time of intense debate in the country about whether politicians should be allowed to hold down a normal job while carrying out their duties as an elected member of parliament or whether that would inevitably lead to a conflict of interests and turn parliamentarians into mere lobbyist for industry . under german law , parliamentarians are indeed allowed to work " on the side " as long as they do not earn more than € 3,000 a month or € 18,000 a year on top of their salaries as a member of parliament . but the system 's critics claim that such a practice could easily give rise to a conflict of interest . " the parliamentarian must not be a lobbyist in disguise , " jochen bäumel of transparency international told news agency afp .
" only by publishing their additional income can the electorate know whose interests they really represent . " companies under pressure spearheaded by mass-selling daily bild , the campaign to publish fat-cat corporate salaries has put pressure on german companies to reveal details of their links with politicians . volkswagen has already announced that it plans to release a list of employees on its books who also hold a political office .
vw ceo pischetsrieder is expected to announce the details on thursday .

many german luxury cars do not meet the new guidelines .
jürgen resch warns that “ made in germany ” may lose its selling power abroad . “ earlier german cars stood for high quality , for security , and for a while , even for high environmental standards , " resch said .
" but , we 're now noticing that even in the united states , more and more cars are not being able to sell , because the emissions are too high .

but his latest caper - dressing as a nazi at a costume party , tops them all . the photo splashed across the british tabloid the sun shows a lanky prince harry wearing the tan uniform of the nazi 's afrika korps , complete with red and black swastika armband , holding a drink in one hand and a cigarette in the other .
and it begs the question : " harry , what were you thinking ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's prince harry the youngest son of the late princess diana and heir-to-the-throne prince charles may be the " wild child " of the british royal family , but surely he knows better ?
and if he does n't , then why did n't one of his minders , or at least big brother william , who attended the " native and colonial " party in a much tamer lion costume , warn the wayward redhead ? harry 's timing could n't be worse .
in just two weeks ' time , his grandmother , queen elizabeth , is due to host a reception for survivors of the holocaust before representing the nation at the holocaust memorial day national event . jewish leaders outraged jewish leaders have already spoken out about the incident .
the simon wiesenthal center , one of the world 's leading jewish human rights organizations , called it " a shameful act … displaying insensitivity " to both holocaust victims and allied soldiers " who gave their lives to defeat nazism . " its founder , rabbi marvin hier , said harry ought to go to auschwitz with his uncle , prince edward , head of the british delegation for the 60th anniversary commemorations . " there he will see the results of the hated symbol he so foolishly and brazenly chose to wear , " hier said . a ' poor choice ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the british tabloid " the sun " splashed a photo from the party over its front page in a statement from clarence house , harry apologized for what he called " a poor choice of costume . "
but there have been calls by british politicians for the prince to appear in person to make his own public apology . " if he wants to be considered an adult , he 's got to behave like an adult , and he has got to apologize in person , through radio and television , " said former royal press spokesman dicky arbiter . others , including rabbi dr. jonathan romain of the reform synagogues of great britain , are prepared to put the incident down to the folly of youth and let the prince 's apology stand . the fact that the palace has issued an apology indicates that this was a mistake by the prince , " romain said .
" but having been given , the apology should now be accepted . " career consequences ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prince harry , youngest son of the prince of wales and grandson of britain 's queen elizabeth ii , took charge of a 48-strong parade of military cadets at eton school tuesday night may 26 2003 , fuelling speculation that he may opt for a military career .
harry , 18 , was appointed commander of eton 's combined cadet force 's formal trooping of the colour ceremony.the prince of wales was among those looking on as his youngest son led the guard of honour 's march out on to college field with their colours at the yearly tattoo , held since òthe corpsó was founded in 1860 .
-lrb- ap photo / pa -rrb- * * united kingdom out magazines out no sales * * the costume choice could prove to have serious consequences for harry , as already , there have been calls to bar him from attending the elite sandhurst military academy later this year .
" i do n't think this young man is suitable for sandhurst , " said doug henderson , a former armed forces minister in prime minister tony blair 's government .
" if it was anyone else , the application would n't be considered .
it should be withdrawn immediately . " in germany , the costume scandal is likely to renew complaints that british perceptions of the country remain skewed by the nazi era .

his opponent , viktor yanukovych , has once again used the courts to put off the transfer of power . stall tactics the inauguration can only take place after the election result is published in one of the two official newspapers , and the ukraine supreme court has barred both papers from printing it until former prime minister viktor yanukovych has a last chance to appeal the outcome in a court of law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yushchenko declaring victory , with ukrainian pop star .
but how soon yanukovych 's latest appeal will finally be filed and decided on is uncertain . yushchenko was finally declared the winner of the ukraine presidential election on jan .
10 , two weeks after the re-run of an earlier election that was declared invalid because of voter fraud .
but yanukovych - who agreed to a new election only after his hand was forced by a massive popular uprising – has managed to hold up the poll result at every turn . currently , yanukovych is appealing the election , claiming it was invalid . ' we will never be satisfied ' “ if the court fails to comply with our demands , we have the right to act within the framework of our legislation , " yanukovych said .
" we ’ ll appeal to the european court of justice .
we will never be satisfied with the result of the so-called third round of the election . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yanukovych leaving voting booth during the repeat election in december all the former prime minister 's previous appeals have been quickly dismissed by the court .
but it can not rule on a complaint until he officially submits it .
and yanukovych ’ s representative in the election commission , nestor shufritch , said he thinks ukraine ’ s weary voters may be called upon yet again to go to the polls . “ if the supreme court does makes a legal rather than a political decision i am personally convinced that , unfortunately , a new election process will be necessary , ” sufritch said . swiss lawyers it is not quite clear what is driving yanukovych in his refusal to cede the election .

" a danger for democracy " - that 's what a leading german social democrat called so-called " green lists " - a conglomeration of environmentalist , peace and anti-nuclear groups - back in 1977 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the greens first leadership at the founding convention on jan .
13 , 1980 just three years later , on jan .
13 , 1980 , some of these " dangerous organizations " joined forces after a long debate about the necessity of founding a new party : " die grünen " or " the greens " were born .
few believed that the party would survive .
debates over the inclusion of left-wing radicals foreshadowed the later power struggles between ecological radicals , the so-called " fundis , " and pragmatic " realos . "
politically , the greens questioned the status quo from the start : calls for an immediate end to the use of nuclear power , the dissolution of nato and an ecologically oriented economy scared away potential voters .
environment first but the greens deserve the biggest credit for putting the protection of the environment at the center of their agenda , according to karl-rudolf korte , a political scientist at the university of duisburg / essen .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the phasing out of nuclear power has been a priority for the greens " this led established parties to take up these topics , " he said , adding that state and federal governments responded by setting up ministries for the environment .
the success became a danger for the greens , however , as others adopted their agenda and made it their own , korte said .
additionally , the party limited itself by imposing a strict political culture .
for many years , elected members of parliament had to give up their seats mid-term to make room for others .
until recently the greens also did not allow party functionaries to hold public office at the same time .
joschka 's sneakers still , german society quickly warmed to the party 's ecologically-oriented politics at the beginning of the 1980s while the big parties still did n't have the subject on their agenda .
because of this , the greens were able to get enough votes to enter local and state parliaments throughout germany , culminating in the first " red-green " coalition government with the social democrats in the central state of hesse in 1985 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer -lrb- right -rrb- taking the oath of office as hesse 's environmental minister on dec .
12 , 1985 that government 's environmental minister - the first in germany - later became the country 's foreign minister .
at the time , though , joschka fischer caused an uproar when he took his oath of office wearing jeans and sneakers .
while successful with voters , the greens began falling apart from the inside as " fundis " and " realos " kept fighting about the future of the party .
the low point was reached with german unification in 1990 : campaigning with the slogan " everyone talks about germany .
we talk about climate , " the greens failed to win over voters and were kicked out of parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the united party 's logo only members of the greens ' eastern german sister party , " bündnis 90 , " or alliance 90 , managed to garner seats .
the two parties finally merged in 1993 and the greens are now officially called " bündnis 90 / die grünen . "
reaching for power a year later , the party , now led by " realos " around joschka fischer , re-entered parliament and reached its high point in 1998 , when the greens became the junior partner in germany 's governing coalition with the social democrats for the first time .
by then , the party had gone through a tremendous process of transformation , reflected in its approval of the participation of german soldiers in the nato-led kosovo mission in 1999 .
fischer can take the credit for the turn-around in the party , according to korte .
" this was probably the biggest challenge for a party that was founded on a pacifist platform , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer -lrb- left -rrb- and german chancellor gerhard schröder together with the social democrats , the greens made a number of difficult decisions in the following years .
they opted for reforms to germany 's tax and social welfare systems and approved other military missions to macedonia and afghanistan .
while social democrats have lost voters in elections since 2002 , the greens managed to hold onto their seats or increase them almost everywhere .
and for years , fischer has led the list of germany 's most popular politicians .
black future ?
but the party 's base remains a distinctly western german one - a fact that does n't surprise danial cohn-bendit -lrb- photo below -rrb- , a prominent green member of the european parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel cohn-bendit " it will take some time for people in eastern germany to realize that economic growth comes with an increased social-ecological responsibility , " he told die welt newspaper .
" it 's a cultural development .
we 're a modern party which requires a modern civil society and the latter 's still emerging in -lrb- eastern germany -rrb- . "
and while the social democrats still seem to be the greens ' natural coalition partner , that could change in the future , according to korte .
on the municipal level , coalitions with the conservative christian democrats already exist - cologne is the most prominent example .
the southwestern state of baden-württemberg is the most likely candidate for a " black-green " coalition , korte said .
maybe it 'll take a bit longer than the next election , however , as it 's taking place near the time when fischer and german chancellor gerhard schröder will fight for re-election on the national level in 2006 . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the green view on german politics foreign minister joschka fischer has been busy campaigning for a permanent seat on the un security council .

12 , 1985 that government 's environmental minister - the first in germany - later became the country 's foreign minister .
at the time , though , joschka fischer caused an uproar when he took his oath of office wearing jeans and sneakers .
while successful with voters , the greens began falling apart from the inside as " fundis " and " realos " kept fighting about the future of the party .
the low point was reached with german unification in 1990 : campaigning with the slogan " everyone talks about germany .
we talk about climate , " the greens failed to win over voters and were kicked out of parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the united party 's logo only members of the greens ' eastern german sister party , " bündnis 90 , " or alliance 90 , managed to garner seats .
the two parties finally merged in 1993 and the greens are now officially called " bündnis 90 / die grünen . "
reaching for power a year later , the party , now led by " realos " around joschka fischer , re-entered parliament and reached its high point in 1998 , when the greens became the junior partner in germany 's governing coalition with the social democrats for the first time .
by then , the party had gone through a tremendous process of transformation , reflected in its approval of the participation of german soldiers in the nato-led kosovo mission in 1999 .
fischer can take the credit for the turn-around in the party , according to korte .
" this was probably the biggest challenge for a party that was founded on a pacifist platform , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer -lrb- left -rrb- and german chancellor gerhard schröder together with the social democrats , the greens made a number of difficult decisions in the following years .
they opted for reforms to germany 's tax and social welfare systems and approved other military missions to macedonia and afghanistan .
while social democrats have lost voters in elections since 2002 , the greens managed to hold onto their seats or increase them almost everywhere .
and for years , fischer has led the list of germany 's most popular politicians .
black future ?
but the party 's base remains a distinctly western german one - a fact that does n't surprise danial cohn-bendit -lrb- photo below -rrb- , a prominent green member of the european parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel cohn-bendit " it will take some time for people in eastern germany to realize that economic growth comes with an increased social-ecological responsibility , " he told die welt newspaper .
" it 's a cultural development .
we 're a modern party which requires a modern civil society and the latter 's still emerging in -lrb- eastern germany -rrb- . "
and while the social democrats still seem to be the greens ' natural coalition partner , that could change in the future , according to korte .
on the municipal level , coalitions with the conservative christian democrats already exist - cologne is the most prominent example .
the southwestern state of baden-württemberg is the most likely candidate for a " black-green " coalition , korte said .
maybe it 'll take a bit longer than the next election , however , as it 's taking place near the time when fischer and german chancellor gerhard schröder will fight for re-election on the national level in 2006 . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the green view on german politics foreign minister joschka fischer has been busy campaigning for a permanent seat on the un security council .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 13.01.2005 car industry accused of " predatory lobbyism " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : links between politicians and industry are coming under scrutiny as debate rages in germany about politicians ' corporate salaries , a green group has accused the german car industry of subverting environmental laws by having prominent politicians on their payrolls . while lobbying to influence governmental policy is standard practice the world over , there is mounting concern in germany that it may be adversely affecting politicians ’ freedom to make the right decisions . this week german environmental group " deutsche umwelthilfe " released a statement charging the german automobile industry with what it calls “ predator lobbyism ” - attacking and killing new regulatory laws from the inside before they have a chance to take effect . it said that with prominent politicians on the payroll of large automotive companies , stricter laws enforcing better emissions filters and lower horsepower motors have no chance in german parliament . companies meddling in parliamentary process ? one way of doing this , said jürgen resch of deutsche umwelthife , was through politician 's pocketbooks .
" there is a list of up to 100 persons in different parliaments , on several levels , on state level , on regional level , being paid by carmaker volkswagen , " resch said .
" for example the mayor of wolfsburg , the city where volkswagen is situated , gets a salary by this company . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw manufacturing factory in wolfsburg volkswagen has also had its hand in watering down recent legislation for higher environmental standards proposed by the green party , which would have required fine particle dust filters in diesel motors . all it took , resch said , was a letter from volkswagen head bernd pischetsrieder to members of parliament . " in this letter pischetsrieder complained that tax incentives for particle filters would harm his company and the car industry in germany and would be bad for the economy , " resch said .
" with this letter he -lrb- pischetsrieder -rrb- was able to stop the entire parliamentary process . " a lobbyist in disguise ? deutsche umwelthilfe 's allegations against german companies come at a time of intense debate in the country about whether politicians should be allowed to hold down a normal job while carrying out their duties as an elected member of parliament or whether that would inevitably lead to a conflict of interests and turn parliamentarians into mere lobbyist for industry . under german law , parliamentarians are indeed allowed to work " on the side " as long as they do not earn more than € 3,000 a month or € 18,000 a year on top of their salaries as a member of parliament . but the system 's critics claim that such a practice could easily give rise to a conflict of interest . " the parliamentarian must not be a lobbyist in disguise , " jochen bäumel of transparency international told news agency afp .
" only by publishing their additional income can the electorate know whose interests they really represent . " companies under pressure spearheaded by mass-selling daily bild , the campaign to publish fat-cat corporate salaries has put pressure on german companies to reveal details of their links with politicians . volkswagen has already announced that it plans to release a list of employees on its books who also hold a political office .
vw ceo pischetsrieder is expected to announce the details on thursday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the rocky road to an eu constitution putting the constitution to the test a referendum for germany after all ? all eu hopes on spain ratifying eu constitution will be a ' tough battle ' europe -pipe- 13.01.2005 eu parliament approves constitution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a small minority of right-wing lawmakers made their protest heard the european parliament has sent an important signal of unity by overwhelmingly endorsing the eu 's proposed new constitution .
now , it is up to the bloc 's 25 member states to ratify the historic treaty . there was a standing ovation in the european parliament in strasbourg as the results of wednesday 's poll were announced : 500 votes in favor to 137 against , with 40 abstentions - a massive show of support for a resolution backing the constitutional treaty . " the result of the vote leaves no room for doubt about the support that this european parliament has expressed for the constitution , " parliament president josep borrell said . while all the mainstream parties in the parliament supported the text , a few dozen right-wing and nationalist lawmakers jeered and waved banners proclaiming " not in my name . " " in the name of the 25 heads of state of the european union who signed the constitution in october , i would like to express my great joy , " retorted luxembourg 's prime minister and current eu president , jean-claude juncker , following the vote . attacks from left and right the new constitution will boost the assembly 's powers , create a long-term president of the european council of eu leaders and an eu foreign minister , as well as streamline decision-making .
but the far left reject it as a global capitalist charter without adequate social protection , while the far right and nationalists have attacked it as a blueprint for a european " superstate " that would give too much power to brussels - views that are far from reality , according to german eu parliamentarian , elmar brock . “ it brings european countries together in order to make them strong enough to survive as democracies in this global environment , " brock said .
" it gives europe not only this efficiency , but also the transparency so that people can check the policy – and also the competence order , which makes sure that the european union can not grow as it wants , but that the competence is given by the member states .
and therefore it ’ s just the opposite of a superstate . ” the constitution still faces a long and bumpy ride .
two countries , lithuania and hungary , have ratified the charter by parliamentary vote so far .
but its fate will be sealed in referendums in countries including france , the netherlands , denmark , the czech republic , poland and above all britain , where approval is far from certain .
a rejection in just one of the countries would be a major blow as it would send the constitution back to the drawing board and start an entire new round of negotiations . juncker has urged national parliaments and eu citizens to support the ratification process , which could take as long as two years . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : the constitution is n't perfect but must do although the eu constitution has plenty of flaws and it still has to be ratified by member states , it reflects a compromise and marks the dawning of a new era , says dw 's bernd riegert .

german politicians seeking to outlaw secret paternity tests won a first battle on wednesday , much to the disappointment of fathers ' rights groups hoping for greater justice in the areas of alimony and child support . the german federal court of justice decided on wednesday that paternity tests carried out in secret are inadmissible as evidence in a lawsuit .
unless the mother gave her consent for the test , the child 's personal rights would be violated , the court in karlsruhe ruled .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lab technician at the " id-labor " in wiesbaden conducts a paternity test .
the decision was welcomed by german justice minister brigitte zypries , who is leading a campaign to make secret paternity tests illegal under a new law regulating the use of genetic data .
" these tests are a serious invasion of the private sphere , " zypries said .
" if a man has doubts about his paternity , he should talk about this with the mother . "
campaigners for fathers ' rights in germany say making secret paternity tests punishable would be yet another blow to men who already get the short end of the stick when it comes to laws regulating alimony , child support , and child custody following a divorce or separation .
" it can not be that , as a woman , i have the right to make my husband pay to support a child that is not his own , or to deny children the right to know who their real father is , " said dr. karin jäckel , an active supporter of the fathers ' rights movement and author of several books on the subject .
" men are , in every respect , held responsible for their children under our laws , which is why they have the right to know who their children are . "

while the battle over paternity tests continues , justice minister zypries has also announced an overhaul of german laws on alimony .
divorced dads are hopeful that the changes will mean more justice for them .
the growing fathers ' rights movement in germany rejects the stereotype of the heartless man who abandons his family for a new relationship .
in reality , they say , the situation is very different .
women file for divorce more frequently than men , and are more often awarded custody of the children .
and in cases where a divorce is contested , fathers frequently become estranged from their children , making it harder for fathers to gain custody rights once the divorce is settled , jäckel said .
despite this emotional strain , fathers are still seen as the familial breadwinner , and can often find themselves burdened for life with child support and alimony payments to ex-wives .
" in cases where the man earns a lot and can pay for everyone , there 's no problem .
but we 're seeing more frequently that the man 's income is n't enough for everyone , " zypries said in an interview with the women 's magazine brigitte .
ideally , she said , both partners would take financial responsibility for themselves after a divorce .
" a man ca n't be expected to support his ex-wife for years , especially if she could go back to work , and as a consequence not have the money to support children from a second marriage , " she said .

but jäckel said that those closely involved with the fathers ' rights movement are skeptical that their concerns will be heeded by politicians .
unlike in britain , where the activist group fathers 4 justice has successfully attracted attention to the plight of divorced dads through spectacular stunts , campaigns by similar german groups have " barely registered politically , " jäckel said , adding that ploys aimed at grabbing media attention can make a desperate father 's situation even worse .
" i 've often seen it happen here that fathers who go to the media to publicize their cases are punished by the judges , " she said .
" in the worst case , this can even result in their custody rights being taken away .
the judges ' logic is that dragging a case of unfair treatment into the public eye only damages the child 's rights , and that someone who would do this is a bad father .

german politicians seeking to outlaw secret paternity tests won a first battle on wednesday , much to the disappointment of fathers ' rights groups hoping for greater justice in the areas of alimony and child support . the german federal court of justice decided on wednesday that paternity tests carried out in secret are inadmissible as evidence in a lawsuit .
unless the mother gave her consent for the test , the child 's personal rights would be violated , the court in karlsruhe ruled .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lab technician at the " id-labor " in wiesbaden conducts a paternity test .
the decision was welcomed by german justice minister brigitte zypries , who is leading a campaign to make secret paternity tests illegal under a new law regulating the use of genetic data .
" these tests are a serious invasion of the private sphere , " zypries said .
" if a man has doubts about his paternity , he should talk about this with the mother . "
campaigners for fathers ' rights in germany say making secret paternity tests punishable would be yet another blow to men who already get the short end of the stick when it comes to laws regulating alimony , child support , and child custody following a divorce or separation .
" it can not be that , as a woman , i have the right to make my husband pay to support a child that is not his own , or to deny children the right to know who their real father is , " said dr. karin jäckel , an active supporter of the fathers ' rights movement and author of several books on the subject .
" men are , in every respect , held responsible for their children under our laws , which is why they have the right to know who their children are . "
modernizing alimony bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a father walks with his son in a düsseldorf park .
while the battle over paternity tests continues , justice minister zypries has also announced an overhaul of german laws on alimony .
divorced dads are hopeful that the changes will mean more justice for them .
the growing fathers ' rights movement in germany rejects the stereotype of the heartless man who abandons his family for a new relationship .
in reality , they say , the situation is very different .
women file for divorce more frequently than men , and are more often awarded custody of the children .
and in cases where a divorce is contested , fathers frequently become estranged from their children , making it harder for fathers to gain custody rights once the divorce is settled , jäckel said .
despite this emotional strain , fathers are still seen as the familial breadwinner , and can often find themselves burdened for life with child support and alimony payments to ex-wives .
" in cases where the man earns a lot and can pay for everyone , there 's no problem .
but we 're seeing more frequently that the man 's income is n't enough for everyone , " zypries said in an interview with the women 's magazine brigitte .
ideally , she said , both partners would take financial responsibility for themselves after a divorce .
" a man ca n't be expected to support his ex-wife for years , especially if she could go back to work , and as a consequence not have the money to support children from a second marriage , " she said .

26 . indonesia , the nation worst-hit by the tidal wave disaster , has an external debt of $ 132 billion -lrb- € 100 billion -rrb- according to the world bank , of which more than $ 70 billion is owed to public creditors or has been guaranteed by public bodies and is eligible for the paris club offer .
indonesia would have to pay more than $ 3 billion in principal payments alone this year - about the same amount it needs to recover from the crisis . german foreign minister joschka fischer said the debt moratorium was " an important step forward " and " an element of aid that can not be underestimated . " doubts linger however , wirayuda admitted that his country still had lingering doubts about taking up the offer . " we do not want that it harms our economy , " he told reporters in berlin .
" we do n't want the market to go wrongly and we do n't want our creditworthiness to be negatively influenced . " in contrast to indonesia , countries such as india , thailand and malaysia have already decided not to accept the freeze on debt repayment for fear they would lose their credit rating on financial markets . indonesia 's fears were echoed by german finance minister hans eichel , who also held talks with wirayuda on thursday . " one must be very prudent as far as the paris club is concerned , " he said and underlined that any debt measures " could put financial credibility in peril .

26 . indonesia , the nation worst-hit by the tidal wave disaster , has an external debt of $ 132 billion -lrb- € 100 billion -rrb- according to the world bank , of which more than $ 70 billion is owed to public creditors or has been guaranteed by public bodies and is eligible for the paris club offer .
indonesia would have to pay more than $ 3 billion in principal payments alone this year - about the same amount it needs to recover from the crisis . german foreign minister joschka fischer said the debt moratorium was " an important step forward " and " an element of aid that can not be underestimated . " doubts linger however , wirayuda admitted that his country still had lingering doubts about taking up the offer . " we do not want that it harms our economy , " he told reporters in berlin .
" we do n't want the market to go wrongly and we do n't want our creditworthiness to be negatively influenced . " in contrast to indonesia , countries such as india , thailand and malaysia have already decided not to accept the freeze on debt repayment for fear they would lose their credit rating on financial markets . indonesia 's fears were echoed by german finance minister hans eichel , who also held talks with wirayuda on thursday . " one must be very prudent as far as the paris club is concerned , " he said and underlined that any debt measures " could put financial credibility in peril .
and that is something they -lrb- indonesia -rrb- do not want .
indonesia is neither in an economic crisis nor a financial crisis and clearly prefers aid to a debt freeze . " complete waiver problematic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paris club chairman jean pierre jouyet the paris club of donors ' decision to suspend the debts of tsunami-hit nations rather than completely waive it has come in for criticism from aid organizations such as oxfam and anti-globalization group attac . but , experts have pointed out that a complete debt waiver could be problematic .
rolf langhammer of the institute for world economics in kiel told deutsche welle that it would n't just damage the credit reputation of the nations , but could also prompt a " chain reaction " with other countries who have also suffered other catastrophes lining up to stake their claim . langhammer also added that it was n't clear whether forgiving debt " would really lead to the money reaching the ones really suffering . " wirayuda plays down troop restrictions on thursday , wirayuda also played down earlier statements by the indonesian government that foreign troops involved in emergency aid operations in the devastated aceh province should not stay longer than three months . the foreign minister stressed that jakarta welcomed the military aid deployments , including germany 's , but added that their presence was a " delicate issue for the indonesian public . " wirayuda said that restrictions on the movement of aid workers in aceh were only for their own safety and denied the rules would hinder international relief operations .
at the same time , he said he was open for the truce offer made by separatist muslim rebels in aceh to the government in jakarta . " there is a silver lining on the horizon , " wirayuda said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers german foreign minister fischer underlined his government 's long-term commitment to help indonesia overcome the devastation wrought by the tsunami disaster and said that german soldiers stationed in aceh with a mobile field hospital and relief supplies ship , would " stay in the region as long as it makes sense and as long as the indonesian government wished .

but his latest caper - dressing as a nazi at a costume party , tops them all . the photo splashed across the british tabloid the sun shows a lanky prince harry wearing the tan uniform of the nazi 's afrika korps , complete with red and black swastika armband , holding a drink in one hand and a cigarette in the other .
and it begs the question : " harry , what were you thinking ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's prince harry the youngest son of the late princess diana and heir-to-the-throne prince charles may be the " wild child " of the british royal family , but surely he knows better ?
and if he does n't , then why did n't one of his minders , or at least big brother william , who attended the " native and colonial " party in a much tamer lion costume , warn the wayward redhead ? harry 's timing could n't be worse .
in just two weeks ' time , his grandmother , queen elizabeth , is due to host a reception for survivors of the holocaust before representing the nation at the holocaust memorial day national event . jewish leaders outraged jewish leaders have already spoken out about the incident .
the simon wiesenthal center , one of the world 's leading jewish human rights organizations , called it " a shameful act … displaying insensitivity " to both holocaust victims and allied soldiers " who gave their lives to defeat nazism . " its founder , rabbi marvin hier , said harry ought to go to auschwitz with his uncle , prince edward , head of the british delegation for the 60th anniversary commemorations . " there he will see the results of the hated symbol he so foolishly and brazenly chose to wear , " hier said . a ' poor choice ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the british tabloid " the sun " splashed a photo from the party over its front page in a statement from clarence house , harry apologized for what he called " a poor choice of costume .

but his latest caper - dressing as a nazi at a costume party , tops them all . the photo splashed across the british tabloid the sun shows a lanky prince harry wearing the tan uniform of the nazi 's afrika korps , complete with red and black swastika armband , holding a drink in one hand and a cigarette in the other .
and it begs the question : " harry , what were you thinking ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's prince harry the youngest son of the late princess diana and heir-to-the-throne prince charles may be the " wild child " of the british royal family , but surely he knows better ?
and if he does n't , then why did n't one of his minders , or at least big brother william , who attended the " native and colonial " party in a much tamer lion costume , warn the wayward redhead ? harry 's timing could n't be worse .
in just two weeks ' time , his grandmother , queen elizabeth , is due to host a reception for survivors of the holocaust before representing the nation at the holocaust memorial day national event . jewish leaders outraged jewish leaders have already spoken out about the incident .
the simon wiesenthal center , one of the world 's leading jewish human rights organizations , called it " a shameful act … displaying insensitivity " to both holocaust victims and allied soldiers " who gave their lives to defeat nazism . " its founder , rabbi marvin hier , said harry ought to go to auschwitz with his uncle , prince edward , head of the british delegation for the 60th anniversary commemorations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 13.01.2005 a silver jubilee for germany 's greens großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : looking ahead to a bright future : claudia roth , the green 's co-chair the german government 's junior coalition partner has come a long way since its birth 25 years ago : the formerly pacifist green party now supports military missions , but the environment still tops its agenda . " a danger for democracy " - that 's what a leading german social democrat called so-called " green lists " - a conglomeration of environmentalist , peace and anti-nuclear groups - back in 1977 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the greens first leadership at the founding convention on jan .
13 , 1980 just three years later , on jan .
13 , 1980 , some of these " dangerous organizations " joined forces after a long debate about the necessity of founding a new party : " die grünen " or " the greens " were born .
few believed that the party would survive .
debates over the inclusion of left-wing radicals foreshadowed the later power struggles between ecological radicals , the so-called " fundis , " and pragmatic " realos . "
politically , the greens questioned the status quo from the start : calls for an immediate end to the use of nuclear power , the dissolution of nato and an ecologically oriented economy scared away potential voters .
environment first but the greens deserve the biggest credit for putting the protection of the environment at the center of their agenda , according to karl-rudolf korte , a political scientist at the university of duisburg / essen .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the phasing out of nuclear power has been a priority for the greens " this led established parties to take up these topics , " he said , adding that state and federal governments responded by setting up ministries for the environment .
the success became a danger for the greens , however , as others adopted their agenda and made it their own , korte said .
additionally , the party limited itself by imposing a strict political culture .
for many years , elected members of parliament had to give up their seats mid-term to make room for others .
until recently the greens also did not allow party functionaries to hold public office at the same time .
joschka 's sneakers still , german society quickly warmed to the party 's ecologically-oriented politics at the beginning of the 1980s while the big parties still did n't have the subject on their agenda .
because of this , the greens were able to get enough votes to enter local and state parliaments throughout germany , culminating in the first " red-green " coalition government with the social democrats in the central state of hesse in 1985 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer -lrb- right -rrb- taking the oath of office as hesse 's environmental minister on dec .
12 , 1985 that government 's environmental minister - the first in germany - later became the country 's foreign minister .
at the time , though , joschka fischer caused an uproar when he took his oath of office wearing jeans and sneakers .
while successful with voters , the greens began falling apart from the inside as " fundis " and " realos " kept fighting about the future of the party .
the low point was reached with german unification in 1990 : campaigning with the slogan " everyone talks about germany .
we talk about climate , " the greens failed to win over voters and were kicked out of parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the united party 's logo only members of the greens ' eastern german sister party , " bündnis 90 , " or alliance 90 , managed to garner seats .
the two parties finally merged in 1993 and the greens are now officially called " bündnis 90 / die grünen . "
reaching for power a year later , the party , now led by " realos " around joschka fischer , re-entered parliament and reached its high point in 1998 , when the greens became the junior partner in germany 's governing coalition with the social democrats for the first time .
by then , the party had gone through a tremendous process of transformation , reflected in its approval of the participation of german soldiers in the nato-led kosovo mission in 1999 .
fischer can take the credit for the turn-around in the party , according to korte .
" this was probably the biggest challenge for a party that was founded on a pacifist platform , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer -lrb- left -rrb- and german chancellor gerhard schröder together with the social democrats , the greens made a number of difficult decisions in the following years .
they opted for reforms to germany 's tax and social welfare systems and approved other military missions to macedonia and afghanistan .
while social democrats have lost voters in elections since 2002 , the greens managed to hold onto their seats or increase them almost everywhere .
and for years , fischer has led the list of germany 's most popular politicians .
black future ?
but the party 's base remains a distinctly western german one - a fact that does n't surprise danial cohn-bendit -lrb- photo below -rrb- , a prominent green member of the european parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel cohn-bendit " it will take some time for people in eastern germany to realize that economic growth comes with an increased social-ecological responsibility , " he told die welt newspaper .
" it 's a cultural development .

and while the social democrats still seem to be the greens ' natural coalition partner , that could change in the future , according to korte .
on the municipal level , coalitions with the conservative christian democrats already exist - cologne is the most prominent example .
the southwestern state of baden-württemberg is the most likely candidate for a " black-green " coalition , korte said .

" a danger for democracy " - that 's what a leading german social democrat called so-called " green lists " - a conglomeration of environmentalist , peace and anti-nuclear groups - back in 1977 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the greens first leadership at the founding convention on jan .
13 , 1980 just three years later , on jan .
13 , 1980 , some of these " dangerous organizations " joined forces after a long debate about the necessity of founding a new party : " die grünen " or " the greens " were born .
few believed that the party would survive .
debates over the inclusion of left-wing radicals foreshadowed the later power struggles between ecological radicals , the so-called " fundis , " and pragmatic " realos . "
politically , the greens questioned the status quo from the start : calls for an immediate end to the use of nuclear power , the dissolution of nato and an ecologically oriented economy scared away potential voters .
environment first but the greens deserve the biggest credit for putting the protection of the environment at the center of their agenda , according to karl-rudolf korte , a political scientist at the university of duisburg / essen .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the phasing out of nuclear power has been a priority for the greens " this led established parties to take up these topics , " he said , adding that state and federal governments responded by setting up ministries for the environment .
the success became a danger for the greens , however , as others adopted their agenda and made it their own , korte said .
additionally , the party limited itself by imposing a strict political culture .
for many years , elected members of parliament had to give up their seats mid-term to make room for others .
until recently the greens also did not allow party functionaries to hold public office at the same time .
joschka 's sneakers still , german society quickly warmed to the party 's ecologically-oriented politics at the beginning of the 1980s while the big parties still did n't have the subject on their agenda .
because of this , the greens were able to get enough votes to enter local and state parliaments throughout germany , culminating in the first " red-green " coalition government with the social democrats in the central state of hesse in 1985 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer -lrb- right -rrb- taking the oath of office as hesse 's environmental minister on dec .
12 , 1985 that government 's environmental minister - the first in germany - later became the country 's foreign minister .
at the time , though , joschka fischer caused an uproar when he took his oath of office wearing jeans and sneakers .
while successful with voters , the greens began falling apart from the inside as " fundis " and " realos " kept fighting about the future of the party .
the low point was reached with german unification in 1990 : campaigning with the slogan " everyone talks about germany .
we talk about climate , " the greens failed to win over voters and were kicked out of parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the united party 's logo only members of the greens ' eastern german sister party , " bündnis 90 , " or alliance 90 , managed to garner seats .
the two parties finally merged in 1993 and the greens are now officially called " bündnis 90 / die grünen . "
reaching for power a year later , the party , now led by " realos " around joschka fischer , re-entered parliament and reached its high point in 1998 , when the greens became the junior partner in germany 's governing coalition with the social democrats for the first time .
by then , the party had gone through a tremendous process of transformation , reflected in its approval of the participation of german soldiers in the nato-led kosovo mission in 1999 .
fischer can take the credit for the turn-around in the party , according to korte .
" this was probably the biggest challenge for a party that was founded on a pacifist platform , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer -lrb- left -rrb- and german chancellor gerhard schröder together with the social democrats , the greens made a number of difficult decisions in the following years .
they opted for reforms to germany 's tax and social welfare systems and approved other military missions to macedonia and afghanistan .
while social democrats have lost voters in elections since 2002 , the greens managed to hold onto their seats or increase them almost everywhere .
and for years , fischer has led the list of germany 's most popular politicians .
black future ?
but the party 's base remains a distinctly western german one - a fact that does n't surprise danial cohn-bendit -lrb- photo below -rrb- , a prominent green member of the european parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel cohn-bendit " it will take some time for people in eastern germany to realize that economic growth comes with an increased social-ecological responsibility , " he told die welt newspaper .
" it 's a cultural development .
we 're a modern party which requires a modern civil society and the latter 's still emerging in -lrb- eastern germany -rrb- . "
and while the social democrats still seem to be the greens ' natural coalition partner , that could change in the future , according to korte .
on the municipal level , coalitions with the conservative christian democrats already exist - cologne is the most prominent example .
the southwestern state of baden-württemberg is the most likely candidate for a " black-green " coalition , korte said .

german politicians seeking to outlaw secret paternity tests won a first battle on wednesday , much to the disappointment of fathers ' rights groups hoping for greater justice in the areas of alimony and child support . the german federal court of justice decided on wednesday that paternity tests carried out in secret are inadmissible as evidence in a lawsuit .
unless the mother gave her consent for the test , the child 's personal rights would be violated , the court in karlsruhe ruled .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lab technician at the " id-labor " in wiesbaden conducts a paternity test .
the decision was welcomed by german justice minister brigitte zypries , who is leading a campaign to make secret paternity tests illegal under a new law regulating the use of genetic data .
" these tests are a serious invasion of the private sphere , " zypries said .
" if a man has doubts about his paternity , he should talk about this with the mother . "
campaigners for fathers ' rights in germany say making secret paternity tests punishable would be yet another blow to men who already get the short end of the stick when it comes to laws regulating alimony , child support , and child custody following a divorce or separation .
" it can not be that , as a woman , i have the right to make my husband pay to support a child that is not his own , or to deny children the right to know who their real father is , " said dr. karin jäckel , an active supporter of the fathers ' rights movement and author of several books on the subject .
" men are , in every respect , held responsible for their children under our laws , which is why they have the right to know who their children are . "

while the battle over paternity tests continues , justice minister zypries has also announced an overhaul of german laws on alimony .
divorced dads are hopeful that the changes will mean more justice for them .
the growing fathers ' rights movement in germany rejects the stereotype of the heartless man who abandons his family for a new relationship .
in reality , they say , the situation is very different .
women file for divorce more frequently than men , and are more often awarded custody of the children .
and in cases where a divorce is contested , fathers frequently become estranged from their children , making it harder for fathers to gain custody rights once the divorce is settled , jäckel said .
despite this emotional strain , fathers are still seen as the familial breadwinner , and can often find themselves burdened for life with child support and alimony payments to ex-wives .
" in cases where the man earns a lot and can pay for everyone , there 's no problem .
but we 're seeing more frequently that the man 's income is n't enough for everyone , " zypries said in an interview with the women 's magazine brigitte .
ideally , she said , both partners would take financial responsibility for themselves after a divorce .
" a man ca n't be expected to support his ex-wife for years , especially if she could go back to work , and as a consequence not have the money to support children from a second marriage , " she said .

unlike in britain , where the activist group fathers 4 justice has successfully attracted attention to the plight of divorced dads through spectacular stunts , campaigns by similar german groups have " barely registered politically , " jäckel said , adding that ploys aimed at grabbing media attention can make a desperate father 's situation even worse .
" i 've often seen it happen here that fathers who go to the media to publicize their cases are punished by the judges , " she said .
" in the worst case , this can even result in their custody rights being taken away .
the judges ' logic is that dragging a case of unfair treatment into the public eye only damages the child 's rights , and that someone who would do this is a bad father .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 13.01.2005 indonesia mulls debt moratorium offer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wirayuda with german foreign minister fischer after meeting with german ministers in berlin thursday , indonesian foreign minister wirayuda said jakarta was considering a debt repayment freeze offer amid misgivings that it could damage its economy . indonesian foreign minister hasan wirayuda said his country was mulling the offer of a debt repayment freeze by the paris club of donor nations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we will continue to have discussions on this offer of a debt moratorium , " wirayuda said after a meeting with fischer in berlin on thursday . his remarks come a day after the paris club of creditor nations offered an unconditional freeze on debt repayments for indonesia , the seychelles and sri lanka to help them rebuild their ravaged coastlines after the tsunami that struck on dec .
26 . indonesia , the nation worst-hit by the tidal wave disaster , has an external debt of $ 132 billion -lrb- € 100 billion -rrb- according to the world bank , of which more than $ 70 billion is owed to public creditors or has been guaranteed by public bodies and is eligible for the paris club offer .
indonesia would have to pay more than $ 3 billion in principal payments alone this year - about the same amount it needs to recover from the crisis . german foreign minister joschka fischer said the debt moratorium was " an important step forward " and " an element of aid that can not be underestimated . " doubts linger however , wirayuda admitted that his country still had lingering doubts about taking up the offer . " we do not want that it harms our economy , " he told reporters in berlin .
" we do n't want the market to go wrongly and we do n't want our creditworthiness to be negatively influenced . " in contrast to indonesia , countries such as india , thailand and malaysia have already decided not to accept the freeze on debt repayment for fear they would lose their credit rating on financial markets . indonesia 's fears were echoed by german finance minister hans eichel , who also held talks with wirayuda on thursday . " one must be very prudent as far as the paris club is concerned , " he said and underlined that any debt measures " could put financial credibility in peril .
and that is something they -lrb- indonesia -rrb- do not want .
indonesia is neither in an economic crisis nor a financial crisis and clearly prefers aid to a debt freeze . " complete waiver problematic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paris club chairman jean pierre jouyet the paris club of donors ' decision to suspend the debts of tsunami-hit nations rather than completely waive it has come in for criticism from aid organizations such as oxfam and anti-globalization group attac . but , experts have pointed out that a complete debt waiver could be problematic .
rolf langhammer of the institute for world economics in kiel told deutsche welle that it would n't just damage the credit reputation of the nations , but could also prompt a " chain reaction " with other countries who have also suffered other catastrophes lining up to stake their claim . langhammer also added that it was n't clear whether forgiving debt " would really lead to the money reaching the ones really suffering . " wirayuda plays down troop restrictions on thursday , wirayuda also played down earlier statements by the indonesian government that foreign troops involved in emergency aid operations in the devastated aceh province should not stay longer than three months . the foreign minister stressed that jakarta welcomed the military aid deployments , including germany 's , but added that their presence was a " delicate issue for the indonesian public . " wirayuda said that restrictions on the movement of aid workers in aceh were only for their own safety and denied the rules would hinder international relief operations .
at the same time , he said he was open for the truce offer made by separatist muslim rebels in aceh to the government in jakarta . " there is a silver lining on the horizon , " wirayuda said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers german foreign minister fischer underlined his government 's long-term commitment to help indonesia overcome the devastation wrought by the tsunami disaster and said that german soldiers stationed in aceh with a mobile field hospital and relief supplies ship , would " stay in the region as long as it makes sense and as long as the indonesian government wished .

26 . indonesia , the nation worst-hit by the tidal wave disaster , has an external debt of $ 132 billion -lrb- € 100 billion -rrb- according to the world bank , of which more than $ 70 billion is owed to public creditors or has been guaranteed by public bodies and is eligible for the paris club offer .
indonesia would have to pay more than $ 3 billion in principal payments alone this year - about the same amount it needs to recover from the crisis . german foreign minister joschka fischer said the debt moratorium was " an important step forward " and " an element of aid that can not be underestimated . " doubts linger however , wirayuda admitted that his country still had lingering doubts about taking up the offer . " we do not want that it harms our economy , " he told reporters in berlin .
" we do n't want the market to go wrongly and we do n't want our creditworthiness to be negatively influenced . " in contrast to indonesia , countries such as india , thailand and malaysia have already decided not to accept the freeze on debt repayment for fear they would lose their credit rating on financial markets . indonesia 's fears were echoed by german finance minister hans eichel , who also held talks with wirayuda on thursday . " one must be very prudent as far as the paris club is concerned , " he said and underlined that any debt measures " could put financial credibility in peril .

rolf langhammer of the institute for world economics in kiel told deutsche welle that it would n't just damage the credit reputation of the nations , but could also prompt a " chain reaction " with other countries who have also suffered other catastrophes lining up to stake their claim . langhammer also added that it was n't clear whether forgiving debt " would really lead to the money reaching the ones really suffering . " wirayuda plays down troop restrictions on thursday , wirayuda also played down earlier statements by the indonesian government that foreign troops involved in emergency aid operations in the devastated aceh province should not stay longer than three months . the foreign minister stressed that jakarta welcomed the military aid deployments , including germany 's , but added that their presence was a " delicate issue for the indonesian public . " wirayuda said that restrictions on the movement of aid workers in aceh were only for their own safety and denied the rules would hinder international relief operations .
at the same time , he said he was open for the truce offer made by separatist muslim rebels in aceh to the government in jakarta .

berlin hails ukrainian decision ; russia slams west yushchenko poisoned , doctors say court orders new ukrainian election europe -pipe- 13.01.2005 appeal delays inauguration in ukraine großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yushchenko still has to wait to accept toasts to his presidency with the tables turned in the ukraine presidential race and opposition candidate yuschenko waiting to take the oath of office , defeated candidate yanukovych is pulling out the delaying tactics . hopes that the long-awaited inauguration of viktor yushchenko would be staged this week have again been dashed .
his opponent , viktor yanukovych , has once again used the courts to put off the transfer of power . stall tactics the inauguration can only take place after the election result is published in one of the two official newspapers , and the ukraine supreme court has barred both papers from printing it until former prime minister viktor yanukovych has a last chance to appeal the outcome in a court of law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yushchenko declaring victory , with ukrainian pop star .
but how soon yanukovych 's latest appeal will finally be filed and decided on is uncertain . yushchenko was finally declared the winner of the ukraine presidential election on jan .
10 , two weeks after the re-run of an earlier election that was declared invalid because of voter fraud .
but yanukovych - who agreed to a new election only after his hand was forced by a massive popular uprising – has managed to hold up the poll result at every turn . currently , yanukovych is appealing the election , claiming it was invalid . ' we will never be satisfied ' “ if the court fails to comply with our demands , we have the right to act within the framework of our legislation , " yanukovych said .
" we ’ ll appeal to the european court of justice .
we will never be satisfied with the result of the so-called third round of the election . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yanukovych leaving voting booth during the repeat election in december all the former prime minister 's previous appeals have been quickly dismissed by the court .
but it can not rule on a complaint until he officially submits it .

german politicians seeking to outlaw secret paternity tests won a first battle on wednesday , much to the disappointment of fathers ' rights groups hoping for greater justice in the areas of alimony and child support . the german federal court of justice decided on wednesday that paternity tests carried out in secret are inadmissible as evidence in a lawsuit .
unless the mother gave her consent for the test , the child 's personal rights would be violated , the court in karlsruhe ruled .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lab technician at the " id-labor " in wiesbaden conducts a paternity test .
the decision was welcomed by german justice minister brigitte zypries , who is leading a campaign to make secret paternity tests illegal under a new law regulating the use of genetic data .
" these tests are a serious invasion of the private sphere , " zypries said .
" if a man has doubts about his paternity , he should talk about this with the mother . "
campaigners for fathers ' rights in germany say making secret paternity tests punishable would be yet another blow to men who already get the short end of the stick when it comes to laws regulating alimony , child support , and child custody following a divorce or separation .
" it can not be that , as a woman , i have the right to make my husband pay to support a child that is not his own , or to deny children the right to know who their real father is , " said dr. karin jäckel , an active supporter of the fathers ' rights movement and author of several books on the subject .
" men are , in every respect , held responsible for their children under our laws , which is why they have the right to know who their children are . "
modernizing alimony bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a father walks with his son in a düsseldorf park .
while the battle over paternity tests continues , justice minister zypries has also announced an overhaul of german laws on alimony .
divorced dads are hopeful that the changes will mean more justice for them .
the growing fathers ' rights movement in germany rejects the stereotype of the heartless man who abandons his family for a new relationship .
in reality , they say , the situation is very different .
women file for divorce more frequently than men , and are more often awarded custody of the children .
and in cases where a divorce is contested , fathers frequently become estranged from their children , making it harder for fathers to gain custody rights once the divorce is settled , jäckel said .
despite this emotional strain , fathers are still seen as the familial breadwinner , and can often find themselves burdened for life with child support and alimony payments to ex-wives .
" in cases where the man earns a lot and can pay for everyone , there 's no problem .
but we 're seeing more frequently that the man 's income is n't enough for everyone , " zypries said in an interview with the women 's magazine brigitte .
ideally , she said , both partners would take financial responsibility for themselves after a divorce .
" a man ca n't be expected to support his ex-wife for years , especially if she could go back to work , and as a consequence not have the money to support children from a second marriage , " she said .

he is a member of fathers for justice , who are campaigning for a change in family law in britain .
but jäckel said that those closely involved with the fathers ' rights movement are skeptical that their concerns will be heeded by politicians .
unlike in britain , where the activist group fathers 4 justice has successfully attracted attention to the plight of divorced dads through spectacular stunts , campaigns by similar german groups have " barely registered politically , " jäckel said , adding that ploys aimed at grabbing media attention can make a desperate father 's situation even worse .
" i 've often seen it happen here that fathers who go to the media to publicize their cases are punished by the judges , " she said .
" in the worst case , this can even result in their custody rights being taken away .
the judges ' logic is that dragging a case of unfair treatment into the public eye only damages the child 's rights , and that someone who would do this is a bad father .

german politicians seeking to outlaw secret paternity tests won a first battle on wednesday , much to the disappointment of fathers ' rights groups hoping for greater justice in the areas of alimony and child support . the german federal court of justice decided on wednesday that paternity tests carried out in secret are inadmissible as evidence in a lawsuit .
unless the mother gave her consent for the test , the child 's personal rights would be violated , the court in karlsruhe ruled .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lab technician at the " id-labor " in wiesbaden conducts a paternity test .
the decision was welcomed by german justice minister brigitte zypries , who is leading a campaign to make secret paternity tests illegal under a new law regulating the use of genetic data .
" these tests are a serious invasion of the private sphere , " zypries said .
" if a man has doubts about his paternity , he should talk about this with the mother . "
campaigners for fathers ' rights in germany say making secret paternity tests punishable would be yet another blow to men who already get the short end of the stick when it comes to laws regulating alimony , child support , and child custody following a divorce or separation .
" it can not be that , as a woman , i have the right to make my husband pay to support a child that is not his own , or to deny children the right to know who their real father is , " said dr. karin jäckel , an active supporter of the fathers ' rights movement and author of several books on the subject .
" men are , in every respect , held responsible for their children under our laws , which is why they have the right to know who their children are . "
modernizing alimony bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a father walks with his son in a düsseldorf park .
while the battle over paternity tests continues , justice minister zypries has also announced an overhaul of german laws on alimony .
divorced dads are hopeful that the changes will mean more justice for them .
the growing fathers ' rights movement in germany rejects the stereotype of the heartless man who abandons his family for a new relationship .
in reality , they say , the situation is very different .
women file for divorce more frequently than men , and are more often awarded custody of the children .
and in cases where a divorce is contested , fathers frequently become estranged from their children , making it harder for fathers to gain custody rights once the divorce is settled , jäckel said .
despite this emotional strain , fathers are still seen as the familial breadwinner , and can often find themselves burdened for life with child support and alimony payments to ex-wives .
" in cases where the man earns a lot and can pay for everyone , there 's no problem .
but we 're seeing more frequently that the man 's income is n't enough for everyone , " zypries said in an interview with the women 's magazine brigitte .
ideally , she said , both partners would take financial responsibility for themselves after a divorce .
" a man ca n't be expected to support his ex-wife for years , especially if she could go back to work , and as a consequence not have the money to support children from a second marriage , " she said .

he is a member of fathers for justice , who are campaigning for a change in family law in britain .
but jäckel said that those closely involved with the fathers ' rights movement are skeptical that their concerns will be heeded by politicians .
unlike in britain , where the activist group fathers 4 justice has successfully attracted attention to the plight of divorced dads through spectacular stunts , campaigns by similar german groups have " barely registered politically , " jäckel said , adding that ploys aimed at grabbing media attention can make a desperate father 's situation even worse .
" i 've often seen it happen here that fathers who go to the media to publicize their cases are punished by the judges , " she said .
" in the worst case , this can even result in their custody rights being taken away .
the judges ' logic is that dragging a case of unfair treatment into the public eye only damages the child 's rights , and that someone who would do this is a bad father .

german politicians seeking to outlaw secret paternity tests won a first battle on wednesday , much to the disappointment of fathers ' rights groups hoping for greater justice in the areas of alimony and child support . the german federal court of justice decided on wednesday that paternity tests carried out in secret are inadmissible as evidence in a lawsuit .
unless the mother gave her consent for the test , the child 's personal rights would be violated , the court in karlsruhe ruled .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lab technician at the " id-labor " in wiesbaden conducts a paternity test .
the decision was welcomed by german justice minister brigitte zypries , who is leading a campaign to make secret paternity tests illegal under a new law regulating the use of genetic data .
" these tests are a serious invasion of the private sphere , " zypries said .
" if a man has doubts about his paternity , he should talk about this with the mother . "
campaigners for fathers ' rights in germany say making secret paternity tests punishable would be yet another blow to men who already get the short end of the stick when it comes to laws regulating alimony , child support , and child custody following a divorce or separation .
" it can not be that , as a woman , i have the right to make my husband pay to support a child that is not his own , or to deny children the right to know who their real father is , " said dr. karin jäckel , an active supporter of the fathers ' rights movement and author of several books on the subject .
" men are , in every respect , held responsible for their children under our laws , which is why they have the right to know who their children are . "

while the battle over paternity tests continues , justice minister zypries has also announced an overhaul of german laws on alimony .

" a danger for democracy " - that 's what a leading german social democrat called so-called " green lists " - a conglomeration of environmentalist , peace and anti-nuclear groups - back in 1977 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the greens first leadership at the founding convention on jan .
13 , 1980 just three years later , on jan .
13 , 1980 , some of these " dangerous organizations " joined forces after a long debate about the necessity of founding a new party : " die grünen " or " the greens " were born .
few believed that the party would survive .
debates over the inclusion of left-wing radicals foreshadowed the later power struggles between ecological radicals , the so-called " fundis , " and pragmatic " realos . "
politically , the greens questioned the status quo from the start : calls for an immediate end to the use of nuclear power , the dissolution of nato and an ecologically oriented economy scared away potential voters .
environment first but the greens deserve the biggest credit for putting the protection of the environment at the center of their agenda , according to karl-rudolf korte , a political scientist at the university of duisburg / essen .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the phasing out of nuclear power has been a priority for the greens " this led established parties to take up these topics , " he said , adding that state and federal governments responded by setting up ministries for the environment .
the success became a danger for the greens , however , as others adopted their agenda and made it their own , korte said .
additionally , the party limited itself by imposing a strict political culture .
for many years , elected members of parliament had to give up their seats mid-term to make room for others .
until recently the greens also did not allow party functionaries to hold public office at the same time .
joschka 's sneakers still , german society quickly warmed to the party 's ecologically-oriented politics at the beginning of the 1980s while the big parties still did n't have the subject on their agenda .
because of this , the greens were able to get enough votes to enter local and state parliaments throughout germany , culminating in the first " red-green " coalition government with the social democrats in the central state of hesse in 1985 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer -lrb- right -rrb- taking the oath of office as hesse 's environmental minister on dec .
12 , 1985 that government 's environmental minister - the first in germany - later became the country 's foreign minister .
at the time , though , joschka fischer caused an uproar when he took his oath of office wearing jeans and sneakers .
while successful with voters , the greens began falling apart from the inside as " fundis " and " realos " kept fighting about the future of the party .
the low point was reached with german unification in 1990 : campaigning with the slogan " everyone talks about germany .
we talk about climate , " the greens failed to win over voters and were kicked out of parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the united party 's logo only members of the greens ' eastern german sister party , " bündnis 90 , " or alliance 90 , managed to garner seats .
the two parties finally merged in 1993 and the greens are now officially called " bündnis 90 / die grünen . "
reaching for power a year later , the party , now led by " realos " around joschka fischer , re-entered parliament and reached its high point in 1998 , when the greens became the junior partner in germany 's governing coalition with the social democrats for the first time .
by then , the party had gone through a tremendous process of transformation , reflected in its approval of the participation of german soldiers in the nato-led kosovo mission in 1999 .
fischer can take the credit for the turn-around in the party , according to korte .
" this was probably the biggest challenge for a party that was founded on a pacifist platform , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer -lrb- left -rrb- and german chancellor gerhard schröder together with the social democrats , the greens made a number of difficult decisions in the following years .
they opted for reforms to germany 's tax and social welfare systems and approved other military missions to macedonia and afghanistan .
while social democrats have lost voters in elections since 2002 , the greens managed to hold onto their seats or increase them almost everywhere .
and for years , fischer has led the list of germany 's most popular politicians .

" a danger for democracy " - that 's what a leading german social democrat called so-called " green lists " - a conglomeration of environmentalist , peace and anti-nuclear groups - back in 1977 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the greens first leadership at the founding convention on jan .
13 , 1980 just three years later , on jan .
13 , 1980 , some of these " dangerous organizations " joined forces after a long debate about the necessity of founding a new party : " die grünen " or " the greens " were born .
few believed that the party would survive .
debates over the inclusion of left-wing radicals foreshadowed the later power struggles between ecological radicals , the so-called " fundis , " and pragmatic " realos . "
politically , the greens questioned the status quo from the start : calls for an immediate end to the use of nuclear power , the dissolution of nato and an ecologically oriented economy scared away potential voters .
environment first but the greens deserve the biggest credit for putting the protection of the environment at the center of their agenda , according to karl-rudolf korte , a political scientist at the university of duisburg / essen .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the phasing out of nuclear power has been a priority for the greens " this led established parties to take up these topics , " he said , adding that state and federal governments responded by setting up ministries for the environment .
the success became a danger for the greens , however , as others adopted their agenda and made it their own , korte said .
additionally , the party limited itself by imposing a strict political culture .
for many years , elected members of parliament had to give up their seats mid-term to make room for others .
until recently the greens also did not allow party functionaries to hold public office at the same time .
joschka 's sneakers still , german society quickly warmed to the party 's ecologically-oriented politics at the beginning of the 1980s while the big parties still did n't have the subject on their agenda .
because of this , the greens were able to get enough votes to enter local and state parliaments throughout germany , culminating in the first " red-green " coalition government with the social democrats in the central state of hesse in 1985 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer -lrb- right -rrb- taking the oath of office as hesse 's environmental minister on dec .
12 , 1985 that government 's environmental minister - the first in germany - later became the country 's foreign minister .
at the time , though , joschka fischer caused an uproar when he took his oath of office wearing jeans and sneakers .
while successful with voters , the greens began falling apart from the inside as " fundis " and " realos " kept fighting about the future of the party .
the low point was reached with german unification in 1990 : campaigning with the slogan " everyone talks about germany .
we talk about climate , " the greens failed to win over voters and were kicked out of parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the united party 's logo only members of the greens ' eastern german sister party , " bündnis 90 , " or alliance 90 , managed to garner seats .
the two parties finally merged in 1993 and the greens are now officially called " bündnis 90 / die grünen . "
reaching for power a year later , the party , now led by " realos " around joschka fischer , re-entered parliament and reached its high point in 1998 , when the greens became the junior partner in germany 's governing coalition with the social democrats for the first time .
by then , the party had gone through a tremendous process of transformation , reflected in its approval of the participation of german soldiers in the nato-led kosovo mission in 1999 .
fischer can take the credit for the turn-around in the party , according to korte .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the greens first leadership at the founding convention on jan .
13 , 1980 just three years later , on jan .
13 , 1980 , some of these " dangerous organizations " joined forces after a long debate about the necessity of founding a new party : " die grünen " or " the greens " were born .
few believed that the party would survive .
debates over the inclusion of left-wing radicals foreshadowed the later power struggles between ecological radicals , the so-called " fundis , " and pragmatic " realos . "
politically , the greens questioned the status quo from the start : calls for an immediate end to the use of nuclear power , the dissolution of nato and an ecologically oriented economy scared away potential voters .
environment first but the greens deserve the biggest credit for putting the protection of the environment at the center of their agenda , according to karl-rudolf korte , a political scientist at the university of duisburg / essen .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the phasing out of nuclear power has been a priority for the greens " this led established parties to take up these topics , " he said , adding that state and federal governments responded by setting up ministries for the environment .
the success became a danger for the greens , however , as others adopted their agenda and made it their own , korte said .
additionally , the party limited itself by imposing a strict political culture .
for many years , elected members of parliament had to give up their seats mid-term to make room for others .
until recently the greens also did not allow party functionaries to hold public office at the same time .
joschka 's sneakers still , german society quickly warmed to the party 's ecologically-oriented politics at the beginning of the 1980s while the big parties still did n't have the subject on their agenda .
because of this , the greens were able to get enough votes to enter local and state parliaments throughout germany , culminating in the first " red-green " coalition government with the social democrats in the central state of hesse in 1985 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer -lrb- right -rrb- taking the oath of office as hesse 's environmental minister on dec .
12 , 1985 that government 's environmental minister - the first in germany - later became the country 's foreign minister .
at the time , though , joschka fischer caused an uproar when he took his oath of office wearing jeans and sneakers .
while successful with voters , the greens began falling apart from the inside as " fundis " and " realos " kept fighting about the future of the party .
the low point was reached with german unification in 1990 : campaigning with the slogan " everyone talks about germany .
we talk about climate , " the greens failed to win over voters and were kicked out of parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the united party 's logo only members of the greens ' eastern german sister party , " bündnis 90 , " or alliance 90 , managed to garner seats .
the two parties finally merged in 1993 and the greens are now officially called " bündnis 90 / die grünen . "
reaching for power a year later , the party , now led by " realos " around joschka fischer , re-entered parliament and reached its high point in 1998 , when the greens became the junior partner in germany 's governing coalition with the social democrats for the first time .
by then , the party had gone through a tremendous process of transformation , reflected in its approval of the participation of german soldiers in the nato-led kosovo mission in 1999 .
fischer can take the credit for the turn-around in the party , according to korte .
" this was probably the biggest challenge for a party that was founded on a pacifist platform , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer -lrb- left -rrb- and german chancellor gerhard schröder together with the social democrats , the greens made a number of difficult decisions in the following years .
they opted for reforms to germany 's tax and social welfare systems and approved other military missions to macedonia and afghanistan .
while social democrats have lost voters in elections since 2002 , the greens managed to hold onto their seats or increase them almost everywhere .
and for years , fischer has led the list of germany 's most popular politicians .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the rocky road to an eu constitution putting the constitution to the test a referendum for germany after all ? all eu hopes on spain ratifying eu constitution will be a ' tough battle ' europe -pipe- 13.01.2005 eu parliament approves constitution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a small minority of right-wing lawmakers made their protest heard the european parliament has sent an important signal of unity by overwhelmingly endorsing the eu 's proposed new constitution .
now , it is up to the bloc 's 25 member states to ratify the historic treaty . there was a standing ovation in the european parliament in strasbourg as the results of wednesday 's poll were announced : 500 votes in favor to 137 against , with 40 abstentions - a massive show of support for a resolution backing the constitutional treaty . " the result of the vote leaves no room for doubt about the support that this european parliament has expressed for the constitution , " parliament president josep borrell said . while all the mainstream parties in the parliament supported the text , a few dozen right-wing and nationalist lawmakers jeered and waved banners proclaiming " not in my name . " " in the name of the 25 heads of state of the european union who signed the constitution in october , i would like to express my great joy , " retorted luxembourg 's prime minister and current eu president , jean-claude juncker , following the vote . attacks from left and right the new constitution will boost the assembly 's powers , create a long-term president of the european council of eu leaders and an eu foreign minister , as well as streamline decision-making .
but the far left reject it as a global capitalist charter without adequate social protection , while the far right and nationalists have attacked it as a blueprint for a european " superstate " that would give too much power to brussels - views that are far from reality , according to german eu parliamentarian , elmar brock . “ it brings european countries together in order to make them strong enough to survive as democracies in this global environment , " brock said .
" it gives europe not only this efficiency , but also the transparency so that people can check the policy – and also the competence order , which makes sure that the european union can not grow as it wants , but that the competence is given by the member states .
and therefore it ’ s just the opposite of a superstate . ” the constitution still faces a long and bumpy ride .
two countries , lithuania and hungary , have ratified the charter by parliamentary vote so far .
but its fate will be sealed in referendums in countries including france , the netherlands , denmark , the czech republic , poland and above all britain , where approval is far from certain .
a rejection in just one of the countries would be a major blow as it would send the constitution back to the drawing board and start an entire new round of negotiations . juncker has urged national parliaments and eu citizens to support the ratification process , which could take as long as two years . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : the constitution is n't perfect but must do although the eu constitution has plenty of flaws and it still has to be ratified by member states , it reflects a compromise and marks the dawning of a new era , says dw 's bernd riegert .

" there is a list of up to 100 persons in different parliaments , on several levels , on state level , on regional level , being paid by carmaker volkswagen , " resch said .
" for example the mayor of wolfsburg , the city where volkswagen is situated , gets a salary by this company . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw manufacturing factory in wolfsburg volkswagen has also had its hand in watering down recent legislation for higher environmental standards proposed by the green party , which would have required fine particle dust filters in diesel motors . all it took , resch said , was a letter from volkswagen head bernd pischetsrieder to members of parliament . " in this letter pischetsrieder complained that tax incentives for particle filters would harm his company and the car industry in germany and would be bad for the economy , " resch said .
" with this letter he -lrb- pischetsrieder -rrb- was able to stop the entire parliamentary process . " a lobbyist in disguise ? deutsche umwelthilfe 's allegations against german companies come at a time of intense debate in the country about whether politicians should be allowed to hold down a normal job while carrying out their duties as an elected member of parliament or whether that would inevitably lead to a conflict of interests and turn parliamentarians into mere lobbyist for industry . under german law , parliamentarians are indeed allowed to work " on the side " as long as they do not earn more than € 3,000 a month or € 18,000 a year on top of their salaries as a member of parliament . but the system 's critics claim that such a practice could easily give rise to a conflict of interest . " the parliamentarian must not be a lobbyist in disguise , " jochen bäumel of transparency international told news agency afp .
" only by publishing their additional income can the electorate know whose interests they really represent . " companies under pressure spearheaded by mass-selling daily bild , the campaign to publish fat-cat corporate salaries has put pressure on german companies to reveal details of their links with politicians . volkswagen has already announced that it plans to release a list of employees on its books who also hold a political office .
vw ceo pischetsrieder is expected to announce the details on thursday .

secretary general of the party , laurenz meyer stepped down last month after it emerged that he had received substantial payouts from energy giant rwe , his former employer , while holding political office . harmful for economy too however , deutsche umwelthilfe claims that the dilution of climate-friendly laws through the nexus of politicians and car industry officials is not only harmful to the german environment , but may hurt the economy in the long run as well . countries like china and japan have lowered the ceilings for acceptable fuel consumption in automobiles , and even the us has stricter emissions standards than germany .
many german luxury cars do not meet the new guidelines .
jürgen resch warns that “ made in germany ” may lose its selling power abroad . “ earlier german cars stood for high quality , for security , and for a while , even for high environmental standards , " resch said .
" but , we 're now noticing that even in the united states , more and more cars are not being able to sell , because the emissions are too high .
we see a big danger if the very high priced cars in germany can ’ t be sold in the whole asian market anymore because of environmental regulations . " tighter regulations needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opel astra diesel hybrid concept vehicle is shown during media previews at the north american international auto show in detroit , jan .
9 , 2005 .
instead of hyping faster motors and new state-of-art fuel pumps , deutsche umwelthilfe says that the german automobile industry need more incentive to focus on the development of alternatives to traditional engines , like environmentally-friendly hybrid models and more energy-efficient diesel motors . it has proposed tighter regulations similar to those being implemented in japan and china within the next few years .
whether these will put german cars on the fast track in asia remains to be seen . kateri jochum -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german opposition deputy resigns german opposition leader angela merkel 's deputy , laurenz meyer , resigned on wednesday after being heavily criticized for failing to fully declare payments and electricity subsidies he received from his former employer .

" there is a list of up to 100 persons in different parliaments , on several levels , on state level , on regional level , being paid by carmaker volkswagen , " resch said .
" for example the mayor of wolfsburg , the city where volkswagen is situated , gets a salary by this company . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw manufacturing factory in wolfsburg volkswagen has also had its hand in watering down recent legislation for higher environmental standards proposed by the green party , which would have required fine particle dust filters in diesel motors . all it took , resch said , was a letter from volkswagen head bernd pischetsrieder to members of parliament . " in this letter pischetsrieder complained that tax incentives for particle filters would harm his company and the car industry in germany and would be bad for the economy , " resch said .
" with this letter he -lrb- pischetsrieder -rrb- was able to stop the entire parliamentary process . " a lobbyist in disguise ? deutsche umwelthilfe 's allegations against german companies come at a time of intense debate in the country about whether politicians should be allowed to hold down a normal job while carrying out their duties as an elected member of parliament or whether that would inevitably lead to a conflict of interests and turn parliamentarians into mere lobbyist for industry . under german law , parliamentarians are indeed allowed to work " on the side " as long as they do not earn more than € 3,000 a month or € 18,000 a year on top of their salaries as a member of parliament . but the system 's critics claim that such a practice could easily give rise to a conflict of interest . " the parliamentarian must not be a lobbyist in disguise , " jochen bäumel of transparency international told news agency afp .
" only by publishing their additional income can the electorate know whose interests they really represent . " companies under pressure spearheaded by mass-selling daily bild , the campaign to publish fat-cat corporate salaries has put pressure on german companies to reveal details of their links with politicians . volkswagen has already announced that it plans to release a list of employees on its books who also hold a political office .
vw ceo pischetsrieder is expected to announce the details on thursday .
bild reported this week that vw had six social democratic parliamentarians on its payrolls over the last six years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : laurenz meyer the issue has already caused heads to roll in the conservative opposition christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
secretary general of the party , laurenz meyer stepped down last month after it emerged that he had received substantial payouts from energy giant rwe , his former employer , while holding political office . harmful for economy too however , deutsche umwelthilfe claims that the dilution of climate-friendly laws through the nexus of politicians and car industry officials is not only harmful to the german environment , but may hurt the economy in the long run as well . countries like china and japan have lowered the ceilings for acceptable fuel consumption in automobiles , and even the us has stricter emissions standards than germany .
many german luxury cars do not meet the new guidelines .
jürgen resch warns that “ made in germany ” may lose its selling power abroad . “ earlier german cars stood for high quality , for security , and for a while , even for high environmental standards , " resch said .
" but , we 're now noticing that even in the united states , more and more cars are not being able to sell , because the emissions are too high .
we see a big danger if the very high priced cars in germany can ’ t be sold in the whole asian market anymore because of environmental regulations . " tighter regulations needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opel astra diesel hybrid concept vehicle is shown during media previews at the north american international auto show in detroit , jan .
9 , 2005 .
instead of hyping faster motors and new state-of-art fuel pumps , deutsche umwelthilfe says that the german automobile industry need more incentive to focus on the development of alternatives to traditional engines , like environmentally-friendly hybrid models and more energy-efficient diesel motors . it has proposed tighter regulations similar to those being implemented in japan and china within the next few years .
whether these will put german cars on the fast track in asia remains to be seen . kateri jochum -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german opposition deputy resigns german opposition leader angela merkel 's deputy , laurenz meyer , resigned on wednesday after being heavily criticized for failing to fully declare payments and electricity subsidies he received from his former employer .

but his latest caper - dressing as a nazi at a costume party , tops them all . the photo splashed across the british tabloid the sun shows a lanky prince harry wearing the tan uniform of the nazi 's afrika korps , complete with red and black swastika armband , holding a drink in one hand and a cigarette in the other .
and it begs the question : " harry , what were you thinking ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's prince harry the youngest son of the late princess diana and heir-to-the-throne prince charles may be the " wild child " of the british royal family , but surely he knows better ?
and if he does n't , then why did n't one of his minders , or at least big brother william , who attended the " native and colonial " party in a much tamer lion costume , warn the wayward redhead ? harry 's timing could n't be worse .

26 . indonesia , the nation worst-hit by the tidal wave disaster , has an external debt of $ 132 billion -lrb- € 100 billion -rrb- according to the world bank , of which more than $ 70 billion is owed to public creditors or has been guaranteed by public bodies and is eligible for the paris club offer .
indonesia would have to pay more than $ 3 billion in principal payments alone this year - about the same amount it needs to recover from the crisis . german foreign minister joschka fischer said the debt moratorium was " an important step forward " and " an element of aid that can not be underestimated . " doubts linger however , wirayuda admitted that his country still had lingering doubts about taking up the offer . " we do not want that it harms our economy , " he told reporters in berlin .
" we do n't want the market to go wrongly and we do n't want our creditworthiness to be negatively influenced . " in contrast to indonesia , countries such as india , thailand and malaysia have already decided not to accept the freeze on debt repayment for fear they would lose their credit rating on financial markets . indonesia 's fears were echoed by german finance minister hans eichel , who also held talks with wirayuda on thursday . " one must be very prudent as far as the paris club is concerned , " he said and underlined that any debt measures " could put financial credibility in peril .
and that is something they -lrb- indonesia -rrb- do not want .

rolf langhammer of the institute for world economics in kiel told deutsche welle that it would n't just damage the credit reputation of the nations , but could also prompt a " chain reaction " with other countries who have also suffered other catastrophes lining up to stake their claim . langhammer also added that it was n't clear whether forgiving debt " would really lead to the money reaching the ones really suffering . " wirayuda plays down troop restrictions on thursday , wirayuda also played down earlier statements by the indonesian government that foreign troops involved in emergency aid operations in the devastated aceh province should not stay longer than three months . the foreign minister stressed that jakarta welcomed the military aid deployments , including germany 's , but added that their presence was a " delicate issue for the indonesian public . " wirayuda said that restrictions on the movement of aid workers in aceh were only for their own safety and denied the rules would hinder international relief operations .
at the same time , he said he was open for the truce offer made by separatist muslim rebels in aceh to the government in jakarta . " there is a silver lining on the horizon , " wirayuda said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers german foreign minister fischer underlined his government 's long-term commitment to help indonesia overcome the devastation wrought by the tsunami disaster and said that german soldiers stationed in aceh with a mobile field hospital and relief supplies ship , would " stay in the region as long as it makes sense and as long as the indonesian government wished .

" there is a list of up to 100 persons in different parliaments , on several levels , on state level , on regional level , being paid by carmaker volkswagen , " resch said .
" for example the mayor of wolfsburg , the city where volkswagen is situated , gets a salary by this company . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw manufacturing factory in wolfsburg volkswagen has also had its hand in watering down recent legislation for higher environmental standards proposed by the green party , which would have required fine particle dust filters in diesel motors . all it took , resch said , was a letter from volkswagen head bernd pischetsrieder to members of parliament . " in this letter pischetsrieder complained that tax incentives for particle filters would harm his company and the car industry in germany and would be bad for the economy , " resch said .
" with this letter he -lrb- pischetsrieder -rrb- was able to stop the entire parliamentary process . " a lobbyist in disguise ? deutsche umwelthilfe 's allegations against german companies come at a time of intense debate in the country about whether politicians should be allowed to hold down a normal job while carrying out their duties as an elected member of parliament or whether that would inevitably lead to a conflict of interests and turn parliamentarians into mere lobbyist for industry . under german law , parliamentarians are indeed allowed to work " on the side " as long as they do not earn more than € 3,000 a month or € 18,000 a year on top of their salaries as a member of parliament . but the system 's critics claim that such a practice could easily give rise to a conflict of interest . " the parliamentarian must not be a lobbyist in disguise , " jochen bäumel of transparency international told news agency afp .
" only by publishing their additional income can the electorate know whose interests they really represent . " companies under pressure spearheaded by mass-selling daily bild , the campaign to publish fat-cat corporate salaries has put pressure on german companies to reveal details of their links with politicians . volkswagen has already announced that it plans to release a list of employees on its books who also hold a political office .
vw ceo pischetsrieder is expected to announce the details on thursday .
bild reported this week that vw had six social democratic parliamentarians on its payrolls over the last six years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : laurenz meyer the issue has already caused heads to roll in the conservative opposition christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
secretary general of the party , laurenz meyer stepped down last month after it emerged that he had received substantial payouts from energy giant rwe , his former employer , while holding political office . harmful for economy too however , deutsche umwelthilfe claims that the dilution of climate-friendly laws through the nexus of politicians and car industry officials is not only harmful to the german environment , but may hurt the economy in the long run as well . countries like china and japan have lowered the ceilings for acceptable fuel consumption in automobiles , and even the us has stricter emissions standards than germany .
many german luxury cars do not meet the new guidelines .
jürgen resch warns that “ made in germany ” may lose its selling power abroad . “ earlier german cars stood for high quality , for security , and for a while , even for high environmental standards , " resch said .
" but , we 're now noticing that even in the united states , more and more cars are not being able to sell , because the emissions are too high .
we see a big danger if the very high priced cars in germany can ’ t be sold in the whole asian market anymore because of environmental regulations . " tighter regulations needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opel astra diesel hybrid concept vehicle is shown during media previews at the north american international auto show in detroit , jan .
9 , 2005 .
instead of hyping faster motors and new state-of-art fuel pumps , deutsche umwelthilfe says that the german automobile industry need more incentive to focus on the development of alternatives to traditional engines , like environmentally-friendly hybrid models and more energy-efficient diesel motors . it has proposed tighter regulations similar to those being implemented in japan and china within the next few years .
whether these will put german cars on the fast track in asia remains to be seen . kateri jochum -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german opposition deputy resigns german opposition leader angela merkel 's deputy , laurenz meyer , resigned on wednesday after being heavily criticized for failing to fully declare payments and electricity subsidies he received from his former employer .

but his latest caper - dressing as a nazi at a costume party , tops them all . the photo splashed across the british tabloid the sun shows a lanky prince harry wearing the tan uniform of the nazi 's afrika korps , complete with red and black swastika armband , holding a drink in one hand and a cigarette in the other .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's prince harry the youngest son of the late princess diana and heir-to-the-throne prince charles may be the " wild child " of the british royal family , but surely he knows better ?
and if he does n't , then why did n't one of his minders , or at least big brother william , who attended the " native and colonial " party in a much tamer lion costume , warn the wayward redhead ? harry 's timing could n't be worse .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 13.01.2005 indonesia mulls debt moratorium offer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wirayuda with german foreign minister fischer after meeting with german ministers in berlin thursday , indonesian foreign minister wirayuda said jakarta was considering a debt repayment freeze offer amid misgivings that it could damage its economy . indonesian foreign minister hasan wirayuda said his country was mulling the offer of a debt repayment freeze by the paris club of donor nations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we will continue to have discussions on this offer of a debt moratorium , " wirayuda said after a meeting with fischer in berlin on thursday . his remarks come a day after the paris club of creditor nations offered an unconditional freeze on debt repayments for indonesia , the seychelles and sri lanka to help them rebuild their ravaged coastlines after the tsunami that struck on dec .
26 . indonesia , the nation worst-hit by the tidal wave disaster , has an external debt of $ 132 billion -lrb- € 100 billion -rrb- according to the world bank , of which more than $ 70 billion is owed to public creditors or has been guaranteed by public bodies and is eligible for the paris club offer .
indonesia would have to pay more than $ 3 billion in principal payments alone this year - about the same amount it needs to recover from the crisis . german foreign minister joschka fischer said the debt moratorium was " an important step forward " and " an element of aid that can not be underestimated . " doubts linger however , wirayuda admitted that his country still had lingering doubts about taking up the offer . " we do not want that it harms our economy , " he told reporters in berlin .
" we do n't want the market to go wrongly and we do n't want our creditworthiness to be negatively influenced . " in contrast to indonesia , countries such as india , thailand and malaysia have already decided not to accept the freeze on debt repayment for fear they would lose their credit rating on financial markets . indonesia 's fears were echoed by german finance minister hans eichel , who also held talks with wirayuda on thursday . " one must be very prudent as far as the paris club is concerned , " he said and underlined that any debt measures " could put financial credibility in peril .
and that is something they -lrb- indonesia -rrb- do not want .
indonesia is neither in an economic crisis nor a financial crisis and clearly prefers aid to a debt freeze . " complete waiver problematic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paris club chairman jean pierre jouyet the paris club of donors ' decision to suspend the debts of tsunami-hit nations rather than completely waive it has come in for criticism from aid organizations such as oxfam and anti-globalization group attac . but , experts have pointed out that a complete debt waiver could be problematic .
rolf langhammer of the institute for world economics in kiel told deutsche welle that it would n't just damage the credit reputation of the nations , but could also prompt a " chain reaction " with other countries who have also suffered other catastrophes lining up to stake their claim . langhammer also added that it was n't clear whether forgiving debt " would really lead to the money reaching the ones really suffering . " wirayuda plays down troop restrictions on thursday , wirayuda also played down earlier statements by the indonesian government that foreign troops involved in emergency aid operations in the devastated aceh province should not stay longer than three months . the foreign minister stressed that jakarta welcomed the military aid deployments , including germany 's , but added that their presence was a " delicate issue for the indonesian public . " wirayuda said that restrictions on the movement of aid workers in aceh were only for their own safety and denied the rules would hinder international relief operations .
at the same time , he said he was open for the truce offer made by separatist muslim rebels in aceh to the government in jakarta . " there is a silver lining on the horizon , " wirayuda said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers german foreign minister fischer underlined his government 's long-term commitment to help indonesia overcome the devastation wrought by the tsunami disaster and said that german soldiers stationed in aceh with a mobile field hospital and relief supplies ship , would " stay in the region as long as it makes sense and as long as the indonesian government wished .

" there is a list of up to 100 persons in different parliaments , on several levels , on state level , on regional level , being paid by carmaker volkswagen , " resch said .

" in this letter pischetsrieder complained that tax incentives for particle filters would harm his company and the car industry in germany and would be bad for the economy , " resch said .
" with this letter he -lrb- pischetsrieder -rrb- was able to stop the entire parliamentary process . " a lobbyist in disguise ? deutsche umwelthilfe 's allegations against german companies come at a time of intense debate in the country about whether politicians should be allowed to hold down a normal job while carrying out their duties as an elected member of parliament or whether that would inevitably lead to a conflict of interests and turn parliamentarians into mere lobbyist for industry . under german law , parliamentarians are indeed allowed to work " on the side " as long as they do not earn more than € 3,000 a month or € 18,000 a year on top of their salaries as a member of parliament . but the system 's critics claim that such a practice could easily give rise to a conflict of interest .

" only by publishing their additional income can the electorate know whose interests they really represent . " companies under pressure spearheaded by mass-selling daily bild , the campaign to publish fat-cat corporate salaries has put pressure on german companies to reveal details of their links with politicians . volkswagen has already announced that it plans to release a list of employees on its books who also hold a political office .
vw ceo pischetsrieder is expected to announce the details on thursday .

many german luxury cars do not meet the new guidelines .
jürgen resch warns that “ made in germany ” may lose its selling power abroad . “ earlier german cars stood for high quality , for security , and for a while , even for high environmental standards , " resch said .
" but , we 're now noticing that even in the united states , more and more cars are not being able to sell , because the emissions are too high .
we see a big danger if the very high priced cars in germany can ’ t be sold in the whole asian market anymore because of environmental regulations .

instead of hyping faster motors and new state-of-art fuel pumps , deutsche umwelthilfe says that the german automobile industry need more incentive to focus on the development of alternatives to traditional engines , like environmentally-friendly hybrid models and more energy-efficient diesel motors . it has proposed tighter regulations similar to those being implemented in japan and china within the next few years .

berlin hails ukrainian decision ; russia slams west yushchenko poisoned , doctors say court orders new ukrainian election europe -pipe- 13.01.2005 appeal delays inauguration in ukraine großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yushchenko still has to wait to accept toasts to his presidency with the tables turned in the ukraine presidential race and opposition candidate yuschenko waiting to take the oath of office , defeated candidate yanukovych is pulling out the delaying tactics . hopes that the long-awaited inauguration of viktor yushchenko would be staged this week have again been dashed .
his opponent , viktor yanukovych , has once again used the courts to put off the transfer of power . stall tactics the inauguration can only take place after the election result is published in one of the two official newspapers , and the ukraine supreme court has barred both papers from printing it until former prime minister viktor yanukovych has a last chance to appeal the outcome in a court of law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yushchenko declaring victory , with ukrainian pop star .
but how soon yanukovych 's latest appeal will finally be filed and decided on is uncertain . yushchenko was finally declared the winner of the ukraine presidential election on jan .
10 , two weeks after the re-run of an earlier election that was declared invalid because of voter fraud .
but yanukovych - who agreed to a new election only after his hand was forced by a massive popular uprising – has managed to hold up the poll result at every turn . currently , yanukovych is appealing the election , claiming it was invalid . ' we will never be satisfied ' “ if the court fails to comply with our demands , we have the right to act within the framework of our legislation , " yanukovych said .
" we ’ ll appeal to the european court of justice .
we will never be satisfied with the result of the so-called third round of the election . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yanukovych leaving voting booth during the repeat election in december all the former prime minister 's previous appeals have been quickly dismissed by the court .
but it can not rule on a complaint until he officially submits it .
and yanukovych ’ s representative in the election commission , nestor shufritch , said he thinks ukraine ’ s weary voters may be called upon yet again to go to the polls . “ if the supreme court does makes a legal rather than a political decision i am personally convinced that , unfortunately , a new election process will be necessary , ” sufritch said . swiss lawyers it is not quite clear what is driving yanukovych in his refusal to cede the election .
but the yanukovych camp does n't seeem to be running out of energy – or money .
they are paying swiss lawyers for advice . the lawyers had promised to hand over to the supreme court on wednesday some 800 files allegedly containing proof of vote rigging in the latest poll , but the process has been delayed . yanukovych now has until friday to submit the evidence .
if the court accepts the complaint , it can take up to 10 days to examine it , which would delay yushchenko ’ s inauguration still further . olive branch from russia but andrei shkill , parliamentary deputy from president-elect yushchenko ’ s party , said he is optimistic that his candidate will someday take office . “ the european court of justice , the swiss lawyers , they are just obvious attempts to make yanukovych and his crew important , " he said .
" to show there are people who refuse to accept the election result and intend to challenge it . " moscow – which strongly supported yanukovych 's candidacy - meanwhile has broken its frosty silence over yuschenko 's victory .
the russians finally held out an olive branch when russian defense minister sergei ivanov told reporters on a visit to washington that his country was ready to cooperate with the newly elected leadership of ukraine . ivanov , whose comments indicate russia wants to retain its influence over the ex-soviet state , noted yushchenko had announced his first foreign visit would be to moscow . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de yushchenko reaches out to russia the winner of ukraine 's bitterly-fought presidential poll , yushchenko , moved tuesday to repair damage to relations with russia while his opponent , yanukovych , persisted in blaming the west for his defeat . -lrb- dec .

" there is a list of up to 100 persons in different parliaments , on several levels , on state level , on regional level , being paid by carmaker volkswagen , " resch said .
" for example the mayor of wolfsburg , the city where volkswagen is situated , gets a salary by this company . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw manufacturing factory in wolfsburg volkswagen has also had its hand in watering down recent legislation for higher environmental standards proposed by the green party , which would have required fine particle dust filters in diesel motors . all it took , resch said , was a letter from volkswagen head bernd pischetsrieder to members of parliament . " in this letter pischetsrieder complained that tax incentives for particle filters would harm his company and the car industry in germany and would be bad for the economy , " resch said .
" with this letter he -lrb- pischetsrieder -rrb- was able to stop the entire parliamentary process . " a lobbyist in disguise ? deutsche umwelthilfe 's allegations against german companies come at a time of intense debate in the country about whether politicians should be allowed to hold down a normal job while carrying out their duties as an elected member of parliament or whether that would inevitably lead to a conflict of interests and turn parliamentarians into mere lobbyist for industry . under german law , parliamentarians are indeed allowed to work " on the side " as long as they do not earn more than € 3,000 a month or € 18,000 a year on top of their salaries as a member of parliament . but the system 's critics claim that such a practice could easily give rise to a conflict of interest . " the parliamentarian must not be a lobbyist in disguise , " jochen bäumel of transparency international told news agency afp .
" only by publishing their additional income can the electorate know whose interests they really represent . " companies under pressure spearheaded by mass-selling daily bild , the campaign to publish fat-cat corporate salaries has put pressure on german companies to reveal details of their links with politicians . volkswagen has already announced that it plans to release a list of employees on its books who also hold a political office .
vw ceo pischetsrieder is expected to announce the details on thursday .

now , it is up to the bloc 's 25 member states to ratify the historic treaty . there was a standing ovation in the european parliament in strasbourg as the results of wednesday 's poll were announced : 500 votes in favor to 137 against , with 40 abstentions - a massive show of support for a resolution backing the constitutional treaty . " the result of the vote leaves no room for doubt about the support that this european parliament has expressed for the constitution , " parliament president josep borrell said . while all the mainstream parties in the parliament supported the text , a few dozen right-wing and nationalist lawmakers jeered and waved banners proclaiming " not in my name . " " in the name of the 25 heads of state of the european union who signed the constitution in october , i would like to express my great joy , " retorted luxembourg 's prime minister and current eu president , jean-claude juncker , following the vote . attacks from left and right the new constitution will boost the assembly 's powers , create a long-term president of the european council of eu leaders and an eu foreign minister , as well as streamline decision-making .
but the far left reject it as a global capitalist charter without adequate social protection , while the far right and nationalists have attacked it as a blueprint for a european " superstate " that would give too much power to brussels - views that are far from reality , according to german eu parliamentarian , elmar brock . “ it brings european countries together in order to make them strong enough to survive as democracies in this global environment , " brock said .
" it gives europe not only this efficiency , but also the transparency so that people can check the policy – and also the competence order , which makes sure that the european union can not grow as it wants , but that the competence is given by the member states .
and therefore it ’ s just the opposite of a superstate . ” the constitution still faces a long and bumpy ride .
two countries , lithuania and hungary , have ratified the charter by parliamentary vote so far .
but its fate will be sealed in referendums in countries including france , the netherlands , denmark , the czech republic , poland and above all britain , where approval is far from certain .
a rejection in just one of the countries would be a major blow as it would send the constitution back to the drawing board and start an entire new round of negotiations . juncker has urged national parliaments and eu citizens to support the ratification process , which could take as long as two years . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : the constitution is n't perfect but must do although the eu constitution has plenty of flaws and it still has to be ratified by member states , it reflects a compromise and marks the dawning of a new era , says dw 's bernd riegert .

26 . indonesia , the nation worst-hit by the tidal wave disaster , has an external debt of $ 132 billion -lrb- € 100 billion -rrb- according to the world bank , of which more than $ 70 billion is owed to public creditors or has been guaranteed by public bodies and is eligible for the paris club offer .
indonesia would have to pay more than $ 3 billion in principal payments alone this year - about the same amount it needs to recover from the crisis . german foreign minister joschka fischer said the debt moratorium was " an important step forward " and " an element of aid that can not be underestimated . " doubts linger however , wirayuda admitted that his country still had lingering doubts about taking up the offer . " we do not want that it harms our economy , " he told reporters in berlin .
" we do n't want the market to go wrongly and we do n't want our creditworthiness to be negatively influenced . " in contrast to indonesia , countries such as india , thailand and malaysia have already decided not to accept the freeze on debt repayment for fear they would lose their credit rating on financial markets . indonesia 's fears were echoed by german finance minister hans eichel , who also held talks with wirayuda on thursday . " one must be very prudent as far as the paris club is concerned , " he said and underlined that any debt measures " could put financial credibility in peril .
and that is something they -lrb- indonesia -rrb- do not want .
indonesia is neither in an economic crisis nor a financial crisis and clearly prefers aid to a debt freeze . " complete waiver problematic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paris club chairman jean pierre jouyet the paris club of donors ' decision to suspend the debts of tsunami-hit nations rather than completely waive it has come in for criticism from aid organizations such as oxfam and anti-globalization group attac . but , experts have pointed out that a complete debt waiver could be problematic .
rolf langhammer of the institute for world economics in kiel told deutsche welle that it would n't just damage the credit reputation of the nations , but could also prompt a " chain reaction " with other countries who have also suffered other catastrophes lining up to stake their claim . langhammer also added that it was n't clear whether forgiving debt " would really lead to the money reaching the ones really suffering . " wirayuda plays down troop restrictions on thursday , wirayuda also played down earlier statements by the indonesian government that foreign troops involved in emergency aid operations in the devastated aceh province should not stay longer than three months . the foreign minister stressed that jakarta welcomed the military aid deployments , including germany 's , but added that their presence was a " delicate issue for the indonesian public . " wirayuda said that restrictions on the movement of aid workers in aceh were only for their own safety and denied the rules would hinder international relief operations .
at the same time , he said he was open for the truce offer made by separatist muslim rebels in aceh to the government in jakarta . " there is a silver lining on the horizon , " wirayuda said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers german foreign minister fischer underlined his government 's long-term commitment to help indonesia overcome the devastation wrought by the tsunami disaster and said that german soldiers stationed in aceh with a mobile field hospital and relief supplies ship , would " stay in the region as long as it makes sense and as long as the indonesian government wished .

26 . indonesia , the nation worst-hit by the tidal wave disaster , has an external debt of $ 132 billion -lrb- € 100 billion -rrb- according to the world bank , of which more than $ 70 billion is owed to public creditors or has been guaranteed by public bodies and is eligible for the paris club offer .
indonesia would have to pay more than $ 3 billion in principal payments alone this year - about the same amount it needs to recover from the crisis . german foreign minister joschka fischer said the debt moratorium was " an important step forward " and " an element of aid that can not be underestimated . " doubts linger however , wirayuda admitted that his country still had lingering doubts about taking up the offer . " we do not want that it harms our economy , " he told reporters in berlin .
" we do n't want the market to go wrongly and we do n't want our creditworthiness to be negatively influenced . " in contrast to indonesia , countries such as india , thailand and malaysia have already decided not to accept the freeze on debt repayment for fear they would lose their credit rating on financial markets . indonesia 's fears were echoed by german finance minister hans eichel , who also held talks with wirayuda on thursday . " one must be very prudent as far as the paris club is concerned , " he said and underlined that any debt measures " could put financial credibility in peril .
and that is something they -lrb- indonesia -rrb- do not want .
indonesia is neither in an economic crisis nor a financial crisis and clearly prefers aid to a debt freeze . " complete waiver problematic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paris club chairman jean pierre jouyet the paris club of donors ' decision to suspend the debts of tsunami-hit nations rather than completely waive it has come in for criticism from aid organizations such as oxfam and anti-globalization group attac . but , experts have pointed out that a complete debt waiver could be problematic .
rolf langhammer of the institute for world economics in kiel told deutsche welle that it would n't just damage the credit reputation of the nations , but could also prompt a " chain reaction " with other countries who have also suffered other catastrophes lining up to stake their claim . langhammer also added that it was n't clear whether forgiving debt " would really lead to the money reaching the ones really suffering . " wirayuda plays down troop restrictions on thursday , wirayuda also played down earlier statements by the indonesian government that foreign troops involved in emergency aid operations in the devastated aceh province should not stay longer than three months . the foreign minister stressed that jakarta welcomed the military aid deployments , including germany 's , but added that their presence was a " delicate issue for the indonesian public . " wirayuda said that restrictions on the movement of aid workers in aceh were only for their own safety and denied the rules would hinder international relief operations .
at the same time , he said he was open for the truce offer made by separatist muslim rebels in aceh to the government in jakarta .

now , it is up to the bloc 's 25 member states to ratify the historic treaty . there was a standing ovation in the european parliament in strasbourg as the results of wednesday 's poll were announced : 500 votes in favor to 137 against , with 40 abstentions - a massive show of support for a resolution backing the constitutional treaty . " the result of the vote leaves no room for doubt about the support that this european parliament has expressed for the constitution , " parliament president josep borrell said . while all the mainstream parties in the parliament supported the text , a few dozen right-wing and nationalist lawmakers jeered and waved banners proclaiming " not in my name .

now , the country 's highest court has made the weed even acceptable for car drivers .
sort of , at least . legally speaking , stoners still face penalties if caught with the drug .
but prosecution is usually dropped if the amount of dope found on a person is considered small enough to show that it 's not intended for sale but rather personal consumption . despite a ruling by germany 's highest court , the federal constitutional court , to introduce a nationwide policy , german states still handle this differently , with negligible amounts ranging from 6 grams -lrb- 0.2 ounces -rrb- to 30 grams . but car drivers have still faced harsh punishments when caught high on the highway .
anyone testing positive for tetrahydrocannabinol -lrb- thc -rrb- , the psychoactive ingredient of cannabis , has lost his or her drivers license so far . this also happened to one man , who had smoked a joint the night before visiting a police station on an unrelated matter .
police officers noticed his strange behavior and convinced him to give a voluntary urine sample that revealed a thc level of 0.5 nanograms per milliliter -lrb- ng / ml -rrb- . his license was taken away from him by a lower court , but the man pursued the case all the way to the top .
germany 's constitutional judges sided with him , saying that tests have become so good at detecting thc that it 's hard to tell when a person has actually had a joint for the last time .
the man got his license back and anyone caught with a level of up to 1 ng / ml will be allowed to keep driving in the future . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european cannabis use at all time high cannabis remains the most commonly used drug in the eu with roughly one in five adult europeans having tried it at least once in their lifetime .

berlin hails ukrainian decision ; russia slams west yushchenko poisoned , doctors say court orders new ukrainian election europe -pipe- 13.01.2005 appeal delays inauguration in ukraine großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yushchenko still has to wait to accept toasts to his presidency with the tables turned in the ukraine presidential race and opposition candidate yuschenko waiting to take the oath of office , defeated candidate yanukovych is pulling out the delaying tactics . hopes that the long-awaited inauguration of viktor yushchenko would be staged this week have again been dashed .
his opponent , viktor yanukovych , has once again used the courts to put off the transfer of power . stall tactics the inauguration can only take place after the election result is published in one of the two official newspapers , and the ukraine supreme court has barred both papers from printing it until former prime minister viktor yanukovych has a last chance to appeal the outcome in a court of law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yushchenko declaring victory , with ukrainian pop star .
but how soon yanukovych 's latest appeal will finally be filed and decided on is uncertain . yushchenko was finally declared the winner of the ukraine presidential election on jan .
10 , two weeks after the re-run of an earlier election that was declared invalid because of voter fraud .
but yanukovych - who agreed to a new election only after his hand was forced by a massive popular uprising – has managed to hold up the poll result at every turn . currently , yanukovych is appealing the election , claiming it was invalid . ' we will never be satisfied ' “ if the court fails to comply with our demands , we have the right to act within the framework of our legislation , " yanukovych said .
" we ’ ll appeal to the european court of justice .
we will never be satisfied with the result of the so-called third round of the election . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yanukovych leaving voting booth during the repeat election in december all the former prime minister 's previous appeals have been quickly dismissed by the court .
but it can not rule on a complaint until he officially submits it .
and yanukovych ’ s representative in the election commission , nestor shufritch , said he thinks ukraine ’ s weary voters may be called upon yet again to go to the polls . “ if the supreme court does makes a legal rather than a political decision i am personally convinced that , unfortunately , a new election process will be necessary , ” sufritch said . swiss lawyers it is not quite clear what is driving yanukovych in his refusal to cede the election .
but the yanukovych camp does n't seeem to be running out of energy – or money .
they are paying swiss lawyers for advice . the lawyers had promised to hand over to the supreme court on wednesday some 800 files allegedly containing proof of vote rigging in the latest poll , but the process has been delayed . yanukovych now has until friday to submit the evidence .
if the court accepts the complaint , it can take up to 10 days to examine it , which would delay yushchenko ’ s inauguration still further . olive branch from russia but andrei shkill , parliamentary deputy from president-elect yushchenko ’ s party , said he is optimistic that his candidate will someday take office . “ the european court of justice , the swiss lawyers , they are just obvious attempts to make yanukovych and his crew important , " he said .
" to show there are people who refuse to accept the election result and intend to challenge it . " moscow – which strongly supported yanukovych 's candidacy - meanwhile has broken its frosty silence over yuschenko 's victory .
the russians finally held out an olive branch when russian defense minister sergei ivanov told reporters on a visit to washington that his country was ready to cooperate with the newly elected leadership of ukraine . ivanov , whose comments indicate russia wants to retain its influence over the ex-soviet state , noted yushchenko had announced his first foreign visit would be to moscow . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de yushchenko reaches out to russia the winner of ukraine 's bitterly-fought presidential poll , yushchenko , moved tuesday to repair damage to relations with russia while his opponent , yanukovych , persisted in blaming the west for his defeat . -lrb- dec .

germany 's constitutional judges sided with him , saying that tests have become so good at detecting thc that it 's hard to tell when a person has actually had a joint for the last time .

" a danger for democracy " - that 's what a leading german social democrat called so-called " green lists " - a conglomeration of environmentalist , peace and anti-nuclear groups - back in 1977 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the greens first leadership at the founding convention on jan .
13 , 1980 just three years later , on jan .
13 , 1980 , some of these " dangerous organizations " joined forces after a long debate about the necessity of founding a new party : " die grünen " or " the greens " were born .
few believed that the party would survive .
debates over the inclusion of left-wing radicals foreshadowed the later power struggles between ecological radicals , the so-called " fundis , " and pragmatic " realos . "
politically , the greens questioned the status quo from the start : calls for an immediate end to the use of nuclear power , the dissolution of nato and an ecologically oriented economy scared away potential voters .
environment first but the greens deserve the biggest credit for putting the protection of the environment at the center of their agenda , according to karl-rudolf korte , a political scientist at the university of duisburg / essen .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the phasing out of nuclear power has been a priority for the greens " this led established parties to take up these topics , " he said , adding that state and federal governments responded by setting up ministries for the environment .
the success became a danger for the greens , however , as others adopted their agenda and made it their own , korte said .
additionally , the party limited itself by imposing a strict political culture .
for many years , elected members of parliament had to give up their seats mid-term to make room for others .
until recently the greens also did not allow party functionaries to hold public office at the same time .
joschka 's sneakers still , german society quickly warmed to the party 's ecologically-oriented politics at the beginning of the 1980s while the big parties still did n't have the subject on their agenda .
because of this , the greens were able to get enough votes to enter local and state parliaments throughout germany , culminating in the first " red-green " coalition government with the social democrats in the central state of hesse in 1985 .

at the time , though , joschka fischer caused an uproar when he took his oath of office wearing jeans and sneakers .
while successful with voters , the greens began falling apart from the inside as " fundis " and " realos " kept fighting about the future of the party .
the low point was reached with german unification in 1990 : campaigning with the slogan " everyone talks about germany .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the united party 's logo only members of the greens ' eastern german sister party , " bündnis 90 , " or alliance 90 , managed to garner seats .
the two parties finally merged in 1993 and the greens are now officially called " bündnis 90 / die grünen . "
reaching for power a year later , the party , now led by " realos " around joschka fischer , re-entered parliament and reached its high point in 1998 , when the greens became the junior partner in germany 's governing coalition with the social democrats for the first time .
by then , the party had gone through a tremendous process of transformation , reflected in its approval of the participation of german soldiers in the nato-led kosovo mission in 1999 .
fischer can take the credit for the turn-around in the party , according to korte .
" this was probably the biggest challenge for a party that was founded on a pacifist platform , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer -lrb- left -rrb- and german chancellor gerhard schröder together with the social democrats , the greens made a number of difficult decisions in the following years .
they opted for reforms to germany 's tax and social welfare systems and approved other military missions to macedonia and afghanistan .

additionally , the party limited itself by imposing a strict political culture .
for many years , elected members of parliament had to give up their seats mid-term to make room for others .
until recently the greens also did not allow party functionaries to hold public office at the same time .
joschka 's sneakers still , german society quickly warmed to the party 's ecologically-oriented politics at the beginning of the 1980s while the big parties still did n't have the subject on their agenda .
because of this , the greens were able to get enough votes to enter local and state parliaments throughout germany , culminating in the first " red-green " coalition government with the social democrats in the central state of hesse in 1985 .

12 , 1985 that government 's environmental minister - the first in germany - later became the country 's foreign minister .
at the time , though , joschka fischer caused an uproar when he took his oath of office wearing jeans and sneakers .
while successful with voters , the greens began falling apart from the inside as " fundis " and " realos " kept fighting about the future of the party .
the low point was reached with german unification in 1990 : campaigning with the slogan " everyone talks about germany .
we talk about climate , " the greens failed to win over voters and were kicked out of parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the united party 's logo only members of the greens ' eastern german sister party , " bündnis 90 , " or alliance 90 , managed to garner seats .
the two parties finally merged in 1993 and the greens are now officially called " bündnis 90 / die grünen . "
reaching for power a year later , the party , now led by " realos " around joschka fischer , re-entered parliament and reached its high point in 1998 , when the greens became the junior partner in germany 's governing coalition with the social democrats for the first time .
by then , the party had gone through a tremendous process of transformation , reflected in its approval of the participation of german soldiers in the nato-led kosovo mission in 1999 .
fischer can take the credit for the turn-around in the party , according to korte .
" this was probably the biggest challenge for a party that was founded on a pacifist platform , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer -lrb- left -rrb- and german chancellor gerhard schröder together with the social democrats , the greens made a number of difficult decisions in the following years .
they opted for reforms to germany 's tax and social welfare systems and approved other military missions to macedonia and afghanistan .
while social democrats have lost voters in elections since 2002 , the greens managed to hold onto their seats or increase them almost everywhere .
and for years , fischer has led the list of germany 's most popular politicians .

german politicians seeking to outlaw secret paternity tests won a first battle on wednesday , much to the disappointment of fathers ' rights groups hoping for greater justice in the areas of alimony and child support . the german federal court of justice decided on wednesday that paternity tests carried out in secret are inadmissible as evidence in a lawsuit .
unless the mother gave her consent for the test , the child 's personal rights would be violated , the court in karlsruhe ruled .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lab technician at the " id-labor " in wiesbaden conducts a paternity test .
the decision was welcomed by german justice minister brigitte zypries , who is leading a campaign to make secret paternity tests illegal under a new law regulating the use of genetic data .
" these tests are a serious invasion of the private sphere , " zypries said .
" if a man has doubts about his paternity , he should talk about this with the mother . "
campaigners for fathers ' rights in germany say making secret paternity tests punishable would be yet another blow to men who already get the short end of the stick when it comes to laws regulating alimony , child support , and child custody following a divorce or separation .
" it can not be that , as a woman , i have the right to make my husband pay to support a child that is not his own , or to deny children the right to know who their real father is , " said dr. karin jäckel , an active supporter of the fathers ' rights movement and author of several books on the subject .
" men are , in every respect , held responsible for their children under our laws , which is why they have the right to know who their children are . "
modernizing alimony bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a father walks with his son in a düsseldorf park .
while the battle over paternity tests continues , justice minister zypries has also announced an overhaul of german laws on alimony .
divorced dads are hopeful that the changes will mean more justice for them .
the growing fathers ' rights movement in germany rejects the stereotype of the heartless man who abandons his family for a new relationship .
in reality , they say , the situation is very different .
women file for divorce more frequently than men , and are more often awarded custody of the children .
and in cases where a divorce is contested , fathers frequently become estranged from their children , making it harder for fathers to gain custody rights once the divorce is settled , jäckel said .
despite this emotional strain , fathers are still seen as the familial breadwinner , and can often find themselves burdened for life with child support and alimony payments to ex-wives .
" in cases where the man earns a lot and can pay for everyone , there 's no problem .
but we 're seeing more frequently that the man 's income is n't enough for everyone , " zypries said in an interview with the women 's magazine brigitte .
ideally , she said , both partners would take financial responsibility for themselves after a divorce .
" a man ca n't be expected to support his ex-wife for years , especially if she could go back to work , and as a consequence not have the money to support children from a second marriage , " she said .

unlike in britain , where the activist group fathers 4 justice has successfully attracted attention to the plight of divorced dads through spectacular stunts , campaigns by similar german groups have " barely registered politically , " jäckel said , adding that ploys aimed at grabbing media attention can make a desperate father 's situation even worse .
" i 've often seen it happen here that fathers who go to the media to publicize their cases are punished by the judges , " she said .
" in the worst case , this can even result in their custody rights being taken away .
the judges ' logic is that dragging a case of unfair treatment into the public eye only damages the child 's rights , and that someone who would do this is a bad father .

" a danger for democracy " - that 's what a leading german social democrat called so-called " green lists " - a conglomeration of environmentalist , peace and anti-nuclear groups - back in 1977 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the greens first leadership at the founding convention on jan .
13 , 1980 just three years later , on jan .
13 , 1980 , some of these " dangerous organizations " joined forces after a long debate about the necessity of founding a new party : " die grünen " or " the greens " were born .
few believed that the party would survive .
debates over the inclusion of left-wing radicals foreshadowed the later power struggles between ecological radicals , the so-called " fundis , " and pragmatic " realos . "
politically , the greens questioned the status quo from the start : calls for an immediate end to the use of nuclear power , the dissolution of nato and an ecologically oriented economy scared away potential voters .
environment first but the greens deserve the biggest credit for putting the protection of the environment at the center of their agenda , according to karl-rudolf korte , a political scientist at the university of duisburg / essen .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the phasing out of nuclear power has been a priority for the greens " this led established parties to take up these topics , " he said , adding that state and federal governments responded by setting up ministries for the environment .
the success became a danger for the greens , however , as others adopted their agenda and made it their own , korte said .
additionally , the party limited itself by imposing a strict political culture .
for many years , elected members of parliament had to give up their seats mid-term to make room for others .

german politicians seeking to outlaw secret paternity tests won a first battle on wednesday , much to the disappointment of fathers ' rights groups hoping for greater justice in the areas of alimony and child support . the german federal court of justice decided on wednesday that paternity tests carried out in secret are inadmissible as evidence in a lawsuit .
unless the mother gave her consent for the test , the child 's personal rights would be violated , the court in karlsruhe ruled .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lab technician at the " id-labor " in wiesbaden conducts a paternity test .
the decision was welcomed by german justice minister brigitte zypries , who is leading a campaign to make secret paternity tests illegal under a new law regulating the use of genetic data .
" these tests are a serious invasion of the private sphere , " zypries said .
" if a man has doubts about his paternity , he should talk about this with the mother . "
campaigners for fathers ' rights in germany say making secret paternity tests punishable would be yet another blow to men who already get the short end of the stick when it comes to laws regulating alimony , child support , and child custody following a divorce or separation .
" it can not be that , as a woman , i have the right to make my husband pay to support a child that is not his own , or to deny children the right to know who their real father is , " said dr. karin jäckel , an active supporter of the fathers ' rights movement and author of several books on the subject .
" men are , in every respect , held responsible for their children under our laws , which is why they have the right to know who their children are . "
modernizing alimony bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a father walks with his son in a düsseldorf park .
while the battle over paternity tests continues , justice minister zypries has also announced an overhaul of german laws on alimony .
divorced dads are hopeful that the changes will mean more justice for them .
the growing fathers ' rights movement in germany rejects the stereotype of the heartless man who abandons his family for a new relationship .
in reality , they say , the situation is very different .
women file for divorce more frequently than men , and are more often awarded custody of the children .
and in cases where a divorce is contested , fathers frequently become estranged from their children , making it harder for fathers to gain custody rights once the divorce is settled , jäckel said .
despite this emotional strain , fathers are still seen as the familial breadwinner , and can often find themselves burdened for life with child support and alimony payments to ex-wives .
" in cases where the man earns a lot and can pay for everyone , there 's no problem .
but we 're seeing more frequently that the man 's income is n't enough for everyone , " zypries said in an interview with the women 's magazine brigitte .
ideally , she said , both partners would take financial responsibility for themselves after a divorce .
" a man ca n't be expected to support his ex-wife for years , especially if she could go back to work , and as a consequence not have the money to support children from a second marriage , " she said .

unlike in britain , where the activist group fathers 4 justice has successfully attracted attention to the plight of divorced dads through spectacular stunts , campaigns by similar german groups have " barely registered politically , " jäckel said , adding that ploys aimed at grabbing media attention can make a desperate father 's situation even worse .
" i 've often seen it happen here that fathers who go to the media to publicize their cases are punished by the judges , " she said .
" in the worst case , this can even result in their custody rights being taken away .
the judges ' logic is that dragging a case of unfair treatment into the public eye only damages the child 's rights , and that someone who would do this is a bad father .

german politicians seeking to outlaw secret paternity tests won a first battle on wednesday , much to the disappointment of fathers ' rights groups hoping for greater justice in the areas of alimony and child support . the german federal court of justice decided on wednesday that paternity tests carried out in secret are inadmissible as evidence in a lawsuit .
unless the mother gave her consent for the test , the child 's personal rights would be violated , the court in karlsruhe ruled .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lab technician at the " id-labor " in wiesbaden conducts a paternity test .
the decision was welcomed by german justice minister brigitte zypries , who is leading a campaign to make secret paternity tests illegal under a new law regulating the use of genetic data .
" these tests are a serious invasion of the private sphere , " zypries said .
" if a man has doubts about his paternity , he should talk about this with the mother . "
campaigners for fathers ' rights in germany say making secret paternity tests punishable would be yet another blow to men who already get the short end of the stick when it comes to laws regulating alimony , child support , and child custody following a divorce or separation .
" it can not be that , as a woman , i have the right to make my husband pay to support a child that is not his own , or to deny children the right to know who their real father is , " said dr. karin jäckel , an active supporter of the fathers ' rights movement and author of several books on the subject .
" men are , in every respect , held responsible for their children under our laws , which is why they have the right to know who their children are . "
modernizing alimony bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a father walks with his son in a düsseldorf park .
while the battle over paternity tests continues , justice minister zypries has also announced an overhaul of german laws on alimony .
divorced dads are hopeful that the changes will mean more justice for them .
the growing fathers ' rights movement in germany rejects the stereotype of the heartless man who abandons his family for a new relationship .
in reality , they say , the situation is very different .
women file for divorce more frequently than men , and are more often awarded custody of the children .
and in cases where a divorce is contested , fathers frequently become estranged from their children , making it harder for fathers to gain custody rights once the divorce is settled , jäckel said .
despite this emotional strain , fathers are still seen as the familial breadwinner , and can often find themselves burdened for life with child support and alimony payments to ex-wives .

" there is a list of up to 100 persons in different parliaments , on several levels , on state level , on regional level , being paid by carmaker volkswagen , " resch said .
" for example the mayor of wolfsburg , the city where volkswagen is situated , gets a salary by this company . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw manufacturing factory in wolfsburg volkswagen has also had its hand in watering down recent legislation for higher environmental standards proposed by the green party , which would have required fine particle dust filters in diesel motors . all it took , resch said , was a letter from volkswagen head bernd pischetsrieder to members of parliament . " in this letter pischetsrieder complained that tax incentives for particle filters would harm his company and the car industry in germany and would be bad for the economy , " resch said .
" with this letter he -lrb- pischetsrieder -rrb- was able to stop the entire parliamentary process . " a lobbyist in disguise ? deutsche umwelthilfe 's allegations against german companies come at a time of intense debate in the country about whether politicians should be allowed to hold down a normal job while carrying out their duties as an elected member of parliament or whether that would inevitably lead to a conflict of interests and turn parliamentarians into mere lobbyist for industry . under german law , parliamentarians are indeed allowed to work " on the side " as long as they do not earn more than € 3,000 a month or € 18,000 a year on top of their salaries as a member of parliament . but the system 's critics claim that such a practice could easily give rise to a conflict of interest . " the parliamentarian must not be a lobbyist in disguise , " jochen bäumel of transparency international told news agency afp .
" only by publishing their additional income can the electorate know whose interests they really represent . " companies under pressure spearheaded by mass-selling daily bild , the campaign to publish fat-cat corporate salaries has put pressure on german companies to reveal details of their links with politicians . volkswagen has already announced that it plans to release a list of employees on its books who also hold a political office .
vw ceo pischetsrieder is expected to announce the details on thursday .
bild reported this week that vw had six social democratic parliamentarians on its payrolls over the last six years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : laurenz meyer the issue has already caused heads to roll in the conservative opposition christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
secretary general of the party , laurenz meyer stepped down last month after it emerged that he had received substantial payouts from energy giant rwe , his former employer , while holding political office . harmful for economy too however , deutsche umwelthilfe claims that the dilution of climate-friendly laws through the nexus of politicians and car industry officials is not only harmful to the german environment , but may hurt the economy in the long run as well . countries like china and japan have lowered the ceilings for acceptable fuel consumption in automobiles , and even the us has stricter emissions standards than germany .
many german luxury cars do not meet the new guidelines .
jürgen resch warns that “ made in germany ” may lose its selling power abroad . “ earlier german cars stood for high quality , for security , and for a while , even for high environmental standards , " resch said .
" but , we 're now noticing that even in the united states , more and more cars are not being able to sell , because the emissions are too high .
we see a big danger if the very high priced cars in germany can ’ t be sold in the whole asian market anymore because of environmental regulations . " tighter regulations needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opel astra diesel hybrid concept vehicle is shown during media previews at the north american international auto show in detroit , jan .
9 , 2005 .
instead of hyping faster motors and new state-of-art fuel pumps , deutsche umwelthilfe says that the german automobile industry need more incentive to focus on the development of alternatives to traditional engines , like environmentally-friendly hybrid models and more energy-efficient diesel motors . it has proposed tighter regulations similar to those being implemented in japan and china within the next few years .

13 , 1980 , some of these " dangerous organizations " joined forces after a long debate about the necessity of founding a new party : " die grünen " or " the greens " were born .
few believed that the party would survive .
debates over the inclusion of left-wing radicals foreshadowed the later power struggles between ecological radicals , the so-called " fundis , " and pragmatic " realos . "
politically , the greens questioned the status quo from the start : calls for an immediate end to the use of nuclear power , the dissolution of nato and an ecologically oriented economy scared away potential voters .

additionally , the party limited itself by imposing a strict political culture .
for many years , elected members of parliament had to give up their seats mid-term to make room for others .
until recently the greens also did not allow party functionaries to hold public office at the same time .
joschka 's sneakers still , german society quickly warmed to the party 's ecologically-oriented politics at the beginning of the 1980s while the big parties still did n't have the subject on their agenda .
because of this , the greens were able to get enough votes to enter local and state parliaments throughout germany , culminating in the first " red-green " coalition government with the social democrats in the central state of hesse in 1985 .

at the time , though , joschka fischer caused an uproar when he took his oath of office wearing jeans and sneakers .
while successful with voters , the greens began falling apart from the inside as " fundis " and " realos " kept fighting about the future of the party .
the low point was reached with german unification in 1990 : campaigning with the slogan " everyone talks about germany .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the united party 's logo only members of the greens ' eastern german sister party , " bündnis 90 , " or alliance 90 , managed to garner seats .
the two parties finally merged in 1993 and the greens are now officially called " bündnis 90 / die grünen . "
reaching for power a year later , the party , now led by " realos " around joschka fischer , re-entered parliament and reached its high point in 1998 , when the greens became the junior partner in germany 's governing coalition with the social democrats for the first time .
by then , the party had gone through a tremendous process of transformation , reflected in its approval of the participation of german soldiers in the nato-led kosovo mission in 1999 .
fischer can take the credit for the turn-around in the party , according to korte .
" this was probably the biggest challenge for a party that was founded on a pacifist platform , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer -lrb- left -rrb- and german chancellor gerhard schröder together with the social democrats , the greens made a number of difficult decisions in the following years .
they opted for reforms to germany 's tax and social welfare systems and approved other military missions to macedonia and afghanistan .
while social democrats have lost voters in elections since 2002 , the greens managed to hold onto their seats or increase them almost everywhere .
and for years , fischer has led the list of germany 's most popular politicians .

and while the social democrats still seem to be the greens ' natural coalition partner , that could change in the future , according to korte .
on the municipal level , coalitions with the conservative christian democrats already exist - cologne is the most prominent example .
the southwestern state of baden-württemberg is the most likely candidate for a " black-green " coalition , korte said .

reaching for power a year later , the party , now led by " realos " around joschka fischer , re-entered parliament and reached its high point in 1998 , when the greens became the junior partner in germany 's governing coalition with the social democrats for the first time .
by then , the party had gone through a tremendous process of transformation , reflected in its approval of the participation of german soldiers in the nato-led kosovo mission in 1999 .

" a danger for democracy " - that 's what a leading german social democrat called so-called " green lists " - a conglomeration of environmentalist , peace and anti-nuclear groups - back in 1977 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the greens first leadership at the founding convention on jan .
13 , 1980 just three years later , on jan .
13 , 1980 , some of these " dangerous organizations " joined forces after a long debate about the necessity of founding a new party : " die grünen " or " the greens " were born .
few believed that the party would survive .
debates over the inclusion of left-wing radicals foreshadowed the later power struggles between ecological radicals , the so-called " fundis , " and pragmatic " realos . "
politically , the greens questioned the status quo from the start : calls for an immediate end to the use of nuclear power , the dissolution of nato and an ecologically oriented economy scared away potential voters .
environment first but the greens deserve the biggest credit for putting the protection of the environment at the center of their agenda , according to karl-rudolf korte , a political scientist at the university of duisburg / essen .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the phasing out of nuclear power has been a priority for the greens " this led established parties to take up these topics , " he said , adding that state and federal governments responded by setting up ministries for the environment .
the success became a danger for the greens , however , as others adopted their agenda and made it their own , korte said .
additionally , the party limited itself by imposing a strict political culture .
for many years , elected members of parliament had to give up their seats mid-term to make room for others .
until recently the greens also did not allow party functionaries to hold public office at the same time .
joschka 's sneakers still , german society quickly warmed to the party 's ecologically-oriented politics at the beginning of the 1980s while the big parties still did n't have the subject on their agenda .
because of this , the greens were able to get enough votes to enter local and state parliaments throughout germany , culminating in the first " red-green " coalition government with the social democrats in the central state of hesse in 1985 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer -lrb- right -rrb- taking the oath of office as hesse 's environmental minister on dec .
12 , 1985 that government 's environmental minister - the first in germany - later became the country 's foreign minister .
at the time , though , joschka fischer caused an uproar when he took his oath of office wearing jeans and sneakers .
while successful with voters , the greens began falling apart from the inside as " fundis " and " realos " kept fighting about the future of the party .
the low point was reached with german unification in 1990 : campaigning with the slogan " everyone talks about germany .

german politicians seeking to outlaw secret paternity tests won a first battle on wednesday , much to the disappointment of fathers ' rights groups hoping for greater justice in the areas of alimony and child support . the german federal court of justice decided on wednesday that paternity tests carried out in secret are inadmissible as evidence in a lawsuit .
unless the mother gave her consent for the test , the child 's personal rights would be violated , the court in karlsruhe ruled .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lab technician at the " id-labor " in wiesbaden conducts a paternity test .
the decision was welcomed by german justice minister brigitte zypries , who is leading a campaign to make secret paternity tests illegal under a new law regulating the use of genetic data .
" these tests are a serious invasion of the private sphere , " zypries said .
" if a man has doubts about his paternity , he should talk about this with the mother . "
campaigners for fathers ' rights in germany say making secret paternity tests punishable would be yet another blow to men who already get the short end of the stick when it comes to laws regulating alimony , child support , and child custody following a divorce or separation .
" it can not be that , as a woman , i have the right to make my husband pay to support a child that is not his own , or to deny children the right to know who their real father is , " said dr. karin jäckel , an active supporter of the fathers ' rights movement and author of several books on the subject .
" men are , in every respect , held responsible for their children under our laws , which is why they have the right to know who their children are . "

while the battle over paternity tests continues , justice minister zypries has also announced an overhaul of german laws on alimony .
divorced dads are hopeful that the changes will mean more justice for them .
the growing fathers ' rights movement in germany rejects the stereotype of the heartless man who abandons his family for a new relationship .
in reality , they say , the situation is very different .
women file for divorce more frequently than men , and are more often awarded custody of the children .
and in cases where a divorce is contested , fathers frequently become estranged from their children , making it harder for fathers to gain custody rights once the divorce is settled , jäckel said .
despite this emotional strain , fathers are still seen as the familial breadwinner , and can often find themselves burdened for life with child support and alimony payments to ex-wives .
" in cases where the man earns a lot and can pay for everyone , there 's no problem .
but we 're seeing more frequently that the man 's income is n't enough for everyone , " zypries said in an interview with the women 's magazine brigitte .
ideally , she said , both partners would take financial responsibility for themselves after a divorce .
" a man ca n't be expected to support his ex-wife for years , especially if she could go back to work , and as a consequence not have the money to support children from a second marriage , " she said .

unlike in britain , where the activist group fathers 4 justice has successfully attracted attention to the plight of divorced dads through spectacular stunts , campaigns by similar german groups have " barely registered politically , " jäckel said , adding that ploys aimed at grabbing media attention can make a desperate father 's situation even worse .
" i 've often seen it happen here that fathers who go to the media to publicize their cases are punished by the judges , " she said .
" in the worst case , this can even result in their custody rights being taken away .
the judges ' logic is that dragging a case of unfair treatment into the public eye only damages the child 's rights , and that someone who would do this is a bad father .

german politicians seeking to outlaw secret paternity tests won a first battle on wednesday , much to the disappointment of fathers ' rights groups hoping for greater justice in the areas of alimony and child support . the german federal court of justice decided on wednesday that paternity tests carried out in secret are inadmissible as evidence in a lawsuit .
unless the mother gave her consent for the test , the child 's personal rights would be violated , the court in karlsruhe ruled .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lab technician at the " id-labor " in wiesbaden conducts a paternity test .
the decision was welcomed by german justice minister brigitte zypries , who is leading a campaign to make secret paternity tests illegal under a new law regulating the use of genetic data .
" these tests are a serious invasion of the private sphere , " zypries said .
" if a man has doubts about his paternity , he should talk about this with the mother . "
campaigners for fathers ' rights in germany say making secret paternity tests punishable would be yet another blow to men who already get the short end of the stick when it comes to laws regulating alimony , child support , and child custody following a divorce or separation .
" it can not be that , as a woman , i have the right to make my husband pay to support a child that is not his own , or to deny children the right to know who their real father is , " said dr. karin jäckel , an active supporter of the fathers ' rights movement and author of several books on the subject .
" men are , in every respect , held responsible for their children under our laws , which is why they have the right to know who their children are . "
modernizing alimony bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a father walks with his son in a düsseldorf park .
while the battle over paternity tests continues , justice minister zypries has also announced an overhaul of german laws on alimony .
divorced dads are hopeful that the changes will mean more justice for them .
the growing fathers ' rights movement in germany rejects the stereotype of the heartless man who abandons his family for a new relationship .
in reality , they say , the situation is very different .
women file for divorce more frequently than men , and are more often awarded custody of the children .
and in cases where a divorce is contested , fathers frequently become estranged from their children , making it harder for fathers to gain custody rights once the divorce is settled , jäckel said .
despite this emotional strain , fathers are still seen as the familial breadwinner , and can often find themselves burdened for life with child support and alimony payments to ex-wives .
" in cases where the man earns a lot and can pay for everyone , there 's no problem .
but we 're seeing more frequently that the man 's income is n't enough for everyone , " zypries said in an interview with the women 's magazine brigitte .
ideally , she said , both partners would take financial responsibility for themselves after a divorce .
" a man ca n't be expected to support his ex-wife for years , especially if she could go back to work , and as a consequence not have the money to support children from a second marriage , " she said .

germany 's constitutional judges sided with him , saying that tests have become so good at detecting thc that it 's hard to tell when a person has actually had a joint for the last time .
the man got his license back and anyone caught with a level of up to 1 ng / ml will be allowed to keep driving in the future . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european cannabis use at all time high cannabis remains the most commonly used drug in the eu with roughly one in five adult europeans having tried it at least once in their lifetime .

" there is a list of up to 100 persons in different parliaments , on several levels , on state level , on regional level , being paid by carmaker volkswagen , " resch said .
" for example the mayor of wolfsburg , the city where volkswagen is situated , gets a salary by this company . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw manufacturing factory in wolfsburg volkswagen has also had its hand in watering down recent legislation for higher environmental standards proposed by the green party , which would have required fine particle dust filters in diesel motors . all it took , resch said , was a letter from volkswagen head bernd pischetsrieder to members of parliament . " in this letter pischetsrieder complained that tax incentives for particle filters would harm his company and the car industry in germany and would be bad for the economy , " resch said .
" with this letter he -lrb- pischetsrieder -rrb- was able to stop the entire parliamentary process . " a lobbyist in disguise ? deutsche umwelthilfe 's allegations against german companies come at a time of intense debate in the country about whether politicians should be allowed to hold down a normal job while carrying out their duties as an elected member of parliament or whether that would inevitably lead to a conflict of interests and turn parliamentarians into mere lobbyist for industry . under german law , parliamentarians are indeed allowed to work " on the side " as long as they do not earn more than € 3,000 a month or € 18,000 a year on top of their salaries as a member of parliament . but the system 's critics claim that such a practice could easily give rise to a conflict of interest . " the parliamentarian must not be a lobbyist in disguise , " jochen bäumel of transparency international told news agency afp .
" only by publishing their additional income can the electorate know whose interests they really represent . " companies under pressure spearheaded by mass-selling daily bild , the campaign to publish fat-cat corporate salaries has put pressure on german companies to reveal details of their links with politicians . volkswagen has already announced that it plans to release a list of employees on its books who also hold a political office .
vw ceo pischetsrieder is expected to announce the details on thursday .
bild reported this week that vw had six social democratic parliamentarians on its payrolls over the last six years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : laurenz meyer the issue has already caused heads to roll in the conservative opposition christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
secretary general of the party , laurenz meyer stepped down last month after it emerged that he had received substantial payouts from energy giant rwe , his former employer , while holding political office . harmful for economy too however , deutsche umwelthilfe claims that the dilution of climate-friendly laws through the nexus of politicians and car industry officials is not only harmful to the german environment , but may hurt the economy in the long run as well . countries like china and japan have lowered the ceilings for acceptable fuel consumption in automobiles , and even the us has stricter emissions standards than germany .
many german luxury cars do not meet the new guidelines .
jürgen resch warns that “ made in germany ” may lose its selling power abroad . “ earlier german cars stood for high quality , for security , and for a while , even for high environmental standards , " resch said .
" but , we 're now noticing that even in the united states , more and more cars are not being able to sell , because the emissions are too high .
we see a big danger if the very high priced cars in germany can ’ t be sold in the whole asian market anymore because of environmental regulations . " tighter regulations needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opel astra diesel hybrid concept vehicle is shown during media previews at the north american international auto show in detroit , jan .
9 , 2005 .
instead of hyping faster motors and new state-of-art fuel pumps , deutsche umwelthilfe says that the german automobile industry need more incentive to focus on the development of alternatives to traditional engines , like environmentally-friendly hybrid models and more energy-efficient diesel motors . it has proposed tighter regulations similar to those being implemented in japan and china within the next few years .
whether these will put german cars on the fast track in asia remains to be seen . kateri jochum -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german opposition deputy resigns german opposition leader angela merkel 's deputy , laurenz meyer , resigned on wednesday after being heavily criticized for failing to fully declare payments and electricity subsidies he received from his former employer .

but his latest caper - dressing as a nazi at a costume party , tops them all . the photo splashed across the british tabloid the sun shows a lanky prince harry wearing the tan uniform of the nazi 's afrika korps , complete with red and black swastika armband , holding a drink in one hand and a cigarette in the other .
and it begs the question : " harry , what were you thinking ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's prince harry the youngest son of the late princess diana and heir-to-the-throne prince charles may be the " wild child " of the british royal family , but surely he knows better ?
and if he does n't , then why did n't one of his minders , or at least big brother william , who attended the " native and colonial " party in a much tamer lion costume , warn the wayward redhead ? harry 's timing could n't be worse .
in just two weeks ' time , his grandmother , queen elizabeth , is due to host a reception for survivors of the holocaust before representing the nation at the holocaust memorial day national event . jewish leaders outraged jewish leaders have already spoken out about the incident .
the simon wiesenthal center , one of the world 's leading jewish human rights organizations , called it " a shameful act … displaying insensitivity " to both holocaust victims and allied soldiers " who gave their lives to defeat nazism . " its founder , rabbi marvin hier , said harry ought to go to auschwitz with his uncle , prince edward , head of the british delegation for the 60th anniversary commemorations . " there he will see the results of the hated symbol he so foolishly and brazenly chose to wear , " hier said . a ' poor choice ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the british tabloid " the sun " splashed a photo from the party over its front page in a statement from clarence house , harry apologized for what he called " a poor choice of costume . "
but there have been calls by british politicians for the prince to appear in person to make his own public apology . " if he wants to be considered an adult , he 's got to behave like an adult , and he has got to apologize in person , through radio and television , " said former royal press spokesman dicky arbiter . others , including rabbi dr. jonathan romain of the reform synagogues of great britain , are prepared to put the incident down to the folly of youth and let the prince 's apology stand . the fact that the palace has issued an apology indicates that this was a mistake by the prince , " romain said .
" but having been given , the apology should now be accepted . " career consequences ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prince harry , youngest son of the prince of wales and grandson of britain 's queen elizabeth ii , took charge of a 48-strong parade of military cadets at eton school tuesday night may 26 2003 , fuelling speculation that he may opt for a military career .
harry , 18 , was appointed commander of eton 's combined cadet force 's formal trooping of the colour ceremony.the prince of wales was among those looking on as his youngest son led the guard of honour 's march out on to college field with their colours at the yearly tattoo , held since òthe corpsó was founded in 1860 .
-lrb- ap photo / pa -rrb- * * united kingdom out magazines out no sales * * the costume choice could prove to have serious consequences for harry , as already , there have been calls to bar him from attending the elite sandhurst military academy later this year .
" i do n't think this young man is suitable for sandhurst , " said doug henderson , a former armed forces minister in prime minister tony blair 's government .
" if it was anyone else , the application would n't be considered .
it should be withdrawn immediately . " in germany , the costume scandal is likely to renew complaints that british perceptions of the country remain skewed by the nazi era .

26 . indonesia , the nation worst-hit by the tidal wave disaster , has an external debt of $ 132 billion -lrb- € 100 billion -rrb- according to the world bank , of which more than $ 70 billion is owed to public creditors or has been guaranteed by public bodies and is eligible for the paris club offer .
indonesia would have to pay more than $ 3 billion in principal payments alone this year - about the same amount it needs to recover from the crisis . german foreign minister joschka fischer said the debt moratorium was " an important step forward " and " an element of aid that can not be underestimated . " doubts linger however , wirayuda admitted that his country still had lingering doubts about taking up the offer . " we do not want that it harms our economy , " he told reporters in berlin .
" we do n't want the market to go wrongly and we do n't want our creditworthiness to be negatively influenced . " in contrast to indonesia , countries such as india , thailand and malaysia have already decided not to accept the freeze on debt repayment for fear they would lose their credit rating on financial markets . indonesia 's fears were echoed by german finance minister hans eichel , who also held talks with wirayuda on thursday . " one must be very prudent as far as the paris club is concerned , " he said and underlined that any debt measures " could put financial credibility in peril .
and that is something they -lrb- indonesia -rrb- do not want .
indonesia is neither in an economic crisis nor a financial crisis and clearly prefers aid to a debt freeze . " complete waiver problematic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paris club chairman jean pierre jouyet the paris club of donors ' decision to suspend the debts of tsunami-hit nations rather than completely waive it has come in for criticism from aid organizations such as oxfam and anti-globalization group attac . but , experts have pointed out that a complete debt waiver could be problematic .
rolf langhammer of the institute for world economics in kiel told deutsche welle that it would n't just damage the credit reputation of the nations , but could also prompt a " chain reaction " with other countries who have also suffered other catastrophes lining up to stake their claim . langhammer also added that it was n't clear whether forgiving debt " would really lead to the money reaching the ones really suffering . " wirayuda plays down troop restrictions on thursday , wirayuda also played down earlier statements by the indonesian government that foreign troops involved in emergency aid operations in the devastated aceh province should not stay longer than three months . the foreign minister stressed that jakarta welcomed the military aid deployments , including germany 's , but added that their presence was a " delicate issue for the indonesian public . " wirayuda said that restrictions on the movement of aid workers in aceh were only for their own safety and denied the rules would hinder international relief operations .
at the same time , he said he was open for the truce offer made by separatist muslim rebels in aceh to the government in jakarta . " there is a silver lining on the horizon , " wirayuda said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers german foreign minister fischer underlined his government 's long-term commitment to help indonesia overcome the devastation wrought by the tsunami disaster and said that german soldiers stationed in aceh with a mobile field hospital and relief supplies ship , would " stay in the region as long as it makes sense and as long as the indonesian government wished .

26 . indonesia , the nation worst-hit by the tidal wave disaster , has an external debt of $ 132 billion -lrb- € 100 billion -rrb- according to the world bank , of which more than $ 70 billion is owed to public creditors or has been guaranteed by public bodies and is eligible for the paris club offer .
indonesia would have to pay more than $ 3 billion in principal payments alone this year - about the same amount it needs to recover from the crisis . german foreign minister joschka fischer said the debt moratorium was " an important step forward " and " an element of aid that can not be underestimated . " doubts linger however , wirayuda admitted that his country still had lingering doubts about taking up the offer . " we do not want that it harms our economy , " he told reporters in berlin .
" we do n't want the market to go wrongly and we do n't want our creditworthiness to be negatively influenced . " in contrast to indonesia , countries such as india , thailand and malaysia have already decided not to accept the freeze on debt repayment for fear they would lose their credit rating on financial markets . indonesia 's fears were echoed by german finance minister hans eichel , who also held talks with wirayuda on thursday . " one must be very prudent as far as the paris club is concerned , " he said and underlined that any debt measures " could put financial credibility in peril .
and that is something they -lrb- indonesia -rrb- do not want .
indonesia is neither in an economic crisis nor a financial crisis and clearly prefers aid to a debt freeze . " complete waiver problematic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paris club chairman jean pierre jouyet the paris club of donors ' decision to suspend the debts of tsunami-hit nations rather than completely waive it has come in for criticism from aid organizations such as oxfam and anti-globalization group attac . but , experts have pointed out that a complete debt waiver could be problematic .
rolf langhammer of the institute for world economics in kiel told deutsche welle that it would n't just damage the credit reputation of the nations , but could also prompt a " chain reaction " with other countries who have also suffered other catastrophes lining up to stake their claim . langhammer also added that it was n't clear whether forgiving debt " would really lead to the money reaching the ones really suffering . " wirayuda plays down troop restrictions on thursday , wirayuda also played down earlier statements by the indonesian government that foreign troops involved in emergency aid operations in the devastated aceh province should not stay longer than three months . the foreign minister stressed that jakarta welcomed the military aid deployments , including germany 's , but added that their presence was a " delicate issue for the indonesian public . " wirayuda said that restrictions on the movement of aid workers in aceh were only for their own safety and denied the rules would hinder international relief operations .
at the same time , he said he was open for the truce offer made by separatist muslim rebels in aceh to the government in jakarta . " there is a silver lining on the horizon , " wirayuda said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers german foreign minister fischer underlined his government 's long-term commitment to help indonesia overcome the devastation wrought by the tsunami disaster and said that german soldiers stationed in aceh with a mobile field hospital and relief supplies ship , would " stay in the region as long as it makes sense and as long as the indonesian government wished .

26 . indonesia , the nation worst-hit by the tidal wave disaster , has an external debt of $ 132 billion -lrb- € 100 billion -rrb- according to the world bank , of which more than $ 70 billion is owed to public creditors or has been guaranteed by public bodies and is eligible for the paris club offer .
indonesia would have to pay more than $ 3 billion in principal payments alone this year - about the same amount it needs to recover from the crisis . german foreign minister joschka fischer said the debt moratorium was " an important step forward " and " an element of aid that can not be underestimated . " doubts linger however , wirayuda admitted that his country still had lingering doubts about taking up the offer . " we do not want that it harms our economy , " he told reporters in berlin .
" we do n't want the market to go wrongly and we do n't want our creditworthiness to be negatively influenced . " in contrast to indonesia , countries such as india , thailand and malaysia have already decided not to accept the freeze on debt repayment for fear they would lose their credit rating on financial markets . indonesia 's fears were echoed by german finance minister hans eichel , who also held talks with wirayuda on thursday . " one must be very prudent as far as the paris club is concerned , " he said and underlined that any debt measures " could put financial credibility in peril .
and that is something they -lrb- indonesia -rrb- do not want .
indonesia is neither in an economic crisis nor a financial crisis and clearly prefers aid to a debt freeze . " complete waiver problematic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paris club chairman jean pierre jouyet the paris club of donors ' decision to suspend the debts of tsunami-hit nations rather than completely waive it has come in for criticism from aid organizations such as oxfam and anti-globalization group attac . but , experts have pointed out that a complete debt waiver could be problematic .
rolf langhammer of the institute for world economics in kiel told deutsche welle that it would n't just damage the credit reputation of the nations , but could also prompt a " chain reaction " with other countries who have also suffered other catastrophes lining up to stake their claim . langhammer also added that it was n't clear whether forgiving debt " would really lead to the money reaching the ones really suffering . " wirayuda plays down troop restrictions on thursday , wirayuda also played down earlier statements by the indonesian government that foreign troops involved in emergency aid operations in the devastated aceh province should not stay longer than three months . the foreign minister stressed that jakarta welcomed the military aid deployments , including germany 's , but added that their presence was a " delicate issue for the indonesian public . " wirayuda said that restrictions on the movement of aid workers in aceh were only for their own safety and denied the rules would hinder international relief operations .
at the same time , he said he was open for the truce offer made by separatist muslim rebels in aceh to the government in jakarta . " there is a silver lining on the horizon , " wirayuda said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers german foreign minister fischer underlined his government 's long-term commitment to help indonesia overcome the devastation wrought by the tsunami disaster and said that german soldiers stationed in aceh with a mobile field hospital and relief supplies ship , would " stay in the region as long as it makes sense and as long as the indonesian government wished .

his opponent , viktor yanukovych , has once again used the courts to put off the transfer of power . stall tactics the inauguration can only take place after the election result is published in one of the two official newspapers , and the ukraine supreme court has barred both papers from printing it until former prime minister viktor yanukovych has a last chance to appeal the outcome in a court of law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yushchenko declaring victory , with ukrainian pop star .
but how soon yanukovych 's latest appeal will finally be filed and decided on is uncertain . yushchenko was finally declared the winner of the ukraine presidential election on jan .
10 , two weeks after the re-run of an earlier election that was declared invalid because of voter fraud .
but yanukovych - who agreed to a new election only after his hand was forced by a massive popular uprising – has managed to hold up the poll result at every turn . currently , yanukovych is appealing the election , claiming it was invalid . ' we will never be satisfied ' “ if the court fails to comply with our demands , we have the right to act within the framework of our legislation , " yanukovych said .
" we ’ ll appeal to the european court of justice .

now , the country 's highest court has made the weed even acceptable for car drivers .
sort of , at least . legally speaking , stoners still face penalties if caught with the drug .
but prosecution is usually dropped if the amount of dope found on a person is considered small enough to show that it 's not intended for sale but rather personal consumption . despite a ruling by germany 's highest court , the federal constitutional court , to introduce a nationwide policy , german states still handle this differently , with negligible amounts ranging from 6 grams -lrb- 0.2 ounces -rrb- to 30 grams . but car drivers have still faced harsh punishments when caught high on the highway .
anyone testing positive for tetrahydrocannabinol -lrb- thc -rrb- , the psychoactive ingredient of cannabis , has lost his or her drivers license so far . this also happened to one man , who had smoked a joint the night before visiting a police station on an unrelated matter .
police officers noticed his strange behavior and convinced him to give a voluntary urine sample that revealed a thc level of 0.5 nanograms per milliliter -lrb- ng / ml -rrb- . his license was taken away from him by a lower court , but the man pursued the case all the way to the top .
germany 's constitutional judges sided with him , saying that tests have become so good at detecting thc that it 's hard to tell when a person has actually had a joint for the last time .
the man got his license back and anyone caught with a level of up to 1 ng / ml will be allowed to keep driving in the future . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european cannabis use at all time high cannabis remains the most commonly used drug in the eu with roughly one in five adult europeans having tried it at least once in their lifetime .

but his latest caper - dressing as a nazi at a costume party , tops them all . the photo splashed across the british tabloid the sun shows a lanky prince harry wearing the tan uniform of the nazi 's afrika korps , complete with red and black swastika armband , holding a drink in one hand and a cigarette in the other .
and it begs the question : " harry , what were you thinking ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's prince harry the youngest son of the late princess diana and heir-to-the-throne prince charles may be the " wild child " of the british royal family , but surely he knows better ?
and if he does n't , then why did n't one of his minders , or at least big brother william , who attended the " native and colonial " party in a much tamer lion costume , warn the wayward redhead ? harry 's timing could n't be worse .
in just two weeks ' time , his grandmother , queen elizabeth , is due to host a reception for survivors of the holocaust before representing the nation at the holocaust memorial day national event . jewish leaders outraged jewish leaders have already spoken out about the incident .
the simon wiesenthal center , one of the world 's leading jewish human rights organizations , called it " a shameful act … displaying insensitivity " to both holocaust victims and allied soldiers " who gave their lives to defeat nazism . " its founder , rabbi marvin hier , said harry ought to go to auschwitz with his uncle , prince edward , head of the british delegation for the 60th anniversary commemorations . " there he will see the results of the hated symbol he so foolishly and brazenly chose to wear , " hier said . a ' poor choice ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the british tabloid " the sun " splashed a photo from the party over its front page in a statement from clarence house , harry apologized for what he called " a poor choice of costume . "
but there have been calls by british politicians for the prince to appear in person to make his own public apology . " if he wants to be considered an adult , he 's got to behave like an adult , and he has got to apologize in person , through radio and television , " said former royal press spokesman dicky arbiter . others , including rabbi dr. jonathan romain of the reform synagogues of great britain , are prepared to put the incident down to the folly of youth and let the prince 's apology stand . the fact that the palace has issued an apology indicates that this was a mistake by the prince , " romain said .
" but having been given , the apology should now be accepted . " career consequences ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prince harry , youngest son of the prince of wales and grandson of britain 's queen elizabeth ii , took charge of a 48-strong parade of military cadets at eton school tuesday night may 26 2003 , fuelling speculation that he may opt for a military career .
harry , 18 , was appointed commander of eton 's combined cadet force 's formal trooping of the colour ceremony.the prince of wales was among those looking on as his youngest son led the guard of honour 's march out on to college field with their colours at the yearly tattoo , held since òthe corpsó was founded in 1860 .
-lrb- ap photo / pa -rrb- * * united kingdom out magazines out no sales * * the costume choice could prove to have serious consequences for harry , as already , there have been calls to bar him from attending the elite sandhurst military academy later this year .
" i do n't think this young man is suitable for sandhurst , " said doug henderson , a former armed forces minister in prime minister tony blair 's government .
" if it was anyone else , the application would n't be considered .
it should be withdrawn immediately . " in germany , the costume scandal is likely to renew complaints that british perceptions of the country remain skewed by the nazi era .

" there is a list of up to 100 persons in different parliaments , on several levels , on state level , on regional level , being paid by carmaker volkswagen , " resch said .
" for example the mayor of wolfsburg , the city where volkswagen is situated , gets a salary by this company . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw manufacturing factory in wolfsburg volkswagen has also had its hand in watering down recent legislation for higher environmental standards proposed by the green party , which would have required fine particle dust filters in diesel motors . all it took , resch said , was a letter from volkswagen head bernd pischetsrieder to members of parliament . " in this letter pischetsrieder complained that tax incentives for particle filters would harm his company and the car industry in germany and would be bad for the economy , " resch said .
" with this letter he -lrb- pischetsrieder -rrb- was able to stop the entire parliamentary process . " a lobbyist in disguise ? deutsche umwelthilfe 's allegations against german companies come at a time of intense debate in the country about whether politicians should be allowed to hold down a normal job while carrying out their duties as an elected member of parliament or whether that would inevitably lead to a conflict of interests and turn parliamentarians into mere lobbyist for industry . under german law , parliamentarians are indeed allowed to work " on the side " as long as they do not earn more than € 3,000 a month or € 18,000 a year on top of their salaries as a member of parliament . but the system 's critics claim that such a practice could easily give rise to a conflict of interest . " the parliamentarian must not be a lobbyist in disguise , " jochen bäumel of transparency international told news agency afp .
" only by publishing their additional income can the electorate know whose interests they really represent . " companies under pressure spearheaded by mass-selling daily bild , the campaign to publish fat-cat corporate salaries has put pressure on german companies to reveal details of their links with politicians . volkswagen has already announced that it plans to release a list of employees on its books who also hold a political office .
vw ceo pischetsrieder is expected to announce the details on thursday .
bild reported this week that vw had six social democratic parliamentarians on its payrolls over the last six years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : laurenz meyer the issue has already caused heads to roll in the conservative opposition christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
secretary general of the party , laurenz meyer stepped down last month after it emerged that he had received substantial payouts from energy giant rwe , his former employer , while holding political office . harmful for economy too however , deutsche umwelthilfe claims that the dilution of climate-friendly laws through the nexus of politicians and car industry officials is not only harmful to the german environment , but may hurt the economy in the long run as well . countries like china and japan have lowered the ceilings for acceptable fuel consumption in automobiles , and even the us has stricter emissions standards than germany .
many german luxury cars do not meet the new guidelines .
jürgen resch warns that “ made in germany ” may lose its selling power abroad . “ earlier german cars stood for high quality , for security , and for a while , even for high environmental standards , " resch said .
" but , we 're now noticing that even in the united states , more and more cars are not being able to sell , because the emissions are too high .
we see a big danger if the very high priced cars in germany can ’ t be sold in the whole asian market anymore because of environmental regulations . " tighter regulations needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opel astra diesel hybrid concept vehicle is shown during media previews at the north american international auto show in detroit , jan .
9 , 2005 .
instead of hyping faster motors and new state-of-art fuel pumps , deutsche umwelthilfe says that the german automobile industry need more incentive to focus on the development of alternatives to traditional engines , like environmentally-friendly hybrid models and more energy-efficient diesel motors . it has proposed tighter regulations similar to those being implemented in japan and china within the next few years .

" a danger for democracy " - that 's what a leading german social democrat called so-called " green lists " - a conglomeration of environmentalist , peace and anti-nuclear groups - back in 1977 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the greens first leadership at the founding convention on jan .
13 , 1980 just three years later , on jan .
13 , 1980 , some of these " dangerous organizations " joined forces after a long debate about the necessity of founding a new party : " die grünen " or " the greens " were born .
few believed that the party would survive .
debates over the inclusion of left-wing radicals foreshadowed the later power struggles between ecological radicals , the so-called " fundis , " and pragmatic " realos . "
politically , the greens questioned the status quo from the start : calls for an immediate end to the use of nuclear power , the dissolution of nato and an ecologically oriented economy scared away potential voters .
environment first but the greens deserve the biggest credit for putting the protection of the environment at the center of their agenda , according to karl-rudolf korte , a political scientist at the university of duisburg / essen .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the phasing out of nuclear power has been a priority for the greens " this led established parties to take up these topics , " he said , adding that state and federal governments responded by setting up ministries for the environment .
the success became a danger for the greens , however , as others adopted their agenda and made it their own , korte said .
additionally , the party limited itself by imposing a strict political culture .
for many years , elected members of parliament had to give up their seats mid-term to make room for others .
until recently the greens also did not allow party functionaries to hold public office at the same time .
joschka 's sneakers still , german society quickly warmed to the party 's ecologically-oriented politics at the beginning of the 1980s while the big parties still did n't have the subject on their agenda .
because of this , the greens were able to get enough votes to enter local and state parliaments throughout germany , culminating in the first " red-green " coalition government with the social democrats in the central state of hesse in 1985 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer -lrb- right -rrb- taking the oath of office as hesse 's environmental minister on dec .
12 , 1985 that government 's environmental minister - the first in germany - later became the country 's foreign minister .
at the time , though , joschka fischer caused an uproar when he took his oath of office wearing jeans and sneakers .
while successful with voters , the greens began falling apart from the inside as " fundis " and " realos " kept fighting about the future of the party .
the low point was reached with german unification in 1990 : campaigning with the slogan " everyone talks about germany .
we talk about climate , " the greens failed to win over voters and were kicked out of parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the united party 's logo only members of the greens ' eastern german sister party , " bündnis 90 , " or alliance 90 , managed to garner seats .
the two parties finally merged in 1993 and the greens are now officially called " bündnis 90 / die grünen . "
reaching for power a year later , the party , now led by " realos " around joschka fischer , re-entered parliament and reached its high point in 1998 , when the greens became the junior partner in germany 's governing coalition with the social democrats for the first time .
by then , the party had gone through a tremendous process of transformation , reflected in its approval of the participation of german soldiers in the nato-led kosovo mission in 1999 .
fischer can take the credit for the turn-around in the party , according to korte .
" this was probably the biggest challenge for a party that was founded on a pacifist platform , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer -lrb- left -rrb- and german chancellor gerhard schröder together with the social democrats , the greens made a number of difficult decisions in the following years .
they opted for reforms to germany 's tax and social welfare systems and approved other military missions to macedonia and afghanistan .
while social democrats have lost voters in elections since 2002 , the greens managed to hold onto their seats or increase them almost everywhere .
and for years , fischer has led the list of germany 's most popular politicians .
black future ?
but the party 's base remains a distinctly western german one - a fact that does n't surprise danial cohn-bendit -lrb- photo below -rrb- , a prominent green member of the european parliament .

" a danger for democracy " - that 's what a leading german social democrat called so-called " green lists " - a conglomeration of environmentalist , peace and anti-nuclear groups - back in 1977 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the greens first leadership at the founding convention on jan .
13 , 1980 just three years later , on jan .
13 , 1980 , some of these " dangerous organizations " joined forces after a long debate about the necessity of founding a new party : " die grünen " or " the greens " were born .
few believed that the party would survive .
debates over the inclusion of left-wing radicals foreshadowed the later power struggles between ecological radicals , the so-called " fundis , " and pragmatic " realos . "
politically , the greens questioned the status quo from the start : calls for an immediate end to the use of nuclear power , the dissolution of nato and an ecologically oriented economy scared away potential voters .
environment first but the greens deserve the biggest credit for putting the protection of the environment at the center of their agenda , according to karl-rudolf korte , a political scientist at the university of duisburg / essen .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the phasing out of nuclear power has been a priority for the greens " this led established parties to take up these topics , " he said , adding that state and federal governments responded by setting up ministries for the environment .
the success became a danger for the greens , however , as others adopted their agenda and made it their own , korte said .
additionally , the party limited itself by imposing a strict political culture .
for many years , elected members of parliament had to give up their seats mid-term to make room for others .
until recently the greens also did not allow party functionaries to hold public office at the same time .
joschka 's sneakers still , german society quickly warmed to the party 's ecologically-oriented politics at the beginning of the 1980s while the big parties still did n't have the subject on their agenda .
because of this , the greens were able to get enough votes to enter local and state parliaments throughout germany , culminating in the first " red-green " coalition government with the social democrats in the central state of hesse in 1985 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer -lrb- right -rrb- taking the oath of office as hesse 's environmental minister on dec .
12 , 1985 that government 's environmental minister - the first in germany - later became the country 's foreign minister .
at the time , though , joschka fischer caused an uproar when he took his oath of office wearing jeans and sneakers .
while successful with voters , the greens began falling apart from the inside as " fundis " and " realos " kept fighting about the future of the party .
the low point was reached with german unification in 1990 : campaigning with the slogan " everyone talks about germany .
we talk about climate , " the greens failed to win over voters and were kicked out of parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the united party 's logo only members of the greens ' eastern german sister party , " bündnis 90 , " or alliance 90 , managed to garner seats .
the two parties finally merged in 1993 and the greens are now officially called " bündnis 90 / die grünen . "
reaching for power a year later , the party , now led by " realos " around joschka fischer , re-entered parliament and reached its high point in 1998 , when the greens became the junior partner in germany 's governing coalition with the social democrats for the first time .
by then , the party had gone through a tremendous process of transformation , reflected in its approval of the participation of german soldiers in the nato-led kosovo mission in 1999 .
fischer can take the credit for the turn-around in the party , according to korte .
" this was probably the biggest challenge for a party that was founded on a pacifist platform , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer -lrb- left -rrb- and german chancellor gerhard schröder together with the social democrats , the greens made a number of difficult decisions in the following years .
they opted for reforms to germany 's tax and social welfare systems and approved other military missions to macedonia and afghanistan .
while social democrats have lost voters in elections since 2002 , the greens managed to hold onto their seats or increase them almost everywhere .
and for years , fischer has led the list of germany 's most popular politicians .

german politicians seeking to outlaw secret paternity tests won a first battle on wednesday , much to the disappointment of fathers ' rights groups hoping for greater justice in the areas of alimony and child support . the german federal court of justice decided on wednesday that paternity tests carried out in secret are inadmissible as evidence in a lawsuit .
unless the mother gave her consent for the test , the child 's personal rights would be violated , the court in karlsruhe ruled .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lab technician at the " id-labor " in wiesbaden conducts a paternity test .
the decision was welcomed by german justice minister brigitte zypries , who is leading a campaign to make secret paternity tests illegal under a new law regulating the use of genetic data .
" these tests are a serious invasion of the private sphere , " zypries said .
" if a man has doubts about his paternity , he should talk about this with the mother . "
campaigners for fathers ' rights in germany say making secret paternity tests punishable would be yet another blow to men who already get the short end of the stick when it comes to laws regulating alimony , child support , and child custody following a divorce or separation .
" it can not be that , as a woman , i have the right to make my husband pay to support a child that is not his own , or to deny children the right to know who their real father is , " said dr. karin jäckel , an active supporter of the fathers ' rights movement and author of several books on the subject .
" men are , in every respect , held responsible for their children under our laws , which is why they have the right to know who their children are . "
modernizing alimony bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a father walks with his son in a düsseldorf park .
while the battle over paternity tests continues , justice minister zypries has also announced an overhaul of german laws on alimony .
divorced dads are hopeful that the changes will mean more justice for them .
the growing fathers ' rights movement in germany rejects the stereotype of the heartless man who abandons his family for a new relationship .
in reality , they say , the situation is very different .
women file for divorce more frequently than men , and are more often awarded custody of the children .
and in cases where a divorce is contested , fathers frequently become estranged from their children , making it harder for fathers to gain custody rights once the divorce is settled , jäckel said .
despite this emotional strain , fathers are still seen as the familial breadwinner , and can often find themselves burdened for life with child support and alimony payments to ex-wives .
" in cases where the man earns a lot and can pay for everyone , there 's no problem .
but we 're seeing more frequently that the man 's income is n't enough for everyone , " zypries said in an interview with the women 's magazine brigitte .
ideally , she said , both partners would take financial responsibility for themselves after a divorce .
" a man ca n't be expected to support his ex-wife for years , especially if she could go back to work , and as a consequence not have the money to support children from a second marriage , " she said .
lack of political reaction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a protester dressed as santa chained himself to the front gate to buckingham palace , london , tuesday nov .
23 , 2004 .
he is a member of fathers for justice , who are campaigning for a change in family law in britain .
but jäckel said that those closely involved with the fathers ' rights movement are skeptical that their concerns will be heeded by politicians .
unlike in britain , where the activist group fathers 4 justice has successfully attracted attention to the plight of divorced dads through spectacular stunts , campaigns by similar german groups have " barely registered politically , " jäckel said , adding that ploys aimed at grabbing media attention can make a desperate father 's situation even worse .
" i 've often seen it happen here that fathers who go to the media to publicize their cases are punished by the judges , " she said .

german politicians seeking to outlaw secret paternity tests won a first battle on wednesday , much to the disappointment of fathers ' rights groups hoping for greater justice in the areas of alimony and child support . the german federal court of justice decided on wednesday that paternity tests carried out in secret are inadmissible as evidence in a lawsuit .
unless the mother gave her consent for the test , the child 's personal rights would be violated , the court in karlsruhe ruled .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lab technician at the " id-labor " in wiesbaden conducts a paternity test .
the decision was welcomed by german justice minister brigitte zypries , who is leading a campaign to make secret paternity tests illegal under a new law regulating the use of genetic data .
" these tests are a serious invasion of the private sphere , " zypries said .
" if a man has doubts about his paternity , he should talk about this with the mother . "
campaigners for fathers ' rights in germany say making secret paternity tests punishable would be yet another blow to men who already get the short end of the stick when it comes to laws regulating alimony , child support , and child custody following a divorce or separation .
" it can not be that , as a woman , i have the right to make my husband pay to support a child that is not his own , or to deny children the right to know who their real father is , " said dr. karin jäckel , an active supporter of the fathers ' rights movement and author of several books on the subject .
" men are , in every respect , held responsible for their children under our laws , which is why they have the right to know who their children are . "
modernizing alimony bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a father walks with his son in a düsseldorf park .
while the battle over paternity tests continues , justice minister zypries has also announced an overhaul of german laws on alimony .
divorced dads are hopeful that the changes will mean more justice for them .
the growing fathers ' rights movement in germany rejects the stereotype of the heartless man who abandons his family for a new relationship .
in reality , they say , the situation is very different .
women file for divorce more frequently than men , and are more often awarded custody of the children .
and in cases where a divorce is contested , fathers frequently become estranged from their children , making it harder for fathers to gain custody rights once the divorce is settled , jäckel said .
despite this emotional strain , fathers are still seen as the familial breadwinner , and can often find themselves burdened for life with child support and alimony payments to ex-wives .
" in cases where the man earns a lot and can pay for everyone , there 's no problem .
but we 're seeing more frequently that the man 's income is n't enough for everyone , " zypries said in an interview with the women 's magazine brigitte .
ideally , she said , both partners would take financial responsibility for themselves after a divorce .
" a man ca n't be expected to support his ex-wife for years , especially if she could go back to work , and as a consequence not have the money to support children from a second marriage , " she said .
lack of political reaction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a protester dressed as santa chained himself to the front gate to buckingham palace , london , tuesday nov .

he is a member of fathers for justice , who are campaigning for a change in family law in britain .
but jäckel said that those closely involved with the fathers ' rights movement are skeptical that their concerns will be heeded by politicians .
unlike in britain , where the activist group fathers 4 justice has successfully attracted attention to the plight of divorced dads through spectacular stunts , campaigns by similar german groups have " barely registered politically , " jäckel said , adding that ploys aimed at grabbing media attention can make a desperate father 's situation even worse .
" i 've often seen it happen here that fathers who go to the media to publicize their cases are punished by the judges , " she said .
" in the worst case , this can even result in their custody rights being taken away .
the judges ' logic is that dragging a case of unfair treatment into the public eye only damages the child 's rights , and that someone who would do this is a bad father .

bbc news -pipe- programmes -pipe- breakfast -pipe- improved performance of secondary schools bbc news / breakfast graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- thursday , 13 january , 2005 , 06:52 gmt improved performance of secondary schools a muslim girls ' comprehensive heads a new table of the progress children make in england 's secondary schools .
feversham college , bradford , tops the " value added " measure - which overall sees grammar schools doing very well .
value added shows how children 's attainment rose between their final primary school year and their gcse year , rather than just the end results .
breakfast had more during thursday 's programme we were live at selly park technical college for girls in birmingham - it came third in the value added table and we were joined by chris woodhead - former chief inspector of schools we also heard from stephen twigg , the school standards minister more from bbc news online but the performance tables have still been criticised by unions , opposition politicians and independent schools .
league table facts best for adding value : feversham college , bradford grammar schools outperform comprehensives best gcse score : thomas telford ctc best a-level score : colyton grammar school 53.7 % got five or more top grades at gcse-level 57.4 % in specialist schools compared to 48.2 % in others london fastest improving region feversham college , which was in the independent sector until 2001 , scored 1,099.8 on the new " all through " value added measure , which is based around 1,000 .
the school said it was underpinned by its islamic ethos .
" our added value has increased because we monitor student progress and teaching and learning with a rigorous focus on exam preparation . "
nationally , though , teenagers in comprehensive schools averaged a score of 984 .
in grammar schools the figure was 1,021 .
in secondary moderns , 982.9 - just below the comprehensives .
the chair of the national grammar schools association , brian wills-pope , said : " what this shows is that selective schools do get the best from their students and it goes to prove that we do add significant value . "
the average in community special schools , which do not normally feature in the tables published by news organisations , was 1,013.2 .
in independent schools - selective and non-selective - the average was 1,034.2 , though they choose whether or not to have their individual scores published . "
everyone associated with the college has high expectations " feversham college modest reaction at ' best ' school in the main gcse-level tables , students at thomas telford city technology college -lrb- ctc -rrb- in shropshire did best by far .
all its 15-year-olds get the equivalent of 12 good gcses , averaging 760.3 points - much more than any other school , including grammars and independents .
this year 's tables count a much wider range of vocational qualifications at this level .
the independent schools ' council , drawing attention to such things as cake decorating certificates , said they had become " absurd " .
at advanced level , the students at colyton grammar school in devon took top slot by averaging 512.6 points .
challenging areas an inner-city comprehensive which has had an increasingly " can do " attitude in recent times heads this year 's " most improved " list .
the proportion getting top gcse-level grades at sir john cass foundation and redcoat church of england secondary school in east london has gone up by 51 percentage points since 2001 , to 87 % .
this is the third year the school has topped the list - but it shares the honour this time with the north school in ashford , kent .
its performance has also risen 51 , from 9 % to 60 % .
' complexity ' the school standards minister , stephen twigg , who visited another of the most-improved schools , said : " these figures show that the fastest improvement is being made in areas of significant deprivation and historically low achievement . "
the liberal democrats said it was time to abandon the " meaningless " tables - which hid the fact that two thirds of students still failed to gain the national standard in the core curriculum subjects of english , maths and science .

the leader of the secondary heads association , john dunford , said : " although more difficult to interpret , the greater complexity of this year 's tables is welcome in avoiding the simplistic approach of previous years and giving parents a broader view of the achievements of schools . "
but the tables were " deeply flawed " , and created perverse incentives for schools to change their exam policy and even curriculum to improve their standings .

feversham college , bradford , tops the " value added " measure - which overall sees grammar schools doing very well .
value added shows how children 's attainment rose between their final primary school year and their gcse year , rather than just the end results .

league table facts best for adding value : feversham college , bradford grammar schools outperform comprehensives best gcse score : thomas telford ctc best a-level score : colyton grammar school 53.7 % got five or more top grades at gcse-level 57.4 % in specialist schools compared to 48.2 % in others london fastest improving region feversham college , which was in the independent sector until 2001 , scored 1,099.8 on the new " all through " value added measure , which is based around 1,000 .
the school said it was underpinned by its islamic ethos .
" our added value has increased because we monitor student progress and teaching and learning with a rigorous focus on exam preparation . "
nationally , though , teenagers in comprehensive schools averaged a score of 984 .
in grammar schools the figure was 1,021 .
in secondary moderns , 982.9 - just below the comprehensives .
the chair of the national grammar schools association , brian wills-pope , said : " what this shows is that selective schools do get the best from their students and it goes to prove that we do add significant value . "
the average in community special schools , which do not normally feature in the tables published by news organisations , was 1,013.2 .

this year 's tables count a much wider range of vocational qualifications at this level .
the independent schools ' council , drawing attention to such things as cake decorating certificates , said they had become " absurd " .
at advanced level , the students at colyton grammar school in devon took top slot by averaging 512.6 points .
challenging areas an inner-city comprehensive which has had an increasingly " can do " attitude in recent times heads this year 's " most improved " list .

this is the third year the school has topped the list - but it shares the honour this time with the north school in ashford , kent .
its performance has also risen 51 , from 9 % to 60 % .
' complexity ' the school standards minister , stephen twigg , who visited another of the most-improved schools , said : " these figures show that the fastest improvement is being made in areas of significant deprivation and historically low achievement . "
the liberal democrats said it was time to abandon the " meaningless " tables - which hid the fact that two thirds of students still failed to gain the national standard in the core curriculum subjects of english , maths and science .
the leader of the secondary heads association , john dunford , said : " although more difficult to interpret , the greater complexity of this year 's tables is welcome in avoiding the simplistic approach of previous years and giving parents a broader view of the achievements of schools . "

but the accounts commission report said that £ 600m of council tax had been outstanding since 1996 .
local authorities collected 92 % of the tax last year , but rates varied from 98 % in orkney to 85 % in glasgow .
the tories criticised the performance and the finance minister said he wanted to see improvements - but councils said they were doing all they could .
the accounts commission report said that only eight of scotland 's 32 councils met targets from the department of work and pensions for dealing with benefit claims last year .
' unreliable data ' however , the time taken to process claims fell from 49 days to 47 days .
dundee city council was excluded from this and another category because it produced what the accounts commission described as " unreliable data " .
the report found an improvement in the time taken to pay invoices , with dundee , aberdeen , perth and kinross and west lothian councils paying at least 90 % on time .
accounts commission chief alastair macnish said : " over the past 12 months , councils have improved in a number of key areas in line with the government 's efficiency agenda .
i have made it clear on a number of occasions that i want to see further improvement in this area tom mccabe finance minister " the reduction in time taken for councils to process benefit claims and pay invoices , along with the increase in council tax collection levels for the fifth consecutive , year is encouraging . "
however , tory spokesman brian monteith said : " if the scottish councils improved their collection rate even to that in england , over £ 50 could be cut from the average band d household .
" i am sure the people of scotland will be rightly wondering why it is that their tax bill is 5 % higher than it should be . "
finance minister tom mccabe said : " i have made it clear on a number of occasions that i want to see further improvement in this area .
" the poorest performing councils lag well behind the rest and i urge those authorities with lower collections levels to seek advice from some of the better performing councils .
genuine hardship " there is simply no excuse for councils not to take all practical steps to collect unpaid council tax or community charge debts . "
however , john pentland of the convention of scottish local authorities -lrb- cosla -rrb- said that councils were " doing everything they can to make sure people pay and pay on time " .
cosla 's finance spokesman said : " councils have some sympathy for those who face genuine hardship and who face the dilemma of paying either a heating bill or a council tax bill .
" those who refuse to pay are doing a grave disservice to others in the community who accept their responsibility to pay their council tax for the wide range of services they receive . "

dundee city council was excluded from this and another category because it produced what the accounts commission described as " unreliable data " .
the report found an improvement in the time taken to pay invoices , with dundee , aberdeen , perth and kinross and west lothian councils paying at least 90 % on time .
accounts commission chief alastair macnish said : " over the past 12 months , councils have improved in a number of key areas in line with the government 's efficiency agenda .
i have made it clear on a number of occasions that i want to see further improvement in this area tom mccabe finance minister " the reduction in time taken for councils to process benefit claims and pay invoices , along with the increase in council tax collection levels for the fifth consecutive , year is encouraging . "
however , tory spokesman brian monteith said : " if the scottish councils improved their collection rate even to that in england , over £ 50 could be cut from the average band d household .
" i am sure the people of scotland will be rightly wondering why it is that their tax bill is 5 % higher than it should be . "
finance minister tom mccabe said : " i have made it clear on a number of occasions that i want to see further improvement in this area .
" the poorest performing councils lag well behind the rest and i urge those authorities with lower collections levels to seek advice from some of the better performing councils .
genuine hardship " there is simply no excuse for councils not to take all practical steps to collect unpaid council tax or community charge debts . "
however , john pentland of the convention of scottish local authorities -lrb- cosla -rrb- said that councils were " doing everything they can to make sure people pay and pay on time " .
cosla 's finance spokesman said : " councils have some sympathy for those who face genuine hardship and who face the dilemma of paying either a heating bill or a council tax bill .
" those who refuse to pay are doing a grave disservice to others in the community who accept their responsibility to pay their council tax for the wide range of services they receive . "
