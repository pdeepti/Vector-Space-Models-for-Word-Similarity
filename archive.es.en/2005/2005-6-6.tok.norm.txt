but , the idea of tuition fees and even study loans remains anathema to many students . in some countries , saving for a child 's education is commonplace .
in the us , where the average cost for a year of studying and living at a private college is currently $ 22,000 -lrb- 17,921 euros -rrb- , many parents start socking away money in a college fund even before they 've sent out birth announcements .
until recently , germans did n't have this concern .
the notion that everyone has a right to a cost-free university education has long been a given in modern german society .
but the concept was dealt a blow in january , when the german federal constitutional court decided to overturn a ban on tuition .
each state can now decide whether its universities will charge for their services , and how much .
painful adjustment the result is a political dust storm that has yet to settle .
conservatives tend to support the implementation of tuition fees , claiming the underfunded universities need all the financial help they can get .
liberals oppose it as being anti-egalitarian .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of third-semester medical students attend class in leipzig .
so far , it looks as if nine of the 16 german states - including north rhine westphalia , now that conservatives won power there in recent elections - will begin charging course fees for an initial round of university study .
the fees will not surpass 500 euros per semester .
already , 12 states impose fees of anywhere from 300 euros to 900 euros per semester for people who take too long to complete their degree , or for career changers who want to take on a second course of study .
while other european countries -lrb- england , for example -rrb- have already gone through the painful adjustment from free to fee education , most germans - who prize their free education system - find the idea of paying tuition for a first round of study outrageous .
last week , some 10,000 students in five cities took to the streets in protest .
new financial instruments but the prospect of tuition fees has grabbed the attention of some farsighted financial institutions , who have begun packaging loans aimed at students .
the kfw , germany 's state-owned development bank , caused a minor sensation in february when it announced a five percent interest loan available to university students , regardless of their subjects of study or their parents ' financial situation .
bildunterschrift : university seminar deutsche bank - unlike the kfw , a private credit institution whose instruments have to make good in the open marketplace - countered with its own student loan , similar to that of kfw but at a slightly higher rate of interest .
once the clamor and political wrangling surrounding tuition costs have subsided , even more credit institutions are expected to compete for the student market , experts say .
growing business " the business of financing student loans will become more important in the coming years , so it is important to get into the market early , " lars hinrichsen , financial adviser at mummert consulting told the handelsblatt newspaper .
sonja hüpfner , spokeswoman for the kfw , explained that the aim of their loan is mostly to help students complete their studies speedily and make them more competitive .
" along with studying , a lot of people have to work to make ends meet , which means it takes them longer to complete a degree , " hüpfner said .
some 63 percent of german students have part time jobs during their studies , according to the internet site studis-online .
long-term students german students take an average of six years to complete a university degree , hüpfner said - the longest of any european country .
" they go on the job market much later , which does n't help them in terms of competitiveness " she pointed out .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstration in essen against tution fees .
sign reads free education -lrb- still -rrb- for everyone according to hüpfner , german expectations of free education is a case of misguided values , tied to an overall cultural distrust of debt .
" people are afraid to take on debt .
but they have to ask themselves : do i want to invest in my own future ?
or should i just take longer to get through my studies , and come on the job market later ? "
judith graff , a fourth year student at the university of cologne , sees the loan issue from a practical standpoint .
sure , her studies have been prolonged by the fact that she has to work 20 hours a week to make ends meet - and that 's without having had to pay any tuition fees .
but she would rather not finish school in debt .
" everyone knows right now there are no jobs in germany .
how would you pay the loan back ? "
graff asked .
" if people come out of school with debt then they would hesitate to start a family ... it 's a bad cycle . "
falling reputation people who argue in favor of tuition say the money is needed to boost academic standards at german universities , whose reputations have suffered over the last few decades .
a recent ranking of the world 's top universities in the times higher education supplement revealed that only one german institution , the university of heidelberg , was placed in the top 50 .
but opponents say even relatively low tuition fees of 500 euros per semester can make the difference between a given student 's success and failure .
" some people say 500 euros a semester is n't much .
but that 's 83 euros a month , " achim meyer auf der heyde , general secretary of the union of german students told the suddeutsche zeitung .
" and 27 percent of students live off of 600 euros a month .
for that person , 83 euros is a lot . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jörg dräger but jörg dräger -lrb- photo -rrb- , hamburg 's senator for science and research , who helped kfw create its student loan , rejects the notion that tuition fees will widen the gap between germany 's haves and have-nots .
instead , he said , giving a college education a monetary value makes it that much more worthwhile .
fees - a great equalizer ?
" tuition fees do n't only improve the financial framework of universities .
they are above all an instrument with which one can more fairly distribute the chances of receiving a university education , " dräger told the hamburg media institute in an interview .
" in the usa , great britain and japan , many more children from -lrb- poorer -rrb- backgrounds study , despite tuition fees .
there , there is stronger awareness that education is also financially worthwhile , " he said .

the kfw , germany 's state-owned development bank , caused a minor sensation in february when it announced a five percent interest loan available to university students , regardless of their subjects of study or their parents ' financial situation .
bildunterschrift : university seminar deutsche bank - unlike the kfw , a private credit institution whose instruments have to make good in the open marketplace - countered with its own student loan , similar to that of kfw but at a slightly higher rate of interest .
once the clamor and political wrangling surrounding tuition costs have subsided , even more credit institutions are expected to compete for the student market , experts say .
growing business " the business of financing student loans will become more important in the coming years , so it is important to get into the market early , " lars hinrichsen , financial adviser at mummert consulting told the handelsblatt newspaper .
sonja hüpfner , spokeswoman for the kfw , explained that the aim of their loan is mostly to help students complete their studies speedily and make them more competitive .
" along with studying , a lot of people have to work to make ends meet , which means it takes them longer to complete a degree , " hüpfner said .
some 63 percent of german students have part time jobs during their studies , according to the internet site studis-online .
long-term students german students take an average of six years to complete a university degree , hüpfner said - the longest of any european country .
" they go on the job market much later , which does n't help them in terms of competitiveness " she pointed out .

sign reads free education -lrb- still -rrb- for everyone according to hüpfner , german expectations of free education is a case of misguided values , tied to an overall cultural distrust of debt .
" people are afraid to take on debt .
but they have to ask themselves : do i want to invest in my own future ?
or should i just take longer to get through my studies , and come on the job market later ? "
judith graff , a fourth year student at the university of cologne , sees the loan issue from a practical standpoint .
sure , her studies have been prolonged by the fact that she has to work 20 hours a week to make ends meet - and that 's without having had to pay any tuition fees .
but she would rather not finish school in debt .
" everyone knows right now there are no jobs in germany .
how would you pay the loan back ? "
graff asked .
" if people come out of school with debt then they would hesitate to start a family ... it 's a bad cycle . "
falling reputation people who argue in favor of tuition say the money is needed to boost academic standards at german universities , whose reputations have suffered over the last few decades .
a recent ranking of the world 's top universities in the times higher education supplement revealed that only one german institution , the university of heidelberg , was placed in the top 50 .
but opponents say even relatively low tuition fees of 500 euros per semester can make the difference between a given student 's success and failure .
" some people say 500 euros a semester is n't much .
but that 's 83 euros a month , " achim meyer auf der heyde , general secretary of the union of german students told the suddeutsche zeitung .
" and 27 percent of students live off of 600 euros a month .
for that person , 83 euros is a lot . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jörg dräger but jörg dräger -lrb- photo -rrb- , hamburg 's senator for science and research , who helped kfw create its student loan , rejects the notion that tuition fees will widen the gap between germany 's haves and have-nots .
instead , he said , giving a college education a monetary value makes it that much more worthwhile .
fees - a great equalizer ?
" tuition fees do n't only improve the financial framework of universities .
they are above all an instrument with which one can more fairly distribute the chances of receiving a university education , " dräger told the hamburg media institute in an interview .
" in the usa , great britain and japan , many more children from -lrb- poorer -rrb- backgrounds study , despite tuition fees .
there , there is stronger awareness that education is also financially worthwhile , " he said .
with changing political winds in germany poised to make fee-based education more widespread , low-income students can only hope that dräger is right . jennifer abramsohn , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de are german universities losing their luster ?

but , the idea of tuition fees and even study loans remains anathema to many students . in some countries , saving for a child 's education is commonplace .
in the us , where the average cost for a year of studying and living at a private college is currently $ 22,000 -lrb- 17,921 euros -rrb- , many parents start socking away money in a college fund even before they 've sent out birth announcements .
until recently , germans did n't have this concern .
the notion that everyone has a right to a cost-free university education has long been a given in modern german society .
but the concept was dealt a blow in january , when the german federal constitutional court decided to overturn a ban on tuition .
each state can now decide whether its universities will charge for their services , and how much .
painful adjustment the result is a political dust storm that has yet to settle .
conservatives tend to support the implementation of tuition fees , claiming the underfunded universities need all the financial help they can get .
liberals oppose it as being anti-egalitarian .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of third-semester medical students attend class in leipzig .
so far , it looks as if nine of the 16 german states - including north rhine westphalia , now that conservatives won power there in recent elections - will begin charging course fees for an initial round of university study .
the fees will not surpass 500 euros per semester .
already , 12 states impose fees of anywhere from 300 euros to 900 euros per semester for people who take too long to complete their degree , or for career changers who want to take on a second course of study .
while other european countries -lrb- england , for example -rrb- have already gone through the painful adjustment from free to fee education , most germans - who prize their free education system - find the idea of paying tuition for a first round of study outrageous .
last week , some 10,000 students in five cities took to the streets in protest .
new financial instruments but the prospect of tuition fees has grabbed the attention of some farsighted financial institutions , who have begun packaging loans aimed at students .
the kfw , germany 's state-owned development bank , caused a minor sensation in february when it announced a five percent interest loan available to university students , regardless of their subjects of study or their parents ' financial situation .
bildunterschrift : university seminar deutsche bank - unlike the kfw , a private credit institution whose instruments have to make good in the open marketplace - countered with its own student loan , similar to that of kfw but at a slightly higher rate of interest .
once the clamor and political wrangling surrounding tuition costs have subsided , even more credit institutions are expected to compete for the student market , experts say .
growing business " the business of financing student loans will become more important in the coming years , so it is important to get into the market early , " lars hinrichsen , financial adviser at mummert consulting told the handelsblatt newspaper .
sonja hüpfner , spokeswoman for the kfw , explained that the aim of their loan is mostly to help students complete their studies speedily and make them more competitive .
" along with studying , a lot of people have to work to make ends meet , which means it takes them longer to complete a degree , " hüpfner said .
some 63 percent of german students have part time jobs during their studies , according to the internet site studis-online .
long-term students german students take an average of six years to complete a university degree , hüpfner said - the longest of any european country .
" they go on the job market much later , which does n't help them in terms of competitiveness " she pointed out .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstration in essen against tution fees .
sign reads free education -lrb- still -rrb- for everyone according to hüpfner , german expectations of free education is a case of misguided values , tied to an overall cultural distrust of debt .
" people are afraid to take on debt .
but they have to ask themselves : do i want to invest in my own future ?
or should i just take longer to get through my studies , and come on the job market later ? "
judith graff , a fourth year student at the university of cologne , sees the loan issue from a practical standpoint .
sure , her studies have been prolonged by the fact that she has to work 20 hours a week to make ends meet - and that 's without having had to pay any tuition fees .
but she would rather not finish school in debt .
" everyone knows right now there are no jobs in germany .
how would you pay the loan back ? "
graff asked .
" if people come out of school with debt then they would hesitate to start a family ... it 's a bad cycle . "
falling reputation people who argue in favor of tuition say the money is needed to boost academic standards at german universities , whose reputations have suffered over the last few decades .
a recent ranking of the world 's top universities in the times higher education supplement revealed that only one german institution , the university of heidelberg , was placed in the top 50 .
but opponents say even relatively low tuition fees of 500 euros per semester can make the difference between a given student 's success and failure .
" some people say 500 euros a semester is n't much .
but that 's 83 euros a month , " achim meyer auf der heyde , general secretary of the union of german students told the suddeutsche zeitung .
" and 27 percent of students live off of 600 euros a month .
for that person , 83 euros is a lot . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jörg dräger but jörg dräger -lrb- photo -rrb- , hamburg 's senator for science and research , who helped kfw create its student loan , rejects the notion that tuition fees will widen the gap between germany 's haves and have-nots .
instead , he said , giving a college education a monetary value makes it that much more worthwhile .
fees - a great equalizer ?
" tuition fees do n't only improve the financial framework of universities .
they are above all an instrument with which one can more fairly distribute the chances of receiving a university education , " dräger told the hamburg media institute in an interview .
" in the usa , great britain and japan , many more children from -lrb- poorer -rrb- backgrounds study , despite tuition fees .
there , there is stronger awareness that education is also financially worthwhile , " he said .
with changing political winds in germany poised to make fee-based education more widespread , low-income students can only hope that dräger is right . jennifer abramsohn , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de are german universities losing their luster ?
chancellor schröder wants to reform the education system this year and the media is awash with talk of “ elite universities . ”
but many are already in dire straits , a far cry from the country ’ s legendary academic yore .

but for all the sting of the slap , this showing could fuel government plans to create a more elite educational system .

but , the idea of tuition fees and even study loans remains anathema to many students . in some countries , saving for a child 's education is commonplace .
in the us , where the average cost for a year of studying and living at a private college is currently $ 22,000 -lrb- 17,921 euros -rrb- , many parents start socking away money in a college fund even before they 've sent out birth announcements .
until recently , germans did n't have this concern .
the notion that everyone has a right to a cost-free university education has long been a given in modern german society .
but the concept was dealt a blow in january , when the german federal constitutional court decided to overturn a ban on tuition .
each state can now decide whether its universities will charge for their services , and how much .
painful adjustment the result is a political dust storm that has yet to settle .
conservatives tend to support the implementation of tuition fees , claiming the underfunded universities need all the financial help they can get .
liberals oppose it as being anti-egalitarian .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of third-semester medical students attend class in leipzig .
so far , it looks as if nine of the 16 german states - including north rhine westphalia , now that conservatives won power there in recent elections - will begin charging course fees for an initial round of university study .
the fees will not surpass 500 euros per semester .
already , 12 states impose fees of anywhere from 300 euros to 900 euros per semester for people who take too long to complete their degree , or for career changers who want to take on a second course of study .
while other european countries -lrb- england , for example -rrb- have already gone through the painful adjustment from free to fee education , most germans - who prize their free education system - find the idea of paying tuition for a first round of study outrageous .
last week , some 10,000 students in five cities took to the streets in protest .
new financial instruments but the prospect of tuition fees has grabbed the attention of some farsighted financial institutions , who have begun packaging loans aimed at students .
the kfw , germany 's state-owned development bank , caused a minor sensation in february when it announced a five percent interest loan available to university students , regardless of their subjects of study or their parents ' financial situation .
bildunterschrift : university seminar deutsche bank - unlike the kfw , a private credit institution whose instruments have to make good in the open marketplace - countered with its own student loan , similar to that of kfw but at a slightly higher rate of interest .
once the clamor and political wrangling surrounding tuition costs have subsided , even more credit institutions are expected to compete for the student market , experts say .
growing business " the business of financing student loans will become more important in the coming years , so it is important to get into the market early , " lars hinrichsen , financial adviser at mummert consulting told the handelsblatt newspaper .
sonja hüpfner , spokeswoman for the kfw , explained that the aim of their loan is mostly to help students complete their studies speedily and make them more competitive .
" along with studying , a lot of people have to work to make ends meet , which means it takes them longer to complete a degree , " hüpfner said .
some 63 percent of german students have part time jobs during their studies , according to the internet site studis-online .
long-term students german students take an average of six years to complete a university degree , hüpfner said - the longest of any european country .
" they go on the job market much later , which does n't help them in terms of competitiveness " she pointed out .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstration in essen against tution fees .
sign reads free education -lrb- still -rrb- for everyone according to hüpfner , german expectations of free education is a case of misguided values , tied to an overall cultural distrust of debt .
" people are afraid to take on debt .
but they have to ask themselves : do i want to invest in my own future ?
or should i just take longer to get through my studies , and come on the job market later ? "
judith graff , a fourth year student at the university of cologne , sees the loan issue from a practical standpoint .
sure , her studies have been prolonged by the fact that she has to work 20 hours a week to make ends meet - and that 's without having had to pay any tuition fees .
but she would rather not finish school in debt .
" everyone knows right now there are no jobs in germany .
how would you pay the loan back ? "
graff asked .
" if people come out of school with debt then they would hesitate to start a family ... it 's a bad cycle . "
falling reputation people who argue in favor of tuition say the money is needed to boost academic standards at german universities , whose reputations have suffered over the last few decades .
a recent ranking of the world 's top universities in the times higher education supplement revealed that only one german institution , the university of heidelberg , was placed in the top 50 .
but opponents say even relatively low tuition fees of 500 euros per semester can make the difference between a given student 's success and failure .
" some people say 500 euros a semester is n't much .
but that 's 83 euros a month , " achim meyer auf der heyde , general secretary of the union of german students told the suddeutsche zeitung .
" and 27 percent of students live off of 600 euros a month .
for that person , 83 euros is a lot . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jörg dräger but jörg dräger -lrb- photo -rrb- , hamburg 's senator for science and research , who helped kfw create its student loan , rejects the notion that tuition fees will widen the gap between germany 's haves and have-nots .
instead , he said , giving a college education a monetary value makes it that much more worthwhile .
fees - a great equalizer ?
" tuition fees do n't only improve the financial framework of universities .
they are above all an instrument with which one can more fairly distribute the chances of receiving a university education , " dräger told the hamburg media institute in an interview .
" in the usa , great britain and japan , many more children from -lrb- poorer -rrb- backgrounds study , despite tuition fees .
there , there is stronger awareness that education is also financially worthwhile , " he said .
with changing political winds in germany poised to make fee-based education more widespread , low-income students can only hope that dräger is right . jennifer abramsohn , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de are german universities losing their luster ?

but , the idea of tuition fees and even study loans remains anathema to many students . in some countries , saving for a child 's education is commonplace .
in the us , where the average cost for a year of studying and living at a private college is currently $ 22,000 -lrb- 17,921 euros -rrb- , many parents start socking away money in a college fund even before they 've sent out birth announcements .
until recently , germans did n't have this concern .
the notion that everyone has a right to a cost-free university education has long been a given in modern german society .
but the concept was dealt a blow in january , when the german federal constitutional court decided to overturn a ban on tuition .
each state can now decide whether its universities will charge for their services , and how much .
painful adjustment the result is a political dust storm that has yet to settle .
conservatives tend to support the implementation of tuition fees , claiming the underfunded universities need all the financial help they can get .
liberals oppose it as being anti-egalitarian .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of third-semester medical students attend class in leipzig .
so far , it looks as if nine of the 16 german states - including north rhine westphalia , now that conservatives won power there in recent elections - will begin charging course fees for an initial round of university study .
the fees will not surpass 500 euros per semester .
already , 12 states impose fees of anywhere from 300 euros to 900 euros per semester for people who take too long to complete their degree , or for career changers who want to take on a second course of study .
while other european countries -lrb- england , for example -rrb- have already gone through the painful adjustment from free to fee education , most germans - who prize their free education system - find the idea of paying tuition for a first round of study outrageous .
last week , some 10,000 students in five cities took to the streets in protest .
new financial instruments but the prospect of tuition fees has grabbed the attention of some farsighted financial institutions , who have begun packaging loans aimed at students .
the kfw , germany 's state-owned development bank , caused a minor sensation in february when it announced a five percent interest loan available to university students , regardless of their subjects of study or their parents ' financial situation .
bildunterschrift : university seminar deutsche bank - unlike the kfw , a private credit institution whose instruments have to make good in the open marketplace - countered with its own student loan , similar to that of kfw but at a slightly higher rate of interest .
once the clamor and political wrangling surrounding tuition costs have subsided , even more credit institutions are expected to compete for the student market , experts say .
growing business " the business of financing student loans will become more important in the coming years , so it is important to get into the market early , " lars hinrichsen , financial adviser at mummert consulting told the handelsblatt newspaper .
sonja hüpfner , spokeswoman for the kfw , explained that the aim of their loan is mostly to help students complete their studies speedily and make them more competitive .
" along with studying , a lot of people have to work to make ends meet , which means it takes them longer to complete a degree , " hüpfner said .
some 63 percent of german students have part time jobs during their studies , according to the internet site studis-online .
long-term students german students take an average of six years to complete a university degree , hüpfner said - the longest of any european country .
" they go on the job market much later , which does n't help them in terms of competitiveness " she pointed out .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstration in essen against tution fees .
sign reads free education -lrb- still -rrb- for everyone according to hüpfner , german expectations of free education is a case of misguided values , tied to an overall cultural distrust of debt .
" people are afraid to take on debt .
but they have to ask themselves : do i want to invest in my own future ?
or should i just take longer to get through my studies , and come on the job market later ? "
judith graff , a fourth year student at the university of cologne , sees the loan issue from a practical standpoint .
sure , her studies have been prolonged by the fact that she has to work 20 hours a week to make ends meet - and that 's without having had to pay any tuition fees .
but she would rather not finish school in debt .
" everyone knows right now there are no jobs in germany .
how would you pay the loan back ? "
graff asked .
" if people come out of school with debt then they would hesitate to start a family ... it 's a bad cycle . "

straw is to give his decision before parliament in the afternoon , choosing his words carefully to avoid making britain appear as the one to kill the treaty . british newspapers said straw would again insist on the need to respect the results of such plebiscites and announce a temporary freeze of the bill which would have allowed the referendum to proceed in britain in early 2006 .
such a move would allow time to determine the future of the constitutional treaty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a view over the river thames from the houses of parliament in westminster palace in london on thursday , london asked paris and the hague to spell out what their vision of its future was . " a period of reflection " " we believe that it is necessary to have a period of reflection in the lead up to discussions at the council of ministers meeting , " said a spokeswoman from blair 's offices at 10 downing street , referring to a meeting of leaders from the european union in brussels on june 16-17 . asked whether the saturday talks between chirac and schröder had affected britain 's standpoint on how to proceed with the constitution , the spokeswoman said : " there is nothing further to add .
that is our position at the moment . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder , center , hugs french president jacques chirac , left , as schröder 's wife doris looks on the french and german leaders , meeting in berlin , agreed that the ratification process of the landmark document for the 25-nation bloc should go on after voters in france and the netherlands voted against it .
every eu member country has " the right and the duty " to take its own decision on the constitution , said a german government spokesman after the two statesmen met over dinner to plot a way out of the crisis . germany has ratified the proposed text , although no referendum was used , and so have nine others of the 25 member states , but the damage caused by the " no " votes in france and the netherlands is severe . it is likely to be further compounded by straw 's speech before parliament . on the home front , freezing the referendum would spare blair a crushing defeat .
a poll published friday by the sun showed 72 percent of britons would reject the draft in a referendum , up from 57 previously . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair such a verdict would probably cause blair to step down as prime minister next year amid mounting political problems since his unpopular decision to join the 2003 us-led invasion of iraq . london 's decision could cause problems but , ten days before the european council meets in brussels , and less than a month before britain assumes the rotating european union presidency on july 1 , london 's expected decision is likely to bother some of its eu partners . most of them have called for forging ahead with the ratification process , echoing the remarks of european commission president jose manuel durao barroso , who is hostile to any " unilateral decision " by a member state . european affairs analyst richard whitman said it was " not a smart idea when you are about to take the job of presidency to go into that having upset a number of key interlocutors . " however , whitman , who heads the european program at the royal institute of international affairs in london , predicted the british decision " will likely trigger a small avalanche of other countries that will suspend " ratification . already denmark and portugal have suggested they would suspend ratification , said aurore wanlin , a researcher at the london-based centre for european reform . ireland no longer seems so sure about its own plans for a referendum .
" i ca n't say .
we will wait and see what comes out of the european council meeting in mid-june , " irish foreign minister dermot ahern said friday . wanlin said meanwhile that " you also have commissioners in brussels who have said in private that it would be too risky to continue with the ratification process because a series of no votes would endanger europe . " blair isolated ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france gave a stinging ' non ' to the draft eu constitution the french and dutch no votes could amount to an opportunity for blair and his vision of free-market economic vision for europe , in the absence of a strong european leadershiop , some experts said .
" the triumph of perfidious albion , " the weekly economist headlined . not so fast , other experts said .
because the european council from june 16-17 will also be about the 2007-2013 budget , where britain is under mounting pressure to give up its cherished 20-year-old rebate . some leaders are dreaming of an agreement to make the crisis blow over .

that would correspond to a price of 22 euros per hvb share or just over 16 billion euros -lrb- $ 19.7 billion -rrb- in all . no deal this week ? the source was nevertheless skeptical that a final deal would be announced this week , since a number of details still had to be settled . those details include the fate of hvb 's highly profitable austrian unit , bank austria creditanstalt . bildunterschrift : soon together ? the business daily handelsblatt reported on monday that unicredito may have to launch a public takeover offer to buy out the minority shareholders in the unit , which would add another two billion euros to the overall takeover price . financial times deutschland said that hvb would remain autonomous , constituting a separate division within the unicredito group .
the two banks had announced last week that they were in tie-up talks . german government not opposed if a deal does come about , it would be the biggest cross-border banking merger in europe , creating the fourth-biggest bank in the euro area and the ninth biggest in europe as a whole . the german government signaled it had no objections to a possible tie-up between hvb and unicredito . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister hans eichel does n't seem too worried about the potential merger such a transaction would not " be a bad thing " in that it would contribute to the consolidation of the european banking sector , said finance ministry spokesman stefan giffeler . but giffeler refused to comment further , insisting that the talks were a matter for the banks alone . on the frankfurt stock exchange , hvb shares were little changed in mid-afternoon trading , changing hands at 19.78 euros , down 0.01 euros or 0.05 percent on the day . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de unicredito-hypovereinsbank merger seen germany 's hypovereinsbank and italy 's unicredito are nearing agreement on a possible merger which is expected to be finalized sometime in june , according to reports .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 06.06.2005 britain delays eu referendum großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lacking a national one , they 're not quite ready for an eu constitution britain 's government reportedly delayed plans for a referendum on the embattled eu constitution monday , a relief for prime minister tony blair at home but a calculated risk for him across the channel . british foreign secretary jack straw was expected to announce monday that britain will freeze a referendum on the treaty after its rejection at the polls in france and the netherlands last week .
straw is to give his decision before parliament in the afternoon , choosing his words carefully to avoid making britain appear as the one to kill the treaty . british newspapers said straw would again insist on the need to respect the results of such plebiscites and announce a temporary freeze of the bill which would have allowed the referendum to proceed in britain in early 2006 .
such a move would allow time to determine the future of the constitutional treaty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a view over the river thames from the houses of parliament in westminster palace in london on thursday , london asked paris and the hague to spell out what their vision of its future was . " a period of reflection " " we believe that it is necessary to have a period of reflection in the lead up to discussions at the council of ministers meeting , " said a spokeswoman from blair 's offices at 10 downing street , referring to a meeting of leaders from the european union in brussels on june 16-17 . asked whether the saturday talks between chirac and schröder had affected britain 's standpoint on how to proceed with the constitution , the spokeswoman said : " there is nothing further to add .
that is our position at the moment . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder , center , hugs french president jacques chirac , left , as schröder 's wife doris looks on the french and german leaders , meeting in berlin , agreed that the ratification process of the landmark document for the 25-nation bloc should go on after voters in france and the netherlands voted against it .
every eu member country has " the right and the duty " to take its own decision on the constitution , said a german government spokesman after the two statesmen met over dinner to plot a way out of the crisis . germany has ratified the proposed text , although no referendum was used , and so have nine others of the 25 member states , but the damage caused by the " no " votes in france and the netherlands is severe . it is likely to be further compounded by straw 's speech before parliament . on the home front , freezing the referendum would spare blair a crushing defeat .
a poll published friday by the sun showed 72 percent of britons would reject the draft in a referendum , up from 57 previously . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair such a verdict would probably cause blair to step down as prime minister next year amid mounting political problems since his unpopular decision to join the 2003 us-led invasion of iraq . london 's decision could cause problems but , ten days before the european council meets in brussels , and less than a month before britain assumes the rotating european union presidency on july 1 , london 's expected decision is likely to bother some of its eu partners . most of them have called for forging ahead with the ratification process , echoing the remarks of european commission president jose manuel durao barroso , who is hostile to any " unilateral decision " by a member state . european affairs analyst richard whitman said it was " not a smart idea when you are about to take the job of presidency to go into that having upset a number of key interlocutors . " however , whitman , who heads the european program at the royal institute of international affairs in london , predicted the british decision " will likely trigger a small avalanche of other countries that will suspend " ratification . already denmark and portugal have suggested they would suspend ratification , said aurore wanlin , a researcher at the london-based centre for european reform . ireland no longer seems so sure about its own plans for a referendum .
" i ca n't say .
we will wait and see what comes out of the european council meeting in mid-june , " irish foreign minister dermot ahern said friday . wanlin said meanwhile that " you also have commissioners in brussels who have said in private that it would be too risky to continue with the ratification process because a series of no votes would endanger europe . " blair isolated ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france gave a stinging ' non ' to the draft eu constitution the french and dutch no votes could amount to an opportunity for blair and his vision of free-market economic vision for europe , in the absence of a strong european leadershiop , some experts said .
" the triumph of perfidious albion , " the weekly economist headlined . not so fast , other experts said .
because the european council from june 16-17 will also be about the 2007-2013 budget , where britain is under mounting pressure to give up its cherished 20-year-old rebate . some leaders are dreaming of an agreement to make the crisis blow over .
and on this file , blair , who is for now rejecting any compromise , is alone against everyone else . afp / dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu battles to keep crisis from widening the eu risks further turmoil as it fights to avoid a escalation of one of its worst crises even as french and german leaders underlined saturday that the ratification process of the new constitution should go on .

straw is to give his decision before parliament in the afternoon , choosing his words carefully to avoid making britain appear as the one to kill the treaty . british newspapers said straw would again insist on the need to respect the results of such plebiscites and announce a temporary freeze of the bill which would have allowed the referendum to proceed in britain in early 2006 .
such a move would allow time to determine the future of the constitutional treaty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a view over the river thames from the houses of parliament in westminster palace in london on thursday , london asked paris and the hague to spell out what their vision of its future was .

every eu member country has " the right and the duty " to take its own decision on the constitution , said a german government spokesman after the two statesmen met over dinner to plot a way out of the crisis . germany has ratified the proposed text , although no referendum was used , and so have nine others of the 25 member states , but the damage caused by the " no " votes in france and the netherlands is severe . it is likely to be further compounded by straw 's speech before parliament . on the home front , freezing the referendum would spare blair a crushing defeat .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 06.06.2005 britain delays eu referendum großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lacking a national one , they 're not quite ready for an eu constitution britain 's government reportedly delayed plans for a referendum on the embattled eu constitution monday , a relief for prime minister tony blair at home but a calculated risk for him across the channel . british foreign secretary jack straw was expected to announce monday that britain will freeze a referendum on the treaty after its rejection at the polls in france and the netherlands last week .
straw is to give his decision before parliament in the afternoon , choosing his words carefully to avoid making britain appear as the one to kill the treaty . british newspapers said straw would again insist on the need to respect the results of such plebiscites and announce a temporary freeze of the bill which would have allowed the referendum to proceed in britain in early 2006 .
such a move would allow time to determine the future of the constitutional treaty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a view over the river thames from the houses of parliament in westminster palace in london on thursday , london asked paris and the hague to spell out what their vision of its future was . " a period of reflection " " we believe that it is necessary to have a period of reflection in the lead up to discussions at the council of ministers meeting , " said a spokeswoman from blair 's offices at 10 downing street , referring to a meeting of leaders from the european union in brussels on june 16-17 . asked whether the saturday talks between chirac and schröder had affected britain 's standpoint on how to proceed with the constitution , the spokeswoman said : " there is nothing further to add .
that is our position at the moment . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder , center , hugs french president jacques chirac , left , as schröder 's wife doris looks on the french and german leaders , meeting in berlin , agreed that the ratification process of the landmark document for the 25-nation bloc should go on after voters in france and the netherlands voted against it .
every eu member country has " the right and the duty " to take its own decision on the constitution , said a german government spokesman after the two statesmen met over dinner to plot a way out of the crisis . germany has ratified the proposed text , although no referendum was used , and so have nine others of the 25 member states , but the damage caused by the " no " votes in france and the netherlands is severe . it is likely to be further compounded by straw 's speech before parliament . on the home front , freezing the referendum would spare blair a crushing defeat .
a poll published friday by the sun showed 72 percent of britons would reject the draft in a referendum , up from 57 previously . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair such a verdict would probably cause blair to step down as prime minister next year amid mounting political problems since his unpopular decision to join the 2003 us-led invasion of iraq . london 's decision could cause problems but , ten days before the european council meets in brussels , and less than a month before britain assumes the rotating european union presidency on july 1 , london 's expected decision is likely to bother some of its eu partners . most of them have called for forging ahead with the ratification process , echoing the remarks of european commission president jose manuel durao barroso , who is hostile to any " unilateral decision " by a member state . european affairs analyst richard whitman said it was " not a smart idea when you are about to take the job of presidency to go into that having upset a number of key interlocutors . " however , whitman , who heads the european program at the royal institute of international affairs in london , predicted the british decision " will likely trigger a small avalanche of other countries that will suspend " ratification . already denmark and portugal have suggested they would suspend ratification , said aurore wanlin , a researcher at the london-based centre for european reform . ireland no longer seems so sure about its own plans for a referendum .
" i ca n't say .
we will wait and see what comes out of the european council meeting in mid-june , " irish foreign minister dermot ahern said friday . wanlin said meanwhile that " you also have commissioners in brussels who have said in private that it would be too risky to continue with the ratification process because a series of no votes would endanger europe . " blair isolated ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france gave a stinging ' non ' to the draft eu constitution the french and dutch no votes could amount to an opportunity for blair and his vision of free-market economic vision for europe , in the absence of a strong european leadershiop , some experts said .
" the triumph of perfidious albion , " the weekly economist headlined . not so fast , other experts said .
because the european council from june 16-17 will also be about the 2007-2013 budget , where britain is under mounting pressure to give up its cherished 20-year-old rebate . some leaders are dreaming of an agreement to make the crisis blow over .
and on this file , blair , who is for now rejecting any compromise , is alone against everyone else . afp / dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu battles to keep crisis from widening the eu risks further turmoil as it fights to avoid a escalation of one of its worst crises even as french and german leaders underlined saturday that the ratification process of the new constitution should go on .
-lrb- june 5 , 2005 -rrb- " europe has to be more modest " elmar brok , conservative european mep and member of the convention which drew up the eu charter told dw-tv that it should have been approved before expansion and warned the eu had to take note of its citizens ' concerns .
-lrb- june 4 , 2005 -rrb- politicians cast doubt on further expansion if the proposed european union constitutional treaty is not adopted , further enlargement of the 25-member club to include turkey and other candidates will be impossible , german lawmakers said saturday .

to do this , he has scheduled a vote of confidence on july 1 .
if the party would follow the leader , they would vote against him and the elections could take place .

interior minister otto schily said he would do his part . " if i ’ m not going to take part in the confidence vote , i can neither vote yes or no , " he said .

back to the basics is the call of some . " we should sharpen our image as an ecological party , " said albert schmidt , a green member of parliament , " because an election campaign waged on center-left coalition nostalgia does n't make sense anymore .

the two parties are at loggerheads over ways to finance major tax cuts promised to german voters .
merkel wouldn ’ t rule out an increase in the value-added tax to finance a major overhaul of the tax and social security systems . " our weak economy would be hurt by higher taxes , " she said .

i won ’ t rule out anything at this moment . " her remarks have angered the free democrats who are pushing for radical tax cuts and plans to curb trade union powers .
but some pollsters say the cdu might even win an absolute majority in the elections , which has strengthened merkel 's hand with her liberal allies . but before any of this happens , gerhard schröder must lose his vote of confidence on july 1 and under the current circumstances , that is anything but a sure thing . uwe hessler -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel chosen as chancellor candidate angela merkel , the leader of germany 's opposition christian democrats , has officially been chosen as the conservative challenger to chancellor gerhard schröder in early elections in the fall .

but , the idea of tuition fees and even study loans remains anathema to many students . in some countries , saving for a child 's education is commonplace .
in the us , where the average cost for a year of studying and living at a private college is currently $ 22,000 -lrb- 17,921 euros -rrb- , many parents start socking away money in a college fund even before they 've sent out birth announcements .
until recently , germans did n't have this concern .
the notion that everyone has a right to a cost-free university education has long been a given in modern german society .
but the concept was dealt a blow in january , when the german federal constitutional court decided to overturn a ban on tuition .
each state can now decide whether its universities will charge for their services , and how much .
painful adjustment the result is a political dust storm that has yet to settle .
conservatives tend to support the implementation of tuition fees , claiming the underfunded universities need all the financial help they can get .
liberals oppose it as being anti-egalitarian .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of third-semester medical students attend class in leipzig .
so far , it looks as if nine of the 16 german states - including north rhine westphalia , now that conservatives won power there in recent elections - will begin charging course fees for an initial round of university study .
the fees will not surpass 500 euros per semester .
already , 12 states impose fees of anywhere from 300 euros to 900 euros per semester for people who take too long to complete their degree , or for career changers who want to take on a second course of study .
while other european countries -lrb- england , for example -rrb- have already gone through the painful adjustment from free to fee education , most germans - who prize their free education system - find the idea of paying tuition for a first round of study outrageous .
last week , some 10,000 students in five cities took to the streets in protest .
new financial instruments but the prospect of tuition fees has grabbed the attention of some farsighted financial institutions , who have begun packaging loans aimed at students .
the kfw , germany 's state-owned development bank , caused a minor sensation in february when it announced a five percent interest loan available to university students , regardless of their subjects of study or their parents ' financial situation .
bildunterschrift : university seminar deutsche bank - unlike the kfw , a private credit institution whose instruments have to make good in the open marketplace - countered with its own student loan , similar to that of kfw but at a slightly higher rate of interest .
once the clamor and political wrangling surrounding tuition costs have subsided , even more credit institutions are expected to compete for the student market , experts say .
growing business " the business of financing student loans will become more important in the coming years , so it is important to get into the market early , " lars hinrichsen , financial adviser at mummert consulting told the handelsblatt newspaper .
sonja hüpfner , spokeswoman for the kfw , explained that the aim of their loan is mostly to help students complete their studies speedily and make them more competitive .
" along with studying , a lot of people have to work to make ends meet , which means it takes them longer to complete a degree , " hüpfner said .
some 63 percent of german students have part time jobs during their studies , according to the internet site studis-online .
long-term students german students take an average of six years to complete a university degree , hüpfner said - the longest of any european country .
" they go on the job market much later , which does n't help them in terms of competitiveness " she pointed out .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstration in essen against tution fees .
sign reads free education -lrb- still -rrb- for everyone according to hüpfner , german expectations of free education is a case of misguided values , tied to an overall cultural distrust of debt .
" people are afraid to take on debt .
but they have to ask themselves : do i want to invest in my own future ?
or should i just take longer to get through my studies , and come on the job market later ? "
judith graff , a fourth year student at the university of cologne , sees the loan issue from a practical standpoint .
sure , her studies have been prolonged by the fact that she has to work 20 hours a week to make ends meet - and that 's without having had to pay any tuition fees .
but she would rather not finish school in debt .
" everyone knows right now there are no jobs in germany .
how would you pay the loan back ? "
graff asked .
" if people come out of school with debt then they would hesitate to start a family ... it 's a bad cycle . "
falling reputation people who argue in favor of tuition say the money is needed to boost academic standards at german universities , whose reputations have suffered over the last few decades .
a recent ranking of the world 's top universities in the times higher education supplement revealed that only one german institution , the university of heidelberg , was placed in the top 50 .
but opponents say even relatively low tuition fees of 500 euros per semester can make the difference between a given student 's success and failure .
" some people say 500 euros a semester is n't much .
but that 's 83 euros a month , " achim meyer auf der heyde , general secretary of the union of german students told the suddeutsche zeitung .
" and 27 percent of students live off of 600 euros a month .
for that person , 83 euros is a lot . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jörg dräger but jörg dräger -lrb- photo -rrb- , hamburg 's senator for science and research , who helped kfw create its student loan , rejects the notion that tuition fees will widen the gap between germany 's haves and have-nots .
instead , he said , giving a college education a monetary value makes it that much more worthwhile .
fees - a great equalizer ?
" tuition fees do n't only improve the financial framework of universities .
they are above all an instrument with which one can more fairly distribute the chances of receiving a university education , " dräger told the hamburg media institute in an interview .
" in the usa , great britain and japan , many more children from -lrb- poorer -rrb- backgrounds study , despite tuition fees .
there , there is stronger awareness that education is also financially worthwhile , " he said .

so far , it looks as if nine of the 16 german states - including north rhine westphalia , now that conservatives won power there in recent elections - will begin charging course fees for an initial round of university study .
the fees will not surpass 500 euros per semester .
already , 12 states impose fees of anywhere from 300 euros to 900 euros per semester for people who take too long to complete their degree , or for career changers who want to take on a second course of study .
while other european countries -lrb- england , for example -rrb- have already gone through the painful adjustment from free to fee education , most germans - who prize their free education system - find the idea of paying tuition for a first round of study outrageous .

but do ads disguised as content have a place in publicly funded programs ?
german public broadcaster ard seems to think so . " with carpets you have less dust , they absorb sound , they look impeccable and make it easier for children to take their first steps . "
a line from a pamphlet advertising floor coverings ?
hardly .
its a piece of dialogue taken directly from " marienhof , " an evening television soap opera that runs on germany 's publicly funded broadcaster , ard .
and the flooring-friendly text was n't written by a screenwriter with a carpet fetish .
the lines were proscribed by the consortium of textile floor coverings , and brought hard cash to bavaria film , the production company responsible for " marienhof . "
journalist volker lilienthal recently researched the issue of product placement on german tv .
he found that the daily soaps " marienhof " and " in aller freundschaft " have for years been systematically violating a section of the public broadcasting code that forbids the inclusion of unmarked advertising .
the rule aims to reduce confusing viewers by commingling content and advertising .
bildunterschrift : product placement von apple computer in filmen 2005 fever pitch in the meantime , bavaria film has admitted to having " cooperated with third parties " during production of the series .
proceeds were used " within the framework of additional development and further production . "
buying dialog the so-called " active integration " of products in the show were brought about by h. + s. and kultur + werbung , two firms dealing in product placement that are run by an ex-actor named andreas schnoor .
in the mid 1990s , schnoor got the federal ministry for economic cooperation and development to shell out the equivalent of around 140,000 euros to the ard hospital-based series " klinik unter palmen . "
in exchange , the characters happened to discuss german aid and development programs .
treading a fine line these days , the eu commission is showing particular interest in the use of disguised advertisement by publicly financed broadcasters ; it is currently observing developments in which eu grievance procedures are pending on public broadcasters due to competition-distortion claims .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gottschalk : his gummi bears are on set , along with guest madonna the question is : how far can the commercial activities of public broadcasters go ?
thomas gottschalk -lrb- photo -rrb- , the host of the publicly-financed game-and-talk show " wetten dass ... , " sidelines as a spokesman for both candy company haribo -lrb- maker of gummi bears -rrb- and the german postal service .
can he use these products in his popular saturday night show ?
he should n't , according to journalist lilienthal .
already in 2004 , lilienthal published numerous examples of programs on publicly financed broadcaster zdf - germany 's " channel two " , - where advertisements had found their way into scripts .
the criticisms prompted zdf 's broadcasting advisory board to create a " 10 point plan " toward combating the " creeping self-commercialization " of the broadcaster .
since then , observers have noticed a reduction in such borderline product placement .
defining ' meaningful ' " advertising disguised as content is forbidden , although product placement is allowed , " said peter widlok of the communications commission for the state of north rhine-westphalia .
" when the inclusion of a product is necessary or meaningful in terms of dramatic or content , there is absolutely no reason that a police commissioner on television ca n't drive a bmw . "
the problem is defining what is meaningful use of a product and what is simply gratuitous advertising .
" its not always possible to be certain whether something is deliberately or just incidentally in the picture , " widlok said .
uncertainty in random test recently , state communications commissioners criticized an increase in product placement .
" in a random sample in february , questionable instances were found in ten cases , " widlok said .
" we encouraged the responsible state communications commissions to take action . "
in this case , action means allowing the broadcasters to respond in a statement to the accusations .
sanctions can only be used in a case where deliberate intent is proved .
but that is rarely possible , widlok said .
ingeborg zahrnt , a communications commission consultant in the state of brandenburg , said the increase in product placement and disguised advertising is due to the raging crisis in the advertising industry .
famous cases " the private broadcasters are fighting against falling advertising revenues , and viewers tend to switch channels during long advertising segments , " zahrnt said .
" so they have to get creative with their advertising . "
manufacturers have seen many a product placement success story over the years : in the 1967 classic film " the graduate , " dustin hoffman drove an alfa romeo , and the italian carmaker immediately felt the results in the form of improved sales .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pierce brosnan , as oo7 , before his bmw 750 il since then , manufacturers have tried to get their cars used in films .
its not incidental that bmw cars have a star role in james bond films .
in 2004 , pepsi managed to get placed in seven blockbuster films .

in exchange , the characters happened to discuss german aid and development programs .

he should n't , according to journalist lilienthal .
already in 2004 , lilienthal published numerous examples of programs on publicly financed broadcaster zdf - germany 's " channel two " , - where advertisements had found their way into scripts .
the criticisms prompted zdf 's broadcasting advisory board to create a " 10 point plan " toward combating the " creeping self-commercialization " of the broadcaster .
since then , observers have noticed a reduction in such borderline product placement .
defining ' meaningful ' " advertising disguised as content is forbidden , although product placement is allowed , " said peter widlok of the communications commission for the state of north rhine-westphalia .
" when the inclusion of a product is necessary or meaningful in terms of dramatic or content , there is absolutely no reason that a police commissioner on television ca n't drive a bmw . "
the problem is defining what is meaningful use of a product and what is simply gratuitous advertising .
" its not always possible to be certain whether something is deliberately or just incidentally in the picture , " widlok said .
uncertainty in random test recently , state communications commissioners criticized an increase in product placement .
" in a random sample in february , questionable instances were found in ten cases , " widlok said .

the journey takes eight minutes by maglev where it would take a car up to an hour . britain 's finance minister , chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown traveled on the shanghai maglev in february and was reportedly very impressed .
transrapid 's british team has since briefed tony blair . britain looks for environmental alternative bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the maglev is more than twice as fast as britain 's fastest domestic train and 128.7mph faster than france 's tgv or japan 's bullet trains .
the british government is looking for an alternative to the increasing numbers of cheap domestic flights that make traveling the length of breadth of the island easier and faster but also noisier and less environmentally sound . the maglev is controlled by a magnetic charge which holds it 1 centimeter -lrb- less than half an inch -rrb- above a metal track and its effect on the environment is negligible .
transrapid uk have told blair that the project would pay huge environmental dividends as it would make domestic air travel virtually obsolete , with a trip from london to newcastle taking just one hour and 40 minutes . transrapid international , the german-based parent company , spent nearly two years working on a " pre-feasibility " plan for britain before presenting it to downing street .
jochen kruse , transrapid 's project manager in shanghai , said : " we 've had discussions with no. 10 - now we 'll be going to the department for transport . " kruse added that a green light from downing street would enable transrapid to come up with a detailed scheme in 18 months .
but construction could take many years . " how long does it typically take to build such things in england ? " he asked .
" if you could import a thousand chinese workers , it could be built in a year . " age-old problems could be a thing of the past as well as environmental and time efficiency aspects , the maglev network would improve the british transport system which has been deteriorating through aging train lines , badly run privatization schemes and congested roads .
it could also put an end to the perennial problems the inclement british weather has on train travel . " leaves on the line ?
i really do n't think that will be a problem , " kruse said . however , despite the obvious benefits , the british will be aware of the problems that the shanghai system has encountered since it went operational 18 months ago at a cost of 1.7 billion euros . expensive and prone to technical problems ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an estimated 2 million people have used the system so far but there are criticisms that the expensive upkeep of the technology is pricing the maglev out of the range of ordinary chinese . " it cost an awful lot of money to put in and it 's expensive to maintain , " one businessman told the british daily the guardian .
" most of the local chinese people ca n't afford to ride on it . " the shanghai line has had technical problems from the beginning .
one of the two tracks has been shut for long periods while engineers adjust malfunctioning cables which carry the electrical charge which sparks the train 's magnetism .
then there 's the problem of the entire system is sinking into the pudong , shanghai 's marshy outpost which separates the city from the airport . however , the problems have not stopped the chinese government from considering transrapid 's plans for a 3.8 billion euro extension to train line as a forerunner to building the line from london to scotland . expansion in china , options worldwide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pudong international airport , shanghai the germans plan to extend shanghai 's line to hangzhou , a provincial capital 201 kilometers away .
transrapid hopes the opening of the extension in 2010 , in time for the world expo in shanghai , will persuade the british government to commission the maglev for its central train route . if the british do take it on , they will join a growing list of supporters eager to take on the new technology .
while germany plans a maglev system for an airport link in munich , the united states government is due to choose imminently between three maglev schemes : a baltimore to washington railway , an airport link in pittsburgh or a 49.8 kilometer track through the nevada desert linking las vegas with casinos on the californian border , which could be extended to los angeles . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german transrapid runs on schedule in shanghai three decades after germans began working on a magnetic railway and three years after china ordered the system as shanghai ’ s airport connection , trains began regular operations monday .

but construction could take many years . " how long does it typically take to build such things in england ? " he asked .
" if you could import a thousand chinese workers , it could be built in a year . " age-old problems could be a thing of the past as well as environmental and time efficiency aspects , the maglev network would improve the british transport system which has been deteriorating through aging train lines , badly run privatization schemes and congested roads .
it could also put an end to the perennial problems the inclement british weather has on train travel . " leaves on the line ?
i really do n't think that will be a problem , " kruse said . however , despite the obvious benefits , the british will be aware of the problems that the shanghai system has encountered since it went operational 18 months ago at a cost of 1.7 billion euros . expensive and prone to technical problems ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an estimated 2 million people have used the system so far but there are criticisms that the expensive upkeep of the technology is pricing the maglev out of the range of ordinary chinese . " it cost an awful lot of money to put in and it 's expensive to maintain , " one businessman told the british daily the guardian .
" most of the local chinese people ca n't afford to ride on it . " the shanghai line has had technical problems from the beginning .
one of the two tracks has been shut for long periods while engineers adjust malfunctioning cables which carry the electrical charge which sparks the train 's magnetism .
then there 's the problem of the entire system is sinking into the pudong , shanghai 's marshy outpost which separates the city from the airport . however , the problems have not stopped the chinese government from considering transrapid 's plans for a 3.8 billion euro extension to train line as a forerunner to building the line from london to scotland . expansion in china , options worldwide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pudong international airport , shanghai the germans plan to extend shanghai 's line to hangzhou , a provincial capital 201 kilometers away .
transrapid hopes the opening of the extension in 2010 , in time for the world expo in shanghai , will persuade the british government to commission the maglev for its central train route . if the british do take it on , they will join a growing list of supporters eager to take on the new technology .
while germany plans a maglev system for an airport link in munich , the united states government is due to choose imminently between three maglev schemes : a baltimore to washington railway , an airport link in pittsburgh or a 49.8 kilometer track through the nevada desert linking las vegas with casinos on the californian border , which could be extended to los angeles . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german transrapid runs on schedule in shanghai three decades after germans began working on a magnetic railway and three years after china ordered the system as shanghai ’ s airport connection , trains began regular operations monday .

the journey takes eight minutes by maglev where it would take a car up to an hour . britain 's finance minister , chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown traveled on the shanghai maglev in february and was reportedly very impressed .
transrapid 's british team has since briefed tony blair . britain looks for environmental alternative bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the maglev is more than twice as fast as britain 's fastest domestic train and 128.7mph faster than france 's tgv or japan 's bullet trains .
the british government is looking for an alternative to the increasing numbers of cheap domestic flights that make traveling the length of breadth of the island easier and faster but also noisier and less environmentally sound . the maglev is controlled by a magnetic charge which holds it 1 centimeter -lrb- less than half an inch -rrb- above a metal track and its effect on the environment is negligible .
transrapid uk have told blair that the project would pay huge environmental dividends as it would make domestic air travel virtually obsolete , with a trip from london to newcastle taking just one hour and 40 minutes . transrapid international , the german-based parent company , spent nearly two years working on a " pre-feasibility " plan for britain before presenting it to downing street .
jochen kruse , transrapid 's project manager in shanghai , said : " we 've had discussions with no. 10 - now we 'll be going to the department for transport . " kruse added that a green light from downing street would enable transrapid to come up with a detailed scheme in 18 months .
but construction could take many years . " how long does it typically take to build such things in england ? " he asked .
" if you could import a thousand chinese workers , it could be built in a year . " age-old problems could be a thing of the past as well as environmental and time efficiency aspects , the maglev network would improve the british transport system which has been deteriorating through aging train lines , badly run privatization schemes and congested roads .
it could also put an end to the perennial problems the inclement british weather has on train travel . " leaves on the line ?
i really do n't think that will be a problem , " kruse said . however , despite the obvious benefits , the british will be aware of the problems that the shanghai system has encountered since it went operational 18 months ago at a cost of 1.7 billion euros . expensive and prone to technical problems ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an estimated 2 million people have used the system so far but there are criticisms that the expensive upkeep of the technology is pricing the maglev out of the range of ordinary chinese . " it cost an awful lot of money to put in and it 's expensive to maintain , " one businessman told the british daily the guardian .
" most of the local chinese people ca n't afford to ride on it . " the shanghai line has had technical problems from the beginning .
one of the two tracks has been shut for long periods while engineers adjust malfunctioning cables which carry the electrical charge which sparks the train 's magnetism .
then there 's the problem of the entire system is sinking into the pudong , shanghai 's marshy outpost which separates the city from the airport . however , the problems have not stopped the chinese government from considering transrapid 's plans for a 3.8 billion euro extension to train line as a forerunner to building the line from london to scotland . expansion in china , options worldwide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pudong international airport , shanghai the germans plan to extend shanghai 's line to hangzhou , a provincial capital 201 kilometers away .
transrapid hopes the opening of the extension in 2010 , in time for the world expo in shanghai , will persuade the british government to commission the maglev for its central train route . if the british do take it on , they will join a growing list of supporters eager to take on the new technology .
while germany plans a maglev system for an airport link in munich , the united states government is due to choose imminently between three maglev schemes : a baltimore to washington railway , an airport link in pittsburgh or a 49.8 kilometer track through the nevada desert linking las vegas with casinos on the californian border , which could be extended to los angeles . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german transrapid runs on schedule in shanghai three decades after germans began working on a magnetic railway and three years after china ordered the system as shanghai ’ s airport connection , trains began regular operations monday .

following a crushing defeat in a regional vote in may , schröder called for new polls to be held in september .
to do this , he has scheduled a vote of confidence on july 1 .
if the party would follow the leader , they would vote against him and the elections could take place .
but the chancellor has a problem : inner-party adversaries from the left are planning to vote for him in an attempt to thwart the early elections .
this was something that schröder did n't plan on .
rumors about a possible resignation before july 1 then spread to which he called " the wildest speculation . " but the already weak position of schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- in parliament could work to his advantage .
with a slim three-seat majority , the chancellor need only ask his own cabinet members to vote against him or abstain .
interior minister otto schily said he would do his part . " if i ’ m not going to take part in the confidence vote , i can neither vote yes or no , " he said .
" this is a viable option in line with the german constitution although i want to stress that it ‘ s all theoretical .
there is no need for the chancellor to resign .
gerhard schröder is still chancellor and he is planning to remain that beyond the elections . " greens feel patronized the secrecy regarding the upcoming vote has not only caused great irritation within the spd .
the junior coalition partner green party is fuming and feels kept in the dark .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greens parliamentary leader katrin göring-eckardt does n't think current government chaos is attributable to them two weeks ago schröder largely bypassed them when he decided for early elections .
now some members are rethinking whether the center-left coalition , if it were somehow victorious in september , should be continued .
back to the basics is the call of some . " we should sharpen our image as an ecological party , " said albert schmidt , a green member of parliament , " because an election campaign waged on center-left coalition nostalgia does n't make sense anymore .
it would be foolish to believe that our alliance will regain power .
we are headed for opposition and the social democrats clearly aim for a grand coalition with the conservatives . " opposition has its own headaches bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cdu chancellor candidate angela merkel enjoys comfortable margin a grand coalition ?
it would be hard to believe that the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- would have to resort to that .
opposition leader angela merkel -lrb- photo -rrb- currently enjoys a nearly 17-percent lead in opinion polls and stands a good chance of becoming the first female chancellor of germany . but she too has troubles with her potential junior coalition partner , the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
the two parties are at loggerheads over ways to finance major tax cuts promised to german voters .
merkel wouldn ’ t rule out an increase in the value-added tax to finance a major overhaul of the tax and social security systems . " our weak economy would be hurt by higher taxes , " she said .
" on the other hand we must be honest and tell voters that much depends on the state of public finances in germany and the need to reform our social systems .
i won ’ t rule out anything at this moment . " her remarks have angered the free democrats who are pushing for radical tax cuts and plans to curb trade union powers .
but some pollsters say the cdu might even win an absolute majority in the elections , which has strengthened merkel 's hand with her liberal allies . but before any of this happens , gerhard schröder must lose his vote of confidence on july 1 and under the current circumstances , that is anything but a sure thing . uwe hessler -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel chosen as chancellor candidate angela merkel , the leader of germany 's opposition christian democrats , has officially been chosen as the conservative challenger to chancellor gerhard schröder in early elections in the fall .
-lrb- may 31 , 2005 -rrb- schröder 's election strategy hits a snag chancellor gerhard schroeder is basing new elections on losing a planned vote of " no confidence " on july 1 .
but losing that and then going on to be left 's top candidate is proving a dilemma .
-lrb- may 28 , 2005 -rrb- early elections : strategy or slow suicide ?
the chancellor 's call to germans to seal his fate is one of his greatest political gambles yet .
public opinion is behind early elections , but does gerhard schröder really stand any chance of being re-elected ?

that would correspond to a price of 22 euros per hvb share or just over 16 billion euros -lrb- $ 19.7 billion -rrb- in all . no deal this week ? the source was nevertheless skeptical that a final deal would be announced this week , since a number of details still had to be settled . those details include the fate of hvb 's highly profitable austrian unit , bank austria creditanstalt . bildunterschrift : soon together ? the business daily handelsblatt reported on monday that unicredito may have to launch a public takeover offer to buy out the minority shareholders in the unit , which would add another two billion euros to the overall takeover price . financial times deutschland said that hvb would remain autonomous , constituting a separate division within the unicredito group .
the two banks had announced last week that they were in tie-up talks . german government not opposed if a deal does come about , it would be the biggest cross-border banking merger in europe , creating the fourth-biggest bank in the euro area and the ninth biggest in europe as a whole . the german government signaled it had no objections to a possible tie-up between hvb and unicredito . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister hans eichel does n't seem too worried about the potential merger such a transaction would not " be a bad thing " in that it would contribute to the consolidation of the european banking sector , said finance ministry spokesman stefan giffeler . but giffeler refused to comment further , insisting that the talks were a matter for the banks alone . on the frankfurt stock exchange , hvb shares were little changed in mid-afternoon trading , changing hands at 19.78 euros , down 0.01 euros or 0.05 percent on the day . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de unicredito-hypovereinsbank merger seen germany 's hypovereinsbank and italy 's unicredito are nearing agreement on a possible merger which is expected to be finalized sometime in june , according to reports .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus on education private universities take hold in germany jewish , muslim groups blast minister 's children 's initiative study : universities in eastern germany are top-notch concerns about scientology youth tutoring centers in germany current affairs -pipe- 06.06.2005 tuition fees face uphill battle in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " prevent tuition fees " reads the banner with conservatives gaining ground in german politics , the idea of free university education appears to be a thing of the past .
but , the idea of tuition fees and even study loans remains anathema to many students . in some countries , saving for a child 's education is commonplace .
in the us , where the average cost for a year of studying and living at a private college is currently $ 22,000 -lrb- 17,921 euros -rrb- , many parents start socking away money in a college fund even before they 've sent out birth announcements .
until recently , germans did n't have this concern .
the notion that everyone has a right to a cost-free university education has long been a given in modern german society .
but the concept was dealt a blow in january , when the german federal constitutional court decided to overturn a ban on tuition .
each state can now decide whether its universities will charge for their services , and how much .
painful adjustment the result is a political dust storm that has yet to settle .
conservatives tend to support the implementation of tuition fees , claiming the underfunded universities need all the financial help they can get .
liberals oppose it as being anti-egalitarian .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of third-semester medical students attend class in leipzig .
so far , it looks as if nine of the 16 german states - including north rhine westphalia , now that conservatives won power there in recent elections - will begin charging course fees for an initial round of university study .
the fees will not surpass 500 euros per semester .
already , 12 states impose fees of anywhere from 300 euros to 900 euros per semester for people who take too long to complete their degree , or for career changers who want to take on a second course of study .
while other european countries -lrb- england , for example -rrb- have already gone through the painful adjustment from free to fee education , most germans - who prize their free education system - find the idea of paying tuition for a first round of study outrageous .
last week , some 10,000 students in five cities took to the streets in protest .
new financial instruments but the prospect of tuition fees has grabbed the attention of some farsighted financial institutions , who have begun packaging loans aimed at students .
the kfw , germany 's state-owned development bank , caused a minor sensation in february when it announced a five percent interest loan available to university students , regardless of their subjects of study or their parents ' financial situation .
bildunterschrift : university seminar deutsche bank - unlike the kfw , a private credit institution whose instruments have to make good in the open marketplace - countered with its own student loan , similar to that of kfw but at a slightly higher rate of interest .
once the clamor and political wrangling surrounding tuition costs have subsided , even more credit institutions are expected to compete for the student market , experts say .
growing business " the business of financing student loans will become more important in the coming years , so it is important to get into the market early , " lars hinrichsen , financial adviser at mummert consulting told the handelsblatt newspaper .
sonja hüpfner , spokeswoman for the kfw , explained that the aim of their loan is mostly to help students complete their studies speedily and make them more competitive .
" along with studying , a lot of people have to work to make ends meet , which means it takes them longer to complete a degree , " hüpfner said .
some 63 percent of german students have part time jobs during their studies , according to the internet site studis-online .
long-term students german students take an average of six years to complete a university degree , hüpfner said - the longest of any european country .
" they go on the job market much later , which does n't help them in terms of competitiveness " she pointed out .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstration in essen against tution fees .
sign reads free education -lrb- still -rrb- for everyone according to hüpfner , german expectations of free education is a case of misguided values , tied to an overall cultural distrust of debt .
" people are afraid to take on debt .
but they have to ask themselves : do i want to invest in my own future ?
or should i just take longer to get through my studies , and come on the job market later ? "
judith graff , a fourth year student at the university of cologne , sees the loan issue from a practical standpoint .
sure , her studies have been prolonged by the fact that she has to work 20 hours a week to make ends meet - and that 's without having had to pay any tuition fees .
but she would rather not finish school in debt .
" everyone knows right now there are no jobs in germany .
how would you pay the loan back ? "
graff asked .
" if people come out of school with debt then they would hesitate to start a family ... it 's a bad cycle . "
falling reputation people who argue in favor of tuition say the money is needed to boost academic standards at german universities , whose reputations have suffered over the last few decades .
a recent ranking of the world 's top universities in the times higher education supplement revealed that only one german institution , the university of heidelberg , was placed in the top 50 .
but opponents say even relatively low tuition fees of 500 euros per semester can make the difference between a given student 's success and failure .
" some people say 500 euros a semester is n't much .
but that 's 83 euros a month , " achim meyer auf der heyde , general secretary of the union of german students told the suddeutsche zeitung .
" and 27 percent of students live off of 600 euros a month .
for that person , 83 euros is a lot . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jörg dräger but jörg dräger -lrb- photo -rrb- , hamburg 's senator for science and research , who helped kfw create its student loan , rejects the notion that tuition fees will widen the gap between germany 's haves and have-nots .
instead , he said , giving a college education a monetary value makes it that much more worthwhile .
fees - a great equalizer ?
" tuition fees do n't only improve the financial framework of universities .
they are above all an instrument with which one can more fairly distribute the chances of receiving a university education , " dräger told the hamburg media institute in an interview .
" in the usa , great britain and japan , many more children from -lrb- poorer -rrb- backgrounds study , despite tuition fees .
there , there is stronger awareness that education is also financially worthwhile , " he said .
with changing political winds in germany poised to make fee-based education more widespread , low-income students can only hope that dräger is right . jennifer abramsohn , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de are german universities losing their luster ?
chancellor schröder wants to reform the education system this year and the media is awash with talk of “ elite universities . ”

many require a visa to enter germany : foreign ministry officials have thought of a somewhat unusual way to prevent abuse . germany wants to be seen as a country that welcomes the world .
a year from now , millions of people are expected to attend the soccer world cup .
" the world as germany 's guest " is the slogan that 's been picked to promote that event . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benedict xvi will face the masses in cologne just like he did during his inauguration in rome in april the world youth day might not receive quite as much global attention , but with german-born pope benedict xvi expected to attend , it 's still a major affair . as a result , youth day visitors from countries that still need visas to enter germany will not have to pay the normal fees , according to foreign ministry officials .
instead , they might be asked to prove their christian convictions . on monday , german tabloid bild ran a fake christianity questionnaire visa applicants in albania will allegedly have to fill out before being allowed to enter germany . " when and how did jesus die ? " read one question .
" what are the names of the sons of adam and eve ? " was another , and finally : " how long did jesus remain on earth after his resurrection before ascending to heaven ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the regular visa application does not include questions about christianity a foreign ministry spokeswoman told dw-world that the german embassy in albania 's capital tirana had merely suggested such a procedure and added that there were no plans to ask visa applicants to fill out such questionnaires .
besides , now that the questions -lrb- and bild 's answers -rrb- were out in the open , it would n't make sense to still ask them , she said . what could happen , however , is that applicants might be asked a question or two during their interviews at the embassy to test their christian knowledge , the spokeswoman said .
local churches might also be asked to screen applicants and write letters of recommendation before sending them to the embassy , she added .

and the flooring-friendly text was n't written by a screenwriter with a carpet fetish .
the lines were proscribed by the consortium of textile floor coverings , and brought hard cash to bavaria film , the production company responsible for " marienhof . "
journalist volker lilienthal recently researched the issue of product placement on german tv .
he found that the daily soaps " marienhof " and " in aller freundschaft " have for years been systematically violating a section of the public broadcasting code that forbids the inclusion of unmarked advertising .
the rule aims to reduce confusing viewers by commingling content and advertising .

he should n't , according to journalist lilienthal .
already in 2004 , lilienthal published numerous examples of programs on publicly financed broadcaster zdf - germany 's " channel two " , - where advertisements had found their way into scripts .
the criticisms prompted zdf 's broadcasting advisory board to create a " 10 point plan " toward combating the " creeping self-commercialization " of the broadcaster .
since then , observers have noticed a reduction in such borderline product placement .
defining ' meaningful ' " advertising disguised as content is forbidden , although product placement is allowed , " said peter widlok of the communications commission for the state of north rhine-westphalia .
" when the inclusion of a product is necessary or meaningful in terms of dramatic or content , there is absolutely no reason that a police commissioner on television ca n't drive a bmw . "
the problem is defining what is meaningful use of a product and what is simply gratuitous advertising .
" its not always possible to be certain whether something is deliberately or just incidentally in the picture , " widlok said .
uncertainty in random test recently , state communications commissioners criticized an increase in product placement .
" in a random sample in february , questionable instances were found in ten cases , " widlok said .
" we encouraged the responsible state communications commissions to take action . "
in this case , action means allowing the broadcasters to respond in a statement to the accusations .
sanctions can only be used in a case where deliberate intent is proved .
but that is rarely possible , widlok said .
ingeborg zahrnt , a communications commission consultant in the state of brandenburg , said the increase in product placement and disguised advertising is due to the raging crisis in the advertising industry .
famous cases " the private broadcasters are fighting against falling advertising revenues , and viewers tend to switch channels during long advertising segments , " zahrnt said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus on education private universities take hold in germany jewish , muslim groups blast minister 's children 's initiative study : universities in eastern germany are top-notch concerns about scientology youth tutoring centers in germany current affairs -pipe- 06.06.2005 tuition fees face uphill battle in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " prevent tuition fees " reads the banner with conservatives gaining ground in german politics , the idea of free university education appears to be a thing of the past .
but , the idea of tuition fees and even study loans remains anathema to many students . in some countries , saving for a child 's education is commonplace .
in the us , where the average cost for a year of studying and living at a private college is currently $ 22,000 -lrb- 17,921 euros -rrb- , many parents start socking away money in a college fund even before they 've sent out birth announcements .
until recently , germans did n't have this concern .
the notion that everyone has a right to a cost-free university education has long been a given in modern german society .
but the concept was dealt a blow in january , when the german federal constitutional court decided to overturn a ban on tuition .
each state can now decide whether its universities will charge for their services , and how much .
painful adjustment the result is a political dust storm that has yet to settle .
conservatives tend to support the implementation of tuition fees , claiming the underfunded universities need all the financial help they can get .
liberals oppose it as being anti-egalitarian .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of third-semester medical students attend class in leipzig .
so far , it looks as if nine of the 16 german states - including north rhine westphalia , now that conservatives won power there in recent elections - will begin charging course fees for an initial round of university study .
the fees will not surpass 500 euros per semester .
already , 12 states impose fees of anywhere from 300 euros to 900 euros per semester for people who take too long to complete their degree , or for career changers who want to take on a second course of study .
while other european countries -lrb- england , for example -rrb- have already gone through the painful adjustment from free to fee education , most germans - who prize their free education system - find the idea of paying tuition for a first round of study outrageous .
last week , some 10,000 students in five cities took to the streets in protest .
new financial instruments but the prospect of tuition fees has grabbed the attention of some farsighted financial institutions , who have begun packaging loans aimed at students .
the kfw , germany 's state-owned development bank , caused a minor sensation in february when it announced a five percent interest loan available to university students , regardless of their subjects of study or their parents ' financial situation .
bildunterschrift : university seminar deutsche bank - unlike the kfw , a private credit institution whose instruments have to make good in the open marketplace - countered with its own student loan , similar to that of kfw but at a slightly higher rate of interest .
once the clamor and political wrangling surrounding tuition costs have subsided , even more credit institutions are expected to compete for the student market , experts say .
growing business " the business of financing student loans will become more important in the coming years , so it is important to get into the market early , " lars hinrichsen , financial adviser at mummert consulting told the handelsblatt newspaper .
sonja hüpfner , spokeswoman for the kfw , explained that the aim of their loan is mostly to help students complete their studies speedily and make them more competitive .
" along with studying , a lot of people have to work to make ends meet , which means it takes them longer to complete a degree , " hüpfner said .
some 63 percent of german students have part time jobs during their studies , according to the internet site studis-online .
long-term students german students take an average of six years to complete a university degree , hüpfner said - the longest of any european country .
" they go on the job market much later , which does n't help them in terms of competitiveness " she pointed out .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstration in essen against tution fees .
sign reads free education -lrb- still -rrb- for everyone according to hüpfner , german expectations of free education is a case of misguided values , tied to an overall cultural distrust of debt .
" people are afraid to take on debt .
but they have to ask themselves : do i want to invest in my own future ?
or should i just take longer to get through my studies , and come on the job market later ? "
judith graff , a fourth year student at the university of cologne , sees the loan issue from a practical standpoint .
sure , her studies have been prolonged by the fact that she has to work 20 hours a week to make ends meet - and that 's without having had to pay any tuition fees .
but she would rather not finish school in debt .
" everyone knows right now there are no jobs in germany .
how would you pay the loan back ? "
graff asked .
" if people come out of school with debt then they would hesitate to start a family ... it 's a bad cycle . "
falling reputation people who argue in favor of tuition say the money is needed to boost academic standards at german universities , whose reputations have suffered over the last few decades .
a recent ranking of the world 's top universities in the times higher education supplement revealed that only one german institution , the university of heidelberg , was placed in the top 50 .
but opponents say even relatively low tuition fees of 500 euros per semester can make the difference between a given student 's success and failure .
" some people say 500 euros a semester is n't much .
but that 's 83 euros a month , " achim meyer auf der heyde , general secretary of the union of german students told the suddeutsche zeitung .
" and 27 percent of students live off of 600 euros a month .
for that person , 83 euros is a lot . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jörg dräger but jörg dräger -lrb- photo -rrb- , hamburg 's senator for science and research , who helped kfw create its student loan , rejects the notion that tuition fees will widen the gap between germany 's haves and have-nots .
instead , he said , giving a college education a monetary value makes it that much more worthwhile .
fees - a great equalizer ?
" tuition fees do n't only improve the financial framework of universities .
they are above all an instrument with which one can more fairly distribute the chances of receiving a university education , " dräger told the hamburg media institute in an interview .
" in the usa , great britain and japan , many more children from -lrb- poorer -rrb- backgrounds study , despite tuition fees .
there , there is stronger awareness that education is also financially worthwhile , " he said .

straw is to give his decision before parliament in the afternoon , choosing his words carefully to avoid making britain appear as the one to kill the treaty . british newspapers said straw would again insist on the need to respect the results of such plebiscites and announce a temporary freeze of the bill which would have allowed the referendum to proceed in britain in early 2006 .
such a move would allow time to determine the future of the constitutional treaty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a view over the river thames from the houses of parliament in westminster palace in london on thursday , london asked paris and the hague to spell out what their vision of its future was . " a period of reflection " " we believe that it is necessary to have a period of reflection in the lead up to discussions at the council of ministers meeting , " said a spokeswoman from blair 's offices at 10 downing street , referring to a meeting of leaders from the european union in brussels on june 16-17 . asked whether the saturday talks between chirac and schröder had affected britain 's standpoint on how to proceed with the constitution , the spokeswoman said : " there is nothing further to add .
that is our position at the moment . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder , center , hugs french president jacques chirac , left , as schröder 's wife doris looks on the french and german leaders , meeting in berlin , agreed that the ratification process of the landmark document for the 25-nation bloc should go on after voters in france and the netherlands voted against it .
every eu member country has " the right and the duty " to take its own decision on the constitution , said a german government spokesman after the two statesmen met over dinner to plot a way out of the crisis . germany has ratified the proposed text , although no referendum was used , and so have nine others of the 25 member states , but the damage caused by the " no " votes in france and the netherlands is severe . it is likely to be further compounded by straw 's speech before parliament . on the home front , freezing the referendum would spare blair a crushing defeat .
a poll published friday by the sun showed 72 percent of britons would reject the draft in a referendum , up from 57 previously . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair such a verdict would probably cause blair to step down as prime minister next year amid mounting political problems since his unpopular decision to join the 2003 us-led invasion of iraq . london 's decision could cause problems but , ten days before the european council meets in brussels , and less than a month before britain assumes the rotating european union presidency on july 1 , london 's expected decision is likely to bother some of its eu partners . most of them have called for forging ahead with the ratification process , echoing the remarks of european commission president jose manuel durao barroso , who is hostile to any " unilateral decision " by a member state . european affairs analyst richard whitman said it was " not a smart idea when you are about to take the job of presidency to go into that having upset a number of key interlocutors . " however , whitman , who heads the european program at the royal institute of international affairs in london , predicted the british decision " will likely trigger a small avalanche of other countries that will suspend " ratification . already denmark and portugal have suggested they would suspend ratification , said aurore wanlin , a researcher at the london-based centre for european reform . ireland no longer seems so sure about its own plans for a referendum .
" i ca n't say .
we will wait and see what comes out of the european council meeting in mid-june , " irish foreign minister dermot ahern said friday . wanlin said meanwhile that " you also have commissioners in brussels who have said in private that it would be too risky to continue with the ratification process because a series of no votes would endanger europe . " blair isolated ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france gave a stinging ' non ' to the draft eu constitution the french and dutch no votes could amount to an opportunity for blair and his vision of free-market economic vision for europe , in the absence of a strong european leadershiop , some experts said .
" the triumph of perfidious albion , " the weekly economist headlined . not so fast , other experts said .
because the european council from june 16-17 will also be about the 2007-2013 budget , where britain is under mounting pressure to give up its cherished 20-year-old rebate . some leaders are dreaming of an agreement to make the crisis blow over .
and on this file , blair , who is for now rejecting any compromise , is alone against everyone else . afp / dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu battles to keep crisis from widening the eu risks further turmoil as it fights to avoid a escalation of one of its worst crises even as french and german leaders underlined saturday that the ratification process of the new constitution should go on .

-lrb- june 4 , 2005 -rrb- politicians cast doubt on further expansion if the proposed european union constitutional treaty is not adopted , further enlargement of the 25-member club to include turkey and other candidates will be impossible , german lawmakers said saturday .

but , the idea of tuition fees and even study loans remains anathema to many students . in some countries , saving for a child 's education is commonplace .
in the us , where the average cost for a year of studying and living at a private college is currently $ 22,000 -lrb- 17,921 euros -rrb- , many parents start socking away money in a college fund even before they 've sent out birth announcements .
until recently , germans did n't have this concern .
the notion that everyone has a right to a cost-free university education has long been a given in modern german society .
but the concept was dealt a blow in january , when the german federal constitutional court decided to overturn a ban on tuition .
each state can now decide whether its universities will charge for their services , and how much .
painful adjustment the result is a political dust storm that has yet to settle .
conservatives tend to support the implementation of tuition fees , claiming the underfunded universities need all the financial help they can get .
liberals oppose it as being anti-egalitarian .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of third-semester medical students attend class in leipzig .
so far , it looks as if nine of the 16 german states - including north rhine westphalia , now that conservatives won power there in recent elections - will begin charging course fees for an initial round of university study .
the fees will not surpass 500 euros per semester .
already , 12 states impose fees of anywhere from 300 euros to 900 euros per semester for people who take too long to complete their degree , or for career changers who want to take on a second course of study .
while other european countries -lrb- england , for example -rrb- have already gone through the painful adjustment from free to fee education , most germans - who prize their free education system - find the idea of paying tuition for a first round of study outrageous .
last week , some 10,000 students in five cities took to the streets in protest .
new financial instruments but the prospect of tuition fees has grabbed the attention of some farsighted financial institutions , who have begun packaging loans aimed at students .
the kfw , germany 's state-owned development bank , caused a minor sensation in february when it announced a five percent interest loan available to university students , regardless of their subjects of study or their parents ' financial situation .
bildunterschrift : university seminar deutsche bank - unlike the kfw , a private credit institution whose instruments have to make good in the open marketplace - countered with its own student loan , similar to that of kfw but at a slightly higher rate of interest .
once the clamor and political wrangling surrounding tuition costs have subsided , even more credit institutions are expected to compete for the student market , experts say .
growing business " the business of financing student loans will become more important in the coming years , so it is important to get into the market early , " lars hinrichsen , financial adviser at mummert consulting told the handelsblatt newspaper .
sonja hüpfner , spokeswoman for the kfw , explained that the aim of their loan is mostly to help students complete their studies speedily and make them more competitive .
" along with studying , a lot of people have to work to make ends meet , which means it takes them longer to complete a degree , " hüpfner said .
some 63 percent of german students have part time jobs during their studies , according to the internet site studis-online .
long-term students german students take an average of six years to complete a university degree , hüpfner said - the longest of any european country .
" they go on the job market much later , which does n't help them in terms of competitiveness " she pointed out .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstration in essen against tution fees .
sign reads free education -lrb- still -rrb- for everyone according to hüpfner , german expectations of free education is a case of misguided values , tied to an overall cultural distrust of debt .
" people are afraid to take on debt .
but they have to ask themselves : do i want to invest in my own future ?
or should i just take longer to get through my studies , and come on the job market later ? "
judith graff , a fourth year student at the university of cologne , sees the loan issue from a practical standpoint .
sure , her studies have been prolonged by the fact that she has to work 20 hours a week to make ends meet - and that 's without having had to pay any tuition fees .
but she would rather not finish school in debt .
" everyone knows right now there are no jobs in germany .
how would you pay the loan back ? "
graff asked .
" if people come out of school with debt then they would hesitate to start a family ... it 's a bad cycle . "
falling reputation people who argue in favor of tuition say the money is needed to boost academic standards at german universities , whose reputations have suffered over the last few decades .
a recent ranking of the world 's top universities in the times higher education supplement revealed that only one german institution , the university of heidelberg , was placed in the top 50 .
but opponents say even relatively low tuition fees of 500 euros per semester can make the difference between a given student 's success and failure .
" some people say 500 euros a semester is n't much .
but that 's 83 euros a month , " achim meyer auf der heyde , general secretary of the union of german students told the suddeutsche zeitung .
" and 27 percent of students live off of 600 euros a month .
for that person , 83 euros is a lot . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jörg dräger but jörg dräger -lrb- photo -rrb- , hamburg 's senator for science and research , who helped kfw create its student loan , rejects the notion that tuition fees will widen the gap between germany 's haves and have-nots .
instead , he said , giving a college education a monetary value makes it that much more worthwhile .
fees - a great equalizer ?
" tuition fees do n't only improve the financial framework of universities .
they are above all an instrument with which one can more fairly distribute the chances of receiving a university education , " dräger told the hamburg media institute in an interview .
" in the usa , great britain and japan , many more children from -lrb- poorer -rrb- backgrounds study , despite tuition fees .
there , there is stronger awareness that education is also financially worthwhile , " he said .
with changing political winds in germany poised to make fee-based education more widespread , low-income students can only hope that dräger is right . jennifer abramsohn , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de are german universities losing their luster ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus on education private universities take hold in germany jewish , muslim groups blast minister 's children 's initiative study : universities in eastern germany are top-notch concerns about scientology youth tutoring centers in germany current affairs -pipe- 06.06.2005 tuition fees face uphill battle in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " prevent tuition fees " reads the banner with conservatives gaining ground in german politics , the idea of free university education appears to be a thing of the past .
but , the idea of tuition fees and even study loans remains anathema to many students . in some countries , saving for a child 's education is commonplace .
in the us , where the average cost for a year of studying and living at a private college is currently $ 22,000 -lrb- 17,921 euros -rrb- , many parents start socking away money in a college fund even before they 've sent out birth announcements .
until recently , germans did n't have this concern .
the notion that everyone has a right to a cost-free university education has long been a given in modern german society .
but the concept was dealt a blow in january , when the german federal constitutional court decided to overturn a ban on tuition .
each state can now decide whether its universities will charge for their services , and how much .
painful adjustment the result is a political dust storm that has yet to settle .
conservatives tend to support the implementation of tuition fees , claiming the underfunded universities need all the financial help they can get .
liberals oppose it as being anti-egalitarian .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of third-semester medical students attend class in leipzig .
so far , it looks as if nine of the 16 german states - including north rhine westphalia , now that conservatives won power there in recent elections - will begin charging course fees for an initial round of university study .
the fees will not surpass 500 euros per semester .
already , 12 states impose fees of anywhere from 300 euros to 900 euros per semester for people who take too long to complete their degree , or for career changers who want to take on a second course of study .
while other european countries -lrb- england , for example -rrb- have already gone through the painful adjustment from free to fee education , most germans - who prize their free education system - find the idea of paying tuition for a first round of study outrageous .
last week , some 10,000 students in five cities took to the streets in protest .
new financial instruments but the prospect of tuition fees has grabbed the attention of some farsighted financial institutions , who have begun packaging loans aimed at students .
the kfw , germany 's state-owned development bank , caused a minor sensation in february when it announced a five percent interest loan available to university students , regardless of their subjects of study or their parents ' financial situation .
bildunterschrift : university seminar deutsche bank - unlike the kfw , a private credit institution whose instruments have to make good in the open marketplace - countered with its own student loan , similar to that of kfw but at a slightly higher rate of interest .
once the clamor and political wrangling surrounding tuition costs have subsided , even more credit institutions are expected to compete for the student market , experts say .
growing business " the business of financing student loans will become more important in the coming years , so it is important to get into the market early , " lars hinrichsen , financial adviser at mummert consulting told the handelsblatt newspaper .
sonja hüpfner , spokeswoman for the kfw , explained that the aim of their loan is mostly to help students complete their studies speedily and make them more competitive .
" along with studying , a lot of people have to work to make ends meet , which means it takes them longer to complete a degree , " hüpfner said .
some 63 percent of german students have part time jobs during their studies , according to the internet site studis-online .
long-term students german students take an average of six years to complete a university degree , hüpfner said - the longest of any european country .
" they go on the job market much later , which does n't help them in terms of competitiveness " she pointed out .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstration in essen against tution fees .
sign reads free education -lrb- still -rrb- for everyone according to hüpfner , german expectations of free education is a case of misguided values , tied to an overall cultural distrust of debt .
" people are afraid to take on debt .
but they have to ask themselves : do i want to invest in my own future ?
or should i just take longer to get through my studies , and come on the job market later ? "
judith graff , a fourth year student at the university of cologne , sees the loan issue from a practical standpoint .
sure , her studies have been prolonged by the fact that she has to work 20 hours a week to make ends meet - and that 's without having had to pay any tuition fees .
but she would rather not finish school in debt .
" everyone knows right now there are no jobs in germany .
how would you pay the loan back ? "
graff asked .
" if people come out of school with debt then they would hesitate to start a family ... it 's a bad cycle . "
falling reputation people who argue in favor of tuition say the money is needed to boost academic standards at german universities , whose reputations have suffered over the last few decades .
a recent ranking of the world 's top universities in the times higher education supplement revealed that only one german institution , the university of heidelberg , was placed in the top 50 .
but opponents say even relatively low tuition fees of 500 euros per semester can make the difference between a given student 's success and failure .
" some people say 500 euros a semester is n't much .
but that 's 83 euros a month , " achim meyer auf der heyde , general secretary of the union of german students told the suddeutsche zeitung .
" and 27 percent of students live off of 600 euros a month .
for that person , 83 euros is a lot . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jörg dräger but jörg dräger -lrb- photo -rrb- , hamburg 's senator for science and research , who helped kfw create its student loan , rejects the notion that tuition fees will widen the gap between germany 's haves and have-nots .
instead , he said , giving a college education a monetary value makes it that much more worthwhile .
fees - a great equalizer ?
" tuition fees do n't only improve the financial framework of universities .
they are above all an instrument with which one can more fairly distribute the chances of receiving a university education , " dräger told the hamburg media institute in an interview .

straw is to give his decision before parliament in the afternoon , choosing his words carefully to avoid making britain appear as the one to kill the treaty . british newspapers said straw would again insist on the need to respect the results of such plebiscites and announce a temporary freeze of the bill which would have allowed the referendum to proceed in britain in early 2006 .
such a move would allow time to determine the future of the constitutional treaty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a view over the river thames from the houses of parliament in westminster palace in london on thursday , london asked paris and the hague to spell out what their vision of its future was . " a period of reflection " " we believe that it is necessary to have a period of reflection in the lead up to discussions at the council of ministers meeting , " said a spokeswoman from blair 's offices at 10 downing street , referring to a meeting of leaders from the european union in brussels on june 16-17 . asked whether the saturday talks between chirac and schröder had affected britain 's standpoint on how to proceed with the constitution , the spokeswoman said : " there is nothing further to add .
that is our position at the moment . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder , center , hugs french president jacques chirac , left , as schröder 's wife doris looks on the french and german leaders , meeting in berlin , agreed that the ratification process of the landmark document for the 25-nation bloc should go on after voters in france and the netherlands voted against it .
every eu member country has " the right and the duty " to take its own decision on the constitution , said a german government spokesman after the two statesmen met over dinner to plot a way out of the crisis . germany has ratified the proposed text , although no referendum was used , and so have nine others of the 25 member states , but the damage caused by the " no " votes in france and the netherlands is severe . it is likely to be further compounded by straw 's speech before parliament . on the home front , freezing the referendum would spare blair a crushing defeat .
a poll published friday by the sun showed 72 percent of britons would reject the draft in a referendum , up from 57 previously . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair such a verdict would probably cause blair to step down as prime minister next year amid mounting political problems since his unpopular decision to join the 2003 us-led invasion of iraq . london 's decision could cause problems but , ten days before the european council meets in brussels , and less than a month before britain assumes the rotating european union presidency on july 1 , london 's expected decision is likely to bother some of its eu partners . most of them have called for forging ahead with the ratification process , echoing the remarks of european commission president jose manuel durao barroso , who is hostile to any " unilateral decision " by a member state . european affairs analyst richard whitman said it was " not a smart idea when you are about to take the job of presidency to go into that having upset a number of key interlocutors . " however , whitman , who heads the european program at the royal institute of international affairs in london , predicted the british decision " will likely trigger a small avalanche of other countries that will suspend " ratification . already denmark and portugal have suggested they would suspend ratification , said aurore wanlin , a researcher at the london-based centre for european reform . ireland no longer seems so sure about its own plans for a referendum .
" i ca n't say .
we will wait and see what comes out of the european council meeting in mid-june , " irish foreign minister dermot ahern said friday . wanlin said meanwhile that " you also have commissioners in brussels who have said in private that it would be too risky to continue with the ratification process because a series of no votes would endanger europe . " blair isolated ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france gave a stinging ' non ' to the draft eu constitution the french and dutch no votes could amount to an opportunity for blair and his vision of free-market economic vision for europe , in the absence of a strong european leadershiop , some experts said .
" the triumph of perfidious albion , " the weekly economist headlined . not so fast , other experts said .
because the european council from june 16-17 will also be about the 2007-2013 budget , where britain is under mounting pressure to give up its cherished 20-year-old rebate . some leaders are dreaming of an agreement to make the crisis blow over .

but , the idea of tuition fees and even study loans remains anathema to many students . in some countries , saving for a child 's education is commonplace .
in the us , where the average cost for a year of studying and living at a private college is currently $ 22,000 -lrb- 17,921 euros -rrb- , many parents start socking away money in a college fund even before they 've sent out birth announcements .
until recently , germans did n't have this concern .
the notion that everyone has a right to a cost-free university education has long been a given in modern german society .
but the concept was dealt a blow in january , when the german federal constitutional court decided to overturn a ban on tuition .
each state can now decide whether its universities will charge for their services , and how much .
painful adjustment the result is a political dust storm that has yet to settle .
conservatives tend to support the implementation of tuition fees , claiming the underfunded universities need all the financial help they can get .
liberals oppose it as being anti-egalitarian .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of third-semester medical students attend class in leipzig .
so far , it looks as if nine of the 16 german states - including north rhine westphalia , now that conservatives won power there in recent elections - will begin charging course fees for an initial round of university study .
the fees will not surpass 500 euros per semester .
already , 12 states impose fees of anywhere from 300 euros to 900 euros per semester for people who take too long to complete their degree , or for career changers who want to take on a second course of study .
while other european countries -lrb- england , for example -rrb- have already gone through the painful adjustment from free to fee education , most germans - who prize their free education system - find the idea of paying tuition for a first round of study outrageous .
last week , some 10,000 students in five cities took to the streets in protest .
new financial instruments but the prospect of tuition fees has grabbed the attention of some farsighted financial institutions , who have begun packaging loans aimed at students .
the kfw , germany 's state-owned development bank , caused a minor sensation in february when it announced a five percent interest loan available to university students , regardless of their subjects of study or their parents ' financial situation .
bildunterschrift : university seminar deutsche bank - unlike the kfw , a private credit institution whose instruments have to make good in the open marketplace - countered with its own student loan , similar to that of kfw but at a slightly higher rate of interest .
once the clamor and political wrangling surrounding tuition costs have subsided , even more credit institutions are expected to compete for the student market , experts say .
growing business " the business of financing student loans will become more important in the coming years , so it is important to get into the market early , " lars hinrichsen , financial adviser at mummert consulting told the handelsblatt newspaper .
sonja hüpfner , spokeswoman for the kfw , explained that the aim of their loan is mostly to help students complete their studies speedily and make them more competitive .
" along with studying , a lot of people have to work to make ends meet , which means it takes them longer to complete a degree , " hüpfner said .
some 63 percent of german students have part time jobs during their studies , according to the internet site studis-online .
long-term students german students take an average of six years to complete a university degree , hüpfner said - the longest of any european country .
" they go on the job market much later , which does n't help them in terms of competitiveness " she pointed out .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstration in essen against tution fees .
sign reads free education -lrb- still -rrb- for everyone according to hüpfner , german expectations of free education is a case of misguided values , tied to an overall cultural distrust of debt .
" people are afraid to take on debt .
but they have to ask themselves : do i want to invest in my own future ?
or should i just take longer to get through my studies , and come on the job market later ? "
judith graff , a fourth year student at the university of cologne , sees the loan issue from a practical standpoint .
sure , her studies have been prolonged by the fact that she has to work 20 hours a week to make ends meet - and that 's without having had to pay any tuition fees .
but she would rather not finish school in debt .
" everyone knows right now there are no jobs in germany .
how would you pay the loan back ? "
graff asked .
" if people come out of school with debt then they would hesitate to start a family ... it 's a bad cycle . "
falling reputation people who argue in favor of tuition say the money is needed to boost academic standards at german universities , whose reputations have suffered over the last few decades .
a recent ranking of the world 's top universities in the times higher education supplement revealed that only one german institution , the university of heidelberg , was placed in the top 50 .
but opponents say even relatively low tuition fees of 500 euros per semester can make the difference between a given student 's success and failure .
" some people say 500 euros a semester is n't much .
but that 's 83 euros a month , " achim meyer auf der heyde , general secretary of the union of german students told the suddeutsche zeitung .
" and 27 percent of students live off of 600 euros a month .
for that person , 83 euros is a lot . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jörg dräger but jörg dräger -lrb- photo -rrb- , hamburg 's senator for science and research , who helped kfw create its student loan , rejects the notion that tuition fees will widen the gap between germany 's haves and have-nots .
instead , he said , giving a college education a monetary value makes it that much more worthwhile .
fees - a great equalizer ?
" tuition fees do n't only improve the financial framework of universities .
they are above all an instrument with which one can more fairly distribute the chances of receiving a university education , " dräger told the hamburg media institute in an interview .
" in the usa , great britain and japan , many more children from -lrb- poorer -rrb- backgrounds study , despite tuition fees .
there , there is stronger awareness that education is also financially worthwhile , " he said .
with changing political winds in germany poised to make fee-based education more widespread , low-income students can only hope that dräger is right . jennifer abramsohn , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de are german universities losing their luster ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus on education private universities take hold in germany jewish , muslim groups blast minister 's children 's initiative study : universities in eastern germany are top-notch concerns about scientology youth tutoring centers in germany current affairs -pipe- 06.06.2005 tuition fees face uphill battle in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " prevent tuition fees " reads the banner with conservatives gaining ground in german politics , the idea of free university education appears to be a thing of the past .
but , the idea of tuition fees and even study loans remains anathema to many students . in some countries , saving for a child 's education is commonplace .
in the us , where the average cost for a year of studying and living at a private college is currently $ 22,000 -lrb- 17,921 euros -rrb- , many parents start socking away money in a college fund even before they 've sent out birth announcements .
until recently , germans did n't have this concern .
the notion that everyone has a right to a cost-free university education has long been a given in modern german society .
but the concept was dealt a blow in january , when the german federal constitutional court decided to overturn a ban on tuition .
each state can now decide whether its universities will charge for their services , and how much .
painful adjustment the result is a political dust storm that has yet to settle .
conservatives tend to support the implementation of tuition fees , claiming the underfunded universities need all the financial help they can get .
liberals oppose it as being anti-egalitarian .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of third-semester medical students attend class in leipzig .
so far , it looks as if nine of the 16 german states - including north rhine westphalia , now that conservatives won power there in recent elections - will begin charging course fees for an initial round of university study .
the fees will not surpass 500 euros per semester .
already , 12 states impose fees of anywhere from 300 euros to 900 euros per semester for people who take too long to complete their degree , or for career changers who want to take on a second course of study .
while other european countries -lrb- england , for example -rrb- have already gone through the painful adjustment from free to fee education , most germans - who prize their free education system - find the idea of paying tuition for a first round of study outrageous .
last week , some 10,000 students in five cities took to the streets in protest .
new financial instruments but the prospect of tuition fees has grabbed the attention of some farsighted financial institutions , who have begun packaging loans aimed at students .
the kfw , germany 's state-owned development bank , caused a minor sensation in february when it announced a five percent interest loan available to university students , regardless of their subjects of study or their parents ' financial situation .
bildunterschrift : university seminar deutsche bank - unlike the kfw , a private credit institution whose instruments have to make good in the open marketplace - countered with its own student loan , similar to that of kfw but at a slightly higher rate of interest .
once the clamor and political wrangling surrounding tuition costs have subsided , even more credit institutions are expected to compete for the student market , experts say .
growing business " the business of financing student loans will become more important in the coming years , so it is important to get into the market early , " lars hinrichsen , financial adviser at mummert consulting told the handelsblatt newspaper .
sonja hüpfner , spokeswoman for the kfw , explained that the aim of their loan is mostly to help students complete their studies speedily and make them more competitive .
" along with studying , a lot of people have to work to make ends meet , which means it takes them longer to complete a degree , " hüpfner said .
some 63 percent of german students have part time jobs during their studies , according to the internet site studis-online .
long-term students german students take an average of six years to complete a university degree , hüpfner said - the longest of any european country .
" they go on the job market much later , which does n't help them in terms of competitiveness " she pointed out .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstration in essen against tution fees .
sign reads free education -lrb- still -rrb- for everyone according to hüpfner , german expectations of free education is a case of misguided values , tied to an overall cultural distrust of debt .
" people are afraid to take on debt .
but they have to ask themselves : do i want to invest in my own future ?
or should i just take longer to get through my studies , and come on the job market later ? "
judith graff , a fourth year student at the university of cologne , sees the loan issue from a practical standpoint .
sure , her studies have been prolonged by the fact that she has to work 20 hours a week to make ends meet - and that 's without having had to pay any tuition fees .
but she would rather not finish school in debt .
" everyone knows right now there are no jobs in germany .
how would you pay the loan back ? "
graff asked .
" if people come out of school with debt then they would hesitate to start a family ... it 's a bad cycle . "
falling reputation people who argue in favor of tuition say the money is needed to boost academic standards at german universities , whose reputations have suffered over the last few decades .
a recent ranking of the world 's top universities in the times higher education supplement revealed that only one german institution , the university of heidelberg , was placed in the top 50 .
but opponents say even relatively low tuition fees of 500 euros per semester can make the difference between a given student 's success and failure .
" some people say 500 euros a semester is n't much .
but that 's 83 euros a month , " achim meyer auf der heyde , general secretary of the union of german students told the suddeutsche zeitung .
" and 27 percent of students live off of 600 euros a month .
for that person , 83 euros is a lot . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jörg dräger but jörg dräger -lrb- photo -rrb- , hamburg 's senator for science and research , who helped kfw create its student loan , rejects the notion that tuition fees will widen the gap between germany 's haves and have-nots .
instead , he said , giving a college education a monetary value makes it that much more worthwhile .
fees - a great equalizer ?
" tuition fees do n't only improve the financial framework of universities .
they are above all an instrument with which one can more fairly distribute the chances of receiving a university education , " dräger told the hamburg media institute in an interview .
" in the usa , great britain and japan , many more children from -lrb- poorer -rrb- backgrounds study , despite tuition fees .
there , there is stronger awareness that education is also financially worthwhile , " he said .
with changing political winds in germany poised to make fee-based education more widespread , low-income students can only hope that dräger is right . jennifer abramsohn , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de are german universities losing their luster ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 06.06.2005 britain delays eu referendum großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lacking a national one , they 're not quite ready for an eu constitution britain 's government reportedly delayed plans for a referendum on the embattled eu constitution monday , a relief for prime minister tony blair at home but a calculated risk for him across the channel . british foreign secretary jack straw was expected to announce monday that britain will freeze a referendum on the treaty after its rejection at the polls in france and the netherlands last week .
straw is to give his decision before parliament in the afternoon , choosing his words carefully to avoid making britain appear as the one to kill the treaty . british newspapers said straw would again insist on the need to respect the results of such plebiscites and announce a temporary freeze of the bill which would have allowed the referendum to proceed in britain in early 2006 .
such a move would allow time to determine the future of the constitutional treaty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a view over the river thames from the houses of parliament in westminster palace in london on thursday , london asked paris and the hague to spell out what their vision of its future was . " a period of reflection " " we believe that it is necessary to have a period of reflection in the lead up to discussions at the council of ministers meeting , " said a spokeswoman from blair 's offices at 10 downing street , referring to a meeting of leaders from the european union in brussels on june 16-17 . asked whether the saturday talks between chirac and schröder had affected britain 's standpoint on how to proceed with the constitution , the spokeswoman said : " there is nothing further to add .
that is our position at the moment . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder , center , hugs french president jacques chirac , left , as schröder 's wife doris looks on the french and german leaders , meeting in berlin , agreed that the ratification process of the landmark document for the 25-nation bloc should go on after voters in france and the netherlands voted against it .
every eu member country has " the right and the duty " to take its own decision on the constitution , said a german government spokesman after the two statesmen met over dinner to plot a way out of the crisis . germany has ratified the proposed text , although no referendum was used , and so have nine others of the 25 member states , but the damage caused by the " no " votes in france and the netherlands is severe . it is likely to be further compounded by straw 's speech before parliament . on the home front , freezing the referendum would spare blair a crushing defeat .
a poll published friday by the sun showed 72 percent of britons would reject the draft in a referendum , up from 57 previously . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair such a verdict would probably cause blair to step down as prime minister next year amid mounting political problems since his unpopular decision to join the 2003 us-led invasion of iraq . london 's decision could cause problems but , ten days before the european council meets in brussels , and less than a month before britain assumes the rotating european union presidency on july 1 , london 's expected decision is likely to bother some of its eu partners . most of them have called for forging ahead with the ratification process , echoing the remarks of european commission president jose manuel durao barroso , who is hostile to any " unilateral decision " by a member state . european affairs analyst richard whitman said it was " not a smart idea when you are about to take the job of presidency to go into that having upset a number of key interlocutors . " however , whitman , who heads the european program at the royal institute of international affairs in london , predicted the british decision " will likely trigger a small avalanche of other countries that will suspend " ratification . already denmark and portugal have suggested they would suspend ratification , said aurore wanlin , a researcher at the london-based centre for european reform . ireland no longer seems so sure about its own plans for a referendum .
" i ca n't say .
we will wait and see what comes out of the european council meeting in mid-june , " irish foreign minister dermot ahern said friday . wanlin said meanwhile that " you also have commissioners in brussels who have said in private that it would be too risky to continue with the ratification process because a series of no votes would endanger europe . " blair isolated ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france gave a stinging ' non ' to the draft eu constitution the french and dutch no votes could amount to an opportunity for blair and his vision of free-market economic vision for europe , in the absence of a strong european leadershiop , some experts said .
" the triumph of perfidious albion , " the weekly economist headlined . not so fast , other experts said .
because the european council from june 16-17 will also be about the 2007-2013 budget , where britain is under mounting pressure to give up its cherished 20-year-old rebate . some leaders are dreaming of an agreement to make the crisis blow over .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 06.06.2005 britain considers german magnet rail großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the transrapid could revolutionize travel from north to south in the uk britain could become the next country to adopt the german-designed transrapid maglev -lrb- magnetic levitation -rrb- train , according to reports in the british press on monday . the british government is said to be considering the german-designed maglev magnetic levitation rail technology for a line that would run along the country 's economic " spinal cord " from london to glasgow through birmingham , manchester , leeds , newcastle and edinburgh at a cost of at least 23.7 billion euros -lrb- $ 28.9 billion -rrb- not including appropriation of land . the maglev , created by transrapid , a joint venture between siemens and thyssenkrupp , is already in operation in china where the 434.5 kph -lrb- 270 mph -rrb- trains hurtle along a 30.5 kilometer -lrb- 19-mile -rrb- magnetic floating railway from the city of shanghai , through surrounding paddy fields to its destination at shanghai airport .
the journey takes eight minutes by maglev where it would take a car up to an hour . britain 's finance minister , chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown traveled on the shanghai maglev in february and was reportedly very impressed .
transrapid 's british team has since briefed tony blair . britain looks for environmental alternative bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the maglev is more than twice as fast as britain 's fastest domestic train and 128.7mph faster than france 's tgv or japan 's bullet trains .
the british government is looking for an alternative to the increasing numbers of cheap domestic flights that make traveling the length of breadth of the island easier and faster but also noisier and less environmentally sound . the maglev is controlled by a magnetic charge which holds it 1 centimeter -lrb- less than half an inch -rrb- above a metal track and its effect on the environment is negligible .
transrapid uk have told blair that the project would pay huge environmental dividends as it would make domestic air travel virtually obsolete , with a trip from london to newcastle taking just one hour and 40 minutes . transrapid international , the german-based parent company , spent nearly two years working on a " pre-feasibility " plan for britain before presenting it to downing street .
jochen kruse , transrapid 's project manager in shanghai , said : " we 've had discussions with no. 10 - now we 'll be going to the department for transport . " kruse added that a green light from downing street would enable transrapid to come up with a detailed scheme in 18 months .
but construction could take many years . " how long does it typically take to build such things in england ? " he asked .
" if you could import a thousand chinese workers , it could be built in a year . " age-old problems could be a thing of the past as well as environmental and time efficiency aspects , the maglev network would improve the british transport system which has been deteriorating through aging train lines , badly run privatization schemes and congested roads .
it could also put an end to the perennial problems the inclement british weather has on train travel . " leaves on the line ?
i really do n't think that will be a problem , " kruse said . however , despite the obvious benefits , the british will be aware of the problems that the shanghai system has encountered since it went operational 18 months ago at a cost of 1.7 billion euros . expensive and prone to technical problems ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an estimated 2 million people have used the system so far but there are criticisms that the expensive upkeep of the technology is pricing the maglev out of the range of ordinary chinese . " it cost an awful lot of money to put in and it 's expensive to maintain , " one businessman told the british daily the guardian .
" most of the local chinese people ca n't afford to ride on it . " the shanghai line has had technical problems from the beginning .
one of the two tracks has been shut for long periods while engineers adjust malfunctioning cables which carry the electrical charge which sparks the train 's magnetism .
then there 's the problem of the entire system is sinking into the pudong , shanghai 's marshy outpost which separates the city from the airport . however , the problems have not stopped the chinese government from considering transrapid 's plans for a 3.8 billion euro extension to train line as a forerunner to building the line from london to scotland . expansion in china , options worldwide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pudong international airport , shanghai the germans plan to extend shanghai 's line to hangzhou , a provincial capital 201 kilometers away .
transrapid hopes the opening of the extension in 2010 , in time for the world expo in shanghai , will persuade the british government to commission the maglev for its central train route . if the british do take it on , they will join a growing list of supporters eager to take on the new technology .
while germany plans a maglev system for an airport link in munich , the united states government is due to choose imminently between three maglev schemes : a baltimore to washington railway , an airport link in pittsburgh or a 49.8 kilometer track through the nevada desert linking las vegas with casinos on the californian border , which could be extended to los angeles . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german transrapid runs on schedule in shanghai three decades after germans began working on a magnetic railway and three years after china ordered the system as shanghai ’ s airport connection , trains began regular operations monday .

following a crushing defeat in a regional vote in may , schröder called for new polls to be held in september .
to do this , he has scheduled a vote of confidence on july 1 .
if the party would follow the leader , they would vote against him and the elections could take place .
but the chancellor has a problem : inner-party adversaries from the left are planning to vote for him in an attempt to thwart the early elections .
this was something that schröder did n't plan on .
rumors about a possible resignation before july 1 then spread to which he called " the wildest speculation . " but the already weak position of schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- in parliament could work to his advantage .
with a slim three-seat majority , the chancellor need only ask his own cabinet members to vote against him or abstain .
interior minister otto schily said he would do his part . " if i ’ m not going to take part in the confidence vote , i can neither vote yes or no , " he said .
" this is a viable option in line with the german constitution although i want to stress that it ‘ s all theoretical .
there is no need for the chancellor to resign .
gerhard schröder is still chancellor and he is planning to remain that beyond the elections . " greens feel patronized the secrecy regarding the upcoming vote has not only caused great irritation within the spd .
the junior coalition partner green party is fuming and feels kept in the dark .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greens parliamentary leader katrin göring-eckardt does n't think current government chaos is attributable to them two weeks ago schröder largely bypassed them when he decided for early elections .
now some members are rethinking whether the center-left coalition , if it were somehow victorious in september , should be continued .
back to the basics is the call of some . " we should sharpen our image as an ecological party , " said albert schmidt , a green member of parliament , " because an election campaign waged on center-left coalition nostalgia does n't make sense anymore .
it would be foolish to believe that our alliance will regain power .
we are headed for opposition and the social democrats clearly aim for a grand coalition with the conservatives . " opposition has its own headaches bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cdu chancellor candidate angela merkel enjoys comfortable margin a grand coalition ?
it would be hard to believe that the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- would have to resort to that .
opposition leader angela merkel -lrb- photo -rrb- currently enjoys a nearly 17-percent lead in opinion polls and stands a good chance of becoming the first female chancellor of germany . but she too has troubles with her potential junior coalition partner , the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
the two parties are at loggerheads over ways to finance major tax cuts promised to german voters .
merkel wouldn ’ t rule out an increase in the value-added tax to finance a major overhaul of the tax and social security systems . " our weak economy would be hurt by higher taxes , " she said .

but , the idea of tuition fees and even study loans remains anathema to many students . in some countries , saving for a child 's education is commonplace .
in the us , where the average cost for a year of studying and living at a private college is currently $ 22,000 -lrb- 17,921 euros -rrb- , many parents start socking away money in a college fund even before they 've sent out birth announcements .
until recently , germans did n't have this concern .
the notion that everyone has a right to a cost-free university education has long been a given in modern german society .
but the concept was dealt a blow in january , when the german federal constitutional court decided to overturn a ban on tuition .
each state can now decide whether its universities will charge for their services , and how much .
painful adjustment the result is a political dust storm that has yet to settle .
conservatives tend to support the implementation of tuition fees , claiming the underfunded universities need all the financial help they can get .
liberals oppose it as being anti-egalitarian .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of third-semester medical students attend class in leipzig .
so far , it looks as if nine of the 16 german states - including north rhine westphalia , now that conservatives won power there in recent elections - will begin charging course fees for an initial round of university study .
the fees will not surpass 500 euros per semester .
already , 12 states impose fees of anywhere from 300 euros to 900 euros per semester for people who take too long to complete their degree , or for career changers who want to take on a second course of study .
while other european countries -lrb- england , for example -rrb- have already gone through the painful adjustment from free to fee education , most germans - who prize their free education system - find the idea of paying tuition for a first round of study outrageous .
last week , some 10,000 students in five cities took to the streets in protest .
new financial instruments but the prospect of tuition fees has grabbed the attention of some farsighted financial institutions , who have begun packaging loans aimed at students .
the kfw , germany 's state-owned development bank , caused a minor sensation in february when it announced a five percent interest loan available to university students , regardless of their subjects of study or their parents ' financial situation .
bildunterschrift : university seminar deutsche bank - unlike the kfw , a private credit institution whose instruments have to make good in the open marketplace - countered with its own student loan , similar to that of kfw but at a slightly higher rate of interest .
once the clamor and political wrangling surrounding tuition costs have subsided , even more credit institutions are expected to compete for the student market , experts say .
growing business " the business of financing student loans will become more important in the coming years , so it is important to get into the market early , " lars hinrichsen , financial adviser at mummert consulting told the handelsblatt newspaper .
sonja hüpfner , spokeswoman for the kfw , explained that the aim of their loan is mostly to help students complete their studies speedily and make them more competitive .
" along with studying , a lot of people have to work to make ends meet , which means it takes them longer to complete a degree , " hüpfner said .
some 63 percent of german students have part time jobs during their studies , according to the internet site studis-online .
long-term students german students take an average of six years to complete a university degree , hüpfner said - the longest of any european country .
" they go on the job market much later , which does n't help them in terms of competitiveness " she pointed out .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstration in essen against tution fees .
sign reads free education -lrb- still -rrb- for everyone according to hüpfner , german expectations of free education is a case of misguided values , tied to an overall cultural distrust of debt .
" people are afraid to take on debt .
but they have to ask themselves : do i want to invest in my own future ?
or should i just take longer to get through my studies , and come on the job market later ? "
judith graff , a fourth year student at the university of cologne , sees the loan issue from a practical standpoint .
sure , her studies have been prolonged by the fact that she has to work 20 hours a week to make ends meet - and that 's without having had to pay any tuition fees .
but she would rather not finish school in debt .
" everyone knows right now there are no jobs in germany .
how would you pay the loan back ? "
graff asked .
" if people come out of school with debt then they would hesitate to start a family ... it 's a bad cycle . "
falling reputation people who argue in favor of tuition say the money is needed to boost academic standards at german universities , whose reputations have suffered over the last few decades .
a recent ranking of the world 's top universities in the times higher education supplement revealed that only one german institution , the university of heidelberg , was placed in the top 50 .
but opponents say even relatively low tuition fees of 500 euros per semester can make the difference between a given student 's success and failure .
" some people say 500 euros a semester is n't much .
but that 's 83 euros a month , " achim meyer auf der heyde , general secretary of the union of german students told the suddeutsche zeitung .
" and 27 percent of students live off of 600 euros a month .
for that person , 83 euros is a lot . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jörg dräger but jörg dräger -lrb- photo -rrb- , hamburg 's senator for science and research , who helped kfw create its student loan , rejects the notion that tuition fees will widen the gap between germany 's haves and have-nots .
instead , he said , giving a college education a monetary value makes it that much more worthwhile .
fees - a great equalizer ?
" tuition fees do n't only improve the financial framework of universities .
they are above all an instrument with which one can more fairly distribute the chances of receiving a university education , " dräger told the hamburg media institute in an interview .
" in the usa , great britain and japan , many more children from -lrb- poorer -rrb- backgrounds study , despite tuition fees .
there , there is stronger awareness that education is also financially worthwhile , " he said .
with changing political winds in germany poised to make fee-based education more widespread , low-income students can only hope that dräger is right . jennifer abramsohn , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de are german universities losing their luster ?

new financial instruments but the prospect of tuition fees has grabbed the attention of some farsighted financial institutions , who have begun packaging loans aimed at students .
the kfw , germany 's state-owned development bank , caused a minor sensation in february when it announced a five percent interest loan available to university students , regardless of their subjects of study or their parents ' financial situation .
bildunterschrift : university seminar deutsche bank - unlike the kfw , a private credit institution whose instruments have to make good in the open marketplace - countered with its own student loan , similar to that of kfw but at a slightly higher rate of interest .
once the clamor and political wrangling surrounding tuition costs have subsided , even more credit institutions are expected to compete for the student market , experts say .
growing business " the business of financing student loans will become more important in the coming years , so it is important to get into the market early , " lars hinrichsen , financial adviser at mummert consulting told the handelsblatt newspaper .
sonja hüpfner , spokeswoman for the kfw , explained that the aim of their loan is mostly to help students complete their studies speedily and make them more competitive .
" along with studying , a lot of people have to work to make ends meet , which means it takes them longer to complete a degree , " hüpfner said .
some 63 percent of german students have part time jobs during their studies , according to the internet site studis-online .
long-term students german students take an average of six years to complete a university degree , hüpfner said - the longest of any european country .
" they go on the job market much later , which does n't help them in terms of competitiveness " she pointed out .

sign reads free education -lrb- still -rrb- for everyone according to hüpfner , german expectations of free education is a case of misguided values , tied to an overall cultural distrust of debt .
" people are afraid to take on debt .
but they have to ask themselves : do i want to invest in my own future ?
or should i just take longer to get through my studies , and come on the job market later ? "
judith graff , a fourth year student at the university of cologne , sees the loan issue from a practical standpoint .
sure , her studies have been prolonged by the fact that she has to work 20 hours a week to make ends meet - and that 's without having had to pay any tuition fees .
but she would rather not finish school in debt .
" everyone knows right now there are no jobs in germany .
how would you pay the loan back ? "
graff asked .
" if people come out of school with debt then they would hesitate to start a family ... it 's a bad cycle . "
falling reputation people who argue in favor of tuition say the money is needed to boost academic standards at german universities , whose reputations have suffered over the last few decades .
a recent ranking of the world 's top universities in the times higher education supplement revealed that only one german institution , the university of heidelberg , was placed in the top 50 .
but opponents say even relatively low tuition fees of 500 euros per semester can make the difference between a given student 's success and failure .
" some people say 500 euros a semester is n't much .
but that 's 83 euros a month , " achim meyer auf der heyde , general secretary of the union of german students told the suddeutsche zeitung .
" and 27 percent of students live off of 600 euros a month .
for that person , 83 euros is a lot . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jörg dräger but jörg dräger -lrb- photo -rrb- , hamburg 's senator for science and research , who helped kfw create its student loan , rejects the notion that tuition fees will widen the gap between germany 's haves and have-nots .
instead , he said , giving a college education a monetary value makes it that much more worthwhile .
fees - a great equalizer ?
" tuition fees do n't only improve the financial framework of universities .
they are above all an instrument with which one can more fairly distribute the chances of receiving a university education , " dräger told the hamburg media institute in an interview .
" in the usa , great britain and japan , many more children from -lrb- poorer -rrb- backgrounds study , despite tuition fees .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus on education private universities take hold in germany jewish , muslim groups blast minister 's children 's initiative study : universities in eastern germany are top-notch concerns about scientology youth tutoring centers in germany current affairs -pipe- 06.06.2005 tuition fees face uphill battle in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " prevent tuition fees " reads the banner with conservatives gaining ground in german politics , the idea of free university education appears to be a thing of the past .
but , the idea of tuition fees and even study loans remains anathema to many students . in some countries , saving for a child 's education is commonplace .
in the us , where the average cost for a year of studying and living at a private college is currently $ 22,000 -lrb- 17,921 euros -rrb- , many parents start socking away money in a college fund even before they 've sent out birth announcements .
until recently , germans did n't have this concern .
the notion that everyone has a right to a cost-free university education has long been a given in modern german society .
but the concept was dealt a blow in january , when the german federal constitutional court decided to overturn a ban on tuition .
each state can now decide whether its universities will charge for their services , and how much .
painful adjustment the result is a political dust storm that has yet to settle .
conservatives tend to support the implementation of tuition fees , claiming the underfunded universities need all the financial help they can get .
liberals oppose it as being anti-egalitarian .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of third-semester medical students attend class in leipzig .
so far , it looks as if nine of the 16 german states - including north rhine westphalia , now that conservatives won power there in recent elections - will begin charging course fees for an initial round of university study .
the fees will not surpass 500 euros per semester .
already , 12 states impose fees of anywhere from 300 euros to 900 euros per semester for people who take too long to complete their degree , or for career changers who want to take on a second course of study .
while other european countries -lrb- england , for example -rrb- have already gone through the painful adjustment from free to fee education , most germans - who prize their free education system - find the idea of paying tuition for a first round of study outrageous .
last week , some 10,000 students in five cities took to the streets in protest .
new financial instruments but the prospect of tuition fees has grabbed the attention of some farsighted financial institutions , who have begun packaging loans aimed at students .
the kfw , germany 's state-owned development bank , caused a minor sensation in february when it announced a five percent interest loan available to university students , regardless of their subjects of study or their parents ' financial situation .
bildunterschrift : university seminar deutsche bank - unlike the kfw , a private credit institution whose instruments have to make good in the open marketplace - countered with its own student loan , similar to that of kfw but at a slightly higher rate of interest .
once the clamor and political wrangling surrounding tuition costs have subsided , even more credit institutions are expected to compete for the student market , experts say .
growing business " the business of financing student loans will become more important in the coming years , so it is important to get into the market early , " lars hinrichsen , financial adviser at mummert consulting told the handelsblatt newspaper .
sonja hüpfner , spokeswoman for the kfw , explained that the aim of their loan is mostly to help students complete their studies speedily and make them more competitive .
" along with studying , a lot of people have to work to make ends meet , which means it takes them longer to complete a degree , " hüpfner said .
some 63 percent of german students have part time jobs during their studies , according to the internet site studis-online .
long-term students german students take an average of six years to complete a university degree , hüpfner said - the longest of any european country .
" they go on the job market much later , which does n't help them in terms of competitiveness " she pointed out .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstration in essen against tution fees .
sign reads free education -lrb- still -rrb- for everyone according to hüpfner , german expectations of free education is a case of misguided values , tied to an overall cultural distrust of debt .
" people are afraid to take on debt .
but they have to ask themselves : do i want to invest in my own future ?
or should i just take longer to get through my studies , and come on the job market later ? "
judith graff , a fourth year student at the university of cologne , sees the loan issue from a practical standpoint .
sure , her studies have been prolonged by the fact that she has to work 20 hours a week to make ends meet - and that 's without having had to pay any tuition fees .
but she would rather not finish school in debt .
" everyone knows right now there are no jobs in germany .
how would you pay the loan back ? "
graff asked .
" if people come out of school with debt then they would hesitate to start a family ... it 's a bad cycle . "
falling reputation people who argue in favor of tuition say the money is needed to boost academic standards at german universities , whose reputations have suffered over the last few decades .
a recent ranking of the world 's top universities in the times higher education supplement revealed that only one german institution , the university of heidelberg , was placed in the top 50 .
but opponents say even relatively low tuition fees of 500 euros per semester can make the difference between a given student 's success and failure .
" some people say 500 euros a semester is n't much .
but that 's 83 euros a month , " achim meyer auf der heyde , general secretary of the union of german students told the suddeutsche zeitung .
" and 27 percent of students live off of 600 euros a month .

following a crushing defeat in a regional vote in may , schröder called for new polls to be held in september .
to do this , he has scheduled a vote of confidence on july 1 .
if the party would follow the leader , they would vote against him and the elections could take place .
but the chancellor has a problem : inner-party adversaries from the left are planning to vote for him in an attempt to thwart the early elections .
this was something that schröder did n't plan on .
rumors about a possible resignation before july 1 then spread to which he called " the wildest speculation . " but the already weak position of schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- in parliament could work to his advantage .
with a slim three-seat majority , the chancellor need only ask his own cabinet members to vote against him or abstain .
interior minister otto schily said he would do his part . " if i ’ m not going to take part in the confidence vote , i can neither vote yes or no , " he said .
" this is a viable option in line with the german constitution although i want to stress that it ‘ s all theoretical .
there is no need for the chancellor to resign .
gerhard schröder is still chancellor and he is planning to remain that beyond the elections . " greens feel patronized the secrecy regarding the upcoming vote has not only caused great irritation within the spd .
the junior coalition partner green party is fuming and feels kept in the dark .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greens parliamentary leader katrin göring-eckardt does n't think current government chaos is attributable to them two weeks ago schröder largely bypassed them when he decided for early elections .
now some members are rethinking whether the center-left coalition , if it were somehow victorious in september , should be continued .
back to the basics is the call of some . " we should sharpen our image as an ecological party , " said albert schmidt , a green member of parliament , " because an election campaign waged on center-left coalition nostalgia does n't make sense anymore .
it would be foolish to believe that our alliance will regain power .
we are headed for opposition and the social democrats clearly aim for a grand coalition with the conservatives . " opposition has its own headaches bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cdu chancellor candidate angela merkel enjoys comfortable margin a grand coalition ?
it would be hard to believe that the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- would have to resort to that .
opposition leader angela merkel -lrb- photo -rrb- currently enjoys a nearly 17-percent lead in opinion polls and stands a good chance of becoming the first female chancellor of germany . but she too has troubles with her potential junior coalition partner , the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
the two parties are at loggerheads over ways to finance major tax cuts promised to german voters .
merkel wouldn ’ t rule out an increase in the value-added tax to finance a major overhaul of the tax and social security systems . " our weak economy would be hurt by higher taxes , " she said .
" on the other hand we must be honest and tell voters that much depends on the state of public finances in germany and the need to reform our social systems .
i won ’ t rule out anything at this moment . " her remarks have angered the free democrats who are pushing for radical tax cuts and plans to curb trade union powers .
but some pollsters say the cdu might even win an absolute majority in the elections , which has strengthened merkel 's hand with her liberal allies . but before any of this happens , gerhard schröder must lose his vote of confidence on july 1 and under the current circumstances , that is anything but a sure thing . uwe hessler -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel chosen as chancellor candidate angela merkel , the leader of germany 's opposition christian democrats , has officially been chosen as the conservative challenger to chancellor gerhard schröder in early elections in the fall .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 06.06.2005 britain considers german magnet rail großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the transrapid could revolutionize travel from north to south in the uk britain could become the next country to adopt the german-designed transrapid maglev -lrb- magnetic levitation -rrb- train , according to reports in the british press on monday . the british government is said to be considering the german-designed maglev magnetic levitation rail technology for a line that would run along the country 's economic " spinal cord " from london to glasgow through birmingham , manchester , leeds , newcastle and edinburgh at a cost of at least 23.7 billion euros -lrb- $ 28.9 billion -rrb- not including appropriation of land . the maglev , created by transrapid , a joint venture between siemens and thyssenkrupp , is already in operation in china where the 434.5 kph -lrb- 270 mph -rrb- trains hurtle along a 30.5 kilometer -lrb- 19-mile -rrb- magnetic floating railway from the city of shanghai , through surrounding paddy fields to its destination at shanghai airport .
the journey takes eight minutes by maglev where it would take a car up to an hour . britain 's finance minister , chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown traveled on the shanghai maglev in february and was reportedly very impressed .
transrapid 's british team has since briefed tony blair . britain looks for environmental alternative bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the maglev is more than twice as fast as britain 's fastest domestic train and 128.7mph faster than france 's tgv or japan 's bullet trains .
the british government is looking for an alternative to the increasing numbers of cheap domestic flights that make traveling the length of breadth of the island easier and faster but also noisier and less environmentally sound . the maglev is controlled by a magnetic charge which holds it 1 centimeter -lrb- less than half an inch -rrb- above a metal track and its effect on the environment is negligible .
transrapid uk have told blair that the project would pay huge environmental dividends as it would make domestic air travel virtually obsolete , with a trip from london to newcastle taking just one hour and 40 minutes . transrapid international , the german-based parent company , spent nearly two years working on a " pre-feasibility " plan for britain before presenting it to downing street .
jochen kruse , transrapid 's project manager in shanghai , said : " we 've had discussions with no. 10 - now we 'll be going to the department for transport . " kruse added that a green light from downing street would enable transrapid to come up with a detailed scheme in 18 months .
but construction could take many years . " how long does it typically take to build such things in england ? " he asked .
" if you could import a thousand chinese workers , it could be built in a year . " age-old problems could be a thing of the past as well as environmental and time efficiency aspects , the maglev network would improve the british transport system which has been deteriorating through aging train lines , badly run privatization schemes and congested roads .
it could also put an end to the perennial problems the inclement british weather has on train travel . " leaves on the line ?
i really do n't think that will be a problem , " kruse said . however , despite the obvious benefits , the british will be aware of the problems that the shanghai system has encountered since it went operational 18 months ago at a cost of 1.7 billion euros . expensive and prone to technical problems ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an estimated 2 million people have used the system so far but there are criticisms that the expensive upkeep of the technology is pricing the maglev out of the range of ordinary chinese . " it cost an awful lot of money to put in and it 's expensive to maintain , " one businessman told the british daily the guardian .
" most of the local chinese people ca n't afford to ride on it . " the shanghai line has had technical problems from the beginning .
one of the two tracks has been shut for long periods while engineers adjust malfunctioning cables which carry the electrical charge which sparks the train 's magnetism .
then there 's the problem of the entire system is sinking into the pudong , shanghai 's marshy outpost which separates the city from the airport . however , the problems have not stopped the chinese government from considering transrapid 's plans for a 3.8 billion euro extension to train line as a forerunner to building the line from london to scotland . expansion in china , options worldwide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pudong international airport , shanghai the germans plan to extend shanghai 's line to hangzhou , a provincial capital 201 kilometers away .
transrapid hopes the opening of the extension in 2010 , in time for the world expo in shanghai , will persuade the british government to commission the maglev for its central train route . if the british do take it on , they will join a growing list of supporters eager to take on the new technology .
while germany plans a maglev system for an airport link in munich , the united states government is due to choose imminently between three maglev schemes : a baltimore to washington railway , an airport link in pittsburgh or a 49.8 kilometer track through the nevada desert linking las vegas with casinos on the californian border , which could be extended to los angeles . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german transrapid runs on schedule in shanghai three decades after germans began working on a magnetic railway and three years after china ordered the system as shanghai ’ s airport connection , trains began regular operations monday .

the journey takes eight minutes by maglev where it would take a car up to an hour . britain 's finance minister , chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown traveled on the shanghai maglev in february and was reportedly very impressed .
transrapid 's british team has since briefed tony blair . britain looks for environmental alternative bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the maglev is more than twice as fast as britain 's fastest domestic train and 128.7mph faster than france 's tgv or japan 's bullet trains .
the british government is looking for an alternative to the increasing numbers of cheap domestic flights that make traveling the length of breadth of the island easier and faster but also noisier and less environmentally sound . the maglev is controlled by a magnetic charge which holds it 1 centimeter -lrb- less than half an inch -rrb- above a metal track and its effect on the environment is negligible .

jochen kruse , transrapid 's project manager in shanghai , said : " we 've had discussions with no. 10 - now we 'll be going to the department for transport . " kruse added that a green light from downing street would enable transrapid to come up with a detailed scheme in 18 months .

following a crushing defeat in a regional vote in may , schröder called for new polls to be held in september .
to do this , he has scheduled a vote of confidence on july 1 .
if the party would follow the leader , they would vote against him and the elections could take place .
but the chancellor has a problem : inner-party adversaries from the left are planning to vote for him in an attempt to thwart the early elections .
this was something that schröder did n't plan on .
rumors about a possible resignation before july 1 then spread to which he called " the wildest speculation . " but the already weak position of schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- in parliament could work to his advantage .
with a slim three-seat majority , the chancellor need only ask his own cabinet members to vote against him or abstain .
interior minister otto schily said he would do his part . " if i ’ m not going to take part in the confidence vote , i can neither vote yes or no , " he said .
" this is a viable option in line with the german constitution although i want to stress that it ‘ s all theoretical .

back to the basics is the call of some . " we should sharpen our image as an ecological party , " said albert schmidt , a green member of parliament , " because an election campaign waged on center-left coalition nostalgia does n't make sense anymore .

but some pollsters say the cdu might even win an absolute majority in the elections , which has strengthened merkel 's hand with her liberal allies . but before any of this happens , gerhard schröder must lose his vote of confidence on july 1 and under the current circumstances , that is anything but a sure thing . uwe hessler -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel chosen as chancellor candidate angela merkel , the leader of germany 's opposition christian democrats , has officially been chosen as the conservative challenger to chancellor gerhard schröder in early elections in the fall .

straw is to give his decision before parliament in the afternoon , choosing his words carefully to avoid making britain appear as the one to kill the treaty . british newspapers said straw would again insist on the need to respect the results of such plebiscites and announce a temporary freeze of the bill which would have allowed the referendum to proceed in britain in early 2006 .
such a move would allow time to determine the future of the constitutional treaty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a view over the river thames from the houses of parliament in westminster palace in london on thursday , london asked paris and the hague to spell out what their vision of its future was . " a period of reflection " " we believe that it is necessary to have a period of reflection in the lead up to discussions at the council of ministers meeting , " said a spokeswoman from blair 's offices at 10 downing street , referring to a meeting of leaders from the european union in brussels on june 16-17 . asked whether the saturday talks between chirac and schröder had affected britain 's standpoint on how to proceed with the constitution , the spokeswoman said : " there is nothing further to add .

following a crushing defeat in a regional vote in may , schröder called for new polls to be held in september .
to do this , he has scheduled a vote of confidence on july 1 .
if the party would follow the leader , they would vote against him and the elections could take place .
but the chancellor has a problem : inner-party adversaries from the left are planning to vote for him in an attempt to thwart the early elections .
this was something that schröder did n't plan on .
rumors about a possible resignation before july 1 then spread to which he called " the wildest speculation . " but the already weak position of schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- in parliament could work to his advantage .
with a slim three-seat majority , the chancellor need only ask his own cabinet members to vote against him or abstain .
interior minister otto schily said he would do his part . " if i ’ m not going to take part in the confidence vote , i can neither vote yes or no , " he said .
" this is a viable option in line with the german constitution although i want to stress that it ‘ s all theoretical .
there is no need for the chancellor to resign .
gerhard schröder is still chancellor and he is planning to remain that beyond the elections . " greens feel patronized the secrecy regarding the upcoming vote has not only caused great irritation within the spd .
the junior coalition partner green party is fuming and feels kept in the dark .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greens parliamentary leader katrin göring-eckardt does n't think current government chaos is attributable to them two weeks ago schröder largely bypassed them when he decided for early elections .
now some members are rethinking whether the center-left coalition , if it were somehow victorious in september , should be continued .
back to the basics is the call of some . " we should sharpen our image as an ecological party , " said albert schmidt , a green member of parliament , " because an election campaign waged on center-left coalition nostalgia does n't make sense anymore .
it would be foolish to believe that our alliance will regain power .
we are headed for opposition and the social democrats clearly aim for a grand coalition with the conservatives . " opposition has its own headaches bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cdu chancellor candidate angela merkel enjoys comfortable margin a grand coalition ?
it would be hard to believe that the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- would have to resort to that .
opposition leader angela merkel -lrb- photo -rrb- currently enjoys a nearly 17-percent lead in opinion polls and stands a good chance of becoming the first female chancellor of germany . but she too has troubles with her potential junior coalition partner , the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
the two parties are at loggerheads over ways to finance major tax cuts promised to german voters .
merkel wouldn ’ t rule out an increase in the value-added tax to finance a major overhaul of the tax and social security systems . " our weak economy would be hurt by higher taxes , " she said .
" on the other hand we must be honest and tell voters that much depends on the state of public finances in germany and the need to reform our social systems .
i won ’ t rule out anything at this moment . " her remarks have angered the free democrats who are pushing for radical tax cuts and plans to curb trade union powers .
but some pollsters say the cdu might even win an absolute majority in the elections , which has strengthened merkel 's hand with her liberal allies . but before any of this happens , gerhard schröder must lose his vote of confidence on july 1 and under the current circumstances , that is anything but a sure thing . uwe hessler -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel chosen as chancellor candidate angela merkel , the leader of germany 's opposition christian democrats , has officially been chosen as the conservative challenger to chancellor gerhard schröder in early elections in the fall .
-lrb- may 31 , 2005 -rrb- schröder 's election strategy hits a snag chancellor gerhard schroeder is basing new elections on losing a planned vote of " no confidence " on july 1 .
but losing that and then going on to be left 's top candidate is proving a dilemma .
-lrb- may 28 , 2005 -rrb- early elections : strategy or slow suicide ?
the chancellor 's call to germans to seal his fate is one of his greatest political gambles yet .
public opinion is behind early elections , but does gerhard schröder really stand any chance of being re-elected ?

straw is to give his decision before parliament in the afternoon , choosing his words carefully to avoid making britain appear as the one to kill the treaty . british newspapers said straw would again insist on the need to respect the results of such plebiscites and announce a temporary freeze of the bill which would have allowed the referendum to proceed in britain in early 2006 .
such a move would allow time to determine the future of the constitutional treaty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a view over the river thames from the houses of parliament in westminster palace in london on thursday , london asked paris and the hague to spell out what their vision of its future was . " a period of reflection " " we believe that it is necessary to have a period of reflection in the lead up to discussions at the council of ministers meeting , " said a spokeswoman from blair 's offices at 10 downing street , referring to a meeting of leaders from the european union in brussels on june 16-17 . asked whether the saturday talks between chirac and schröder had affected britain 's standpoint on how to proceed with the constitution , the spokeswoman said : " there is nothing further to add .
that is our position at the moment . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder , center , hugs french president jacques chirac , left , as schröder 's wife doris looks on the french and german leaders , meeting in berlin , agreed that the ratification process of the landmark document for the 25-nation bloc should go on after voters in france and the netherlands voted against it .
every eu member country has " the right and the duty " to take its own decision on the constitution , said a german government spokesman after the two statesmen met over dinner to plot a way out of the crisis . germany has ratified the proposed text , although no referendum was used , and so have nine others of the 25 member states , but the damage caused by the " no " votes in france and the netherlands is severe . it is likely to be further compounded by straw 's speech before parliament . on the home front , freezing the referendum would spare blair a crushing defeat .
a poll published friday by the sun showed 72 percent of britons would reject the draft in a referendum , up from 57 previously . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair such a verdict would probably cause blair to step down as prime minister next year amid mounting political problems since his unpopular decision to join the 2003 us-led invasion of iraq . london 's decision could cause problems but , ten days before the european council meets in brussels , and less than a month before britain assumes the rotating european union presidency on july 1 , london 's expected decision is likely to bother some of its eu partners . most of them have called for forging ahead with the ratification process , echoing the remarks of european commission president jose manuel durao barroso , who is hostile to any " unilateral decision " by a member state . european affairs analyst richard whitman said it was " not a smart idea when you are about to take the job of presidency to go into that having upset a number of key interlocutors . " however , whitman , who heads the european program at the royal institute of international affairs in london , predicted the british decision " will likely trigger a small avalanche of other countries that will suspend " ratification . already denmark and portugal have suggested they would suspend ratification , said aurore wanlin , a researcher at the london-based centre for european reform . ireland no longer seems so sure about its own plans for a referendum .
" i ca n't say .
we will wait and see what comes out of the european council meeting in mid-june , " irish foreign minister dermot ahern said friday . wanlin said meanwhile that " you also have commissioners in brussels who have said in private that it would be too risky to continue with the ratification process because a series of no votes would endanger europe . " blair isolated ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france gave a stinging ' non ' to the draft eu constitution the french and dutch no votes could amount to an opportunity for blair and his vision of free-market economic vision for europe , in the absence of a strong european leadershiop , some experts said .
" the triumph of perfidious albion , " the weekly economist headlined . not so fast , other experts said .
because the european council from june 16-17 will also be about the 2007-2013 budget , where britain is under mounting pressure to give up its cherished 20-year-old rebate . some leaders are dreaming of an agreement to make the crisis blow over .
and on this file , blair , who is for now rejecting any compromise , is alone against everyone else . afp / dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu battles to keep crisis from widening the eu risks further turmoil as it fights to avoid a escalation of one of its worst crises even as french and german leaders underlined saturday that the ratification process of the new constitution should go on .

following a crushing defeat in a regional vote in may , schröder called for new polls to be held in september .
to do this , he has scheduled a vote of confidence on july 1 .
if the party would follow the leader , they would vote against him and the elections could take place .
but the chancellor has a problem : inner-party adversaries from the left are planning to vote for him in an attempt to thwart the early elections .
this was something that schröder did n't plan on .
rumors about a possible resignation before july 1 then spread to which he called " the wildest speculation . " but the already weak position of schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- in parliament could work to his advantage .
with a slim three-seat majority , the chancellor need only ask his own cabinet members to vote against him or abstain .
interior minister otto schily said he would do his part . " if i ’ m not going to take part in the confidence vote , i can neither vote yes or no , " he said .

following a crushing defeat in a regional vote in may , schröder called for new polls to be held in september .
to do this , he has scheduled a vote of confidence on july 1 .
if the party would follow the leader , they would vote against him and the elections could take place .
but the chancellor has a problem : inner-party adversaries from the left are planning to vote for him in an attempt to thwart the early elections .
this was something that schröder did n't plan on .
rumors about a possible resignation before july 1 then spread to which he called " the wildest speculation . " but the already weak position of schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- in parliament could work to his advantage .
with a slim three-seat majority , the chancellor need only ask his own cabinet members to vote against him or abstain .
interior minister otto schily said he would do his part . " if i ’ m not going to take part in the confidence vote , i can neither vote yes or no , " he said .
" this is a viable option in line with the german constitution although i want to stress that it ‘ s all theoretical .
there is no need for the chancellor to resign .
gerhard schröder is still chancellor and he is planning to remain that beyond the elections . " greens feel patronized the secrecy regarding the upcoming vote has not only caused great irritation within the spd .

the journey takes eight minutes by maglev where it would take a car up to an hour . britain 's finance minister , chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown traveled on the shanghai maglev in february and was reportedly very impressed .
transrapid 's british team has since briefed tony blair . britain looks for environmental alternative bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the maglev is more than twice as fast as britain 's fastest domestic train and 128.7mph faster than france 's tgv or japan 's bullet trains .
the british government is looking for an alternative to the increasing numbers of cheap domestic flights that make traveling the length of breadth of the island easier and faster but also noisier and less environmentally sound . the maglev is controlled by a magnetic charge which holds it 1 centimeter -lrb- less than half an inch -rrb- above a metal track and its effect on the environment is negligible .
transrapid uk have told blair that the project would pay huge environmental dividends as it would make domestic air travel virtually obsolete , with a trip from london to newcastle taking just one hour and 40 minutes . transrapid international , the german-based parent company , spent nearly two years working on a " pre-feasibility " plan for britain before presenting it to downing street .
jochen kruse , transrapid 's project manager in shanghai , said : " we 've had discussions with no. 10 - now we 'll be going to the department for transport . " kruse added that a green light from downing street would enable transrapid to come up with a detailed scheme in 18 months .

" if you could import a thousand chinese workers , it could be built in a year . " age-old problems could be a thing of the past as well as environmental and time efficiency aspects , the maglev network would improve the british transport system which has been deteriorating through aging train lines , badly run privatization schemes and congested roads .
it could also put an end to the perennial problems the inclement british weather has on train travel . " leaves on the line ?
i really do n't think that will be a problem , " kruse said . however , despite the obvious benefits , the british will be aware of the problems that the shanghai system has encountered since it went operational 18 months ago at a cost of 1.7 billion euros . expensive and prone to technical problems ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an estimated 2 million people have used the system so far but there are criticisms that the expensive upkeep of the technology is pricing the maglev out of the range of ordinary chinese .

" most of the local chinese people ca n't afford to ride on it . " the shanghai line has had technical problems from the beginning .
one of the two tracks has been shut for long periods while engineers adjust malfunctioning cables which carry the electrical charge which sparks the train 's magnetism .
then there 's the problem of the entire system is sinking into the pudong , shanghai 's marshy outpost which separates the city from the airport . however , the problems have not stopped the chinese government from considering transrapid 's plans for a 3.8 billion euro extension to train line as a forerunner to building the line from london to scotland . expansion in china , options worldwide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pudong international airport , shanghai the germans plan to extend shanghai 's line to hangzhou , a provincial capital 201 kilometers away .

but , the idea of tuition fees and even study loans remains anathema to many students . in some countries , saving for a child 's education is commonplace .
in the us , where the average cost for a year of studying and living at a private college is currently $ 22,000 -lrb- 17,921 euros -rrb- , many parents start socking away money in a college fund even before they 've sent out birth announcements .
until recently , germans did n't have this concern .
the notion that everyone has a right to a cost-free university education has long been a given in modern german society .
but the concept was dealt a blow in january , when the german federal constitutional court decided to overturn a ban on tuition .
each state can now decide whether its universities will charge for their services , and how much .
painful adjustment the result is a political dust storm that has yet to settle .
conservatives tend to support the implementation of tuition fees , claiming the underfunded universities need all the financial help they can get .
liberals oppose it as being anti-egalitarian .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of third-semester medical students attend class in leipzig .
so far , it looks as if nine of the 16 german states - including north rhine westphalia , now that conservatives won power there in recent elections - will begin charging course fees for an initial round of university study .
the fees will not surpass 500 euros per semester .
already , 12 states impose fees of anywhere from 300 euros to 900 euros per semester for people who take too long to complete their degree , or for career changers who want to take on a second course of study .
while other european countries -lrb- england , for example -rrb- have already gone through the painful adjustment from free to fee education , most germans - who prize their free education system - find the idea of paying tuition for a first round of study outrageous .
last week , some 10,000 students in five cities took to the streets in protest .
new financial instruments but the prospect of tuition fees has grabbed the attention of some farsighted financial institutions , who have begun packaging loans aimed at students .
the kfw , germany 's state-owned development bank , caused a minor sensation in february when it announced a five percent interest loan available to university students , regardless of their subjects of study or their parents ' financial situation .
bildunterschrift : university seminar deutsche bank - unlike the kfw , a private credit institution whose instruments have to make good in the open marketplace - countered with its own student loan , similar to that of kfw but at a slightly higher rate of interest .
once the clamor and political wrangling surrounding tuition costs have subsided , even more credit institutions are expected to compete for the student market , experts say .
growing business " the business of financing student loans will become more important in the coming years , so it is important to get into the market early , " lars hinrichsen , financial adviser at mummert consulting told the handelsblatt newspaper .
sonja hüpfner , spokeswoman for the kfw , explained that the aim of their loan is mostly to help students complete their studies speedily and make them more competitive .
" along with studying , a lot of people have to work to make ends meet , which means it takes them longer to complete a degree , " hüpfner said .
some 63 percent of german students have part time jobs during their studies , according to the internet site studis-online .
long-term students german students take an average of six years to complete a university degree , hüpfner said - the longest of any european country .
" they go on the job market much later , which does n't help them in terms of competitiveness " she pointed out .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstration in essen against tution fees .
sign reads free education -lrb- still -rrb- for everyone according to hüpfner , german expectations of free education is a case of misguided values , tied to an overall cultural distrust of debt .
" people are afraid to take on debt .
but they have to ask themselves : do i want to invest in my own future ?
or should i just take longer to get through my studies , and come on the job market later ? "
judith graff , a fourth year student at the university of cologne , sees the loan issue from a practical standpoint .
sure , her studies have been prolonged by the fact that she has to work 20 hours a week to make ends meet - and that 's without having had to pay any tuition fees .
but she would rather not finish school in debt .
" everyone knows right now there are no jobs in germany .
how would you pay the loan back ? "
graff asked .
" if people come out of school with debt then they would hesitate to start a family ... it 's a bad cycle . "
falling reputation people who argue in favor of tuition say the money is needed to boost academic standards at german universities , whose reputations have suffered over the last few decades .
a recent ranking of the world 's top universities in the times higher education supplement revealed that only one german institution , the university of heidelberg , was placed in the top 50 .
but opponents say even relatively low tuition fees of 500 euros per semester can make the difference between a given student 's success and failure .
" some people say 500 euros a semester is n't much .
but that 's 83 euros a month , " achim meyer auf der heyde , general secretary of the union of german students told the suddeutsche zeitung .
" and 27 percent of students live off of 600 euros a month .
for that person , 83 euros is a lot . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jörg dräger but jörg dräger -lrb- photo -rrb- , hamburg 's senator for science and research , who helped kfw create its student loan , rejects the notion that tuition fees will widen the gap between germany 's haves and have-nots .
instead , he said , giving a college education a monetary value makes it that much more worthwhile .
fees - a great equalizer ?
" tuition fees do n't only improve the financial framework of universities .
they are above all an instrument with which one can more fairly distribute the chances of receiving a university education , " dräger told the hamburg media institute in an interview .
" in the usa , great britain and japan , many more children from -lrb- poorer -rrb- backgrounds study , despite tuition fees .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of third-semester medical students attend class in leipzig .
so far , it looks as if nine of the 16 german states - including north rhine westphalia , now that conservatives won power there in recent elections - will begin charging course fees for an initial round of university study .
the fees will not surpass 500 euros per semester .
already , 12 states impose fees of anywhere from 300 euros to 900 euros per semester for people who take too long to complete their degree , or for career changers who want to take on a second course of study .
while other european countries -lrb- england , for example -rrb- have already gone through the painful adjustment from free to fee education , most germans - who prize their free education system - find the idea of paying tuition for a first round of study outrageous .
last week , some 10,000 students in five cities took to the streets in protest .
new financial instruments but the prospect of tuition fees has grabbed the attention of some farsighted financial institutions , who have begun packaging loans aimed at students .
the kfw , germany 's state-owned development bank , caused a minor sensation in february when it announced a five percent interest loan available to university students , regardless of their subjects of study or their parents ' financial situation .
bildunterschrift : university seminar deutsche bank - unlike the kfw , a private credit institution whose instruments have to make good in the open marketplace - countered with its own student loan , similar to that of kfw but at a slightly higher rate of interest .
once the clamor and political wrangling surrounding tuition costs have subsided , even more credit institutions are expected to compete for the student market , experts say .
growing business " the business of financing student loans will become more important in the coming years , so it is important to get into the market early , " lars hinrichsen , financial adviser at mummert consulting told the handelsblatt newspaper .
sonja hüpfner , spokeswoman for the kfw , explained that the aim of their loan is mostly to help students complete their studies speedily and make them more competitive .
" along with studying , a lot of people have to work to make ends meet , which means it takes them longer to complete a degree , " hüpfner said .
some 63 percent of german students have part time jobs during their studies , according to the internet site studis-online .
long-term students german students take an average of six years to complete a university degree , hüpfner said - the longest of any european country .
" they go on the job market much later , which does n't help them in terms of competitiveness " she pointed out .

sign reads free education -lrb- still -rrb- for everyone according to hüpfner , german expectations of free education is a case of misguided values , tied to an overall cultural distrust of debt .
" people are afraid to take on debt .
but they have to ask themselves : do i want to invest in my own future ?
or should i just take longer to get through my studies , and come on the job market later ? "
judith graff , a fourth year student at the university of cologne , sees the loan issue from a practical standpoint .
sure , her studies have been prolonged by the fact that she has to work 20 hours a week to make ends meet - and that 's without having had to pay any tuition fees .
but she would rather not finish school in debt .
" everyone knows right now there are no jobs in germany .
how would you pay the loan back ? "
graff asked .
" if people come out of school with debt then they would hesitate to start a family ... it 's a bad cycle . "
falling reputation people who argue in favor of tuition say the money is needed to boost academic standards at german universities , whose reputations have suffered over the last few decades .
a recent ranking of the world 's top universities in the times higher education supplement revealed that only one german institution , the university of heidelberg , was placed in the top 50 .
but opponents say even relatively low tuition fees of 500 euros per semester can make the difference between a given student 's success and failure .
" some people say 500 euros a semester is n't much .
but that 's 83 euros a month , " achim meyer auf der heyde , general secretary of the union of german students told the suddeutsche zeitung .
" and 27 percent of students live off of 600 euros a month .
for that person , 83 euros is a lot . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jörg dräger but jörg dräger -lrb- photo -rrb- , hamburg 's senator for science and research , who helped kfw create its student loan , rejects the notion that tuition fees will widen the gap between germany 's haves and have-nots .
instead , he said , giving a college education a monetary value makes it that much more worthwhile .
fees - a great equalizer ?
" tuition fees do n't only improve the financial framework of universities .
they are above all an instrument with which one can more fairly distribute the chances of receiving a university education , " dräger told the hamburg media institute in an interview .
" in the usa , great britain and japan , many more children from -lrb- poorer -rrb- backgrounds study , despite tuition fees .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 06.06.2005 britain considers german magnet rail großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the transrapid could revolutionize travel from north to south in the uk britain could become the next country to adopt the german-designed transrapid maglev -lrb- magnetic levitation -rrb- train , according to reports in the british press on monday . the british government is said to be considering the german-designed maglev magnetic levitation rail technology for a line that would run along the country 's economic " spinal cord " from london to glasgow through birmingham , manchester , leeds , newcastle and edinburgh at a cost of at least 23.7 billion euros -lrb- $ 28.9 billion -rrb- not including appropriation of land . the maglev , created by transrapid , a joint venture between siemens and thyssenkrupp , is already in operation in china where the 434.5 kph -lrb- 270 mph -rrb- trains hurtle along a 30.5 kilometer -lrb- 19-mile -rrb- magnetic floating railway from the city of shanghai , through surrounding paddy fields to its destination at shanghai airport .
the journey takes eight minutes by maglev where it would take a car up to an hour . britain 's finance minister , chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown traveled on the shanghai maglev in february and was reportedly very impressed .
transrapid 's british team has since briefed tony blair . britain looks for environmental alternative bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the maglev is more than twice as fast as britain 's fastest domestic train and 128.7mph faster than france 's tgv or japan 's bullet trains .
the british government is looking for an alternative to the increasing numbers of cheap domestic flights that make traveling the length of breadth of the island easier and faster but also noisier and less environmentally sound . the maglev is controlled by a magnetic charge which holds it 1 centimeter -lrb- less than half an inch -rrb- above a metal track and its effect on the environment is negligible .
transrapid uk have told blair that the project would pay huge environmental dividends as it would make domestic air travel virtually obsolete , with a trip from london to newcastle taking just one hour and 40 minutes . transrapid international , the german-based parent company , spent nearly two years working on a " pre-feasibility " plan for britain before presenting it to downing street .
jochen kruse , transrapid 's project manager in shanghai , said : " we 've had discussions with no. 10 - now we 'll be going to the department for transport . " kruse added that a green light from downing street would enable transrapid to come up with a detailed scheme in 18 months .
but construction could take many years . " how long does it typically take to build such things in england ? " he asked .
" if you could import a thousand chinese workers , it could be built in a year . " age-old problems could be a thing of the past as well as environmental and time efficiency aspects , the maglev network would improve the british transport system which has been deteriorating through aging train lines , badly run privatization schemes and congested roads .
it could also put an end to the perennial problems the inclement british weather has on train travel . " leaves on the line ?
i really do n't think that will be a problem , " kruse said . however , despite the obvious benefits , the british will be aware of the problems that the shanghai system has encountered since it went operational 18 months ago at a cost of 1.7 billion euros . expensive and prone to technical problems ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an estimated 2 million people have used the system so far but there are criticisms that the expensive upkeep of the technology is pricing the maglev out of the range of ordinary chinese . " it cost an awful lot of money to put in and it 's expensive to maintain , " one businessman told the british daily the guardian .
" most of the local chinese people ca n't afford to ride on it . " the shanghai line has had technical problems from the beginning .
one of the two tracks has been shut for long periods while engineers adjust malfunctioning cables which carry the electrical charge which sparks the train 's magnetism .

the journey takes eight minutes by maglev where it would take a car up to an hour . britain 's finance minister , chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown traveled on the shanghai maglev in february and was reportedly very impressed .
transrapid 's british team has since briefed tony blair . britain looks for environmental alternative bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the maglev is more than twice as fast as britain 's fastest domestic train and 128.7mph faster than france 's tgv or japan 's bullet trains .
the british government is looking for an alternative to the increasing numbers of cheap domestic flights that make traveling the length of breadth of the island easier and faster but also noisier and less environmentally sound . the maglev is controlled by a magnetic charge which holds it 1 centimeter -lrb- less than half an inch -rrb- above a metal track and its effect on the environment is negligible .
transrapid uk have told blair that the project would pay huge environmental dividends as it would make domestic air travel virtually obsolete , with a trip from london to newcastle taking just one hour and 40 minutes . transrapid international , the german-based parent company , spent nearly two years working on a " pre-feasibility " plan for britain before presenting it to downing street .
jochen kruse , transrapid 's project manager in shanghai , said : " we 've had discussions with no. 10 - now we 'll be going to the department for transport . " kruse added that a green light from downing street would enable transrapid to come up with a detailed scheme in 18 months .
but construction could take many years . " how long does it typically take to build such things in england ? " he asked .
" if you could import a thousand chinese workers , it could be built in a year . " age-old problems could be a thing of the past as well as environmental and time efficiency aspects , the maglev network would improve the british transport system which has been deteriorating through aging train lines , badly run privatization schemes and congested roads .
it could also put an end to the perennial problems the inclement british weather has on train travel . " leaves on the line ?
i really do n't think that will be a problem , " kruse said . however , despite the obvious benefits , the british will be aware of the problems that the shanghai system has encountered since it went operational 18 months ago at a cost of 1.7 billion euros . expensive and prone to technical problems ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an estimated 2 million people have used the system so far but there are criticisms that the expensive upkeep of the technology is pricing the maglev out of the range of ordinary chinese . " it cost an awful lot of money to put in and it 's expensive to maintain , " one businessman told the british daily the guardian .
" most of the local chinese people ca n't afford to ride on it . " the shanghai line has had technical problems from the beginning .
one of the two tracks has been shut for long periods while engineers adjust malfunctioning cables which carry the electrical charge which sparks the train 's magnetism .

following a crushing defeat in a regional vote in may , schröder called for new polls to be held in september .
to do this , he has scheduled a vote of confidence on july 1 .
if the party would follow the leader , they would vote against him and the elections could take place .
but the chancellor has a problem : inner-party adversaries from the left are planning to vote for him in an attempt to thwart the early elections .
this was something that schröder did n't plan on .
rumors about a possible resignation before july 1 then spread to which he called " the wildest speculation . " but the already weak position of schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- in parliament could work to his advantage .
with a slim three-seat majority , the chancellor need only ask his own cabinet members to vote against him or abstain .
interior minister otto schily said he would do his part . " if i ’ m not going to take part in the confidence vote , i can neither vote yes or no , " he said .
" this is a viable option in line with the german constitution although i want to stress that it ‘ s all theoretical .

the two parties are at loggerheads over ways to finance major tax cuts promised to german voters .
merkel wouldn ’ t rule out an increase in the value-added tax to finance a major overhaul of the tax and social security systems . " our weak economy would be hurt by higher taxes , " she said .

i won ’ t rule out anything at this moment . " her remarks have angered the free democrats who are pushing for radical tax cuts and plans to curb trade union powers .
but some pollsters say the cdu might even win an absolute majority in the elections , which has strengthened merkel 's hand with her liberal allies . but before any of this happens , gerhard schröder must lose his vote of confidence on july 1 and under the current circumstances , that is anything but a sure thing . uwe hessler -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel chosen as chancellor candidate angela merkel , the leader of germany 's opposition christian democrats , has officially been chosen as the conservative challenger to chancellor gerhard schröder in early elections in the fall .

following a crushing defeat in a regional vote in may , schröder called for new polls to be held in september .
to do this , he has scheduled a vote of confidence on july 1 .
if the party would follow the leader , they would vote against him and the elections could take place .
but the chancellor has a problem : inner-party adversaries from the left are planning to vote for him in an attempt to thwart the early elections .
this was something that schröder did n't plan on .
rumors about a possible resignation before july 1 then spread to which he called " the wildest speculation . " but the already weak position of schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- in parliament could work to his advantage .
with a slim three-seat majority , the chancellor need only ask his own cabinet members to vote against him or abstain .
interior minister otto schily said he would do his part . " if i ’ m not going to take part in the confidence vote , i can neither vote yes or no , " he said .
" this is a viable option in line with the german constitution although i want to stress that it ‘ s all theoretical .
there is no need for the chancellor to resign .
gerhard schröder is still chancellor and he is planning to remain that beyond the elections . " greens feel patronized the secrecy regarding the upcoming vote has not only caused great irritation within the spd .
the junior coalition partner green party is fuming and feels kept in the dark .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greens parliamentary leader katrin göring-eckardt does n't think current government chaos is attributable to them two weeks ago schröder largely bypassed them when he decided for early elections .
now some members are rethinking whether the center-left coalition , if it were somehow victorious in september , should be continued .
back to the basics is the call of some . " we should sharpen our image as an ecological party , " said albert schmidt , a green member of parliament , " because an election campaign waged on center-left coalition nostalgia does n't make sense anymore .
it would be foolish to believe that our alliance will regain power .
we are headed for opposition and the social democrats clearly aim for a grand coalition with the conservatives . " opposition has its own headaches bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cdu chancellor candidate angela merkel enjoys comfortable margin a grand coalition ?
it would be hard to believe that the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- would have to resort to that .
opposition leader angela merkel -lrb- photo -rrb- currently enjoys a nearly 17-percent lead in opinion polls and stands a good chance of becoming the first female chancellor of germany . but she too has troubles with her potential junior coalition partner , the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
the two parties are at loggerheads over ways to finance major tax cuts promised to german voters .
merkel wouldn ’ t rule out an increase in the value-added tax to finance a major overhaul of the tax and social security systems . " our weak economy would be hurt by higher taxes , " she said .
" on the other hand we must be honest and tell voters that much depends on the state of public finances in germany and the need to reform our social systems .
i won ’ t rule out anything at this moment . " her remarks have angered the free democrats who are pushing for radical tax cuts and plans to curb trade union powers .
but some pollsters say the cdu might even win an absolute majority in the elections , which has strengthened merkel 's hand with her liberal allies . but before any of this happens , gerhard schröder must lose his vote of confidence on july 1 and under the current circumstances , that is anything but a sure thing . uwe hessler -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel chosen as chancellor candidate angela merkel , the leader of germany 's opposition christian democrats , has officially been chosen as the conservative challenger to chancellor gerhard schröder in early elections in the fall .
-lrb- may 31 , 2005 -rrb- schröder 's election strategy hits a snag chancellor gerhard schroeder is basing new elections on losing a planned vote of " no confidence " on july 1 .
but losing that and then going on to be left 's top candidate is proving a dilemma .

german public broadcaster ard seems to think so . " with carpets you have less dust , they absorb sound , they look impeccable and make it easier for children to take their first steps . "

and the flooring-friendly text was n't written by a screenwriter with a carpet fetish .
the lines were proscribed by the consortium of textile floor coverings , and brought hard cash to bavaria film , the production company responsible for " marienhof . "
journalist volker lilienthal recently researched the issue of product placement on german tv .
he found that the daily soaps " marienhof " and " in aller freundschaft " have for years been systematically violating a section of the public broadcasting code that forbids the inclusion of unmarked advertising .
the rule aims to reduce confusing viewers by commingling content and advertising .

buying dialog the so-called " active integration " of products in the show were brought about by h. + s. and kultur + werbung , two firms dealing in product placement that are run by an ex-actor named andreas schnoor .
in the mid 1990s , schnoor got the federal ministry for economic cooperation and development to shell out the equivalent of around 140,000 euros to the ard hospital-based series " klinik unter palmen . "
in exchange , the characters happened to discuss german aid and development programs .
treading a fine line these days , the eu commission is showing particular interest in the use of disguised advertisement by publicly financed broadcasters ; it is currently observing developments in which eu grievance procedures are pending on public broadcasters due to competition-distortion claims .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gottschalk : his gummi bears are on set , along with guest madonna the question is : how far can the commercial activities of public broadcasters go ?
thomas gottschalk -lrb- photo -rrb- , the host of the publicly-financed game-and-talk show " wetten dass ... , " sidelines as a spokesman for both candy company haribo -lrb- maker of gummi bears -rrb- and the german postal service .
can he use these products in his popular saturday night show ?
he should n't , according to journalist lilienthal .
already in 2004 , lilienthal published numerous examples of programs on publicly financed broadcaster zdf - germany 's " channel two " , - where advertisements had found their way into scripts .
the criticisms prompted zdf 's broadcasting advisory board to create a " 10 point plan " toward combating the " creeping self-commercialization " of the broadcaster .
since then , observers have noticed a reduction in such borderline product placement .
defining ' meaningful ' " advertising disguised as content is forbidden , although product placement is allowed , " said peter widlok of the communications commission for the state of north rhine-westphalia .
" when the inclusion of a product is necessary or meaningful in terms of dramatic or content , there is absolutely no reason that a police commissioner on television ca n't drive a bmw . "
the problem is defining what is meaningful use of a product and what is simply gratuitous advertising .
" its not always possible to be certain whether something is deliberately or just incidentally in the picture , " widlok said .
uncertainty in random test recently , state communications commissioners criticized an increase in product placement .
" in a random sample in february , questionable instances were found in ten cases , " widlok said .
" we encouraged the responsible state communications commissions to take action . "
in this case , action means allowing the broadcasters to respond in a statement to the accusations .
sanctions can only be used in a case where deliberate intent is proved .
but that is rarely possible , widlok said .
ingeborg zahrnt , a communications commission consultant in the state of brandenburg , said the increase in product placement and disguised advertising is due to the raging crisis in the advertising industry .
famous cases " the private broadcasters are fighting against falling advertising revenues , and viewers tend to switch channels during long advertising segments , " zahrnt said .
" so they have to get creative with their advertising . "
manufacturers have seen many a product placement success story over the years : in the 1967 classic film " the graduate , " dustin hoffman drove an alfa romeo , and the italian carmaker immediately felt the results in the form of improved sales .

many require a visa to enter germany : foreign ministry officials have thought of a somewhat unusual way to prevent abuse . germany wants to be seen as a country that welcomes the world .

instead , they might be asked to prove their christian convictions . on monday , german tabloid bild ran a fake christianity questionnaire visa applicants in albania will allegedly have to fill out before being allowed to enter germany . " when and how did jesus die ? " read one question .
" what are the names of the sons of adam and eve ? " was another , and finally : " how long did jesus remain on earth after his resurrection before ascending to heaven ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the regular visa application does not include questions about christianity a foreign ministry spokeswoman told dw-world that the german embassy in albania 's capital tirana had merely suggested such a procedure and added that there were no plans to ask visa applicants to fill out such questionnaires .
besides , now that the questions -lrb- and bild 's answers -rrb- were out in the open , it would n't make sense to still ask them , she said . what could happen , however , is that applicants might be asked a question or two during their interviews at the embassy to test their christian knowledge , the spokeswoman said .
local churches might also be asked to screen applicants and write letters of recommendation before sending them to the embassy , she added .

the problem is defining what is meaningful use of a product and what is simply gratuitous advertising .
" its not always possible to be certain whether something is deliberately or just incidentally in the picture , " widlok said .
uncertainty in random test recently , state communications commissioners criticized an increase in product placement .
" in a random sample in february , questionable instances were found in ten cases , " widlok said .
" we encouraged the responsible state communications commissions to take action . "

sanctions can only be used in a case where deliberate intent is proved .
but that is rarely possible , widlok said .
ingeborg zahrnt , a communications commission consultant in the state of brandenburg , said the increase in product placement and disguised advertising is due to the raging crisis in the advertising industry .

the lines were proscribed by the consortium of textile floor coverings , and brought hard cash to bavaria film , the production company responsible for " marienhof . "
journalist volker lilienthal recently researched the issue of product placement on german tv .
he found that the daily soaps " marienhof " and " in aller freundschaft " have for years been systematically violating a section of the public broadcasting code that forbids the inclusion of unmarked advertising .
the rule aims to reduce confusing viewers by commingling content and advertising .

in exchange , the characters happened to discuss german aid and development programs .
treading a fine line these days , the eu commission is showing particular interest in the use of disguised advertisement by publicly financed broadcasters ; it is currently observing developments in which eu grievance procedures are pending on public broadcasters due to competition-distortion claims .

he should n't , according to journalist lilienthal .
already in 2004 , lilienthal published numerous examples of programs on publicly financed broadcaster zdf - germany 's " channel two " , - where advertisements had found their way into scripts .
the criticisms prompted zdf 's broadcasting advisory board to create a " 10 point plan " toward combating the " creeping self-commercialization " of the broadcaster .
since then , observers have noticed a reduction in such borderline product placement .
defining ' meaningful ' " advertising disguised as content is forbidden , although product placement is allowed , " said peter widlok of the communications commission for the state of north rhine-westphalia .
" when the inclusion of a product is necessary or meaningful in terms of dramatic or content , there is absolutely no reason that a police commissioner on television ca n't drive a bmw . "
the problem is defining what is meaningful use of a product and what is simply gratuitous advertising .
" its not always possible to be certain whether something is deliberately or just incidentally in the picture , " widlok said .
uncertainty in random test recently , state communications commissioners criticized an increase in product placement .
" in a random sample in february , questionable instances were found in ten cases , " widlok said .
" we encouraged the responsible state communications commissions to take action . "
in this case , action means allowing the broadcasters to respond in a statement to the accusations .
sanctions can only be used in a case where deliberate intent is proved .
but that is rarely possible , widlok said .
ingeborg zahrnt , a communications commission consultant in the state of brandenburg , said the increase in product placement and disguised advertising is due to the raging crisis in the advertising industry .
famous cases " the private broadcasters are fighting against falling advertising revenues , and viewers tend to switch channels during long advertising segments , " zahrnt said .
" so they have to get creative with their advertising . "

the journey takes eight minutes by maglev where it would take a car up to an hour . britain 's finance minister , chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown traveled on the shanghai maglev in february and was reportedly very impressed .
transrapid 's british team has since briefed tony blair . britain looks for environmental alternative bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the maglev is more than twice as fast as britain 's fastest domestic train and 128.7mph faster than france 's tgv or japan 's bullet trains .
the british government is looking for an alternative to the increasing numbers of cheap domestic flights that make traveling the length of breadth of the island easier and faster but also noisier and less environmentally sound . the maglev is controlled by a magnetic charge which holds it 1 centimeter -lrb- less than half an inch -rrb- above a metal track and its effect on the environment is negligible .
transrapid uk have told blair that the project would pay huge environmental dividends as it would make domestic air travel virtually obsolete , with a trip from london to newcastle taking just one hour and 40 minutes . transrapid international , the german-based parent company , spent nearly two years working on a " pre-feasibility " plan for britain before presenting it to downing street .
jochen kruse , transrapid 's project manager in shanghai , said : " we 've had discussions with no. 10 - now we 'll be going to the department for transport . " kruse added that a green light from downing street would enable transrapid to come up with a detailed scheme in 18 months .

" if you could import a thousand chinese workers , it could be built in a year . " age-old problems could be a thing of the past as well as environmental and time efficiency aspects , the maglev network would improve the british transport system which has been deteriorating through aging train lines , badly run privatization schemes and congested roads .
it could also put an end to the perennial problems the inclement british weather has on train travel . " leaves on the line ?

the journey takes eight minutes by maglev where it would take a car up to an hour . britain 's finance minister , chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown traveled on the shanghai maglev in february and was reportedly very impressed .
transrapid 's british team has since briefed tony blair . britain looks for environmental alternative bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the maglev is more than twice as fast as britain 's fastest domestic train and 128.7mph faster than france 's tgv or japan 's bullet trains .
the british government is looking for an alternative to the increasing numbers of cheap domestic flights that make traveling the length of breadth of the island easier and faster but also noisier and less environmentally sound . the maglev is controlled by a magnetic charge which holds it 1 centimeter -lrb- less than half an inch -rrb- above a metal track and its effect on the environment is negligible .
transrapid uk have told blair that the project would pay huge environmental dividends as it would make domestic air travel virtually obsolete , with a trip from london to newcastle taking just one hour and 40 minutes . transrapid international , the german-based parent company , spent nearly two years working on a " pre-feasibility " plan for britain before presenting it to downing street .
jochen kruse , transrapid 's project manager in shanghai , said : " we 've had discussions with no. 10 - now we 'll be going to the department for transport . " kruse added that a green light from downing street would enable transrapid to come up with a detailed scheme in 18 months .

" if you could import a thousand chinese workers , it could be built in a year . " age-old problems could be a thing of the past as well as environmental and time efficiency aspects , the maglev network would improve the british transport system which has been deteriorating through aging train lines , badly run privatization schemes and congested roads .
it could also put an end to the perennial problems the inclement british weather has on train travel . " leaves on the line ?
i really do n't think that will be a problem , " kruse said . however , despite the obvious benefits , the british will be aware of the problems that the shanghai system has encountered since it went operational 18 months ago at a cost of 1.7 billion euros . expensive and prone to technical problems ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an estimated 2 million people have used the system so far but there are criticisms that the expensive upkeep of the technology is pricing the maglev out of the range of ordinary chinese . " it cost an awful lot of money to put in and it 's expensive to maintain , " one businessman told the british daily the guardian .
" most of the local chinese people ca n't afford to ride on it . " the shanghai line has had technical problems from the beginning .
one of the two tracks has been shut for long periods while engineers adjust malfunctioning cables which carry the electrical charge which sparks the train 's magnetism .
then there 's the problem of the entire system is sinking into the pudong , shanghai 's marshy outpost which separates the city from the airport . however , the problems have not stopped the chinese government from considering transrapid 's plans for a 3.8 billion euro extension to train line as a forerunner to building the line from london to scotland . expansion in china , options worldwide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pudong international airport , shanghai the germans plan to extend shanghai 's line to hangzhou , a provincial capital 201 kilometers away .

while germany plans a maglev system for an airport link in munich , the united states government is due to choose imminently between three maglev schemes : a baltimore to washington railway , an airport link in pittsburgh or a 49.8 kilometer track through the nevada desert linking las vegas with casinos on the californian border , which could be extended to los angeles . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german transrapid runs on schedule in shanghai three decades after germans began working on a magnetic railway and three years after china ordered the system as shanghai ’ s airport connection , trains began regular operations monday .

that would correspond to a price of 22 euros per hvb share or just over 16 billion euros -lrb- $ 19.7 billion -rrb- in all . no deal this week ? the source was nevertheless skeptical that a final deal would be announced this week , since a number of details still had to be settled . those details include the fate of hvb 's highly profitable austrian unit , bank austria creditanstalt . bildunterschrift : soon together ? the business daily handelsblatt reported on monday that unicredito may have to launch a public takeover offer to buy out the minority shareholders in the unit , which would add another two billion euros to the overall takeover price . financial times deutschland said that hvb would remain autonomous , constituting a separate division within the unicredito group .
the two banks had announced last week that they were in tie-up talks . german government not opposed if a deal does come about , it would be the biggest cross-border banking merger in europe , creating the fourth-biggest bank in the euro area and the ninth biggest in europe as a whole . the german government signaled it had no objections to a possible tie-up between hvb and unicredito . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister hans eichel does n't seem too worried about the potential merger such a transaction would not " be a bad thing " in that it would contribute to the consolidation of the european banking sector , said finance ministry spokesman stefan giffeler . but giffeler refused to comment further , insisting that the talks were a matter for the banks alone . on the frankfurt stock exchange , hvb shares were little changed in mid-afternoon trading , changing hands at 19.78 euros , down 0.01 euros or 0.05 percent on the day . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de unicredito-hypovereinsbank merger seen germany 's hypovereinsbank and italy 's unicredito are nearing agreement on a possible merger which is expected to be finalized sometime in june , according to reports .

following a crushing defeat in a regional vote in may , schröder called for new polls to be held in september .
to do this , he has scheduled a vote of confidence on july 1 .
if the party would follow the leader , they would vote against him and the elections could take place .
but the chancellor has a problem : inner-party adversaries from the left are planning to vote for him in an attempt to thwart the early elections .
this was something that schröder did n't plan on .
rumors about a possible resignation before july 1 then spread to which he called " the wildest speculation . " but the already weak position of schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- in parliament could work to his advantage .
with a slim three-seat majority , the chancellor need only ask his own cabinet members to vote against him or abstain .
interior minister otto schily said he would do his part . " if i ’ m not going to take part in the confidence vote , i can neither vote yes or no , " he said .
" this is a viable option in line with the german constitution although i want to stress that it ‘ s all theoretical .
there is no need for the chancellor to resign .
gerhard schröder is still chancellor and he is planning to remain that beyond the elections . " greens feel patronized the secrecy regarding the upcoming vote has not only caused great irritation within the spd .
the junior coalition partner green party is fuming and feels kept in the dark .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greens parliamentary leader katrin göring-eckardt does n't think current government chaos is attributable to them two weeks ago schröder largely bypassed them when he decided for early elections .
now some members are rethinking whether the center-left coalition , if it were somehow victorious in september , should be continued .
back to the basics is the call of some . " we should sharpen our image as an ecological party , " said albert schmidt , a green member of parliament , " because an election campaign waged on center-left coalition nostalgia does n't make sense anymore .
it would be foolish to believe that our alliance will regain power .

" opposition has its own headaches bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cdu chancellor candidate angela merkel enjoys comfortable margin a grand coalition ?
it would be hard to believe that the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- would have to resort to that .
opposition leader angela merkel -lrb- photo -rrb- currently enjoys a nearly 17-percent lead in opinion polls and stands a good chance of becoming the first female chancellor of germany . but she too has troubles with her potential junior coalition partner , the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
the two parties are at loggerheads over ways to finance major tax cuts promised to german voters .
merkel wouldn ’ t rule out an increase in the value-added tax to finance a major overhaul of the tax and social security systems . " our weak economy would be hurt by higher taxes , " she said .
" on the other hand we must be honest and tell voters that much depends on the state of public finances in germany and the need to reform our social systems .
i won ’ t rule out anything at this moment . " her remarks have angered the free democrats who are pushing for radical tax cuts and plans to curb trade union powers .
but some pollsters say the cdu might even win an absolute majority in the elections , which has strengthened merkel 's hand with her liberal allies . but before any of this happens , gerhard schröder must lose his vote of confidence on july 1 and under the current circumstances , that is anything but a sure thing . uwe hessler -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel chosen as chancellor candidate angela merkel , the leader of germany 's opposition christian democrats , has officially been chosen as the conservative challenger to chancellor gerhard schröder in early elections in the fall .

following a crushing defeat in a regional vote in may , schröder called for new polls to be held in september .
to do this , he has scheduled a vote of confidence on july 1 .
if the party would follow the leader , they would vote against him and the elections could take place .
but the chancellor has a problem : inner-party adversaries from the left are planning to vote for him in an attempt to thwart the early elections .
this was something that schröder did n't plan on .
rumors about a possible resignation before july 1 then spread to which he called " the wildest speculation . " but the already weak position of schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- in parliament could work to his advantage .
with a slim three-seat majority , the chancellor need only ask his own cabinet members to vote against him or abstain .
interior minister otto schily said he would do his part . " if i ’ m not going to take part in the confidence vote , i can neither vote yes or no , " he said .
" this is a viable option in line with the german constitution although i want to stress that it ‘ s all theoretical .
there is no need for the chancellor to resign .
gerhard schröder is still chancellor and he is planning to remain that beyond the elections . " greens feel patronized the secrecy regarding the upcoming vote has not only caused great irritation within the spd .
the junior coalition partner green party is fuming and feels kept in the dark .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greens parliamentary leader katrin göring-eckardt does n't think current government chaos is attributable to them two weeks ago schröder largely bypassed them when he decided for early elections .
now some members are rethinking whether the center-left coalition , if it were somehow victorious in september , should be continued .
back to the basics is the call of some . " we should sharpen our image as an ecological party , " said albert schmidt , a green member of parliament , " because an election campaign waged on center-left coalition nostalgia does n't make sense anymore .
it would be foolish to believe that our alliance will regain power .
we are headed for opposition and the social democrats clearly aim for a grand coalition with the conservatives . " opposition has its own headaches bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cdu chancellor candidate angela merkel enjoys comfortable margin a grand coalition ?
it would be hard to believe that the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- would have to resort to that .
opposition leader angela merkel -lrb- photo -rrb- currently enjoys a nearly 17-percent lead in opinion polls and stands a good chance of becoming the first female chancellor of germany . but she too has troubles with her potential junior coalition partner , the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
the two parties are at loggerheads over ways to finance major tax cuts promised to german voters .
merkel wouldn ’ t rule out an increase in the value-added tax to finance a major overhaul of the tax and social security systems . " our weak economy would be hurt by higher taxes , " she said .
" on the other hand we must be honest and tell voters that much depends on the state of public finances in germany and the need to reform our social systems .
i won ’ t rule out anything at this moment . " her remarks have angered the free democrats who are pushing for radical tax cuts and plans to curb trade union powers .
but some pollsters say the cdu might even win an absolute majority in the elections , which has strengthened merkel 's hand with her liberal allies . but before any of this happens , gerhard schröder must lose his vote of confidence on july 1 and under the current circumstances , that is anything but a sure thing . uwe hessler -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel chosen as chancellor candidate angela merkel , the leader of germany 's opposition christian democrats , has officially been chosen as the conservative challenger to chancellor gerhard schröder in early elections in the fall .

straw is to give his decision before parliament in the afternoon , choosing his words carefully to avoid making britain appear as the one to kill the treaty . british newspapers said straw would again insist on the need to respect the results of such plebiscites and announce a temporary freeze of the bill which would have allowed the referendum to proceed in britain in early 2006 .
such a move would allow time to determine the future of the constitutional treaty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a view over the river thames from the houses of parliament in westminster palace in london on thursday , london asked paris and the hague to spell out what their vision of its future was . " a period of reflection " " we believe that it is necessary to have a period of reflection in the lead up to discussions at the council of ministers meeting , " said a spokeswoman from blair 's offices at 10 downing street , referring to a meeting of leaders from the european union in brussels on june 16-17 . asked whether the saturday talks between chirac and schröder had affected britain 's standpoint on how to proceed with the constitution , the spokeswoman said : " there is nothing further to add .

every eu member country has " the right and the duty " to take its own decision on the constitution , said a german government spokesman after the two statesmen met over dinner to plot a way out of the crisis . germany has ratified the proposed text , although no referendum was used , and so have nine others of the 25 member states , but the damage caused by the " no " votes in france and the netherlands is severe . it is likely to be further compounded by straw 's speech before parliament . on the home front , freezing the referendum would spare blair a crushing defeat .

" however , whitman , who heads the european program at the royal institute of international affairs in london , predicted the british decision " will likely trigger a small avalanche of other countries that will suspend " ratification . already denmark and portugal have suggested they would suspend ratification , said aurore wanlin , a researcher at the london-based centre for european reform . ireland no longer seems so sure about its own plans for a referendum .
" i ca n't say .

straw is to give his decision before parliament in the afternoon , choosing his words carefully to avoid making britain appear as the one to kill the treaty . british newspapers said straw would again insist on the need to respect the results of such plebiscites and announce a temporary freeze of the bill which would have allowed the referendum to proceed in britain in early 2006 .
such a move would allow time to determine the future of the constitutional treaty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a view over the river thames from the houses of parliament in westminster palace in london on thursday , london asked paris and the hague to spell out what their vision of its future was . " a period of reflection " " we believe that it is necessary to have a period of reflection in the lead up to discussions at the council of ministers meeting , " said a spokeswoman from blair 's offices at 10 downing street , referring to a meeting of leaders from the european union in brussels on june 16-17 . asked whether the saturday talks between chirac and schröder had affected britain 's standpoint on how to proceed with the constitution , the spokeswoman said : " there is nothing further to add .

every eu member country has " the right and the duty " to take its own decision on the constitution , said a german government spokesman after the two statesmen met over dinner to plot a way out of the crisis . germany has ratified the proposed text , although no referendum was used , and so have nine others of the 25 member states , but the damage caused by the " no " votes in france and the netherlands is severe . it is likely to be further compounded by straw 's speech before parliament . on the home front , freezing the referendum would spare blair a crushing defeat .
a poll published friday by the sun showed 72 percent of britons would reject the draft in a referendum , up from 57 previously . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair such a verdict would probably cause blair to step down as prime minister next year amid mounting political problems since his unpopular decision to join the 2003 us-led invasion of iraq . london 's decision could cause problems but , ten days before the european council meets in brussels , and less than a month before britain assumes the rotating european union presidency on july 1 , london 's expected decision is likely to bother some of its eu partners . most of them have called for forging ahead with the ratification process , echoing the remarks of european commission president jose manuel durao barroso , who is hostile to any " unilateral decision " by a member state . european affairs analyst richard whitman said it was " not a smart idea when you are about to take the job of presidency to go into that having upset a number of key interlocutors . " however , whitman , who heads the european program at the royal institute of international affairs in london , predicted the british decision " will likely trigger a small avalanche of other countries that will suspend " ratification . already denmark and portugal have suggested they would suspend ratification , said aurore wanlin , a researcher at the london-based centre for european reform . ireland no longer seems so sure about its own plans for a referendum .

but , the idea of tuition fees and even study loans remains anathema to many students . in some countries , saving for a child 's education is commonplace .
in the us , where the average cost for a year of studying and living at a private college is currently $ 22,000 -lrb- 17,921 euros -rrb- , many parents start socking away money in a college fund even before they 've sent out birth announcements .
until recently , germans did n't have this concern .
the notion that everyone has a right to a cost-free university education has long been a given in modern german society .
but the concept was dealt a blow in january , when the german federal constitutional court decided to overturn a ban on tuition .
each state can now decide whether its universities will charge for their services , and how much .
painful adjustment the result is a political dust storm that has yet to settle .
conservatives tend to support the implementation of tuition fees , claiming the underfunded universities need all the financial help they can get .
liberals oppose it as being anti-egalitarian .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of third-semester medical students attend class in leipzig .
so far , it looks as if nine of the 16 german states - including north rhine westphalia , now that conservatives won power there in recent elections - will begin charging course fees for an initial round of university study .
the fees will not surpass 500 euros per semester .
already , 12 states impose fees of anywhere from 300 euros to 900 euros per semester for people who take too long to complete their degree , or for career changers who want to take on a second course of study .
while other european countries -lrb- england , for example -rrb- have already gone through the painful adjustment from free to fee education , most germans - who prize their free education system - find the idea of paying tuition for a first round of study outrageous .
last week , some 10,000 students in five cities took to the streets in protest .
new financial instruments but the prospect of tuition fees has grabbed the attention of some farsighted financial institutions , who have begun packaging loans aimed at students .
the kfw , germany 's state-owned development bank , caused a minor sensation in february when it announced a five percent interest loan available to university students , regardless of their subjects of study or their parents ' financial situation .
bildunterschrift : university seminar deutsche bank - unlike the kfw , a private credit institution whose instruments have to make good in the open marketplace - countered with its own student loan , similar to that of kfw but at a slightly higher rate of interest .

growing business " the business of financing student loans will become more important in the coming years , so it is important to get into the market early , " lars hinrichsen , financial adviser at mummert consulting told the handelsblatt newspaper .

" along with studying , a lot of people have to work to make ends meet , which means it takes them longer to complete a degree , " hüpfner said .
some 63 percent of german students have part time jobs during their studies , according to the internet site studis-online .

" people are afraid to take on debt .
but they have to ask themselves : do i want to invest in my own future ?
or should i just take longer to get through my studies , and come on the job market later ? "
judith graff , a fourth year student at the university of cologne , sees the loan issue from a practical standpoint .
sure , her studies have been prolonged by the fact that she has to work 20 hours a week to make ends meet - and that 's without having had to pay any tuition fees .
but she would rather not finish school in debt .
" everyone knows right now there are no jobs in germany .
how would you pay the loan back ? "
graff asked .
" if people come out of school with debt then they would hesitate to start a family ... it 's a bad cycle . "

a recent ranking of the world 's top universities in the times higher education supplement revealed that only one german institution , the university of heidelberg , was placed in the top 50 .
but opponents say even relatively low tuition fees of 500 euros per semester can make the difference between a given student 's success and failure .
" some people say 500 euros a semester is n't much .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus on education private universities take hold in germany jewish , muslim groups blast minister 's children 's initiative study : universities in eastern germany are top-notch concerns about scientology youth tutoring centers in germany current affairs -pipe- 06.06.2005 tuition fees face uphill battle in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " prevent tuition fees " reads the banner with conservatives gaining ground in german politics , the idea of free university education appears to be a thing of the past .
but , the idea of tuition fees and even study loans remains anathema to many students . in some countries , saving for a child 's education is commonplace .
in the us , where the average cost for a year of studying and living at a private college is currently $ 22,000 -lrb- 17,921 euros -rrb- , many parents start socking away money in a college fund even before they 've sent out birth announcements .
until recently , germans did n't have this concern .
the notion that everyone has a right to a cost-free university education has long been a given in modern german society .
but the concept was dealt a blow in january , when the german federal constitutional court decided to overturn a ban on tuition .
each state can now decide whether its universities will charge for their services , and how much .
painful adjustment the result is a political dust storm that has yet to settle .
conservatives tend to support the implementation of tuition fees , claiming the underfunded universities need all the financial help they can get .
liberals oppose it as being anti-egalitarian .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of third-semester medical students attend class in leipzig .
so far , it looks as if nine of the 16 german states - including north rhine westphalia , now that conservatives won power there in recent elections - will begin charging course fees for an initial round of university study .
the fees will not surpass 500 euros per semester .
already , 12 states impose fees of anywhere from 300 euros to 900 euros per semester for people who take too long to complete their degree , or for career changers who want to take on a second course of study .
while other european countries -lrb- england , for example -rrb- have already gone through the painful adjustment from free to fee education , most germans - who prize their free education system - find the idea of paying tuition for a first round of study outrageous .
last week , some 10,000 students in five cities took to the streets in protest .
new financial instruments but the prospect of tuition fees has grabbed the attention of some farsighted financial institutions , who have begun packaging loans aimed at students .
the kfw , germany 's state-owned development bank , caused a minor sensation in february when it announced a five percent interest loan available to university students , regardless of their subjects of study or their parents ' financial situation .
bildunterschrift : university seminar deutsche bank - unlike the kfw , a private credit institution whose instruments have to make good in the open marketplace - countered with its own student loan , similar to that of kfw but at a slightly higher rate of interest .
once the clamor and political wrangling surrounding tuition costs have subsided , even more credit institutions are expected to compete for the student market , experts say .
growing business " the business of financing student loans will become more important in the coming years , so it is important to get into the market early , " lars hinrichsen , financial adviser at mummert consulting told the handelsblatt newspaper .
sonja hüpfner , spokeswoman for the kfw , explained that the aim of their loan is mostly to help students complete their studies speedily and make them more competitive .
" along with studying , a lot of people have to work to make ends meet , which means it takes them longer to complete a degree , " hüpfner said .
some 63 percent of german students have part time jobs during their studies , according to the internet site studis-online .
long-term students german students take an average of six years to complete a university degree , hüpfner said - the longest of any european country .
" they go on the job market much later , which does n't help them in terms of competitiveness " she pointed out .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstration in essen against tution fees .
sign reads free education -lrb- still -rrb- for everyone according to hüpfner , german expectations of free education is a case of misguided values , tied to an overall cultural distrust of debt .
" people are afraid to take on debt .
but they have to ask themselves : do i want to invest in my own future ?
or should i just take longer to get through my studies , and come on the job market later ? "
judith graff , a fourth year student at the university of cologne , sees the loan issue from a practical standpoint .
sure , her studies have been prolonged by the fact that she has to work 20 hours a week to make ends meet - and that 's without having had to pay any tuition fees .
but she would rather not finish school in debt .
" everyone knows right now there are no jobs in germany .
how would you pay the loan back ? "
graff asked .
" if people come out of school with debt then they would hesitate to start a family ... it 's a bad cycle . "
falling reputation people who argue in favor of tuition say the money is needed to boost academic standards at german universities , whose reputations have suffered over the last few decades .
a recent ranking of the world 's top universities in the times higher education supplement revealed that only one german institution , the university of heidelberg , was placed in the top 50 .
but opponents say even relatively low tuition fees of 500 euros per semester can make the difference between a given student 's success and failure .
" some people say 500 euros a semester is n't much .
but that 's 83 euros a month , " achim meyer auf der heyde , general secretary of the union of german students told the suddeutsche zeitung .
" and 27 percent of students live off of 600 euros a month .
for that person , 83 euros is a lot . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jörg dräger but jörg dräger -lrb- photo -rrb- , hamburg 's senator for science and research , who helped kfw create its student loan , rejects the notion that tuition fees will widen the gap between germany 's haves and have-nots .
instead , he said , giving a college education a monetary value makes it that much more worthwhile .
fees - a great equalizer ?
" tuition fees do n't only improve the financial framework of universities .
they are above all an instrument with which one can more fairly distribute the chances of receiving a university education , " dräger told the hamburg media institute in an interview .
" in the usa , great britain and japan , many more children from -lrb- poorer -rrb- backgrounds study , despite tuition fees .
there , there is stronger awareness that education is also financially worthwhile , " he said .

instead , they might be asked to prove their christian convictions . on monday , german tabloid bild ran a fake christianity questionnaire visa applicants in albania will allegedly have to fill out before being allowed to enter germany . " when and how did jesus die ? " read one question .
" what are the names of the sons of adam and eve ? " was another , and finally : " how long did jesus remain on earth after his resurrection before ascending to heaven ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the regular visa application does not include questions about christianity a foreign ministry spokeswoman told dw-world that the german embassy in albania 's capital tirana had merely suggested such a procedure and added that there were no plans to ask visa applicants to fill out such questionnaires .
besides , now that the questions -lrb- and bild 's answers -rrb- were out in the open , it would n't make sense to still ask them , she said . what could happen , however , is that applicants might be asked a question or two during their interviews at the embassy to test their christian knowledge , the spokeswoman said .
local churches might also be asked to screen applicants and write letters of recommendation before sending them to the embassy , she added .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus on education private universities take hold in germany jewish , muslim groups blast minister 's children 's initiative study : universities in eastern germany are top-notch concerns about scientology youth tutoring centers in germany current affairs -pipe- 06.06.2005 tuition fees face uphill battle in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " prevent tuition fees " reads the banner with conservatives gaining ground in german politics , the idea of free university education appears to be a thing of the past .
but , the idea of tuition fees and even study loans remains anathema to many students . in some countries , saving for a child 's education is commonplace .
in the us , where the average cost for a year of studying and living at a private college is currently $ 22,000 -lrb- 17,921 euros -rrb- , many parents start socking away money in a college fund even before they 've sent out birth announcements .
until recently , germans did n't have this concern .
the notion that everyone has a right to a cost-free university education has long been a given in modern german society .
but the concept was dealt a blow in january , when the german federal constitutional court decided to overturn a ban on tuition .
each state can now decide whether its universities will charge for their services , and how much .
painful adjustment the result is a political dust storm that has yet to settle .
conservatives tend to support the implementation of tuition fees , claiming the underfunded universities need all the financial help they can get .
liberals oppose it as being anti-egalitarian .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of third-semester medical students attend class in leipzig .
so far , it looks as if nine of the 16 german states - including north rhine westphalia , now that conservatives won power there in recent elections - will begin charging course fees for an initial round of university study .
the fees will not surpass 500 euros per semester .
already , 12 states impose fees of anywhere from 300 euros to 900 euros per semester for people who take too long to complete their degree , or for career changers who want to take on a second course of study .
while other european countries -lrb- england , for example -rrb- have already gone through the painful adjustment from free to fee education , most germans - who prize their free education system - find the idea of paying tuition for a first round of study outrageous .
last week , some 10,000 students in five cities took to the streets in protest .
new financial instruments but the prospect of tuition fees has grabbed the attention of some farsighted financial institutions , who have begun packaging loans aimed at students .
the kfw , germany 's state-owned development bank , caused a minor sensation in february when it announced a five percent interest loan available to university students , regardless of their subjects of study or their parents ' financial situation .
bildunterschrift : university seminar deutsche bank - unlike the kfw , a private credit institution whose instruments have to make good in the open marketplace - countered with its own student loan , similar to that of kfw but at a slightly higher rate of interest .
once the clamor and political wrangling surrounding tuition costs have subsided , even more credit institutions are expected to compete for the student market , experts say .
growing business " the business of financing student loans will become more important in the coming years , so it is important to get into the market early , " lars hinrichsen , financial adviser at mummert consulting told the handelsblatt newspaper .
sonja hüpfner , spokeswoman for the kfw , explained that the aim of their loan is mostly to help students complete their studies speedily and make them more competitive .
" along with studying , a lot of people have to work to make ends meet , which means it takes them longer to complete a degree , " hüpfner said .
some 63 percent of german students have part time jobs during their studies , according to the internet site studis-online .
long-term students german students take an average of six years to complete a university degree , hüpfner said - the longest of any european country .
" they go on the job market much later , which does n't help them in terms of competitiveness " she pointed out .

following a crushing defeat in a regional vote in may , schröder called for new polls to be held in september .
to do this , he has scheduled a vote of confidence on july 1 .
if the party would follow the leader , they would vote against him and the elections could take place .
but the chancellor has a problem : inner-party adversaries from the left are planning to vote for him in an attempt to thwart the early elections .
this was something that schröder did n't plan on .
rumors about a possible resignation before july 1 then spread to which he called " the wildest speculation . " but the already weak position of schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- in parliament could work to his advantage .
with a slim three-seat majority , the chancellor need only ask his own cabinet members to vote against him or abstain .
interior minister otto schily said he would do his part . " if i ’ m not going to take part in the confidence vote , i can neither vote yes or no , " he said .
" this is a viable option in line with the german constitution although i want to stress that it ‘ s all theoretical .
there is no need for the chancellor to resign .

now some members are rethinking whether the center-left coalition , if it were somehow victorious in september , should be continued .
back to the basics is the call of some . " we should sharpen our image as an ecological party , " said albert schmidt , a green member of parliament , " because an election campaign waged on center-left coalition nostalgia does n't make sense anymore .
it would be foolish to believe that our alliance will regain power .

" opposition has its own headaches bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cdu chancellor candidate angela merkel enjoys comfortable margin a grand coalition ?
it would be hard to believe that the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- would have to resort to that .
opposition leader angela merkel -lrb- photo -rrb- currently enjoys a nearly 17-percent lead in opinion polls and stands a good chance of becoming the first female chancellor of germany . but she too has troubles with her potential junior coalition partner , the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
the two parties are at loggerheads over ways to finance major tax cuts promised to german voters .
merkel wouldn ’ t rule out an increase in the value-added tax to finance a major overhaul of the tax and social security systems . " our weak economy would be hurt by higher taxes , " she said .
" on the other hand we must be honest and tell voters that much depends on the state of public finances in germany and the need to reform our social systems .
i won ’ t rule out anything at this moment . " her remarks have angered the free democrats who are pushing for radical tax cuts and plans to curb trade union powers .
but some pollsters say the cdu might even win an absolute majority in the elections , which has strengthened merkel 's hand with her liberal allies . but before any of this happens , gerhard schröder must lose his vote of confidence on july 1 and under the current circumstances , that is anything but a sure thing . uwe hessler -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel chosen as chancellor candidate angela merkel , the leader of germany 's opposition christian democrats , has officially been chosen as the conservative challenger to chancellor gerhard schröder in early elections in the fall .
-lrb- may 31 , 2005 -rrb- schröder 's election strategy hits a snag chancellor gerhard schroeder is basing new elections on losing a planned vote of " no confidence " on july 1 .
but losing that and then going on to be left 's top candidate is proving a dilemma .
-lrb- may 28 , 2005 -rrb- early elections : strategy or slow suicide ?
the chancellor 's call to germans to seal his fate is one of his greatest political gambles yet .
public opinion is behind early elections , but does gerhard schröder really stand any chance of being re-elected ?

following a crushing defeat in a regional vote in may , schröder called for new polls to be held in september .
to do this , he has scheduled a vote of confidence on july 1 .
if the party would follow the leader , they would vote against him and the elections could take place .
but the chancellor has a problem : inner-party adversaries from the left are planning to vote for him in an attempt to thwart the early elections .
this was something that schröder did n't plan on .
rumors about a possible resignation before july 1 then spread to which he called " the wildest speculation . " but the already weak position of schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- in parliament could work to his advantage .
with a slim three-seat majority , the chancellor need only ask his own cabinet members to vote against him or abstain .
interior minister otto schily said he would do his part . " if i ’ m not going to take part in the confidence vote , i can neither vote yes or no , " he said .
" this is a viable option in line with the german constitution although i want to stress that it ‘ s all theoretical .
there is no need for the chancellor to resign .
gerhard schröder is still chancellor and he is planning to remain that beyond the elections . " greens feel patronized the secrecy regarding the upcoming vote has not only caused great irritation within the spd .
the junior coalition partner green party is fuming and feels kept in the dark .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greens parliamentary leader katrin göring-eckardt does n't think current government chaos is attributable to them two weeks ago schröder largely bypassed them when he decided for early elections .
now some members are rethinking whether the center-left coalition , if it were somehow victorious in september , should be continued .
back to the basics is the call of some . " we should sharpen our image as an ecological party , " said albert schmidt , a green member of parliament , " because an election campaign waged on center-left coalition nostalgia does n't make sense anymore .

following a crushing defeat in a regional vote in may , schröder called for new polls to be held in september .
to do this , he has scheduled a vote of confidence on july 1 .
if the party would follow the leader , they would vote against him and the elections could take place .
but the chancellor has a problem : inner-party adversaries from the left are planning to vote for him in an attempt to thwart the early elections .
this was something that schröder did n't plan on .
rumors about a possible resignation before july 1 then spread to which he called " the wildest speculation . " but the already weak position of schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- in parliament could work to his advantage .
with a slim three-seat majority , the chancellor need only ask his own cabinet members to vote against him or abstain .
interior minister otto schily said he would do his part . " if i ’ m not going to take part in the confidence vote , i can neither vote yes or no , " he said .
" this is a viable option in line with the german constitution although i want to stress that it ‘ s all theoretical .
there is no need for the chancellor to resign .
gerhard schröder is still chancellor and he is planning to remain that beyond the elections . " greens feel patronized the secrecy regarding the upcoming vote has not only caused great irritation within the spd .
the junior coalition partner green party is fuming and feels kept in the dark .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greens parliamentary leader katrin göring-eckardt does n't think current government chaos is attributable to them two weeks ago schröder largely bypassed them when he decided for early elections .
now some members are rethinking whether the center-left coalition , if it were somehow victorious in september , should be continued .
back to the basics is the call of some . " we should sharpen our image as an ecological party , " said albert schmidt , a green member of parliament , " because an election campaign waged on center-left coalition nostalgia does n't make sense anymore .
it would be foolish to believe that our alliance will regain power .

the two parties are at loggerheads over ways to finance major tax cuts promised to german voters .
merkel wouldn ’ t rule out an increase in the value-added tax to finance a major overhaul of the tax and social security systems . " our weak economy would be hurt by higher taxes , " she said .
" on the other hand we must be honest and tell voters that much depends on the state of public finances in germany and the need to reform our social systems .
i won ’ t rule out anything at this moment . " her remarks have angered the free democrats who are pushing for radical tax cuts and plans to curb trade union powers .
but some pollsters say the cdu might even win an absolute majority in the elections , which has strengthened merkel 's hand with her liberal allies . but before any of this happens , gerhard schröder must lose his vote of confidence on july 1 and under the current circumstances , that is anything but a sure thing . uwe hessler -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel chosen as chancellor candidate angela merkel , the leader of germany 's opposition christian democrats , has officially been chosen as the conservative challenger to chancellor gerhard schröder in early elections in the fall .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : world youth day 2005 prayer , and environmental protection tight security for pope 's youth gathering germany prepares for world youth day offering pilgrims a helping held current affairs -pipe- 06.06.2005 german visas for the faithful großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if you want to come to germany , please identify the depicted scene about 800,000 young catholics are expected to attend world youth day in cologne in august .
many require a visa to enter germany : foreign ministry officials have thought of a somewhat unusual way to prevent abuse . germany wants to be seen as a country that welcomes the world .
a year from now , millions of people are expected to attend the soccer world cup .
" the world as germany 's guest " is the slogan that 's been picked to promote that event . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benedict xvi will face the masses in cologne just like he did during his inauguration in rome in april the world youth day might not receive quite as much global attention , but with german-born pope benedict xvi expected to attend , it 's still a major affair . as a result , youth day visitors from countries that still need visas to enter germany will not have to pay the normal fees , according to foreign ministry officials .
instead , they might be asked to prove their christian convictions . on monday , german tabloid bild ran a fake christianity questionnaire visa applicants in albania will allegedly have to fill out before being allowed to enter germany . " when and how did jesus die ? " read one question .
" what are the names of the sons of adam and eve ? " was another , and finally : " how long did jesus remain on earth after his resurrection before ascending to heaven ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the regular visa application does not include questions about christianity a foreign ministry spokeswoman told dw-world that the german embassy in albania 's capital tirana had merely suggested such a procedure and added that there were no plans to ask visa applicants to fill out such questionnaires .

the journey takes eight minutes by maglev where it would take a car up to an hour . britain 's finance minister , chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown traveled on the shanghai maglev in february and was reportedly very impressed .
transrapid 's british team has since briefed tony blair . britain looks for environmental alternative bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the maglev is more than twice as fast as britain 's fastest domestic train and 128.7mph faster than france 's tgv or japan 's bullet trains .
the british government is looking for an alternative to the increasing numbers of cheap domestic flights that make traveling the length of breadth of the island easier and faster but also noisier and less environmentally sound . the maglev is controlled by a magnetic charge which holds it 1 centimeter -lrb- less than half an inch -rrb- above a metal track and its effect on the environment is negligible .
transrapid uk have told blair that the project would pay huge environmental dividends as it would make domestic air travel virtually obsolete , with a trip from london to newcastle taking just one hour and 40 minutes . transrapid international , the german-based parent company , spent nearly two years working on a " pre-feasibility " plan for britain before presenting it to downing street .
jochen kruse , transrapid 's project manager in shanghai , said : " we 've had discussions with no. 10 - now we 'll be going to the department for transport . " kruse added that a green light from downing street would enable transrapid to come up with a detailed scheme in 18 months .
but construction could take many years . " how long does it typically take to build such things in england ? " he asked .
" if you could import a thousand chinese workers , it could be built in a year . " age-old problems could be a thing of the past as well as environmental and time efficiency aspects , the maglev network would improve the british transport system which has been deteriorating through aging train lines , badly run privatization schemes and congested roads .
it could also put an end to the perennial problems the inclement british weather has on train travel . " leaves on the line ?
i really do n't think that will be a problem , " kruse said . however , despite the obvious benefits , the british will be aware of the problems that the shanghai system has encountered since it went operational 18 months ago at a cost of 1.7 billion euros . expensive and prone to technical problems ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an estimated 2 million people have used the system so far but there are criticisms that the expensive upkeep of the technology is pricing the maglev out of the range of ordinary chinese . " it cost an awful lot of money to put in and it 's expensive to maintain , " one businessman told the british daily the guardian .
" most of the local chinese people ca n't afford to ride on it . " the shanghai line has had technical problems from the beginning .
one of the two tracks has been shut for long periods while engineers adjust malfunctioning cables which carry the electrical charge which sparks the train 's magnetism .
then there 's the problem of the entire system is sinking into the pudong , shanghai 's marshy outpost which separates the city from the airport . however , the problems have not stopped the chinese government from considering transrapid 's plans for a 3.8 billion euro extension to train line as a forerunner to building the line from london to scotland . expansion in china , options worldwide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pudong international airport , shanghai the germans plan to extend shanghai 's line to hangzhou , a provincial capital 201 kilometers away .

while germany plans a maglev system for an airport link in munich , the united states government is due to choose imminently between three maglev schemes : a baltimore to washington railway , an airport link in pittsburgh or a 49.8 kilometer track through the nevada desert linking las vegas with casinos on the californian border , which could be extended to los angeles . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german transrapid runs on schedule in shanghai three decades after germans began working on a magnetic railway and three years after china ordered the system as shanghai ’ s airport connection , trains began regular operations monday .

the journey takes eight minutes by maglev where it would take a car up to an hour . britain 's finance minister , chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown traveled on the shanghai maglev in february and was reportedly very impressed .
transrapid 's british team has since briefed tony blair . britain looks for environmental alternative bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the maglev is more than twice as fast as britain 's fastest domestic train and 128.7mph faster than france 's tgv or japan 's bullet trains .
the british government is looking for an alternative to the increasing numbers of cheap domestic flights that make traveling the length of breadth of the island easier and faster but also noisier and less environmentally sound . the maglev is controlled by a magnetic charge which holds it 1 centimeter -lrb- less than half an inch -rrb- above a metal track and its effect on the environment is negligible .
transrapid uk have told blair that the project would pay huge environmental dividends as it would make domestic air travel virtually obsolete , with a trip from london to newcastle taking just one hour and 40 minutes . transrapid international , the german-based parent company , spent nearly two years working on a " pre-feasibility " plan for britain before presenting it to downing street .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 06.06.2005 britain considers german magnet rail großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the transrapid could revolutionize travel from north to south in the uk britain could become the next country to adopt the german-designed transrapid maglev -lrb- magnetic levitation -rrb- train , according to reports in the british press on monday . the british government is said to be considering the german-designed maglev magnetic levitation rail technology for a line that would run along the country 's economic " spinal cord " from london to glasgow through birmingham , manchester , leeds , newcastle and edinburgh at a cost of at least 23.7 billion euros -lrb- $ 28.9 billion -rrb- not including appropriation of land . the maglev , created by transrapid , a joint venture between siemens and thyssenkrupp , is already in operation in china where the 434.5 kph -lrb- 270 mph -rrb- trains hurtle along a 30.5 kilometer -lrb- 19-mile -rrb- magnetic floating railway from the city of shanghai , through surrounding paddy fields to its destination at shanghai airport .
the journey takes eight minutes by maglev where it would take a car up to an hour . britain 's finance minister , chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown traveled on the shanghai maglev in february and was reportedly very impressed .
transrapid 's british team has since briefed tony blair . britain looks for environmental alternative bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the maglev is more than twice as fast as britain 's fastest domestic train and 128.7mph faster than france 's tgv or japan 's bullet trains .
the british government is looking for an alternative to the increasing numbers of cheap domestic flights that make traveling the length of breadth of the island easier and faster but also noisier and less environmentally sound . the maglev is controlled by a magnetic charge which holds it 1 centimeter -lrb- less than half an inch -rrb- above a metal track and its effect on the environment is negligible .
transrapid uk have told blair that the project would pay huge environmental dividends as it would make domestic air travel virtually obsolete , with a trip from london to newcastle taking just one hour and 40 minutes . transrapid international , the german-based parent company , spent nearly two years working on a " pre-feasibility " plan for britain before presenting it to downing street .
jochen kruse , transrapid 's project manager in shanghai , said : " we 've had discussions with no. 10 - now we 'll be going to the department for transport . " kruse added that a green light from downing street would enable transrapid to come up with a detailed scheme in 18 months .
but construction could take many years . " how long does it typically take to build such things in england ? " he asked .
" if you could import a thousand chinese workers , it could be built in a year . " age-old problems could be a thing of the past as well as environmental and time efficiency aspects , the maglev network would improve the british transport system which has been deteriorating through aging train lines , badly run privatization schemes and congested roads .
it could also put an end to the perennial problems the inclement british weather has on train travel . " leaves on the line ?
i really do n't think that will be a problem , " kruse said . however , despite the obvious benefits , the british will be aware of the problems that the shanghai system has encountered since it went operational 18 months ago at a cost of 1.7 billion euros . expensive and prone to technical problems ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an estimated 2 million people have used the system so far but there are criticisms that the expensive upkeep of the technology is pricing the maglev out of the range of ordinary chinese . " it cost an awful lot of money to put in and it 's expensive to maintain , " one businessman told the british daily the guardian .
" most of the local chinese people ca n't afford to ride on it . " the shanghai line has had technical problems from the beginning .
one of the two tracks has been shut for long periods while engineers adjust malfunctioning cables which carry the electrical charge which sparks the train 's magnetism .
then there 's the problem of the entire system is sinking into the pudong , shanghai 's marshy outpost which separates the city from the airport . however , the problems have not stopped the chinese government from considering transrapid 's plans for a 3.8 billion euro extension to train line as a forerunner to building the line from london to scotland . expansion in china , options worldwide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pudong international airport , shanghai the germans plan to extend shanghai 's line to hangzhou , a provincial capital 201 kilometers away .

he found that the daily soaps " marienhof " and " in aller freundschaft " have for years been systematically violating a section of the public broadcasting code that forbids the inclusion of unmarked advertising .

the criticisms prompted zdf 's broadcasting advisory board to create a " 10 point plan " toward combating the " creeping self-commercialization " of the broadcaster .
since then , observers have noticed a reduction in such borderline product placement .
defining ' meaningful ' " advertising disguised as content is forbidden , although product placement is allowed , " said peter widlok of the communications commission for the state of north rhine-westphalia .
" when the inclusion of a product is necessary or meaningful in terms of dramatic or content , there is absolutely no reason that a police commissioner on television ca n't drive a bmw . "
the problem is defining what is meaningful use of a product and what is simply gratuitous advertising .
" its not always possible to be certain whether something is deliberately or just incidentally in the picture , " widlok said .
uncertainty in random test recently , state communications commissioners criticized an increase in product placement .
" in a random sample in february , questionable instances were found in ten cases , " widlok said .
" we encouraged the responsible state communications commissions to take action . "
in this case , action means allowing the broadcasters to respond in a statement to the accusations .
sanctions can only be used in a case where deliberate intent is proved .
but that is rarely possible , widlok said .

but do ads disguised as content have a place in publicly funded programs ?
german public broadcaster ard seems to think so . " with carpets you have less dust , they absorb sound , they look impeccable and make it easier for children to take their first steps . "
a line from a pamphlet advertising floor coverings ?
hardly .
its a piece of dialogue taken directly from " marienhof , " an evening television soap opera that runs on germany 's publicly funded broadcaster , ard .
and the flooring-friendly text was n't written by a screenwriter with a carpet fetish .
the lines were proscribed by the consortium of textile floor coverings , and brought hard cash to bavaria film , the production company responsible for " marienhof . "
journalist volker lilienthal recently researched the issue of product placement on german tv .
he found that the daily soaps " marienhof " and " in aller freundschaft " have for years been systematically violating a section of the public broadcasting code that forbids the inclusion of unmarked advertising .
the rule aims to reduce confusing viewers by commingling content and advertising .
bildunterschrift : product placement von apple computer in filmen 2005 fever pitch in the meantime , bavaria film has admitted to having " cooperated with third parties " during production of the series .
proceeds were used " within the framework of additional development and further production . "
buying dialog the so-called " active integration " of products in the show were brought about by h. + s. and kultur + werbung , two firms dealing in product placement that are run by an ex-actor named andreas schnoor .
in the mid 1990s , schnoor got the federal ministry for economic cooperation and development to shell out the equivalent of around 140,000 euros to the ard hospital-based series " klinik unter palmen . "
in exchange , the characters happened to discuss german aid and development programs .
treading a fine line these days , the eu commission is showing particular interest in the use of disguised advertisement by publicly financed broadcasters ; it is currently observing developments in which eu grievance procedures are pending on public broadcasters due to competition-distortion claims .

but , the idea of tuition fees and even study loans remains anathema to many students . in some countries , saving for a child 's education is commonplace .
in the us , where the average cost for a year of studying and living at a private college is currently $ 22,000 -lrb- 17,921 euros -rrb- , many parents start socking away money in a college fund even before they 've sent out birth announcements .
until recently , germans did n't have this concern .
the notion that everyone has a right to a cost-free university education has long been a given in modern german society .
but the concept was dealt a blow in january , when the german federal constitutional court decided to overturn a ban on tuition .
each state can now decide whether its universities will charge for their services , and how much .
painful adjustment the result is a political dust storm that has yet to settle .
conservatives tend to support the implementation of tuition fees , claiming the underfunded universities need all the financial help they can get .
liberals oppose it as being anti-egalitarian .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of third-semester medical students attend class in leipzig .
so far , it looks as if nine of the 16 german states - including north rhine westphalia , now that conservatives won power there in recent elections - will begin charging course fees for an initial round of university study .
the fees will not surpass 500 euros per semester .
already , 12 states impose fees of anywhere from 300 euros to 900 euros per semester for people who take too long to complete their degree , or for career changers who want to take on a second course of study .
while other european countries -lrb- england , for example -rrb- have already gone through the painful adjustment from free to fee education , most germans - who prize their free education system - find the idea of paying tuition for a first round of study outrageous .
last week , some 10,000 students in five cities took to the streets in protest .
new financial instruments but the prospect of tuition fees has grabbed the attention of some farsighted financial institutions , who have begun packaging loans aimed at students .
the kfw , germany 's state-owned development bank , caused a minor sensation in february when it announced a five percent interest loan available to university students , regardless of their subjects of study or their parents ' financial situation .
bildunterschrift : university seminar deutsche bank - unlike the kfw , a private credit institution whose instruments have to make good in the open marketplace - countered with its own student loan , similar to that of kfw but at a slightly higher rate of interest .
once the clamor and political wrangling surrounding tuition costs have subsided , even more credit institutions are expected to compete for the student market , experts say .
growing business " the business of financing student loans will become more important in the coming years , so it is important to get into the market early , " lars hinrichsen , financial adviser at mummert consulting told the handelsblatt newspaper .
sonja hüpfner , spokeswoman for the kfw , explained that the aim of their loan is mostly to help students complete their studies speedily and make them more competitive .
" along with studying , a lot of people have to work to make ends meet , which means it takes them longer to complete a degree , " hüpfner said .
some 63 percent of german students have part time jobs during their studies , according to the internet site studis-online .
long-term students german students take an average of six years to complete a university degree , hüpfner said - the longest of any european country .
" they go on the job market much later , which does n't help them in terms of competitiveness " she pointed out .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstration in essen against tution fees .
sign reads free education -lrb- still -rrb- for everyone according to hüpfner , german expectations of free education is a case of misguided values , tied to an overall cultural distrust of debt .
" people are afraid to take on debt .
but they have to ask themselves : do i want to invest in my own future ?
or should i just take longer to get through my studies , and come on the job market later ? "
judith graff , a fourth year student at the university of cologne , sees the loan issue from a practical standpoint .
sure , her studies have been prolonged by the fact that she has to work 20 hours a week to make ends meet - and that 's without having had to pay any tuition fees .
but she would rather not finish school in debt .
" everyone knows right now there are no jobs in germany .
how would you pay the loan back ? "
graff asked .
" if people come out of school with debt then they would hesitate to start a family ... it 's a bad cycle . "
falling reputation people who argue in favor of tuition say the money is needed to boost academic standards at german universities , whose reputations have suffered over the last few decades .
a recent ranking of the world 's top universities in the times higher education supplement revealed that only one german institution , the university of heidelberg , was placed in the top 50 .
but opponents say even relatively low tuition fees of 500 euros per semester can make the difference between a given student 's success and failure .
" some people say 500 euros a semester is n't much .
but that 's 83 euros a month , " achim meyer auf der heyde , general secretary of the union of german students told the suddeutsche zeitung .
" and 27 percent of students live off of 600 euros a month .
for that person , 83 euros is a lot . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jörg dräger but jörg dräger -lrb- photo -rrb- , hamburg 's senator for science and research , who helped kfw create its student loan , rejects the notion that tuition fees will widen the gap between germany 's haves and have-nots .
instead , he said , giving a college education a monetary value makes it that much more worthwhile .
fees - a great equalizer ?
" tuition fees do n't only improve the financial framework of universities .
they are above all an instrument with which one can more fairly distribute the chances of receiving a university education , " dräger told the hamburg media institute in an interview .
" in the usa , great britain and japan , many more children from -lrb- poorer -rrb- backgrounds study , despite tuition fees .

chen yonglin also told an australian newspaper that officials tipped off his bosses immediately after he requested political asylum .
mr chen said he was defecting as he could no longer support what he said was china 's persecution of dissidents .
the chinese consulate said mr chen had made up stories to avoid going home .
mr chen , 37 , who worked as the chinese consul for political affairs in sydney , has been refused political asylum but he could be given a protection visa .
australian authorities have confirmed they had received an application for a protection visa from the diplomat , but did not comment on the asylum application they had allegedly rejected .
immigration minister amanda vanstone said the diplomat 's asylum application would not receive special treatment .
the defection attempt has come at a delicate time , as australia and china are trying to deepen economic and political ties .
' thousand spies ' mr chen is believed to have gone into hiding with his wife and daughter .
the diplomat said he had been responsible for monitoring chinese dissident activity in australia , including that of members of the spiritual movement , falun gong , which is banned in china .
he also said that there were up to 1,000 chinese spies in australia .
i did n't think it would happen like this - australia is a democratic country chen yonglin in an interview with the sydney morning herald published on monday , mr chen said he walked into the department of immigration in sydney with his family on 26 may .
he said he had offered information on chinese spies and kidnappings in australia , but had been turned down .
he was discouraged from applying for asylum and denied a safe haven , he said .
he said officers also called the chinese embassy .
the chinese consulate then called his mobile , at which point he decided to go into hiding .
when he finally met with australian officials last tuesday , he was told to apply for a tourist visa , he said .
" i did n't think it would happen like this .
australia is a democratic country , " he added .
" i thought they would help me .
my family is desperate .
we are helpless .
we need to be in a safe place . "
' no human rights ' china 's consulate said in a statement on sunday that mr chen had reached the end of his four-year stint in australia and was making up his allegations because he did not want to return to china .
" chen yonglin fabricated stories which are unfounded and purely fictitious , " it said .
on saturday , mr chen appeared at a rally in sydney , saying that chinese spies were trying to kidnap him and take him back to china .
" i 'm frightened that if they send -lsb- me -rsb- back to china , i certainly will be prosecuted , because in my working for four years in the consulate i have been helping in some way the pro-democracy activists and the falun gong people , " he said .
" in 16 years , the chinese government has done nothing for political reform .
people have no political freedom , no human rights . "
mr chen was involved in the tiananmen square protests and joined the diplomatic corps after being re-educated .

chen yonglin also told an australian newspaper that officials tipped off his bosses immediately after he requested political asylum .
mr chen said he was defecting as he could no longer support what he said was china 's persecution of dissidents .
the chinese consulate said mr chen had made up stories to avoid going home .
mr chen , 37 , who worked as the chinese consul for political affairs in sydney , has been refused political asylum but he could be given a protection visa .
australian authorities have confirmed they had received an application for a protection visa from the diplomat , but did not comment on the asylum application they had allegedly rejected .
immigration minister amanda vanstone said the diplomat 's asylum application would not receive special treatment .
the defection attempt has come at a delicate time , as australia and china are trying to deepen economic and political ties .
' thousand spies ' mr chen is believed to have gone into hiding with his wife and daughter .
the diplomat said he had been responsible for monitoring chinese dissident activity in australia , including that of members of the spiritual movement , falun gong , which is banned in china .
he also said that there were up to 1,000 chinese spies in australia .
i did n't think it would happen like this - australia is a democratic country chen yonglin in an interview with the sydney morning herald published on monday , mr chen said he walked into the department of immigration in sydney with his family on 26 may .
he said he had offered information on chinese spies and kidnappings in australia , but had been turned down .
he was discouraged from applying for asylum and denied a safe haven , he said .
he said officers also called the chinese embassy .
the chinese consulate then called his mobile , at which point he decided to go into hiding .
when he finally met with australian officials last tuesday , he was told to apply for a tourist visa , he said .
" i did n't think it would happen like this .
australia is a democratic country , " he added .
" i thought they would help me .
my family is desperate .
we are helpless .
we need to be in a safe place . "
' no human rights ' china 's consulate said in a statement on sunday that mr chen had reached the end of his four-year stint in australia and was making up his allegations because he did not want to return to china .
" chen yonglin fabricated stories which are unfounded and purely fictitious , " it said .
on saturday , mr chen appeared at a rally in sydney , saying that chinese spies were trying to kidnap him and take him back to china .
" i 'm frightened that if they send -lsb- me -rsb- back to china , i certainly will be prosecuted , because in my working for four years in the consulate i have been helping in some way the pro-democracy activists and the falun gong people , " he said .
" in 16 years , the chinese government has done nothing for political reform .
people have no political freedom , no human rights . "
mr chen was involved in the tiananmen square protests and joined the diplomatic corps after being re-educated .

variable charges of up to £ 1.43 a mile - in busy routes in rush hour - could replace road tax and fuel duty under the government 's plans .
transport experts said it would be the world 's most advanced road pricing scheme - but predicted political and technical difficulties in bringing it in .
' poll tax revolt ' " governments will upset at their peril society 's wish to do what it wants to do and that is to move around , " says professor garel rhys , director of the centre for automotive industry research at cardiff university 's business school .
it 's feasible , the question is , is it politically acceptable ?

and bert morris , director of the aa motoring trust , said : " it 's feasible , the question is , is it politically acceptable ?
" will people affected think they are better off or worse off ? "
tourism impact transport also has a wider impact on other parts of the economy , mr morris points out .
" tourism is transport reliant .
what will be the impact on tourism of road pricing ?
will people stop taking day trips to the seaside because of it ? "
mr darling is set to outline the proposals fully in a speech to the social market foundation on thursday .
mr darling is proposing to replace road tax and petrol duty there are currently about 30 million vehicles registered in the uk , up from 20 million just 15 years ago .
building extra roads to tackle congestion does not work and governments had realised this , said professor rhys .
the government could use the pricing scheme to indicate where roads are most needed , he said .
" i think the government will have to show this is not just simply a system of charging for the existing road network , soaking the people who are using it , but also use it as a price signal where it will show where new roads are really needed , " he added .
he said many of the current areas of congestion could be due to roadworks or accidents .
" i also think policing the proposed scheme will be a major problem .
the vast majority will be law-abiding but what about the minority ?
there could be a sizeable one . "
experts say other potential problems for the government include the effect on low income drivers , the reliability of the new technology , and deciding how to administer the collection of funds .
' way forward ' tony grayling , assistant director of the institute for public policy research and a former adviser to the government , also warned of more pollution and traffic in rural areas .
" whilst you would be reducing traffic in urban areas at peak hours , that would be more than outweighed by the growth in traffic in rural areas , where you had made motoring cheaper by cutting fuel duties , " he says .
sue nicholson , head of campaigns for motorists ' group the rac foundation , says the proposal , which would start with a pilot scheme , was a potential solution to the increasing traffic congestion .
" it 's certainly worth talking about .
it 's potentially a way forward out of the congestion problems that we face , " she says .
" providing this tax was substitutional to fuel tax and road tax rather than additional and provided we had some other guarantees then i think , for a lot of people , this would be a tempting option . "

the government could use the pricing scheme to indicate where roads are most needed , he said .
" i think the government will have to show this is not just simply a system of charging for the existing road network , soaking the people who are using it , but also use it as a price signal where it will show where new roads are really needed , " he added .
he said many of the current areas of congestion could be due to roadworks or accidents .
" i also think policing the proposed scheme will be a major problem .
the vast majority will be law-abiding but what about the minority ?
there could be a sizeable one . "
experts say other potential problems for the government include the effect on low income drivers , the reliability of the new technology , and deciding how to administer the collection of funds .
' way forward ' tony grayling , assistant director of the institute for public policy research and a former adviser to the government , also warned of more pollution and traffic in rural areas .
" whilst you would be reducing traffic in urban areas at peak hours , that would be more than outweighed by the growth in traffic in rural areas , where you had made motoring cheaper by cutting fuel duties , " he says .
sue nicholson , head of campaigns for motorists ' group the rac foundation , says the proposal , which would start with a pilot scheme , was a potential solution to the increasing traffic congestion .
" it 's certainly worth talking about .
it 's potentially a way forward out of the congestion problems that we face , " she says .
" providing this tax was substitutional to fuel tax and road tax rather than additional and provided we had some other guarantees then i think , for a lot of people , this would be a tempting option . "

south wales police said many motorists are still flouting the law which bans people from using a mobile phone while behind the wheel .
anyone caught using their phone while driving faces a fine of up to £ 1,000 .
but courts do not have the power to impose penalty points .
using a hand held mobile phone while driving has been illegal since 2003 .

we will not tolerate such actions where other people 's lives are endangered sergeant nigel whitehouse , south wales police many drivers now use hand free kits to make calls while on the move , but under existing legislation , they can be prosecuted if it is proved that they are not in proper control of their vehicle .
despite several operations to clamp down on the dangerous use of phones , south wales police say that many motorists continue to ignore the law .
road safety officer sergeant nigel whitehouse is heading an operation which launches on monday to target such drivers .
he said : " we have already prosecuted a number of drivers since the legislation was introduced as their driving actions fell well below the standard required .

oriel mon , which opened 13 years ago to house the prestigious charles tunnicliffe art collection , is also facing declining visitor numbers .
plans to house a new exhibition by sir kyffin williams at the gallery have also come under fire .
anglesey council declined to comment as no final decision has been reached .
the gallery was built on the outskirts of llangefni to house the work of renowned wildlife artist charles tunnicliffe .
it certainly would not add any inspiration to the art collection unpublished report but bbc wales has seen an unpublished report prepared in the early 90s by the wildlife trust , on the consideration of various sites for the gallery , which ruled out the site eventually chosen for the venue .
the report said of the llangefni site , " it certainly would not add any inspiration to the art collection " and that " llangefni offers no scope for a wildlife connection " .
the report concludes that " a building in llangefni would be lost in its surroundings ... the insertion of a building of any size and significance in llangefni would also involve considerable costs , disruption in the life of the town and the building of a multi-storey car park " .
figures obtained under the freedom of information act from anglesey council also show a 10,000 drop in visitor numbers since the gallery first opened .
there are plans to extend the gallery for sir kyffin williams ' works in 1991/2 , 65,339 people visited the oriel mon but by 2004/5 , the figures had slumped to 55,901 .
now plans to extend the existing art gallery to house another prestigious art collection , paintings by sir kyffin williams , have also come under fire .
the new plans have so far failed to attract the backing of the welsh arts council .
anglesey artist wil rowlands said that the council-led project lacks any transparency .
friends of sir kyffin williams say that the delays by the council are causing the elderly artist a huge amount of frustration and anguish .
anglesey council refused to be interviewed on the grounds that no final decisions have yet been made even though the project was given the go- ahead with planning permission in january 2005 .
the results of bbc wales ' two-month investigation is set to be revealed on the radio cymru programme , post cyntaf .

former separatist rebel joseph kabui beat his nearest rival , former governor john momis , by 14,000 votes .
the poll has been seen as a key test of a un-brokered peace deal , which ended a 10-year separatist campaign by rebels hoping to secede from papua new guinea .
new zealand election observer andrew ladley called mr kabui 's win a " landslide victory " .
but mr momis questioned the results , and said he was considering a legal challenge .
" a new day is now dawning today , " mr kabui told local media on monday .
" today is also the journey to see that bougainville is no longer a province of png -lsb- papua new guinea -rsb- but it is an autonomous region in png .
that everyone must understand now , " he said .
mr kabui , head of the people 's congress party , is a former ally of francis ona , who led the separatist campaign that left up to 15,000 people dead .
the rebellion began in 1989 as a dispute over land and alleged environmental damage between islanders and multinational copper mining companies .
but it became a brutal war of independence , involving government forces , well-armed militias and foreign mercenaries .
under a deal signed in august 2001 , the two sides agreed that bougainville should have greater self-government and eventually a referendum on independence , within 10-15 years .
the election of an autonomous government is being seen as a major test of the agreement , and an important step towards full independence .
bougainville 's fledgling administration will run the island , with papua new guinea 's federal government retaining control over defence and the economy .
voting lasted a fortnight because of the island 's rugged terrain .
some of the electorate had to walk for days or travel by canoe to reach polling stations .

under a deal signed in august 2001 , the two sides agreed that bougainville should have greater self-government and eventually a referendum on independence , within 10-15 years .
the election of an autonomous government is being seen as a major test of the agreement , and an important step towards full independence .
bougainville 's fledgling administration will run the island , with papua new guinea 's federal government retaining control over defence and the economy .

giselle pakeerah after discussions between the government and the games industry , it was agreed games which carry a 15 or 18 certificate should be more clearly labelled .
the age labels are now more than double the previous size , similar to the warnings in place on dvds and videos .
giselle pakeerah said : " up until now , the industry have absolved themselves completely of any responsibility .
" and so the crucial step is the fact that they 've now had to accept responsibility and they 've had to demonstrate that by altering the way things are labelled . "
' responsible marketing ' leblanc admitted killing stefan in stokes wood park in leicester on 23 february .
police said robbery was the motive behind the attack - and not the video game blamed by stefan 's parents .

the robot vehicle started to experience wheel slippage while trying to traverse a ripple-shaped dune on 26 april .
engineers used a model rover back on earth to work out a driving strategy to release opportunity from the deep dirt .
and at the weekend the rover confirmed it was rolling free again with images showing the wheels had good traction .
" after a nerve-wracking month of hard work , the rover team is both elated and relieved to finally see our wheels sitting on top of the sand instead of half buried in it , " said jeffrey biesiadecki , a nasa rover mobility engineer .
nasa said it would study opportunity 's surroundings carefully before commanding the vehicle to take a long drive .
engineers want to be sure there are not any other sand traps close by that could catch the vehicle for a second time .
" the first thing we 're going to do is simply take a hard look at the stuff we were stuck in , " said dr steve squyres , the principal investigator for the mars rovers ' science instruments .
the mission team simulated the escape on an engineering model " after that , we will begin a cautious set of moves to get us on our way southward again .
south is where we think the best science is , so that 's still where we want to go . "
opportunity and its twin rover , spirit , have been studying the geology on opposite sides of the planet for more than a year since successfully completing their three-month primary missions .
the robots have worked superbly under harsh martian conditions far longer than expected .
shortly after landing in january 2004 , opportunity found layered bedrock bearing geological evidence of a shallow ancient sea .
more than one year later , spirit found extensive layered bedrock after driving for about three km and climbing into the " columbia hills . "

the national institute for health and clinical excellence -lrb- nice -rrb- has said anti-tnfa drugs should be provided by the nhs across england and wales .
but a study has found lack of funds in many nhs trusts is preventing many patients from benefiting from them .
it was commissioned by the british society for rheumatology and the arthritis and musculoskeletal alliance . "
clearly patients are being let down if they are not being provided with these drugs " jane kennedy most people with rheumatoid arthritis respond to standard immunosuppressant drugs , but around 15 % have symptoms so severe that these drugs are of little help .
it is these patients who have most to gain from being given access to anti-tnfa drugs .
doctors estimate almost 1,700 rheumatoid arthritis patients who could benefit from the drugs are being denied treatment .
the results suggest little has changed since a similar survey was carried out in 2003 .
professor david isenberg , bsr president , said the findings were " very disappointing " .
he said : " it is immensely frustrating for doctors to have patients who clearly qualify for anti-tnfa intervention but are unable to get it .
" these drugs offer hope and relief to people who have severe rheumatoid arthritis , and are likely to be affected by high levels of pain and disability , making their day to day living very difficult . "
long wait di vara works for the nhs in the health secretary patricia hewitt 's constituency of leicester west .
he was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis almost eight years ago , and has been told he should receive the treatment .
but his consultant has told him that there is a three year waiting list in leicestershire .
he said : " i love my job , and feel i still have a lot to give , but if i do n't receive any therapy fairly soon i might have to pack my job up . "
the survey of 148 rheumatology units across the uk found that 31 % of doctors were unable to provide the treatment to all patients who qualified for it .
more than 50 % blamed a lack of funding .
many doctors also said they were unable to provide the drugs to people with other arthritis-related conditions , such as ankylosing spondylitis -lrb- as -rrb- and psoriatic arthritis -lrb- psa -rrb- .
professor isenberg said : " it is wrong that some people are being left with unnecessary pain and disability .
" the department of health should remind health trusts they need to take urgent and immediate action to ensure people get the treatment they are entitled to . "
neil betteridge , of the charity arthritis care , said : " it is extremely worrying that thousands of people are being forced to live in severe pain as a direct result of being unable to access the treatment they so desperately need .
" our helplines team receives hundreds of calls every year from people desperate for information about how they can access anti-tnf treatment .
many feel they have been abandoned by the system . "
government action a department of health spokeswoman said specialist teams based in every strategic health authority were being introduced to provide advice , care and treatment for people with chronic diseases like arthritis .
two new classes of drugs had also been made available to nhs patients with arthritis following reviews by nice .

the national institute for health and clinical excellence -lrb- nice -rrb- has said anti-tnfa drugs should be provided by the nhs across england and wales .
but a study has found lack of funds in many nhs trusts is preventing many patients from benefiting from them .
it was commissioned by the british society for rheumatology and the arthritis and musculoskeletal alliance .
clearly patients are being let down if they are not being provided with these drugs jane kennedy most people with rheumatoid arthritis respond to standard immunosuppressant drugs , but around 15 % have symptoms so severe that these drugs are of little help .
it is these patients who have most to gain from being given access to anti-tnfa drugs .
doctors estimate almost 1,700 rheumatoid arthritis patients who could benefit from the drugs are being denied treatment .
the results suggest little has changed since a similar survey was carried out in 2003 .
professor david isenberg , bsr president , said the findings were " very disappointing " .
he said : " it is immensely frustrating for doctors to have patients who clearly qualify for anti-tnfa intervention but are unable to get it .
" these drugs offer hope and relief to people who have severe rheumatoid arthritis , and are likely to be affected by high levels of pain and disability , making their day to day living very difficult . "
long wait di vara works for the nhs in the health secretary patricia hewitt 's constituency of leicester west .
he was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis almost eight years ago , and has been told he should receive the treatment .
but his consultant has told him that there is a three year waiting list in leicestershire .
he said : " i love my job , and feel i still have a lot to give , but if i do n't receive any therapy fairly soon i might have to pack my job up . "
the survey of 148 rheumatology units across the uk found that 31 % of doctors were unable to provide the treatment to all patients who qualified for it .
more than 50 % blamed a lack of funding .
many doctors also said they were unable to provide the drugs to people with other arthritis-related conditions , such as ankylosing spondylitis -lrb- as -rrb- and psoriatic arthritis -lrb- psa -rrb- .
professor isenberg said : " it is wrong that some people are being left with unnecessary pain and disability .

a woman of many parts - actress , political activist and fitness guru - she followed goldie hawn as the second silver screen star at the event .
she told stories of hepburn and hanoi .
the veteran of causes and campaigns , including famously opposing the vietnam war , she said of current events : " i 'm 67 and i 've not seen the situation as scary as it is now . "
inevitably , her opposition to the vietnam war took up most of the discussion .
as source material for an autobiography , not many have access to a 22,000 page fbi file .
we need to stay and fight - there 's a lot of us , we 've just been lied to and manipulated - we 're just a little walking-wounded right now jane fonda at hay festival " i was a celebrity , " she said of the attention of a more secret kind .
" there were people far more effective and more knowledgeable .
i was barbarella , but i was suddenly working with soldiers in the anti-war movement .
i was a real threat . "
earlier on sunday , in one of those odd moments that hay can throw up , the actress had met robert mcnamara , the us defence secretary who had resigned from the lyndon johnson administration over the bombing of north vietnam .
" i wanted to say thank you to him .
when he said that they were wrong , it was something i wanted to acknowledge . "
ms fonda told the sell-out crowd of her relationship with her parents .
the actress is in the uk after a five-week us publicity tour her mother 's depression eventually led to her suicide when fonda was 12 , and there were the well-documented difficulties with her father , actor henry fonda : " i could n't get him to love me . "
she spoke quite movingly of working with him on his final film , on golden pond , which won him an oscar in 1982 , aged 76 .
on the same film , she also encountered the formidable katherine hepburn , whose first words to her were " i do n't like you " .
but her frostiness did thaw .
" she was angry with me because i did n't pay enough attention to -lrb- acting -rrb- .
i had children .. had a business . "
despite winning two oscars , the star of klute , coming home and they shoot horses , do n't they ? only recently returned to films after a gap of 15 years , starring alongside jennifer lopez in monsters-in-law .
manipulated " i 'm a big movie buff , but it 's what i do , not what i am .
most of my films are of absolutely no importance whatsoever . "
ms fonda mused over an idea for a film about an older couple falling in love - getting undressed in the dark - and dismissed a press report about herself and botox injections .
" do they know nothing about lighting , " she queried .
" you can look about 10 years younger if the light 's right .
no , i 've not had botox .
everyone looks alike , it 's frightening . "
" you go shopping in hollywood and everyone looks the same .
that 's what i like about over here , everyone looks like -lrb- what -rrb- they are . "
after railing against the right-wing and contending that only the women 's movement was a real force for more radical politics in the united states , the book title , my life so far , sounded more like a warning to her opponents .
" we need to stay and fight .
there 's a lot of us , we 've just been lied to and manipulated .
we 're just a little walking-wounded right now . "
