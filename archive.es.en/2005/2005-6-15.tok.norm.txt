germany faces off against australia in the second match .
who has the best shot ? argentina - tunisia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : striker javier saviola , nicknamed " the rabbit " , is a massive goal-scoring threat though playing without stars hernan crespo , roberto ayala and juan sebastian veron , argentina is one of those countries that produces soccer talent like other countries produce co2 emissions .
coach jose pekerman still has javier saviola , juan roman riquelme , javier zanetti , and defender gabriel heinze to pick from , all of whom will figure prominently in the gauchos ' attacking style .
high off of a 3-1 spanking of brazil in the world cup qualifying rounds that secured them a spot in the 2006 world cup , argentina comes into the confederations cup tournament playing well enough to earn its " favorite " status . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : silva has been a serious threat ever since tunisia one the africa cup tunisia 's star player is its coach , the frenchman roger lemerre , who won the european championship with france in 2000 , and the confederations cup a year later .
lemerre has the tunisians playing tight and disciplined in the back , waiting for the chance to counter .
when they do , it 's usually over the wings - a mirror image of argentina 's style - and to francileude dos santos silva .
the native brazilian , who took tunisian citizenship just before the africa cup last year , became the tournament 's shooting star .
now , he 's ready to make problems for the big names in the confederations cup .
" on paper , we have no chance against germany and argentina , " said lemerre .
" but you never know . " possible lineup : tunisia - boumnijel - trabelsi , jaidi , abdi , clayton - ghodhbane , nafti , ben saada , mnari - santos , jaziri argentina - leo franco - coloccini , milito , heinze - j. zanetti , cambiasso , bernardi , sorin - riquelme - tevez , saviola germany - australia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kevin kuranyi will have to show he 's up to shouldering the goal-scoring burden germany comes into the tournament with a number of questions : can the strikers score goals ?
will the young defense stand up against major international competition ?
as a matter of fact , will the rest of the team stand up to major international competition ?
because it is hosting the world cup next year , germany has been spared the intensity and pressure of qualification .
as a result , coach jürgen klinsmann has been allowed to juggle around all sorts of lineup changes in the team 's friendly matches .
after this tournament , that should end .
tonight 's match against australia will be a chance for the strikers , most likely kevin kuranyi and gerald asamoah , to show their mettle in klinsmann 's offense-oriented playing style .
the german defense , who all hover around the age of 22 , will also have to prove itself - klinsmann ended practice this week with extra work for the defenders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : australia has a chance to surprise others at the tournament , but only a small one .
the definite underdog in this match-up , australia , is nevertheless a team with big dreams .
their past confed cup performances give them good reason to hope .
the team finished second in riyadh in 1997 , playing their way into the final before getting walloped by brazil .
in 2001 , in south korea and japan , the team beat brazil 1-0 to win third place and get their revenge .
coach frank farina remains confident : " we believe in ourselves , " he told reporters the other day .
his side is arguably one of the better ones in recent years , even without liverpool striker harry kewell , who is injured .
midfielders tim cahill , brett merton and striker mark viduka all play in the english premiership .
cahill will be responsible for directing the " socceroos " attack , and will look to take advantage of germany 's maligned and relatively slow defense .
the everton midfielder also remains a goal-scoring threat , notching 12 for his club as it marched to a champion 's league qualifying spot and seven for his country in as many appearances .
captian craig moore will anchor the defense . possible lineup : germany - kahn - b. schneider , a. friedrich , mertesacker , hitzlsperger - frings - deisler , schweinsteiger - ballack - kuranyi , podolski australia - schwarzer - neill , popovic , moore , muscat - milicevic - chipperfield , skoko , emerton - cahill - viduka dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the mini-world cup kicks off hundreds of thousands of fans will follow the fortunes of eight teams at five stadiums across germany over the next two weeks .

" the meeting i 've just had with president chirac was immensely amicable but obviously there 's sharp disagreement , " blair told a news briefing after talks .
" i think it is difficult to see these differences being bridged , but of course you know we continue to talk . " british rebate and french farm subsidies the dispute centers on britain 's controversial 5.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.4 billion -rrb- eu rebate , forged by margaret thatcher 's iron will two decades ago , that is under fire from other eu members sick of footing the bill .
france , germany , spain and the netherlands in particular want the rebate to be reconsidered , claiming that since it was introduced britain has grown much richer and the eu much bigger . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french dairy farmer jean-marc guigue repairs fencing on his dairy farm in mognard , france britain wants a reform of agricultural subsidies , agreed upon in 2002 , which consumes more than 40 percent of the eu 's budget and especially benefits french farmers .
blair wants chirac to give ground on the topic before it agrees to submit its annual rebate from european coffers for renegotiation - a demand that chirac is unlikely to give in to for fear it could anger powerful french farmers at a time when his personal popularity at home has slipped to dismal levels . chirac has called for a " gesture of solidarity " from britain to freeze or surrender its debate . on wednesday , chirac 's spokesman jerome bonnafont told reuters that france wanted " a fair and reasonable agreement " in which everyone made a contribution .
he made no reference to any french concessions .
bonnafont said chirac believed it was " important we do not add financial difficulties to the current political crisis in europe , " sparked by the rejection of the eu constitution in france and the netherlands . eu treaty ratification tricky issue wednesday 's meeting with chirac marked the end of a two-day whirlwind diplomatic tour for blair which also took him to russia and germany .
the tour was meant to focus principally on the summit of the group of eight industrialized countries in gleneagles next month .
britain is chairing the g8 this year and has made ending chronic poverty in africa one of its top concerns for meetings , along with real progress on confronting climate change . britain 's own decision to shelve plans for a planned referendum on the eu constitution next year in the wake of the two rejections in france and the netherlands has not gone down well with other eu members who still want to push ahead with the ratification process . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair , left , with schröder in germany , chancellor gerhard schröder has emerged as a vocal champion of the embattled eu constitution , urging the bloc to press on with the ratification process despite london 's decision to call off a planned referendum on it .
he has also taken the french side in the farm subsidies row , which blair has said must also be put on the table in brussels this week . " chancellor schröder is clearly on the same lines as the french president as far as agricultural subsidies are concerned , " government spokesman bela anda said monday ahead of the meeting between schröder and blair . a clear political direction britain 's position on both the constitution and the budget and blair 's row with chirac have left it looking increasingly isolated within the eu - a situation similar to the time when britain joined the us-led invasion in iraq in 2003 in the face of fierce franco-german opposition . experts are pessimistic about the prospect of a deal on either of the issues at a two-day eu summit that kicks off in brussels on thursday . luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , whose country currently holds the six-month rotating eu presidency , said he was fairly certain a deal would n't be brokered at the summit . " i am pretty sure we wo n't get the financial perspectives through at this summit , " juncker told a european parliament committee , hours before he was due to circulate a compromise proposal on the 2007-2013 budget to eu leaders .
" there is agreement , more or less , on the total amount of funding .
we differ as to payments to the budget , the structure of expenditure and who is a net contributor , " juncker said . tony blair , who has rejected a long-term freeze on britain 's widely-criticized eu budget rebate , has linked the budget dispute to the constitutional and political crisis gripping the eu and called for a pause for reflection . " if we want to reconnect people in europe with the idea of the european union , we 've got to set a clear political direction , " blair said after wednesday 's meeting with chirac . " we 've got to , even in the financing of europe , in fact , in some respects particularly in the financing of europe , reconnect the priorities that people have in europe with the way that we spend the money in europe , " blair said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup 2006 -pipe- 15.06.2005 argentina dominates tunisia in opener großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juan riquelme started the scoring , and led his team to victory argentina played a superior game against tunisia , winning 2-1 with the help of a penalty kick and a nicely-played second goal . though the final score was a little closer than some had expected , argentina left no doubt who was the master on the field .
coach jose pekerman 's side , missing stars like hernan crespo and juan sebastian veron , nevertheless controlled play virtually from the start .
tunisia was left rueing an early missed penalty shot that might have changed the flow of the match .
and referee roberto rosetti will probably want to review the game tape to take a second look at some of his calls .
tunisia started quick in the first half , as argentina found itself confounded by the coach roger lemerre 's disciplined backfield . still , a couple of close calls came right at the beginning , when saviola failed to get past goalie khaled fadhel in the 14th minute , and galletti 's header went above the crossbar a minute later . penalty shot on counter tunisia rarely ventured into the argentine half of the field after an initial storm of action .
when they did , it was usually on dangerous counters .
shortly after galletti 's chance , tunisia replied .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gonazalo rodriguez against tunisia 's chadli .
the teams were evenly matched only at the very beginning of the match . sprung forward on the left side of the field , haykel guemamdia ran hard after a ball , and goalie german lux cut him down on the bottom side of the penalty box close to the goal .
referee rosetti did n't hesitate in awarding a penalty shot .
but imed mhadhebi sent his shot wide and to the left , squandering an opportunity that would have been so valuable later . riquelme gives gauchos the lead argentina started taking control after the 20th minute . playmaker juan riquelme distributed some nice passes around the top of the penalty area .
in the 32nd minute , rosetti pointed to the spot after a dubious fall by argentine defender maximiliano rodriguez .
replays showed the call was anything but 100 percent , but riquelme calmly slotted in the penalty to give argentina the lead . the gauchos played patient at the second half , giving tunisia the opportunity to come into their side of the field .
but gabriel heinze , fabricio coloccini and co. kept the door shut tight .
in the 57th minute , luciano galletti was sprung down the right side .
left unmarked until the last moment , he had time to pick out a charging saviola who pocketed the ball in the left side of the net for a 2-0 lead . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : good reason to be happy tunisia claws back shaky argentine keeper german lux then almost let tunisia back into the game when he weakly cleared a ball directly to a charging slim benachour .
but the tunisian midfielder 's shot at the 67th minute went just right of the goal . but his side would soon get their chance .
guemamdia ended up one on one with lux again , and fell as the keeper dove for his feet .
replays showed the tunisian striker took off nice and early , completely missing lux 's outstretched fingertips .

coach jose pekerman 's side , missing stars like hernan crespo and juan sebastian veron , nevertheless controlled play virtually from the start .
tunisia was left rueing an early missed penalty shot that might have changed the flow of the match .
and referee roberto rosetti will probably want to review the game tape to take a second look at some of his calls .
tunisia started quick in the first half , as argentina found itself confounded by the coach roger lemerre 's disciplined backfield . still , a couple of close calls came right at the beginning , when saviola failed to get past goalie khaled fadhel in the 14th minute , and galletti 's header went above the crossbar a minute later . penalty shot on counter tunisia rarely ventured into the argentine half of the field after an initial storm of action .
when they did , it was usually on dangerous counters .
shortly after galletti 's chance , tunisia replied .

the teams were evenly matched only at the very beginning of the match . sprung forward on the left side of the field , haykel guemamdia ran hard after a ball , and goalie german lux cut him down on the bottom side of the penalty box close to the goal .

in the 32nd minute , rosetti pointed to the spot after a dubious fall by argentine defender maximiliano rodriguez .
replays showed the call was anything but 100 percent , but riquelme calmly slotted in the penalty to give argentina the lead . the gauchos played patient at the second half , giving tunisia the opportunity to come into their side of the field .
but gabriel heinze , fabricio coloccini and co. kept the door shut tight .
in the 57th minute , luciano galletti was sprung down the right side .
left unmarked until the last moment , he had time to pick out a charging saviola who pocketed the ball in the left side of the net for a 2-0 lead . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : good reason to be happy tunisia claws back shaky argentine keeper german lux then almost let tunisia back into the game when he weakly cleared a ball directly to a charging slim benachour .
but the tunisian midfielder 's shot at the 67th minute went just right of the goal . but his side would soon get their chance .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 15.06.2005 moving german service to foreign shores großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indians assume the lion 's share of german service jobs sent abroad outsourcing has become standard in manufacturing .
but according to a recent study concerning the service sector , it 's still something of a novelty in germany , though that 's rapidly changing . in the early 1900s , henry ford revolutionized manufacturing when he introduced the assembly line to build cars .
the 1980s saw the next revolution : subcontractors took over part of the manufacturing process .
outsourcing has now taken hold of the service sector , where it 's called " offshoring . "
deutsche bank and the it organization bitkom presented a study on the effects of this change for the german workforce on tuesday in berlin that suggests that german it students may want to shift their emphasis . germany 's offshoring sales volume currently amounts to about 600 million euros -lrb- $ 723 million -rrb- .
an increase of more than 20 percent is expected over the next five years , and it 's a development that ca n't be halted , according to bitkom vice president jörg menno harms . " we can decide whether we want to react to globalization passively - as victims - or actively by having a say in the future division of labor in the world , " harms said .

but according to a recent study concerning the service sector , it 's still something of a novelty in germany , though that 's rapidly changing . in the early 1900s , henry ford revolutionized manufacturing when he introduced the assembly line to build cars .
the 1980s saw the next revolution : subcontractors took over part of the manufacturing process .
outsourcing has now taken hold of the service sector , where it 's called " offshoring . "
deutsche bank and the it organization bitkom presented a study on the effects of this change for the german workforce on tuesday in berlin that suggests that german it students may want to shift their emphasis . germany 's offshoring sales volume currently amounts to about 600 million euros -lrb- $ 723 million -rrb- .
an increase of more than 20 percent is expected over the next five years , and it 's a development that ca n't be halted , according to bitkom vice president jörg menno harms . " we can decide whether we want to react to globalization passively - as victims - or actively by having a say in the future division of labor in the world , " harms said .
" offshoring should n't be a taboo topic .
we 've got to acknowledge that companies use offshoring to keep up and to improve their international competitiveness . " due to the change , young computer scientists with fresh degrees in hand are likely to discover they can only get work in the sector as highly specialized experts with experience in project management or as consultants and customer advisors .
mere programmers are simply not needed in germany , since their work is now done in india , ireland and israel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relocating jobs abroad continues to be at the heart of heated discussions in germany .
the fact that only 570 of the 4,000 companies contacted for the study participated illustrates how touchy it is .
despite promises of anonymity , many companies were concerned about their image .
but , the study actually showed that offshoring does n't necessarily have a negative effect on the jobs that remain in germany .
on the contrary , the savings allow the companies to grow and to hire more employees , harms said .
not always feasible though india is still the main destination for offshoring projects - it has 90 percent of the western european market - contractors from eastern europe are gaining ground , the study showed . " we do feel a cultural proximity to eastern european countries , " one of the study 's authors , jürgen schaaf , said .
" the great advantage the us and britain have in india is a common language .
that 's an advantage germans do n't have in india .
but in many eastern european countries , german is spoken well enough to communicate on a working level . " in its own attempts to send jobs offshore , deutsche bank discovered firsthand the importance of language for the service sector .
the bank tried to establish a call-center abroad , but ended up leaving again because customers were n't satisfied . bildunterschrift : deutsche bank chief economist norbert walter " you learn that many languages are spoken all over the world , but often in such a manner that only locals can understand them , not our customers , " said deutsche bank chief economist norbert walter -lrb- photo -rrb- . now , one of the bank 's two global call-centers is located in berlin .
the way of the future ? but it 's not only customer services , bookkeeping and personnel that are prey to offshoring .
about 40 percent of the firms questioned in the study said they 'd partly offshored research and development as well .
but in this case , cost efficiency was n't the only reason .
there just are n't enough highly specialized experts in germany and that 's what the country needs , walter said . in view of all the schools that - due to germany 's low birth rate - are expected to stand empty in the future , the country could start making a name for itself as a global contractor of education , " walter suggested .
germany could make a name for itself for " inshoring " instead of offshoring . sabine kinkartz -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de giving globalization a coy voice what would happen if india 's formidable army of call center operators dropped their professional tone and got personal on the phone ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup 2006 -pipe- 15.06.2005 argentina dominates tunisia in opener großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juan riquelme started the scoring , and led his team to victory argentina played a superior game against tunisia , winning 2-1 with the help of a penalty kick and a nicely-played second goal . though the final score was a little closer than some had expected , argentina left no doubt who was the master on the field .
coach jose pekerman 's side , missing stars like hernan crespo and juan sebastian veron , nevertheless controlled play virtually from the start .
tunisia was left rueing an early missed penalty shot that might have changed the flow of the match .
and referee roberto rosetti will probably want to review the game tape to take a second look at some of his calls .
tunisia started quick in the first half , as argentina found itself confounded by the coach roger lemerre 's disciplined backfield . still , a couple of close calls came right at the beginning , when saviola failed to get past goalie khaled fadhel in the 14th minute , and galletti 's header went above the crossbar a minute later . penalty shot on counter tunisia rarely ventured into the argentine half of the field after an initial storm of action .
when they did , it was usually on dangerous counters .
shortly after galletti 's chance , tunisia replied .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gonazalo rodriguez against tunisia 's chadli .
the teams were evenly matched only at the very beginning of the match . sprung forward on the left side of the field , haykel guemamdia ran hard after a ball , and goalie german lux cut him down on the bottom side of the penalty box close to the goal .
referee rosetti did n't hesitate in awarding a penalty shot .
but imed mhadhebi sent his shot wide and to the left , squandering an opportunity that would have been so valuable later . riquelme gives gauchos the lead argentina started taking control after the 20th minute . playmaker juan riquelme distributed some nice passes around the top of the penalty area .
in the 32nd minute , rosetti pointed to the spot after a dubious fall by argentine defender maximiliano rodriguez .
replays showed the call was anything but 100 percent , but riquelme calmly slotted in the penalty to give argentina the lead . the gauchos played patient at the second half , giving tunisia the opportunity to come into their side of the field .
but gabriel heinze , fabricio coloccini and co. kept the door shut tight .
in the 57th minute , luciano galletti was sprung down the right side .
left unmarked until the last moment , he had time to pick out a charging saviola who pocketed the ball in the left side of the net for a 2-0 lead . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : good reason to be happy tunisia claws back shaky argentine keeper german lux then almost let tunisia back into the game when he weakly cleared a ball directly to a charging slim benachour .
but the tunisian midfielder 's shot at the 67th minute went just right of the goal . but his side would soon get their chance .
guemamdia ended up one on one with lux again , and fell as the keeper dove for his feet .
replays showed the tunisian striker took off nice and early , completely missing lux 's outstretched fingertips .
but rosetti pointed to the spot .
guemamdia took the penalty himself this time , slotting it into the corner and making it interesting again in the 72nd minute . the two sides traded a couple of opportunities in the closing phase of the match , but both keepers showed they were on point .
tunisia showed it did n't have a solution for the solid argentine defense in font of lux , and bowed to a superior opponent . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the mini-world cup kicks off hundreds of thousands of fans will follow the fortunes of eight teams at five stadiums across germany over the next two weeks .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 15.06.2005 invasion of the healthy hedonists großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : residents keep their eyes peeled for anyone breaking the rules young people are no longer spending their sundays nursing hangovers in front of the tv .
they head out to their private allotments to tend to their vegetables .
so when did that most suburban of activities become so hip ? undeterred by the bracing easterly wind , dirk ziegler is deadheading his geraniums .
" it 's good to get outside at the weekend , " exclaims the 35-year-old father-of-two as he surveys his modest kingdom .
raising his voice above the roar of a passing train , he shrugs off the obvious downsides of the urban garden .
" having an allotment in the center of town is perfect because it 's so easy to reach - and it 's great for the kids to have somewhere to play , " he says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dirk is part of a wider movement of 30-somethings who 've tired of late nights in smoky clubs and want to get back to nature . three years ago , he and his girlfriend leased a garden allotment in prenzlauer berg - a district in central berlin more commonly associated with fashionable bars and boutiques - and they 've never looked back .
" allotments have become trendy " , confirmed jürgen hurt , president of the berlin association for gardeners in an interview with the daily berliner zeitung .
according to a study conducted by the association , the average age of tenants has dropped from 56 to 46 in the last six years .
the " schrebergarten " -lrb- allotment -rrb- phenomenon , born a century ago , was named after the leipzig-based doctor daniel schreber - a staunch believer in exercise in the great outdoors for pasty-faced city children .
plots of land leased from the state became increasingly popular with tenants seeking gardens for their young , plus an opportunity to stock up their pantries with home-grown garden produce .
meet the weekend warriors today , pedestrians on the busy bornholmer bridge , which earned its place in history as the first border-crossing to be opened to east germans back in 1989 , can look down on the " garden colony " where dirk and his family now spend most of their free time .
flanked by railway lines and shopping malls , it 's a haven of tranquillity in an otherwise bleak urban landscape .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rosy-cheeked garden gnomes preside over well-kept lawns , framed by rows of flourishing hollyhocks and crispy-looking lettuces .
if it were n't for the not-so-distant hum of traffic , it would be a rural idyll .
but what 's most striking is that few of the residents are lounging around with a beer and the sports section of the sunday paper - they 're all getting their hands dirty .
" i put in at least ten hours of work a week , " says dirk , who 's been digging in his flower-bed all day .
his neighbor is busy putting up a trellis , while across the way , mrs sturmer is fixing her roof .
she 's part of the colony 's elder generation , who can remember a time when allotments were about survival rather than leisure .
" my allotment has been in the family for three generations , " she explained .
" my grandfather leased it during the recession in the 1920s , when people in the city really needed their allotments .
back then , it was a necessity , because if you did n't grow your own vegetables , you did n't have any . "
dig it ?
but times have changed , and these days , growing your own spinach is a lifestyle choice .
herbaceous borders are hipper than prada pumps .
in the uk , the times has even dubbed gardening " the new sex . "
so if you think weeding , digging and planting is for frustrated housewives , think again .
bildunterschrift : for just a few hundred euros a year , some 4 million germans enjoy the pastoral perks of an allotment garden , and waiting lists are long .
experts say this love affair with all things horticultural is a sign of the times .
" allotments used to be seen as conventional and boring , but not anymore , " said trend researcher eike wenzel .
it 's not even that vacations are a luxury few can afford when 5 million germans are unemployed .
" it does n't actually have anything to do with the country 's financial difficulties , " he said .
" it 's more about getting back to nature - the satisfaction of doing things yourself and using your hands . "
he would even go so far as to say it reflects a slow shift in values .
" it ties in with a return to tradition and a desire for a slower pace of life .
the 1990s were a very stormy decade of accelerated technology , modernization and digitalization , " he explained .
" but people now feel that they 've been disappointed by these developments and what they really want is a grounded family life and old-fashioned values .
bonding with nature is a key factor in that shift . "
urban refugees bildunterschrift : most of berlin 's 840 garden colonies are made up of 20 to 100 plots , each roughly 300 meters square , overseen by a highly authoritative residents ' association .
its job is to make sure everyone sticks to the rules , which range from keeping the noise down between midday and 3 p.m. to making sure trees never grow beyond a prescribed height and using at least one third of the garden as a vegetable patch .
" you have to fit in , and if you do n't like it , you should n't bother coming here , " says frau sturmer in no uncertain terms .
" young families have to adjust to the rules like everyone else . "
and most of them do .
an allotment garden is a coveted commodity , and not even the younger generation is prepared to risk being banished for bad behavior .
according to wenzel , germany 's new outdoor types are a conscientious bunch .
they have consumer clout , believe in buying organic , and - reflecting the trend to domestic tourism - they 're more likely to go on an eco-friendly holiday to germany 's baltic coast than a package tour to thailand .
the lohas " in advertising , there 's a lot of talk of what 's called lohas - lifestyle of health and sustainability , " he explained .
" we predict that in future , more and more germans will be living in a way that 's environmentally responsible - but enjoying themselves in the process .
the healthy hedonists are idealistic and political correct , but they 're also pleasure-seeking . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but while the healthy hedonists draw spiritual satisfaction from watching their carrots grow , the old-school allotment residents appreciate their leafy retreats for more prosaic reasons .

they head out to their private allotments to tend to their vegetables .
so when did that most suburban of activities become so hip ? undeterred by the bracing easterly wind , dirk ziegler is deadheading his geraniums .
" it 's good to get outside at the weekend , " exclaims the 35-year-old father-of-two as he surveys his modest kingdom .
raising his voice above the roar of a passing train , he shrugs off the obvious downsides of the urban garden .
" having an allotment in the center of town is perfect because it 's so easy to reach - and it 's great for the kids to have somewhere to play , " he says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dirk is part of a wider movement of 30-somethings who 've tired of late nights in smoky clubs and want to get back to nature . three years ago , he and his girlfriend leased a garden allotment in prenzlauer berg - a district in central berlin more commonly associated with fashionable bars and boutiques - and they 've never looked back .
" allotments have become trendy " , confirmed jürgen hurt , president of the berlin association for gardeners in an interview with the daily berliner zeitung .
according to a study conducted by the association , the average age of tenants has dropped from 56 to 46 in the last six years .
the " schrebergarten " -lrb- allotment -rrb- phenomenon , born a century ago , was named after the leipzig-based doctor daniel schreber - a staunch believer in exercise in the great outdoors for pasty-faced city children .
plots of land leased from the state became increasingly popular with tenants seeking gardens for their young , plus an opportunity to stock up their pantries with home-grown garden produce .
meet the weekend warriors today , pedestrians on the busy bornholmer bridge , which earned its place in history as the first border-crossing to be opened to east germans back in 1989 , can look down on the " garden colony " where dirk and his family now spend most of their free time .
flanked by railway lines and shopping malls , it 's a haven of tranquillity in an otherwise bleak urban landscape .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rosy-cheeked garden gnomes preside over well-kept lawns , framed by rows of flourishing hollyhocks and crispy-looking lettuces .
if it were n't for the not-so-distant hum of traffic , it would be a rural idyll .
but what 's most striking is that few of the residents are lounging around with a beer and the sports section of the sunday paper - they 're all getting their hands dirty .
" i put in at least ten hours of work a week , " says dirk , who 's been digging in his flower-bed all day .
his neighbor is busy putting up a trellis , while across the way , mrs sturmer is fixing her roof .
she 's part of the colony 's elder generation , who can remember a time when allotments were about survival rather than leisure .
" my allotment has been in the family for three generations , " she explained .
" my grandfather leased it during the recession in the 1920s , when people in the city really needed their allotments .
back then , it was a necessity , because if you did n't grow your own vegetables , you did n't have any . "
dig it ?
but times have changed , and these days , growing your own spinach is a lifestyle choice .
herbaceous borders are hipper than prada pumps .
in the uk , the times has even dubbed gardening " the new sex . "
so if you think weeding , digging and planting is for frustrated housewives , think again .
bildunterschrift : for just a few hundred euros a year , some 4 million germans enjoy the pastoral perks of an allotment garden , and waiting lists are long .
experts say this love affair with all things horticultural is a sign of the times .
" allotments used to be seen as conventional and boring , but not anymore , " said trend researcher eike wenzel .
it 's not even that vacations are a luxury few can afford when 5 million germans are unemployed .
" it does n't actually have anything to do with the country 's financial difficulties , " he said .
" it 's more about getting back to nature - the satisfaction of doing things yourself and using your hands . "
he would even go so far as to say it reflects a slow shift in values .
" it ties in with a return to tradition and a desire for a slower pace of life .
the 1990s were a very stormy decade of accelerated technology , modernization and digitalization , " he explained .
" but people now feel that they 've been disappointed by these developments and what they really want is a grounded family life and old-fashioned values .
bonding with nature is a key factor in that shift . "
urban refugees bildunterschrift : most of berlin 's 840 garden colonies are made up of 20 to 100 plots , each roughly 300 meters square , overseen by a highly authoritative residents ' association .
its job is to make sure everyone sticks to the rules , which range from keeping the noise down between midday and 3 p.m. to making sure trees never grow beyond a prescribed height and using at least one third of the garden as a vegetable patch .
" you have to fit in , and if you do n't like it , you should n't bother coming here , " says frau sturmer in no uncertain terms .
" young families have to adjust to the rules like everyone else . "
and most of them do .
an allotment garden is a coveted commodity , and not even the younger generation is prepared to risk being banished for bad behavior .
according to wenzel , germany 's new outdoor types are a conscientious bunch .
they have consumer clout , believe in buying organic , and - reflecting the trend to domestic tourism - they 're more likely to go on an eco-friendly holiday to germany 's baltic coast than a package tour to thailand .
the lohas " in advertising , there 's a lot of talk of what 's called lohas - lifestyle of health and sustainability , " he explained .
" we predict that in future , more and more germans will be living in a way that 's environmentally responsible - but enjoying themselves in the process .
the healthy hedonists are idealistic and political correct , but they 're also pleasure-seeking . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but while the healthy hedonists draw spiritual satisfaction from watching their carrots grow , the old-school allotment residents appreciate their leafy retreats for more prosaic reasons .

everyone was pleased with bringing home the three points but the porous defense is turning into a serious problem . for the 48,000 fans at the sold out waldstadion in frankfurt , germany 's opening match victory against australia was largely entertaining , if not at times nerve-wracking .
a soccer coach would have pulled out his or her hair , wondering how a team can suffer such lapses of concentration . " winning the opening match and the three points are very important , " said germany coach jürgen klinsmann , " but we also know some things did n't work optimally . " namely , giving up two first-half equalizers to the socceroos and then also a goal in stoppage time , but fortunately at that point , klinsmann 's squad had a two-goal advantage . six minutes of excitement bildunterschrift : australia 's josip skoko -lrb- yellow -rrb- squeezes the ball under germany 's jumping wall the first 15 minutes of the match were uneventful with both sides walking on pins and needles , playing stiffly .
kevin kuranyi 's goal in the 17th minute started what would be a toe-to-toe punchout in the following six minutes . before the fans could sit back down after celebrating the newly-acquired striker by schalke , germany 's central defender robert huth mugged john aloisi unnecessarily outside the german penalty box .
josip skoko took the free-kick and instead of lifting the ball , he kept it on the ground .
that was unfortunate because the wall jumped and watched the leather roll under their feet .
after 19 minutes , the score stood 1-1 . germany roared right back , with per mertesacker the benefactor of some sloppy defending by the australian defense and scored in the 23rd minute .
it was his first goal with the national squad , leaving many of the fans rubbing their eyes as their squad decided that attacking soccer , hardly what germany has been known for the past decade and a half , would bring success . since taking over last july , jürgen klinsmann promised more offense from the german team and he has held true to his promise .
at a cost , namely a porous defense . amateurish defense bildunterschrift : germany 's michael ballack -lrb- right -rrb- converts a penalty kick to put his side ahead 3-2 eight minutes after resecuring the lead , some very sharp passing and flat-footed defending allowed australia to get a second equalizer .
this time john aloisi beat his defender easily to streak into the penalty box and beat kahn .
the remainder of the second half , germany played insecurely and receiving a few catcalls when the referee carlos amarilla blew his whistle to end the first half . coming out of the locker room , germany were rejuvenated and put australia 's back against the wall .
it paid off in the 60th minute when arne friedrich , one of germany 's best players in the match , drew a penalty .
team captain michael ballack stepped and calmly sunk the spot kick and germany led 3-2 . the goal broke the australian resistance as the teams who both had expended much energy in the first hour , slowed the pace down .
the game started getting sloppy as passes frequently landed on an opponent 's foot or out of bounds . podolski secures victory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john aloisi scores australia 's second equalizer , getting past defender robert huth to do so lukas podolski was less affected by the fast pace .
in the 88th minute , he scored what would turn out to be the gamewinning goal after a strong run by ballack .
the two-goal lead was a relief to the sell-out crowd who could finally start singing after a night filled more with wonderment as the mostly unknown socceroos put world soccer power germany through the paces .
but it was almost not enough . in stoppage time , the german backline fell asleep as it did against russia one week ago .
aloisi again could break free and scored as the defenders wondered how he got behind them . the fans then had to wait only another 30 seconds before amarilla blew the final whistle and they could breathe a collective sigh of relief . klinsmann has promised excitement and that is what they got . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de argentina dominates tunisia in opener argentina played a superior game against tunisia , winning 2-1 with the help of a penalty kick and a nicely-played second goal .

a soccer coach would have pulled out his or her hair , wondering how a team can suffer such lapses of concentration . " winning the opening match and the three points are very important , " said germany coach jürgen klinsmann , " but we also know some things did n't work optimally . " namely , giving up two first-half equalizers to the socceroos and then also a goal in stoppage time , but fortunately at that point , klinsmann 's squad had a two-goal advantage . six minutes of excitement bildunterschrift : australia 's josip skoko -lrb- yellow -rrb- squeezes the ball under germany 's jumping wall the first 15 minutes of the match were uneventful with both sides walking on pins and needles , playing stiffly .
kevin kuranyi 's goal in the 17th minute started what would be a toe-to-toe punchout in the following six minutes . before the fans could sit back down after celebrating the newly-acquired striker by schalke , germany 's central defender robert huth mugged john aloisi unnecessarily outside the german penalty box .
josip skoko took the free-kick and instead of lifting the ball , he kept it on the ground .
that was unfortunate because the wall jumped and watched the leather roll under their feet .
after 19 minutes , the score stood 1-1 . germany roared right back , with per mertesacker the benefactor of some sloppy defending by the australian defense and scored in the 23rd minute .
it was his first goal with the national squad , leaving many of the fans rubbing their eyes as their squad decided that attacking soccer , hardly what germany has been known for the past decade and a half , would bring success . since taking over last july , jürgen klinsmann promised more offense from the german team and he has held true to his promise .
at a cost , namely a porous defense . amateurish defense bildunterschrift : germany 's michael ballack -lrb- right -rrb- converts a penalty kick to put his side ahead 3-2 eight minutes after resecuring the lead , some very sharp passing and flat-footed defending allowed australia to get a second equalizer .
this time john aloisi beat his defender easily to streak into the penalty box and beat kahn .
the remainder of the second half , germany played insecurely and receiving a few catcalls when the referee carlos amarilla blew his whistle to end the first half . coming out of the locker room , germany were rejuvenated and put australia 's back against the wall .
it paid off in the 60th minute when arne friedrich , one of germany 's best players in the match , drew a penalty .
team captain michael ballack stepped and calmly sunk the spot kick and germany led 3-2 . the goal broke the australian resistance as the teams who both had expended much energy in the first hour , slowed the pace down .
the game started getting sloppy as passes frequently landed on an opponent 's foot or out of bounds . podolski secures victory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john aloisi scores australia 's second equalizer , getting past defender robert huth to do so lukas podolski was less affected by the fast pace .
in the 88th minute , he scored what would turn out to be the gamewinning goal after a strong run by ballack .
the two-goal lead was a relief to the sell-out crowd who could finally start singing after a night filled more with wonderment as the mostly unknown socceroos put world soccer power germany through the paces .
but it was almost not enough . in stoppage time , the german backline fell asleep as it did against russia one week ago .
aloisi again could break free and scored as the defenders wondered how he got behind them . the fans then had to wait only another 30 seconds before amarilla blew the final whistle and they could breathe a collective sigh of relief . klinsmann has promised excitement and that is what they got . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de argentina dominates tunisia in opener argentina played a superior game against tunisia , winning 2-1 with the help of a penalty kick and a nicely-played second goal .

germany kick-off their confederations cup campaign on wednesday with high hopes of lifting the cup on june 29 .
but as dw-world 's blog reporter nick amies writes , a defensive flaw may end the dream before the final . the confederations cup begins on wednesday and , if the majority of pundits can be trusted in their evaluation , a south american team will be collecting the spoils on june 29 , therefore breaking the cycle of the trophy being retained by the holding federation . this line of thinking has already ruled out a german or greek victory , as the hosts and the european champions are the only ones who can take over from france , the current holders from uefa . this is doing a major disservice to the europeans even before a ball has been kicked in anger .
while greece may actually turn out to be the flash-in-the-pan that many expect , for germany it seems especially harsh . to write off the chances of jürgen klinsmann 's young eagles without even a badly sung national anthem passing their lips is a more of an insult than a disservice .
no doubt the tired argument of their inability to beat any of the top sides in the world in the last five years is being used to support the opinion that germany will fail to win the confederations cup . this , in my opinion , is just laziness ; an excuse to avoid delving deeper into the machinations of the german team and asking why they may not have what it takes to deliver on home soil this month . underlying flaws bildunterschrift : while it is bad form to give the germans no chance at all before the tournament begins , it is entirely likely that the issues that many analysts avoid in their rush to praise the brazilians and argentineans may be the undoing of this undoubtedly talented but flawed german team . ironically , the germans suffer from the same problem that plagues the world champions at times - they have problems defending . this is a relatively new malaise for germany , a team which has been world famous for decades for stinginess on the international stage .
it used to be the germans couldn ’ t score .
but when they did , they had the resources to shut up shop and defend the 1-0 lead through to victory . the current problem became evident under rudi völler and , while the german defense is tighter since klinsmann took the helm , germany 's improving offensive play distracts from a continuing problem left over from the previous era . exciting attackers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann finds himself with one problem most teams would dream to have : an excess of exciting , attacking players .

for those holding their sides , wait until you see the argentinean midfield breaking and bearing down on thorsten frings and then see who ’ s laughing . lacking an experienced protector germany have a potentially majestic back four in andreas hinkel , per mertesacker , robert huth and thomas hitzlsperger but this new generation lack the classic holding midfielder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense starts in front of the defenders and frings is not disciplined enough to play the role that franz beckenbauer and , to a lesser degree , hamann have done to such effect if the germans play 4-4-2 .

germany kick-off their confederations cup campaign on wednesday with high hopes of lifting the cup on june 29 .
but as dw-world 's blog reporter nick amies writes , a defensive flaw may end the dream before the final . the confederations cup begins on wednesday and , if the majority of pundits can be trusted in their evaluation , a south american team will be collecting the spoils on june 29 , therefore breaking the cycle of the trophy being retained by the holding federation . this line of thinking has already ruled out a german or greek victory , as the hosts and the european champions are the only ones who can take over from france , the current holders from uefa . this is doing a major disservice to the europeans even before a ball has been kicked in anger .
while greece may actually turn out to be the flash-in-the-pan that many expect , for germany it seems especially harsh . to write off the chances of jürgen klinsmann 's young eagles without even a badly sung national anthem passing their lips is a more of an insult than a disservice .
no doubt the tired argument of their inability to beat any of the top sides in the world in the last five years is being used to support the opinion that germany will fail to win the confederations cup . this , in my opinion , is just laziness ; an excuse to avoid delving deeper into the machinations of the german team and asking why they may not have what it takes to deliver on home soil this month . underlying flaws bildunterschrift : while it is bad form to give the germans no chance at all before the tournament begins , it is entirely likely that the issues that many analysts avoid in their rush to praise the brazilians and argentineans may be the undoing of this undoubtedly talented but flawed german team . ironically , the germans suffer from the same problem that plagues the world champions at times - they have problems defending . this is a relatively new malaise for germany , a team which has been world famous for decades for stinginess on the international stage .
it used to be the germans couldn ’ t score .
but when they did , they had the resources to shut up shop and defend the 1-0 lead through to victory . the current problem became evident under rudi völler and , while the german defense is tighter since klinsmann took the helm , germany 's improving offensive play distracts from a continuing problem left over from the previous era . exciting attackers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann finds himself with one problem most teams would dream to have : an excess of exciting , attacking players .

for those holding their sides , wait until you see the argentinean midfield breaking and bearing down on thorsten frings and then see who ’ s laughing . lacking an experienced protector germany have a potentially majestic back four in andreas hinkel , per mertesacker , robert huth and thomas hitzlsperger but this new generation lack the classic holding midfielder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense starts in front of the defenders and frings is not disciplined enough to play the role that franz beckenbauer and , to a lesser degree , hamann have done to such effect if the germans play 4-4-2 .

german organizers hope they like what they see . so far , more than 500,000 tickets have been sold to the confederations cup tournament , which kicks off wednesday night when argentina plays tunisia in cologne . most of the fans will be locals , eager to get a measure of how organizers , as well as their team , are coming along ahead of the world cup next summer .
both organizers and political officials are hoping not to disappoint . the two-week tournament will be televised in 170 countries across the world , and organizers are hoping the 600,000-ticket barrier is reached some time during the tournament .
top matches like argentina and germany on june 21 and greece vs. brazil in leipzig on june 16 are already sold out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece , the surprise 2004 european champions , will be out to prove their victory was no fluke " the tournament is much more than a dress rehearsal for next year 's world cup , " fifa president joseph blatter told journalists .
" it 's a prestigious international tournament in its own right : you just have to cast an eye over the starting field . " win the confed cup , win the world cup hosts germany will be joined by mexico , japan , brazil , argentina , greece , australia and tunisia , the top teams from the world 's soccer federations .
though several teams are n't arriving with their top players - who are either injured or , like brazilian star ronaldo , " taking a rest " - coaches say each team is taking the tournament seriously .
german coach jürgen klinsmann -lrb- photo -rrb- said the tournament will be crucial to seeing how his young squad measures up against top competition , one year before it plays the world cup at home .
soccer officials have promised each player a 60,000 euro -lrb- $ 72,000 -rrb- bonus if they hoist the trophy on june 29 .
the reason ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen klinsmann wants nothing short of victory " he who wants to win the world cup , should also win the confederations cup , " said german soccer association president theo zwanziger . security also getting a test run the same philosophy might apply to german security officials .
one year before welcoming more than a million soccer fans into the country , germany 's police are eager to show the world that they can put on a peaceful tournament . the national information and cooperation center , a new body created expressly to coordinate policing activities for the 2006 tournament , will get a test run during the confederations cup .
the center will provide situation reports culled from information coming in from germany 's federal and 16 state police forces .
" we wo n't have the really big groups of -lrb- foreign -rrb- fans that we expect for the world cup , " said organizing committee vice-president wolfgang niersbach .
" but otherwise the measures in respect of security are the same … there will be an external security ring right around the stadium . " too many tournaments the heightened security measures are at the same time an acknowledgement of how far the confed cup has come since its humble beginnings as an invitation-only tournament of four teams in saudi arabia in 1992 .
but not all are happy about its progress . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ronaldo will be resting , not playing , this time around the inclusion of yet another tournament in a playing schedule that can be gruelling for top-flight players has reaped criticism from some team managers .
four mexican players , registered to play for the national team in the tournament , might not show up because of playing commitments to their clubs .
fifa has threatened to take action . " the players do n't have enough vacation , " said karl-heinz rummenigge , a german soccer legend and chairman of bundesliga champions fc bayern munich , adding that the tournament should be phased out . organizers , of course , do n't want to hear such talk now .
everyone from the local fan to the kaiser himself , world cup 2006 organizing committee chief franz beckenbauer , is singing the confed cup 's praises - and hoping the home country -lrb- and team -rrb- make a strong showing .
" i 'm looking forward to the tournament , " said beckenbauer .

german organizers hope they like what they see . so far , more than 500,000 tickets have been sold to the confederations cup tournament , which kicks off wednesday night when argentina plays tunisia in cologne . most of the fans will be locals , eager to get a measure of how organizers , as well as their team , are coming along ahead of the world cup next summer .
both organizers and political officials are hoping not to disappoint . the two-week tournament will be televised in 170 countries across the world , and organizers are hoping the 600,000-ticket barrier is reached some time during the tournament .
top matches like argentina and germany on june 21 and greece vs. brazil in leipzig on june 16 are already sold out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece , the surprise 2004 european champions , will be out to prove their victory was no fluke " the tournament is much more than a dress rehearsal for next year 's world cup , " fifa president joseph blatter told journalists .
" it 's a prestigious international tournament in its own right : you just have to cast an eye over the starting field . " win the confed cup , win the world cup hosts germany will be joined by mexico , japan , brazil , argentina , greece , australia and tunisia , the top teams from the world 's soccer federations .
though several teams are n't arriving with their top players - who are either injured or , like brazilian star ronaldo , " taking a rest " - coaches say each team is taking the tournament seriously .
german coach jürgen klinsmann -lrb- photo -rrb- said the tournament will be crucial to seeing how his young squad measures up against top competition , one year before it plays the world cup at home .
soccer officials have promised each player a 60,000 euro -lrb- $ 72,000 -rrb- bonus if they hoist the trophy on june 29 .
the reason ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen klinsmann wants nothing short of victory " he who wants to win the world cup , should also win the confederations cup , " said german soccer association president theo zwanziger . security also getting a test run the same philosophy might apply to german security officials .
one year before welcoming more than a million soccer fans into the country , germany 's police are eager to show the world that they can put on a peaceful tournament . the national information and cooperation center , a new body created expressly to coordinate policing activities for the 2006 tournament , will get a test run during the confederations cup .
the center will provide situation reports culled from information coming in from germany 's federal and 16 state police forces .
" we wo n't have the really big groups of -lrb- foreign -rrb- fans that we expect for the world cup , " said organizing committee vice-president wolfgang niersbach .
" but otherwise the measures in respect of security are the same … there will be an external security ring right around the stadium . " too many tournaments the heightened security measures are at the same time an acknowledgement of how far the confed cup has come since its humble beginnings as an invitation-only tournament of four teams in saudi arabia in 1992 .
but not all are happy about its progress . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ronaldo will be resting , not playing , this time around the inclusion of yet another tournament in a playing schedule that can be gruelling for top-flight players has reaped criticism from some team managers .
four mexican players , registered to play for the national team in the tournament , might not show up because of playing commitments to their clubs .
fifa has threatened to take action . " the players do n't have enough vacation , " said karl-heinz rummenigge , a german soccer legend and chairman of bundesliga champions fc bayern munich , adding that the tournament should be phased out . organizers , of course , do n't want to hear such talk now .
everyone from the local fan to the kaiser himself , world cup 2006 organizing committee chief franz beckenbauer , is singing the confed cup 's praises - and hoping the home country -lrb- and team -rrb- make a strong showing .
" i 'm looking forward to the tournament , " said beckenbauer .
" and if people say afterwards we were good hosts , i 'll be very satisfied .

france 's chirac has categorically ruled out any reduction in the subsidies , which his country 's farmers rely on . the european constitution the eu leaders will also debate what to do about the bloc constitution in the wake of french and dutch rejection of the document in may 29 and june 1 referendums .

germany faces off against australia in the second match .

coach jose pekerman still has javier saviola , juan roman riquelme , javier zanetti , and defender gabriel heinze to pick from , all of whom will figure prominently in the gauchos ' attacking style .
high off of a 3-1 spanking of brazil in the world cup qualifying rounds that secured them a spot in the 2006 world cup , argentina comes into the confederations cup tournament playing well enough to earn its " favorite " status . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : silva has been a serious threat ever since tunisia one the africa cup tunisia 's star player is its coach , the frenchman roger lemerre , who won the european championship with france in 2000 , and the confederations cup a year later .
lemerre has the tunisians playing tight and disciplined in the back , waiting for the chance to counter .
when they do , it 's usually over the wings - a mirror image of argentina 's style - and to francileude dos santos silva .
the native brazilian , who took tunisian citizenship just before the africa cup last year , became the tournament 's shooting star .
now , he 's ready to make problems for the big names in the confederations cup .
" on paper , we have no chance against germany and argentina , " said lemerre .
" but you never know . " possible lineup : tunisia - boumnijel - trabelsi , jaidi , abdi , clayton - ghodhbane , nafti , ben saada , mnari - santos , jaziri argentina - leo franco - coloccini , milito , heinze - j. zanetti , cambiasso , bernardi , sorin - riquelme - tevez , saviola germany - australia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kevin kuranyi will have to show he 's up to shouldering the goal-scoring burden germany comes into the tournament with a number of questions : can the strikers score goals ?
will the young defense stand up against major international competition ?
as a matter of fact , will the rest of the team stand up to major international competition ?
because it is hosting the world cup next year , germany has been spared the intensity and pressure of qualification .
as a result , coach jürgen klinsmann has been allowed to juggle around all sorts of lineup changes in the team 's friendly matches .
after this tournament , that should end .
tonight 's match against australia will be a chance for the strikers , most likely kevin kuranyi and gerald asamoah , to show their mettle in klinsmann 's offense-oriented playing style .
the german defense , who all hover around the age of 22 , will also have to prove itself - klinsmann ended practice this week with extra work for the defenders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : australia has a chance to surprise others at the tournament , but only a small one .
the definite underdog in this match-up , australia , is nevertheless a team with big dreams .
their past confed cup performances give them good reason to hope .
the team finished second in riyadh in 1997 , playing their way into the final before getting walloped by brazil .
in 2001 , in south korea and japan , the team beat brazil 1-0 to win third place and get their revenge .
coach frank farina remains confident : " we believe in ourselves , " he told reporters the other day .
his side is arguably one of the better ones in recent years , even without liverpool striker harry kewell , who is injured .
midfielders tim cahill , brett merton and striker mark viduka all play in the english premiership .
cahill will be responsible for directing the " socceroos " attack , and will look to take advantage of germany 's maligned and relatively slow defense .
the everton midfielder also remains a goal-scoring threat , notching 12 for his club as it marched to a champion 's league qualifying spot and seven for his country in as many appearances .
captian craig moore will anchor the defense . possible lineup : germany - kahn - b. schneider , a. friedrich , mertesacker , hitzlsperger - frings - deisler , schweinsteiger - ballack - kuranyi , podolski australia - schwarzer - neill , popovic , moore , muscat - milicevic - chipperfield , skoko , emerton - cahill - viduka dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the mini-world cup kicks off hundreds of thousands of fans will follow the fortunes of eight teams at five stadiums across germany over the next two weeks .

germany kick-off their confederations cup campaign on wednesday with high hopes of lifting the cup on june 29 .

they head out to their private allotments to tend to their vegetables .
so when did that most suburban of activities become so hip ? undeterred by the bracing easterly wind , dirk ziegler is deadheading his geraniums .
" it 's good to get outside at the weekend , " exclaims the 35-year-old father-of-two as he surveys his modest kingdom .
raising his voice above the roar of a passing train , he shrugs off the obvious downsides of the urban garden .
" having an allotment in the center of town is perfect because it 's so easy to reach - and it 's great for the kids to have somewhere to play , " he says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dirk is part of a wider movement of 30-somethings who 've tired of late nights in smoky clubs and want to get back to nature . three years ago , he and his girlfriend leased a garden allotment in prenzlauer berg - a district in central berlin more commonly associated with fashionable bars and boutiques - and they 've never looked back .
" allotments have become trendy " , confirmed jürgen hurt , president of the berlin association for gardeners in an interview with the daily berliner zeitung .
according to a study conducted by the association , the average age of tenants has dropped from 56 to 46 in the last six years .
the " schrebergarten " -lrb- allotment -rrb- phenomenon , born a century ago , was named after the leipzig-based doctor daniel schreber - a staunch believer in exercise in the great outdoors for pasty-faced city children .
plots of land leased from the state became increasingly popular with tenants seeking gardens for their young , plus an opportunity to stock up their pantries with home-grown garden produce .
meet the weekend warriors today , pedestrians on the busy bornholmer bridge , which earned its place in history as the first border-crossing to be opened to east germans back in 1989 , can look down on the " garden colony " where dirk and his family now spend most of their free time .
flanked by railway lines and shopping malls , it 's a haven of tranquillity in an otherwise bleak urban landscape .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rosy-cheeked garden gnomes preside over well-kept lawns , framed by rows of flourishing hollyhocks and crispy-looking lettuces .
if it were n't for the not-so-distant hum of traffic , it would be a rural idyll .
but what 's most striking is that few of the residents are lounging around with a beer and the sports section of the sunday paper - they 're all getting their hands dirty .
" i put in at least ten hours of work a week , " says dirk , who 's been digging in his flower-bed all day .
his neighbor is busy putting up a trellis , while across the way , mrs sturmer is fixing her roof .
she 's part of the colony 's elder generation , who can remember a time when allotments were about survival rather than leisure .
" my allotment has been in the family for three generations , " she explained .
" my grandfather leased it during the recession in the 1920s , when people in the city really needed their allotments .
back then , it was a necessity , because if you did n't grow your own vegetables , you did n't have any . "
dig it ?
but times have changed , and these days , growing your own spinach is a lifestyle choice .
herbaceous borders are hipper than prada pumps .
in the uk , the times has even dubbed gardening " the new sex . "
so if you think weeding , digging and planting is for frustrated housewives , think again .
bildunterschrift : for just a few hundred euros a year , some 4 million germans enjoy the pastoral perks of an allotment garden , and waiting lists are long .
experts say this love affair with all things horticultural is a sign of the times .
" allotments used to be seen as conventional and boring , but not anymore , " said trend researcher eike wenzel .
it 's not even that vacations are a luxury few can afford when 5 million germans are unemployed .
" it does n't actually have anything to do with the country 's financial difficulties , " he said .
" it 's more about getting back to nature - the satisfaction of doing things yourself and using your hands . "
he would even go so far as to say it reflects a slow shift in values .
" it ties in with a return to tradition and a desire for a slower pace of life .
the 1990s were a very stormy decade of accelerated technology , modernization and digitalization , " he explained .
" but people now feel that they 've been disappointed by these developments and what they really want is a grounded family life and old-fashioned values .
bonding with nature is a key factor in that shift . "

its job is to make sure everyone sticks to the rules , which range from keeping the noise down between midday and 3 p.m. to making sure trees never grow beyond a prescribed height and using at least one third of the garden as a vegetable patch .
" you have to fit in , and if you do n't like it , you should n't bother coming here , " says frau sturmer in no uncertain terms .
" young families have to adjust to the rules like everyone else . "
and most of them do .
an allotment garden is a coveted commodity , and not even the younger generation is prepared to risk being banished for bad behavior .
according to wenzel , germany 's new outdoor types are a conscientious bunch .
they have consumer clout , believe in buying organic , and - reflecting the trend to domestic tourism - they 're more likely to go on an eco-friendly holiday to germany 's baltic coast than a package tour to thailand .

" we predict that in future , more and more germans will be living in a way that 's environmentally responsible - but enjoying themselves in the process .
the healthy hedonists are idealistic and political correct , but they 're also pleasure-seeking . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but while the healthy hedonists draw spiritual satisfaction from watching their carrots grow , the old-school allotment residents appreciate their leafy retreats for more prosaic reasons .

they head out to their private allotments to tend to their vegetables .
so when did that most suburban of activities become so hip ? undeterred by the bracing easterly wind , dirk ziegler is deadheading his geraniums .
" it 's good to get outside at the weekend , " exclaims the 35-year-old father-of-two as he surveys his modest kingdom .
raising his voice above the roar of a passing train , he shrugs off the obvious downsides of the urban garden .
" having an allotment in the center of town is perfect because it 's so easy to reach - and it 's great for the kids to have somewhere to play , " he says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dirk is part of a wider movement of 30-somethings who 've tired of late nights in smoky clubs and want to get back to nature . three years ago , he and his girlfriend leased a garden allotment in prenzlauer berg - a district in central berlin more commonly associated with fashionable bars and boutiques - and they 've never looked back .
" allotments have become trendy " , confirmed jürgen hurt , president of the berlin association for gardeners in an interview with the daily berliner zeitung .
according to a study conducted by the association , the average age of tenants has dropped from 56 to 46 in the last six years .
the " schrebergarten " -lrb- allotment -rrb- phenomenon , born a century ago , was named after the leipzig-based doctor daniel schreber - a staunch believer in exercise in the great outdoors for pasty-faced city children .
plots of land leased from the state became increasingly popular with tenants seeking gardens for their young , plus an opportunity to stock up their pantries with home-grown garden produce .
meet the weekend warriors today , pedestrians on the busy bornholmer bridge , which earned its place in history as the first border-crossing to be opened to east germans back in 1989 , can look down on the " garden colony " where dirk and his family now spend most of their free time .
flanked by railway lines and shopping malls , it 's a haven of tranquillity in an otherwise bleak urban landscape .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rosy-cheeked garden gnomes preside over well-kept lawns , framed by rows of flourishing hollyhocks and crispy-looking lettuces .
if it were n't for the not-so-distant hum of traffic , it would be a rural idyll .
but what 's most striking is that few of the residents are lounging around with a beer and the sports section of the sunday paper - they 're all getting their hands dirty .
" i put in at least ten hours of work a week , " says dirk , who 's been digging in his flower-bed all day .
his neighbor is busy putting up a trellis , while across the way , mrs sturmer is fixing her roof .
she 's part of the colony 's elder generation , who can remember a time when allotments were about survival rather than leisure .
" my allotment has been in the family for three generations , " she explained .
" my grandfather leased it during the recession in the 1920s , when people in the city really needed their allotments .
back then , it was a necessity , because if you did n't grow your own vegetables , you did n't have any . "
dig it ?
but times have changed , and these days , growing your own spinach is a lifestyle choice .
herbaceous borders are hipper than prada pumps .
in the uk , the times has even dubbed gardening " the new sex . "
so if you think weeding , digging and planting is for frustrated housewives , think again .
bildunterschrift : for just a few hundred euros a year , some 4 million germans enjoy the pastoral perks of an allotment garden , and waiting lists are long .
experts say this love affair with all things horticultural is a sign of the times .
" allotments used to be seen as conventional and boring , but not anymore , " said trend researcher eike wenzel .
it 's not even that vacations are a luxury few can afford when 5 million germans are unemployed .
" it does n't actually have anything to do with the country 's financial difficulties , " he said .
" it 's more about getting back to nature - the satisfaction of doing things yourself and using your hands . "
he would even go so far as to say it reflects a slow shift in values .
" it ties in with a return to tradition and a desire for a slower pace of life .
the 1990s were a very stormy decade of accelerated technology , modernization and digitalization , " he explained .
" but people now feel that they 've been disappointed by these developments and what they really want is a grounded family life and old-fashioned values .
bonding with nature is a key factor in that shift . "
urban refugees bildunterschrift : most of berlin 's 840 garden colonies are made up of 20 to 100 plots , each roughly 300 meters square , overseen by a highly authoritative residents ' association .
its job is to make sure everyone sticks to the rules , which range from keeping the noise down between midday and 3 p.m. to making sure trees never grow beyond a prescribed height and using at least one third of the garden as a vegetable patch .
" you have to fit in , and if you do n't like it , you should n't bother coming here , " says frau sturmer in no uncertain terms .
" young families have to adjust to the rules like everyone else . "
and most of them do .
an allotment garden is a coveted commodity , and not even the younger generation is prepared to risk being banished for bad behavior .
according to wenzel , germany 's new outdoor types are a conscientious bunch .
they have consumer clout , believe in buying organic , and - reflecting the trend to domestic tourism - they 're more likely to go on an eco-friendly holiday to germany 's baltic coast than a package tour to thailand .
the lohas " in advertising , there 's a lot of talk of what 's called lohas - lifestyle of health and sustainability , " he explained .
" we predict that in future , more and more germans will be living in a way that 's environmentally responsible - but enjoying themselves in the process .
the healthy hedonists are idealistic and political correct , but they 're also pleasure-seeking . "

germany kick-off their confederations cup campaign on wednesday with high hopes of lifting the cup on june 29 .
but as dw-world 's blog reporter nick amies writes , a defensive flaw may end the dream before the final . the confederations cup begins on wednesday and , if the majority of pundits can be trusted in their evaluation , a south american team will be collecting the spoils on june 29 , therefore breaking the cycle of the trophy being retained by the holding federation . this line of thinking has already ruled out a german or greek victory , as the hosts and the european champions are the only ones who can take over from france , the current holders from uefa . this is doing a major disservice to the europeans even before a ball has been kicked in anger .
while greece may actually turn out to be the flash-in-the-pan that many expect , for germany it seems especially harsh . to write off the chances of jürgen klinsmann 's young eagles without even a badly sung national anthem passing their lips is a more of an insult than a disservice .
no doubt the tired argument of their inability to beat any of the top sides in the world in the last five years is being used to support the opinion that germany will fail to win the confederations cup . this , in my opinion , is just laziness ; an excuse to avoid delving deeper into the machinations of the german team and asking why they may not have what it takes to deliver on home soil this month . underlying flaws bildunterschrift : while it is bad form to give the germans no chance at all before the tournament begins , it is entirely likely that the issues that many analysts avoid in their rush to praise the brazilians and argentineans may be the undoing of this undoubtedly talented but flawed german team . ironically , the germans suffer from the same problem that plagues the world champions at times - they have problems defending . this is a relatively new malaise for germany , a team which has been world famous for decades for stinginess on the international stage .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 15.06.2005 invasion of the healthy hedonists großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : residents keep their eyes peeled for anyone breaking the rules young people are no longer spending their sundays nursing hangovers in front of the tv .
they head out to their private allotments to tend to their vegetables .
so when did that most suburban of activities become so hip ? undeterred by the bracing easterly wind , dirk ziegler is deadheading his geraniums .
" it 's good to get outside at the weekend , " exclaims the 35-year-old father-of-two as he surveys his modest kingdom .
raising his voice above the roar of a passing train , he shrugs off the obvious downsides of the urban garden .
" having an allotment in the center of town is perfect because it 's so easy to reach - and it 's great for the kids to have somewhere to play , " he says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dirk is part of a wider movement of 30-somethings who 've tired of late nights in smoky clubs and want to get back to nature . three years ago , he and his girlfriend leased a garden allotment in prenzlauer berg - a district in central berlin more commonly associated with fashionable bars and boutiques - and they 've never looked back .
" allotments have become trendy " , confirmed jürgen hurt , president of the berlin association for gardeners in an interview with the daily berliner zeitung .
according to a study conducted by the association , the average age of tenants has dropped from 56 to 46 in the last six years .
the " schrebergarten " -lrb- allotment -rrb- phenomenon , born a century ago , was named after the leipzig-based doctor daniel schreber - a staunch believer in exercise in the great outdoors for pasty-faced city children .
plots of land leased from the state became increasingly popular with tenants seeking gardens for their young , plus an opportunity to stock up their pantries with home-grown garden produce .
meet the weekend warriors today , pedestrians on the busy bornholmer bridge , which earned its place in history as the first border-crossing to be opened to east germans back in 1989 , can look down on the " garden colony " where dirk and his family now spend most of their free time .
flanked by railway lines and shopping malls , it 's a haven of tranquillity in an otherwise bleak urban landscape .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rosy-cheeked garden gnomes preside over well-kept lawns , framed by rows of flourishing hollyhocks and crispy-looking lettuces .
if it were n't for the not-so-distant hum of traffic , it would be a rural idyll .
but what 's most striking is that few of the residents are lounging around with a beer and the sports section of the sunday paper - they 're all getting their hands dirty .
" i put in at least ten hours of work a week , " says dirk , who 's been digging in his flower-bed all day .
his neighbor is busy putting up a trellis , while across the way , mrs sturmer is fixing her roof .
she 's part of the colony 's elder generation , who can remember a time when allotments were about survival rather than leisure .
" my allotment has been in the family for three generations , " she explained .
" my grandfather leased it during the recession in the 1920s , when people in the city really needed their allotments .
back then , it was a necessity , because if you did n't grow your own vegetables , you did n't have any . "
dig it ?
but times have changed , and these days , growing your own spinach is a lifestyle choice .
herbaceous borders are hipper than prada pumps .
in the uk , the times has even dubbed gardening " the new sex . "
so if you think weeding , digging and planting is for frustrated housewives , think again .
bildunterschrift : for just a few hundred euros a year , some 4 million germans enjoy the pastoral perks of an allotment garden , and waiting lists are long .
experts say this love affair with all things horticultural is a sign of the times .
" allotments used to be seen as conventional and boring , but not anymore , " said trend researcher eike wenzel .
it 's not even that vacations are a luxury few can afford when 5 million germans are unemployed .
" it does n't actually have anything to do with the country 's financial difficulties , " he said .
" it 's more about getting back to nature - the satisfaction of doing things yourself and using your hands . "
he would even go so far as to say it reflects a slow shift in values .
" it ties in with a return to tradition and a desire for a slower pace of life .
the 1990s were a very stormy decade of accelerated technology , modernization and digitalization , " he explained .
" but people now feel that they 've been disappointed by these developments and what they really want is a grounded family life and old-fashioned values .
bonding with nature is a key factor in that shift . "
urban refugees bildunterschrift : most of berlin 's 840 garden colonies are made up of 20 to 100 plots , each roughly 300 meters square , overseen by a highly authoritative residents ' association .
its job is to make sure everyone sticks to the rules , which range from keeping the noise down between midday and 3 p.m. to making sure trees never grow beyond a prescribed height and using at least one third of the garden as a vegetable patch .
" you have to fit in , and if you do n't like it , you should n't bother coming here , " says frau sturmer in no uncertain terms .
" young families have to adjust to the rules like everyone else . "
and most of them do .
an allotment garden is a coveted commodity , and not even the younger generation is prepared to risk being banished for bad behavior .
according to wenzel , germany 's new outdoor types are a conscientious bunch .
they have consumer clout , believe in buying organic , and - reflecting the trend to domestic tourism - they 're more likely to go on an eco-friendly holiday to germany 's baltic coast than a package tour to thailand .
the lohas " in advertising , there 's a lot of talk of what 's called lohas - lifestyle of health and sustainability , " he explained .
" we predict that in future , more and more germans will be living in a way that 's environmentally responsible - but enjoying themselves in the process .
the healthy hedonists are idealistic and political correct , but they 're also pleasure-seeking . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but while the healthy hedonists draw spiritual satisfaction from watching their carrots grow , the old-school allotment residents appreciate their leafy retreats for more prosaic reasons .
" tempers can fray when you 're both retired , " admits 65-year-old herr mittelstadt .
" it 's nice to know there 's always somewhere to escape to . " jane paulick , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de conservatism : the new rebellion ?
much has been made lately of the idea that teenage " cool " is giving way to a renaissance of conservatism .

they head out to their private allotments to tend to their vegetables .
so when did that most suburban of activities become so hip ? undeterred by the bracing easterly wind , dirk ziegler is deadheading his geraniums .
" it 's good to get outside at the weekend , " exclaims the 35-year-old father-of-two as he surveys his modest kingdom .
raising his voice above the roar of a passing train , he shrugs off the obvious downsides of the urban garden .
" having an allotment in the center of town is perfect because it 's so easy to reach - and it 's great for the kids to have somewhere to play , " he says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dirk is part of a wider movement of 30-somethings who 've tired of late nights in smoky clubs and want to get back to nature . three years ago , he and his girlfriend leased a garden allotment in prenzlauer berg - a district in central berlin more commonly associated with fashionable bars and boutiques - and they 've never looked back .
" allotments have become trendy " , confirmed jürgen hurt , president of the berlin association for gardeners in an interview with the daily berliner zeitung .
according to a study conducted by the association , the average age of tenants has dropped from 56 to 46 in the last six years .
the " schrebergarten " -lrb- allotment -rrb- phenomenon , born a century ago , was named after the leipzig-based doctor daniel schreber - a staunch believer in exercise in the great outdoors for pasty-faced city children .
plots of land leased from the state became increasingly popular with tenants seeking gardens for their young , plus an opportunity to stock up their pantries with home-grown garden produce .
meet the weekend warriors today , pedestrians on the busy bornholmer bridge , which earned its place in history as the first border-crossing to be opened to east germans back in 1989 , can look down on the " garden colony " where dirk and his family now spend most of their free time .
flanked by railway lines and shopping malls , it 's a haven of tranquillity in an otherwise bleak urban landscape .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rosy-cheeked garden gnomes preside over well-kept lawns , framed by rows of flourishing hollyhocks and crispy-looking lettuces .
if it were n't for the not-so-distant hum of traffic , it would be a rural idyll .
but what 's most striking is that few of the residents are lounging around with a beer and the sports section of the sunday paper - they 're all getting their hands dirty .
" i put in at least ten hours of work a week , " says dirk , who 's been digging in his flower-bed all day .
his neighbor is busy putting up a trellis , while across the way , mrs sturmer is fixing her roof .
she 's part of the colony 's elder generation , who can remember a time when allotments were about survival rather than leisure .
" my allotment has been in the family for three generations , " she explained .
" my grandfather leased it during the recession in the 1920s , when people in the city really needed their allotments .
back then , it was a necessity , because if you did n't grow your own vegetables , you did n't have any . "
dig it ?
but times have changed , and these days , growing your own spinach is a lifestyle choice .
herbaceous borders are hipper than prada pumps .
in the uk , the times has even dubbed gardening " the new sex . "
so if you think weeding , digging and planting is for frustrated housewives , think again .
bildunterschrift : for just a few hundred euros a year , some 4 million germans enjoy the pastoral perks of an allotment garden , and waiting lists are long .
experts say this love affair with all things horticultural is a sign of the times .
" allotments used to be seen as conventional and boring , but not anymore , " said trend researcher eike wenzel .
it 's not even that vacations are a luxury few can afford when 5 million germans are unemployed .
" it does n't actually have anything to do with the country 's financial difficulties , " he said .
" it 's more about getting back to nature - the satisfaction of doing things yourself and using your hands . "
he would even go so far as to say it reflects a slow shift in values .
" it ties in with a return to tradition and a desire for a slower pace of life .
the 1990s were a very stormy decade of accelerated technology , modernization and digitalization , " he explained .
" but people now feel that they 've been disappointed by these developments and what they really want is a grounded family life and old-fashioned values .
bonding with nature is a key factor in that shift . "
urban refugees bildunterschrift : most of berlin 's 840 garden colonies are made up of 20 to 100 plots , each roughly 300 meters square , overseen by a highly authoritative residents ' association .
its job is to make sure everyone sticks to the rules , which range from keeping the noise down between midday and 3 p.m. to making sure trees never grow beyond a prescribed height and using at least one third of the garden as a vegetable patch .
" you have to fit in , and if you do n't like it , you should n't bother coming here , " says frau sturmer in no uncertain terms .
" young families have to adjust to the rules like everyone else . "
and most of them do .
an allotment garden is a coveted commodity , and not even the younger generation is prepared to risk being banished for bad behavior .
according to wenzel , germany 's new outdoor types are a conscientious bunch .
they have consumer clout , believe in buying organic , and - reflecting the trend to domestic tourism - they 're more likely to go on an eco-friendly holiday to germany 's baltic coast than a package tour to thailand .
the lohas " in advertising , there 's a lot of talk of what 's called lohas - lifestyle of health and sustainability , " he explained .
" we predict that in future , more and more germans will be living in a way that 's environmentally responsible - but enjoying themselves in the process .
the healthy hedonists are idealistic and political correct , but they 're also pleasure-seeking . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but while the healthy hedonists draw spiritual satisfaction from watching their carrots grow , the old-school allotment residents appreciate their leafy retreats for more prosaic reasons .
" tempers can fray when you 're both retired , " admits 65-year-old herr mittelstadt .
" it 's nice to know there 's always somewhere to escape to . " jane paulick , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de conservatism : the new rebellion ?

they head out to their private allotments to tend to their vegetables .
so when did that most suburban of activities become so hip ? undeterred by the bracing easterly wind , dirk ziegler is deadheading his geraniums .
" it 's good to get outside at the weekend , " exclaims the 35-year-old father-of-two as he surveys his modest kingdom .
raising his voice above the roar of a passing train , he shrugs off the obvious downsides of the urban garden .
" having an allotment in the center of town is perfect because it 's so easy to reach - and it 's great for the kids to have somewhere to play , " he says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dirk is part of a wider movement of 30-somethings who 've tired of late nights in smoky clubs and want to get back to nature . three years ago , he and his girlfriend leased a garden allotment in prenzlauer berg - a district in central berlin more commonly associated with fashionable bars and boutiques - and they 've never looked back .
" allotments have become trendy " , confirmed jürgen hurt , president of the berlin association for gardeners in an interview with the daily berliner zeitung .
according to a study conducted by the association , the average age of tenants has dropped from 56 to 46 in the last six years .
the " schrebergarten " -lrb- allotment -rrb- phenomenon , born a century ago , was named after the leipzig-based doctor daniel schreber - a staunch believer in exercise in the great outdoors for pasty-faced city children .
plots of land leased from the state became increasingly popular with tenants seeking gardens for their young , plus an opportunity to stock up their pantries with home-grown garden produce .
meet the weekend warriors today , pedestrians on the busy bornholmer bridge , which earned its place in history as the first border-crossing to be opened to east germans back in 1989 , can look down on the " garden colony " where dirk and his family now spend most of their free time .
flanked by railway lines and shopping malls , it 's a haven of tranquillity in an otherwise bleak urban landscape .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rosy-cheeked garden gnomes preside over well-kept lawns , framed by rows of flourishing hollyhocks and crispy-looking lettuces .
if it were n't for the not-so-distant hum of traffic , it would be a rural idyll .
but what 's most striking is that few of the residents are lounging around with a beer and the sports section of the sunday paper - they 're all getting their hands dirty .
" i put in at least ten hours of work a week , " says dirk , who 's been digging in his flower-bed all day .
his neighbor is busy putting up a trellis , while across the way , mrs sturmer is fixing her roof .
she 's part of the colony 's elder generation , who can remember a time when allotments were about survival rather than leisure .
" my allotment has been in the family for three generations , " she explained .
" my grandfather leased it during the recession in the 1920s , when people in the city really needed their allotments .
back then , it was a necessity , because if you did n't grow your own vegetables , you did n't have any . "
dig it ?
but times have changed , and these days , growing your own spinach is a lifestyle choice .
herbaceous borders are hipper than prada pumps .
in the uk , the times has even dubbed gardening " the new sex . "
so if you think weeding , digging and planting is for frustrated housewives , think again .
bildunterschrift : for just a few hundred euros a year , some 4 million germans enjoy the pastoral perks of an allotment garden , and waiting lists are long .
experts say this love affair with all things horticultural is a sign of the times .
" allotments used to be seen as conventional and boring , but not anymore , " said trend researcher eike wenzel .
it 's not even that vacations are a luxury few can afford when 5 million germans are unemployed .
" it does n't actually have anything to do with the country 's financial difficulties , " he said .
" it 's more about getting back to nature - the satisfaction of doing things yourself and using your hands . "
he would even go so far as to say it reflects a slow shift in values .
" it ties in with a return to tradition and a desire for a slower pace of life .
the 1990s were a very stormy decade of accelerated technology , modernization and digitalization , " he explained .
" but people now feel that they 've been disappointed by these developments and what they really want is a grounded family life and old-fashioned values .
bonding with nature is a key factor in that shift . "
urban refugees bildunterschrift : most of berlin 's 840 garden colonies are made up of 20 to 100 plots , each roughly 300 meters square , overseen by a highly authoritative residents ' association .
its job is to make sure everyone sticks to the rules , which range from keeping the noise down between midday and 3 p.m. to making sure trees never grow beyond a prescribed height and using at least one third of the garden as a vegetable patch .
" you have to fit in , and if you do n't like it , you should n't bother coming here , " says frau sturmer in no uncertain terms .
" young families have to adjust to the rules like everyone else . "
and most of them do .
an allotment garden is a coveted commodity , and not even the younger generation is prepared to risk being banished for bad behavior .
according to wenzel , germany 's new outdoor types are a conscientious bunch .
they have consumer clout , believe in buying organic , and - reflecting the trend to domestic tourism - they 're more likely to go on an eco-friendly holiday to germany 's baltic coast than a package tour to thailand .
the lohas " in advertising , there 's a lot of talk of what 's called lohas - lifestyle of health and sustainability , " he explained .
" we predict that in future , more and more germans will be living in a way that 's environmentally responsible - but enjoying themselves in the process .
the healthy hedonists are idealistic and political correct , but they 're also pleasure-seeking . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but while the healthy hedonists draw spiritual satisfaction from watching their carrots grow , the old-school allotment residents appreciate their leafy retreats for more prosaic reasons .
" tempers can fray when you 're both retired , " admits 65-year-old herr mittelstadt .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the 2005 confederations cup confed cup : from riyadh to the world the mini-world cup kicks off the confederations cup comes to germany argentina bounces roos world cup 2006 -pipe- 15.06.2005 germany lacking bricks in defensive wall großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's defense may be the future but what about the present ?
germany kick-off their confederations cup campaign on wednesday with high hopes of lifting the cup on june 29 .
but as dw-world 's blog reporter nick amies writes , a defensive flaw may end the dream before the final . the confederations cup begins on wednesday and , if the majority of pundits can be trusted in their evaluation , a south american team will be collecting the spoils on june 29 , therefore breaking the cycle of the trophy being retained by the holding federation . this line of thinking has already ruled out a german or greek victory , as the hosts and the european champions are the only ones who can take over from france , the current holders from uefa . this is doing a major disservice to the europeans even before a ball has been kicked in anger .
while greece may actually turn out to be the flash-in-the-pan that many expect , for germany it seems especially harsh . to write off the chances of jürgen klinsmann 's young eagles without even a badly sung national anthem passing their lips is a more of an insult than a disservice .
no doubt the tired argument of their inability to beat any of the top sides in the world in the last five years is being used to support the opinion that germany will fail to win the confederations cup . this , in my opinion , is just laziness ; an excuse to avoid delving deeper into the machinations of the german team and asking why they may not have what it takes to deliver on home soil this month . underlying flaws bildunterschrift : while it is bad form to give the germans no chance at all before the tournament begins , it is entirely likely that the issues that many analysts avoid in their rush to praise the brazilians and argentineans may be the undoing of this undoubtedly talented but flawed german team . ironically , the germans suffer from the same problem that plagues the world champions at times - they have problems defending . this is a relatively new malaise for germany , a team which has been world famous for decades for stinginess on the international stage .
it used to be the germans couldn ’ t score .
but when they did , they had the resources to shut up shop and defend the 1-0 lead through to victory . the current problem became evident under rudi völler and , while the german defense is tighter since klinsmann took the helm , germany 's improving offensive play distracts from a continuing problem left over from the previous era . exciting attackers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann finds himself with one problem most teams would dream to have : an excess of exciting , attacking players .
you can tick them off as you look down the squad sheet … ballack , schweinsteiger -lrb- photo -rrb- , deisler , podolski … germany 's threat comes from up-front and from midfield , giving the coach and the team unenviable options when attacking . but what happens if they get caught on the break ? i would probably get laughed at or shouted down in any discussion on the subject by saying that the biggest loss to the german team for the confed cup has been the injury to dietmar hamann .
for those holding their sides , wait until you see the argentinean midfield breaking and bearing down on thorsten frings and then see who ’ s laughing . lacking an experienced protector germany have a potentially majestic back four in andreas hinkel , per mertesacker , robert huth and thomas hitzlsperger but this new generation lack the classic holding midfielder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense starts in front of the defenders and frings is not disciplined enough to play the role that franz beckenbauer and , to a lesser degree , hamann have done to such effect if the germans play 4-4-2 .
the defenders are even more exposed if klinsmann opts for a 4-3-3 with frings and fabian ernst deployed to the left and right with the central role going to an attack-minded michael ballack . and it is n't just the fault of frings .
bernd schneider and ballack often go missing when defensive duties come calling but it is the role bestowed on frings that bears the responsibility .
my jury remains out on his ability to protect his defenders . the young back four without a savvy guardian in front of them may find themselves pulled all over the place by the likes of javier saviola and juan riquelme in the final group a game against argentina on june 21 . attacking prowess bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : that said , germany 's attacking prowess against australia and tunisia is likely to be too much for these outside challengers and any threat the oceania and african champions may present is unlikely to cause the germans any irretrievable damage , seeing the home side through as runners-up . but in the latter stages , against the free-wheeling brazilians or meticulous greeks , germany may have more problems .
overcoming either of the top teams in group b could set germany up for a final against argentina who are definitely one of the teams to beat . it is they , not brazil , who are my south american tip for the confederation cup with germany suffering painful , but encouraging , heartbreak at the final hurdle . extracted from dw-world 's confederations cup blog nick amies , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the confederations cup comes to germany the fifa 2005 confederations cup kicks off in germany on june 15 , bringing the leading teams from the world 's six soccer federations together to compete for the title of champion of champions .

a lawyer for abdelghani mzoudi , whose not-guilty verdict was upheld in a federal court last week , said he would run the risk of being prosecuted again if he told the court what he knew about the defendant , mounir el motassadeq .
both mzoudi and motassadeq , friends of three sept .
11 suicide hijackers who were based in the northern german port city of hamburg , faced separate trials here for complicity in the attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon which killed some 3,000 people .
motassadeq was convicted in february 2003 and sentenced to the maximum 15 years in prison .
but the following year a federal court ordered a retrial , which is now underway here .
mzoudi was acquitted of the same charges - membership in a terrorist organization and more than 3,000 counts of accessory to murder - in october 2004 .
a federal court last week rejected an appeal from federal prosecutors for a new trial , citing a lack of evidence against him .

germany faces off against australia in the second match .
who has the best shot ? argentina - tunisia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : striker javier saviola , nicknamed " the rabbit " , is a massive goal-scoring threat though playing without stars hernan crespo , roberto ayala and juan sebastian veron , argentina is one of those countries that produces soccer talent like other countries produce co2 emissions .
coach jose pekerman still has javier saviola , juan roman riquelme , javier zanetti , and defender gabriel heinze to pick from , all of whom will figure prominently in the gauchos ' attacking style .
high off of a 3-1 spanking of brazil in the world cup qualifying rounds that secured them a spot in the 2006 world cup , argentina comes into the confederations cup tournament playing well enough to earn its " favorite " status . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : silva has been a serious threat ever since tunisia one the africa cup tunisia 's star player is its coach , the frenchman roger lemerre , who won the european championship with france in 2000 , and the confederations cup a year later .
lemerre has the tunisians playing tight and disciplined in the back , waiting for the chance to counter .
when they do , it 's usually over the wings - a mirror image of argentina 's style - and to francileude dos santos silva .
the native brazilian , who took tunisian citizenship just before the africa cup last year , became the tournament 's shooting star .
now , he 's ready to make problems for the big names in the confederations cup .
" on paper , we have no chance against germany and argentina , " said lemerre .
" but you never know . " possible lineup : tunisia - boumnijel - trabelsi , jaidi , abdi , clayton - ghodhbane , nafti , ben saada , mnari - santos , jaziri argentina - leo franco - coloccini , milito , heinze - j. zanetti , cambiasso , bernardi , sorin - riquelme - tevez , saviola germany - australia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kevin kuranyi will have to show he 's up to shouldering the goal-scoring burden germany comes into the tournament with a number of questions : can the strikers score goals ?
will the young defense stand up against major international competition ?
as a matter of fact , will the rest of the team stand up to major international competition ?
because it is hosting the world cup next year , germany has been spared the intensity and pressure of qualification .
as a result , coach jürgen klinsmann has been allowed to juggle around all sorts of lineup changes in the team 's friendly matches .
after this tournament , that should end .
tonight 's match against australia will be a chance for the strikers , most likely kevin kuranyi and gerald asamoah , to show their mettle in klinsmann 's offense-oriented playing style .
the german defense , who all hover around the age of 22 , will also have to prove itself - klinsmann ended practice this week with extra work for the defenders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : australia has a chance to surprise others at the tournament , but only a small one .
the definite underdog in this match-up , australia , is nevertheless a team with big dreams .
their past confed cup performances give them good reason to hope .
the team finished second in riyadh in 1997 , playing their way into the final before getting walloped by brazil .
in 2001 , in south korea and japan , the team beat brazil 1-0 to win third place and get their revenge .
coach frank farina remains confident : " we believe in ourselves , " he told reporters the other day .
his side is arguably one of the better ones in recent years , even without liverpool striker harry kewell , who is injured .
midfielders tim cahill , brett merton and striker mark viduka all play in the english premiership .
cahill will be responsible for directing the " socceroos " attack , and will look to take advantage of germany 's maligned and relatively slow defense .
the everton midfielder also remains a goal-scoring threat , notching 12 for his club as it marched to a champion 's league qualifying spot and seven for his country in as many appearances .
captian craig moore will anchor the defense . possible lineup : germany - kahn - b. schneider , a. friedrich , mertesacker , hitzlsperger - frings - deisler , schweinsteiger - ballack - kuranyi , podolski australia - schwarzer - neill , popovic , moore , muscat - milicevic - chipperfield , skoko , emerton - cahill - viduka dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the mini-world cup kicks off hundreds of thousands of fans will follow the fortunes of eight teams at five stadiums across germany over the next two weeks .

coach jose pekerman still has javier saviola , juan roman riquelme , javier zanetti , and defender gabriel heinze to pick from , all of whom will figure prominently in the gauchos ' attacking style .
high off of a 3-1 spanking of brazil in the world cup qualifying rounds that secured them a spot in the 2006 world cup , argentina comes into the confederations cup tournament playing well enough to earn its " favorite " status . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : silva has been a serious threat ever since tunisia one the africa cup tunisia 's star player is its coach , the frenchman roger lemerre , who won the european championship with france in 2000 , and the confederations cup a year later .
lemerre has the tunisians playing tight and disciplined in the back , waiting for the chance to counter .
when they do , it 's usually over the wings - a mirror image of argentina 's style - and to francileude dos santos silva .
the native brazilian , who took tunisian citizenship just before the africa cup last year , became the tournament 's shooting star .
now , he 's ready to make problems for the big names in the confederations cup .
" on paper , we have no chance against germany and argentina , " said lemerre .
" but you never know .

will the young defense stand up against major international competition ?
as a matter of fact , will the rest of the team stand up to major international competition ?
because it is hosting the world cup next year , germany has been spared the intensity and pressure of qualification .
as a result , coach jürgen klinsmann has been allowed to juggle around all sorts of lineup changes in the team 's friendly matches .
after this tournament , that should end .
tonight 's match against australia will be a chance for the strikers , most likely kevin kuranyi and gerald asamoah , to show their mettle in klinsmann 's offense-oriented playing style .
the german defense , who all hover around the age of 22 , will also have to prove itself - klinsmann ended practice this week with extra work for the defenders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : australia has a chance to surprise others at the tournament , but only a small one .
the definite underdog in this match-up , australia , is nevertheless a team with big dreams .
their past confed cup performances give them good reason to hope .
the team finished second in riyadh in 1997 , playing their way into the final before getting walloped by brazil .
in 2001 , in south korea and japan , the team beat brazil 1-0 to win third place and get their revenge .
coach frank farina remains confident : " we believe in ourselves , " he told reporters the other day .
his side is arguably one of the better ones in recent years , even without liverpool striker harry kewell , who is injured .
midfielders tim cahill , brett merton and striker mark viduka all play in the english premiership .
cahill will be responsible for directing the " socceroos " attack , and will look to take advantage of germany 's maligned and relatively slow defense .
the everton midfielder also remains a goal-scoring threat , notching 12 for his club as it marched to a champion 's league qualifying spot and seven for his country in as many appearances .

coach jose pekerman 's side , missing stars like hernan crespo and juan sebastian veron , nevertheless controlled play virtually from the start .
tunisia was left rueing an early missed penalty shot that might have changed the flow of the match .
and referee roberto rosetti will probably want to review the game tape to take a second look at some of his calls .
tunisia started quick in the first half , as argentina found itself confounded by the coach roger lemerre 's disciplined backfield . still , a couple of close calls came right at the beginning , when saviola failed to get past goalie khaled fadhel in the 14th minute , and galletti 's header went above the crossbar a minute later . penalty shot on counter tunisia rarely ventured into the argentine half of the field after an initial storm of action .
when they did , it was usually on dangerous counters .
shortly after galletti 's chance , tunisia replied .

the teams were evenly matched only at the very beginning of the match . sprung forward on the left side of the field , haykel guemamdia ran hard after a ball , and goalie german lux cut him down on the bottom side of the penalty box close to the goal .
referee rosetti did n't hesitate in awarding a penalty shot .
but imed mhadhebi sent his shot wide and to the left , squandering an opportunity that would have been so valuable later . riquelme gives gauchos the lead argentina started taking control after the 20th minute . playmaker juan riquelme distributed some nice passes around the top of the penalty area .
in the 32nd minute , rosetti pointed to the spot after a dubious fall by argentine defender maximiliano rodriguez .
replays showed the call was anything but 100 percent , but riquelme calmly slotted in the penalty to give argentina the lead . the gauchos played patient at the second half , giving tunisia the opportunity to come into their side of the field .
but gabriel heinze , fabricio coloccini and co. kept the door shut tight .
in the 57th minute , luciano galletti was sprung down the right side .
left unmarked until the last moment , he had time to pick out a charging saviola who pocketed the ball in the left side of the net for a 2-0 lead . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : good reason to be happy tunisia claws back shaky argentine keeper german lux then almost let tunisia back into the game when he weakly cleared a ball directly to a charging slim benachour .
but the tunisian midfielder 's shot at the 67th minute went just right of the goal . but his side would soon get their chance .
guemamdia ended up one on one with lux again , and fell as the keeper dove for his feet .
replays showed the tunisian striker took off nice and early , completely missing lux 's outstretched fingertips .
but rosetti pointed to the spot .
guemamdia took the penalty himself this time , slotting it into the corner and making it interesting again in the 72nd minute . the two sides traded a couple of opportunities in the closing phase of the match , but both keepers showed they were on point .

tunisia started quick in the first half , as argentina found itself confounded by the coach roger lemerre 's disciplined backfield . still , a couple of close calls came right at the beginning , when saviola failed to get past goalie khaled fadhel in the 14th minute , and galletti 's header went above the crossbar a minute later . penalty shot on counter tunisia rarely ventured into the argentine half of the field after an initial storm of action .
when they did , it was usually on dangerous counters .

germany faces off against australia in the second match .
who has the best shot ? argentina - tunisia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : striker javier saviola , nicknamed " the rabbit " , is a massive goal-scoring threat though playing without stars hernan crespo , roberto ayala and juan sebastian veron , argentina is one of those countries that produces soccer talent like other countries produce co2 emissions .
coach jose pekerman still has javier saviola , juan roman riquelme , javier zanetti , and defender gabriel heinze to pick from , all of whom will figure prominently in the gauchos ' attacking style .
high off of a 3-1 spanking of brazil in the world cup qualifying rounds that secured them a spot in the 2006 world cup , argentina comes into the confederations cup tournament playing well enough to earn its " favorite " status . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : silva has been a serious threat ever since tunisia one the africa cup tunisia 's star player is its coach , the frenchman roger lemerre , who won the european championship with france in 2000 , and the confederations cup a year later .
lemerre has the tunisians playing tight and disciplined in the back , waiting for the chance to counter .
when they do , it 's usually over the wings - a mirror image of argentina 's style - and to francileude dos santos silva .
the native brazilian , who took tunisian citizenship just before the africa cup last year , became the tournament 's shooting star .
now , he 's ready to make problems for the big names in the confederations cup .
" on paper , we have no chance against germany and argentina , " said lemerre .
" but you never know . " possible lineup : tunisia - boumnijel - trabelsi , jaidi , abdi , clayton - ghodhbane , nafti , ben saada , mnari - santos , jaziri argentina - leo franco - coloccini , milito , heinze - j. zanetti , cambiasso , bernardi , sorin - riquelme - tevez , saviola germany - australia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kevin kuranyi will have to show he 's up to shouldering the goal-scoring burden germany comes into the tournament with a number of questions : can the strikers score goals ?
will the young defense stand up against major international competition ?
as a matter of fact , will the rest of the team stand up to major international competition ?
because it is hosting the world cup next year , germany has been spared the intensity and pressure of qualification .
as a result , coach jürgen klinsmann has been allowed to juggle around all sorts of lineup changes in the team 's friendly matches .
after this tournament , that should end .
tonight 's match against australia will be a chance for the strikers , most likely kevin kuranyi and gerald asamoah , to show their mettle in klinsmann 's offense-oriented playing style .
the german defense , who all hover around the age of 22 , will also have to prove itself - klinsmann ended practice this week with extra work for the defenders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : australia has a chance to surprise others at the tournament , but only a small one .
the definite underdog in this match-up , australia , is nevertheless a team with big dreams .
their past confed cup performances give them good reason to hope .
the team finished second in riyadh in 1997 , playing their way into the final before getting walloped by brazil .
in 2001 , in south korea and japan , the team beat brazil 1-0 to win third place and get their revenge .
coach frank farina remains confident : " we believe in ourselves , " he told reporters the other day .
his side is arguably one of the better ones in recent years , even without liverpool striker harry kewell , who is injured .
midfielders tim cahill , brett merton and striker mark viduka all play in the english premiership .
cahill will be responsible for directing the " socceroos " attack , and will look to take advantage of germany 's maligned and relatively slow defense .
the everton midfielder also remains a goal-scoring threat , notching 12 for his club as it marched to a champion 's league qualifying spot and seven for his country in as many appearances .
captian craig moore will anchor the defense . possible lineup : germany - kahn - b. schneider , a. friedrich , mertesacker , hitzlsperger - frings - deisler , schweinsteiger - ballack - kuranyi , podolski australia - schwarzer - neill , popovic , moore , muscat - milicevic - chipperfield , skoko , emerton - cahill - viduka dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the mini-world cup kicks off hundreds of thousands of fans will follow the fortunes of eight teams at five stadiums across germany over the next two weeks .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 15.06.2005 britain , france lock horns over budget großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neither side is giving ground on the tricky issue of the eu budget not since britain 's joining of the us-led invasion of iraq has the country seemed so isolated in the eu as tony blair remains at loggerheads with france and germany over eu spending plans ahead of a crucial summit . british prime minister tony blair 's visit with french president jacques chirac on wednesday went off as widely expected - amiable enough but with no breakthrough on the yawning differences between the two leaders over the 2007-2013 eu budget plan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac and tony blair in paris on wednesday .
" the meeting i 've just had with president chirac was immensely amicable but obviously there 's sharp disagreement , " blair told a news briefing after talks .
" i think it is difficult to see these differences being bridged , but of course you know we continue to talk . " british rebate and french farm subsidies the dispute centers on britain 's controversial 5.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.4 billion -rrb- eu rebate , forged by margaret thatcher 's iron will two decades ago , that is under fire from other eu members sick of footing the bill .
france , germany , spain and the netherlands in particular want the rebate to be reconsidered , claiming that since it was introduced britain has grown much richer and the eu much bigger . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french dairy farmer jean-marc guigue repairs fencing on his dairy farm in mognard , france britain wants a reform of agricultural subsidies , agreed upon in 2002 , which consumes more than 40 percent of the eu 's budget and especially benefits french farmers .
blair wants chirac to give ground on the topic before it agrees to submit its annual rebate from european coffers for renegotiation - a demand that chirac is unlikely to give in to for fear it could anger powerful french farmers at a time when his personal popularity at home has slipped to dismal levels . chirac has called for a " gesture of solidarity " from britain to freeze or surrender its debate . on wednesday , chirac 's spokesman jerome bonnafont told reuters that france wanted " a fair and reasonable agreement " in which everyone made a contribution .
he made no reference to any french concessions .
bonnafont said chirac believed it was " important we do not add financial difficulties to the current political crisis in europe , " sparked by the rejection of the eu constitution in france and the netherlands . eu treaty ratification tricky issue wednesday 's meeting with chirac marked the end of a two-day whirlwind diplomatic tour for blair which also took him to russia and germany .
the tour was meant to focus principally on the summit of the group of eight industrialized countries in gleneagles next month .
britain is chairing the g8 this year and has made ending chronic poverty in africa one of its top concerns for meetings , along with real progress on confronting climate change . britain 's own decision to shelve plans for a planned referendum on the eu constitution next year in the wake of the two rejections in france and the netherlands has not gone down well with other eu members who still want to push ahead with the ratification process . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair , left , with schröder in germany , chancellor gerhard schröder has emerged as a vocal champion of the embattled eu constitution , urging the bloc to press on with the ratification process despite london 's decision to call off a planned referendum on it .
he has also taken the french side in the farm subsidies row , which blair has said must also be put on the table in brussels this week . " chancellor schröder is clearly on the same lines as the french president as far as agricultural subsidies are concerned , " government spokesman bela anda said monday ahead of the meeting between schröder and blair . a clear political direction britain 's position on both the constitution and the budget and blair 's row with chirac have left it looking increasingly isolated within the eu - a situation similar to the time when britain joined the us-led invasion in iraq in 2003 in the face of fierce franco-german opposition . experts are pessimistic about the prospect of a deal on either of the issues at a two-day eu summit that kicks off in brussels on thursday . luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , whose country currently holds the six-month rotating eu presidency , said he was fairly certain a deal would n't be brokered at the summit . " i am pretty sure we wo n't get the financial perspectives through at this summit , " juncker told a european parliament committee , hours before he was due to circulate a compromise proposal on the 2007-2013 budget to eu leaders .
" there is agreement , more or less , on the total amount of funding .
we differ as to payments to the budget , the structure of expenditure and who is a net contributor , " juncker said . tony blair , who has rejected a long-term freeze on britain 's widely-criticized eu budget rebate , has linked the budget dispute to the constitutional and political crisis gripping the eu and called for a pause for reflection . " if we want to reconnect people in europe with the idea of the european union , we 've got to set a clear political direction , " blair said after wednesday 's meeting with chirac . " we 've got to , even in the financing of europe , in fact , in some respects particularly in the financing of europe , reconnect the priorities that people have in europe with the way that we spend the money in europe , " blair said . " if we were to set out some of that forward path and direction , then i think it would be a lot easier to persuade people why it 's necessary also to have a new set of rules to govern europe .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 15.06.2005 moving german service to foreign shores großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indians assume the lion 's share of german service jobs sent abroad outsourcing has become standard in manufacturing .
but according to a recent study concerning the service sector , it 's still something of a novelty in germany , though that 's rapidly changing . in the early 1900s , henry ford revolutionized manufacturing when he introduced the assembly line to build cars .
the 1980s saw the next revolution : subcontractors took over part of the manufacturing process .
outsourcing has now taken hold of the service sector , where it 's called " offshoring . "
deutsche bank and the it organization bitkom presented a study on the effects of this change for the german workforce on tuesday in berlin that suggests that german it students may want to shift their emphasis . germany 's offshoring sales volume currently amounts to about 600 million euros -lrb- $ 723 million -rrb- .
an increase of more than 20 percent is expected over the next five years , and it 's a development that ca n't be halted , according to bitkom vice president jörg menno harms . " we can decide whether we want to react to globalization passively - as victims - or actively by having a say in the future division of labor in the world , " harms said .
" offshoring should n't be a taboo topic .
we 've got to acknowledge that companies use offshoring to keep up and to improve their international competitiveness . " due to the change , young computer scientists with fresh degrees in hand are likely to discover they can only get work in the sector as highly specialized experts with experience in project management or as consultants and customer advisors .
mere programmers are simply not needed in germany , since their work is now done in india , ireland and israel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relocating jobs abroad continues to be at the heart of heated discussions in germany .
the fact that only 570 of the 4,000 companies contacted for the study participated illustrates how touchy it is .
despite promises of anonymity , many companies were concerned about their image .
but , the study actually showed that offshoring does n't necessarily have a negative effect on the jobs that remain in germany .
on the contrary , the savings allow the companies to grow and to hire more employees , harms said .
not always feasible though india is still the main destination for offshoring projects - it has 90 percent of the western european market - contractors from eastern europe are gaining ground , the study showed . " we do feel a cultural proximity to eastern european countries , " one of the study 's authors , jürgen schaaf , said .
" the great advantage the us and britain have in india is a common language .
that 's an advantage germans do n't have in india .
but in many eastern european countries , german is spoken well enough to communicate on a working level . " in its own attempts to send jobs offshore , deutsche bank discovered firsthand the importance of language for the service sector .
the bank tried to establish a call-center abroad , but ended up leaving again because customers were n't satisfied . bildunterschrift : deutsche bank chief economist norbert walter " you learn that many languages are spoken all over the world , but often in such a manner that only locals can understand them , not our customers , " said deutsche bank chief economist norbert walter -lrb- photo -rrb- . now , one of the bank 's two global call-centers is located in berlin .
the way of the future ? but it 's not only customer services , bookkeeping and personnel that are prey to offshoring .
about 40 percent of the firms questioned in the study said they 'd partly offshored research and development as well .
but in this case , cost efficiency was n't the only reason .
there just are n't enough highly specialized experts in germany and that 's what the country needs , walter said . in view of all the schools that - due to germany 's low birth rate - are expected to stand empty in the future , the country could start making a name for itself as a global contractor of education , " walter suggested .
germany could make a name for itself for " inshoring " instead of offshoring . sabine kinkartz -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de giving globalization a coy voice what would happen if india 's formidable army of call center operators dropped their professional tone and got personal on the phone ?
a german artist group is looking for the answer with their project , " call cutta . "
-lrb- april 19 , 2005 -rrb- opinion : germany left behind while the new alliance of two leftist parties for germany 's early general election this fall might make the campaign more colorful , it certainly wo n't help the country , says dw-world 's marc young .

but according to a recent study concerning the service sector , it 's still something of a novelty in germany , though that 's rapidly changing . in the early 1900s , henry ford revolutionized manufacturing when he introduced the assembly line to build cars .
the 1980s saw the next revolution : subcontractors took over part of the manufacturing process .
outsourcing has now taken hold of the service sector , where it 's called " offshoring . "
deutsche bank and the it organization bitkom presented a study on the effects of this change for the german workforce on tuesday in berlin that suggests that german it students may want to shift their emphasis . germany 's offshoring sales volume currently amounts to about 600 million euros -lrb- $ 723 million -rrb- .
an increase of more than 20 percent is expected over the next five years , and it 's a development that ca n't be halted , according to bitkom vice president jörg menno harms . " we can decide whether we want to react to globalization passively - as victims - or actively by having a say in the future division of labor in the world , " harms said .

but , the study actually showed that offshoring does n't necessarily have a negative effect on the jobs that remain in germany .
on the contrary , the savings allow the companies to grow and to hire more employees , harms said .
not always feasible though india is still the main destination for offshoring projects - it has 90 percent of the western european market - contractors from eastern europe are gaining ground , the study showed .

11 , 2001 attacks .
a lawyer for abdelghani mzoudi , whose not-guilty verdict was upheld in a federal court last week , said he would run the risk of being prosecuted again if he told the court what he knew about the defendant , mounir el motassadeq .
both mzoudi and motassadeq , friends of three sept .
11 suicide hijackers who were based in the northern german port city of hamburg , faced separate trials here for complicity in the attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon which killed some 3,000 people .
motassadeq was convicted in february 2003 and sentenced to the maximum 15 years in prison .
but the following year a federal court ordered a retrial , which is now underway here .
mzoudi was acquitted of the same charges - membership in a terrorist organization and more than 3,000 counts of accessory to murder - in october 2004 .
a federal court last week rejected an appeal from federal prosecutors for a new trial , citing a lack of evidence against him .
the hamburg court had hoped to gain more information from mzoudi about motassadeq 's alleged role in the so-called hamburg cell led by the hijackers ' ringleader , mohammed atta .

german organizers hope they like what they see . so far , more than 500,000 tickets have been sold to the confederations cup tournament , which kicks off wednesday night when argentina plays tunisia in cologne . most of the fans will be locals , eager to get a measure of how organizers , as well as their team , are coming along ahead of the world cup next summer .
both organizers and political officials are hoping not to disappoint . the two-week tournament will be televised in 170 countries across the world , and organizers are hoping the 600,000-ticket barrier is reached some time during the tournament .
top matches like argentina and germany on june 21 and greece vs. brazil in leipzig on june 16 are already sold out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece , the surprise 2004 european champions , will be out to prove their victory was no fluke " the tournament is much more than a dress rehearsal for next year 's world cup , " fifa president joseph blatter told journalists .
" it 's a prestigious international tournament in its own right : you just have to cast an eye over the starting field . " win the confed cup , win the world cup hosts germany will be joined by mexico , japan , brazil , argentina , greece , australia and tunisia , the top teams from the world 's soccer federations .
though several teams are n't arriving with their top players - who are either injured or , like brazilian star ronaldo , " taking a rest " - coaches say each team is taking the tournament seriously .
german coach jürgen klinsmann -lrb- photo -rrb- said the tournament will be crucial to seeing how his young squad measures up against top competition , one year before it plays the world cup at home .
soccer officials have promised each player a 60,000 euro -lrb- $ 72,000 -rrb- bonus if they hoist the trophy on june 29 .
the reason ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen klinsmann wants nothing short of victory " he who wants to win the world cup , should also win the confederations cup , " said german soccer association president theo zwanziger . security also getting a test run the same philosophy might apply to german security officials .
one year before welcoming more than a million soccer fans into the country , germany 's police are eager to show the world that they can put on a peaceful tournament . the national information and cooperation center , a new body created expressly to coordinate policing activities for the 2006 tournament , will get a test run during the confederations cup .
the center will provide situation reports culled from information coming in from germany 's federal and 16 state police forces .
" we wo n't have the really big groups of -lrb- foreign -rrb- fans that we expect for the world cup , " said organizing committee vice-president wolfgang niersbach .
" but otherwise the measures in respect of security are the same … there will be an external security ring right around the stadium . " too many tournaments the heightened security measures are at the same time an acknowledgement of how far the confed cup has come since its humble beginnings as an invitation-only tournament of four teams in saudi arabia in 1992 .
but not all are happy about its progress . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ronaldo will be resting , not playing , this time around the inclusion of yet another tournament in a playing schedule that can be gruelling for top-flight players has reaped criticism from some team managers .
four mexican players , registered to play for the national team in the tournament , might not show up because of playing commitments to their clubs .
fifa has threatened to take action . " the players do n't have enough vacation , " said karl-heinz rummenigge , a german soccer legend and chairman of bundesliga champions fc bayern munich , adding that the tournament should be phased out . organizers , of course , do n't want to hear such talk now .
everyone from the local fan to the kaiser himself , world cup 2006 organizing committee chief franz beckenbauer , is singing the confed cup 's praises - and hoping the home country -lrb- and team -rrb- make a strong showing .
" i 'm looking forward to the tournament , " said beckenbauer .

germany kick-off their confederations cup campaign on wednesday with high hopes of lifting the cup on june 29 .
but as dw-world 's blog reporter nick amies writes , a defensive flaw may end the dream before the final . the confederations cup begins on wednesday and , if the majority of pundits can be trusted in their evaluation , a south american team will be collecting the spoils on june 29 , therefore breaking the cycle of the trophy being retained by the holding federation . this line of thinking has already ruled out a german or greek victory , as the hosts and the european champions are the only ones who can take over from france , the current holders from uefa . this is doing a major disservice to the europeans even before a ball has been kicked in anger .
while greece may actually turn out to be the flash-in-the-pan that many expect , for germany it seems especially harsh . to write off the chances of jürgen klinsmann 's young eagles without even a badly sung national anthem passing their lips is a more of an insult than a disservice .

they head out to their private allotments to tend to their vegetables .
so when did that most suburban of activities become so hip ? undeterred by the bracing easterly wind , dirk ziegler is deadheading his geraniums .
" it 's good to get outside at the weekend , " exclaims the 35-year-old father-of-two as he surveys his modest kingdom .
raising his voice above the roar of a passing train , he shrugs off the obvious downsides of the urban garden .
" having an allotment in the center of town is perfect because it 's so easy to reach - and it 's great for the kids to have somewhere to play , " he says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dirk is part of a wider movement of 30-somethings who 've tired of late nights in smoky clubs and want to get back to nature . three years ago , he and his girlfriend leased a garden allotment in prenzlauer berg - a district in central berlin more commonly associated with fashionable bars and boutiques - and they 've never looked back .
" allotments have become trendy " , confirmed jürgen hurt , president of the berlin association for gardeners in an interview with the daily berliner zeitung .
according to a study conducted by the association , the average age of tenants has dropped from 56 to 46 in the last six years .
the " schrebergarten " -lrb- allotment -rrb- phenomenon , born a century ago , was named after the leipzig-based doctor daniel schreber - a staunch believer in exercise in the great outdoors for pasty-faced city children .
plots of land leased from the state became increasingly popular with tenants seeking gardens for their young , plus an opportunity to stock up their pantries with home-grown garden produce .
meet the weekend warriors today , pedestrians on the busy bornholmer bridge , which earned its place in history as the first border-crossing to be opened to east germans back in 1989 , can look down on the " garden colony " where dirk and his family now spend most of their free time .
flanked by railway lines and shopping malls , it 's a haven of tranquillity in an otherwise bleak urban landscape .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rosy-cheeked garden gnomes preside over well-kept lawns , framed by rows of flourishing hollyhocks and crispy-looking lettuces .
if it were n't for the not-so-distant hum of traffic , it would be a rural idyll .
but what 's most striking is that few of the residents are lounging around with a beer and the sports section of the sunday paper - they 're all getting their hands dirty .
" i put in at least ten hours of work a week , " says dirk , who 's been digging in his flower-bed all day .
his neighbor is busy putting up a trellis , while across the way , mrs sturmer is fixing her roof .
she 's part of the colony 's elder generation , who can remember a time when allotments were about survival rather than leisure .
" my allotment has been in the family for three generations , " she explained .
" my grandfather leased it during the recession in the 1920s , when people in the city really needed their allotments .
back then , it was a necessity , because if you did n't grow your own vegetables , you did n't have any . "
dig it ?
but times have changed , and these days , growing your own spinach is a lifestyle choice .
herbaceous borders are hipper than prada pumps .
in the uk , the times has even dubbed gardening " the new sex . "
so if you think weeding , digging and planting is for frustrated housewives , think again .
bildunterschrift : for just a few hundred euros a year , some 4 million germans enjoy the pastoral perks of an allotment garden , and waiting lists are long .
experts say this love affair with all things horticultural is a sign of the times .
" allotments used to be seen as conventional and boring , but not anymore , " said trend researcher eike wenzel .
it 's not even that vacations are a luxury few can afford when 5 million germans are unemployed .
" it does n't actually have anything to do with the country 's financial difficulties , " he said .
" it 's more about getting back to nature - the satisfaction of doing things yourself and using your hands . "
he would even go so far as to say it reflects a slow shift in values .
" it ties in with a return to tradition and a desire for a slower pace of life .
the 1990s were a very stormy decade of accelerated technology , modernization and digitalization , " he explained .
" but people now feel that they 've been disappointed by these developments and what they really want is a grounded family life and old-fashioned values .
bonding with nature is a key factor in that shift . "
urban refugees bildunterschrift : most of berlin 's 840 garden colonies are made up of 20 to 100 plots , each roughly 300 meters square , overseen by a highly authoritative residents ' association .
its job is to make sure everyone sticks to the rules , which range from keeping the noise down between midday and 3 p.m. to making sure trees never grow beyond a prescribed height and using at least one third of the garden as a vegetable patch .
" you have to fit in , and if you do n't like it , you should n't bother coming here , " says frau sturmer in no uncertain terms .
" young families have to adjust to the rules like everyone else . "
and most of them do .
an allotment garden is a coveted commodity , and not even the younger generation is prepared to risk being banished for bad behavior .
according to wenzel , germany 's new outdoor types are a conscientious bunch .
they have consumer clout , believe in buying organic , and - reflecting the trend to domestic tourism - they 're more likely to go on an eco-friendly holiday to germany 's baltic coast than a package tour to thailand .

" we predict that in future , more and more germans will be living in a way that 's environmentally responsible - but enjoying themselves in the process .
the healthy hedonists are idealistic and political correct , but they 're also pleasure-seeking . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but while the healthy hedonists draw spiritual satisfaction from watching their carrots grow , the old-school allotment residents appreciate their leafy retreats for more prosaic reasons .

they head out to their private allotments to tend to their vegetables .
so when did that most suburban of activities become so hip ? undeterred by the bracing easterly wind , dirk ziegler is deadheading his geraniums .
" it 's good to get outside at the weekend , " exclaims the 35-year-old father-of-two as he surveys his modest kingdom .
raising his voice above the roar of a passing train , he shrugs off the obvious downsides of the urban garden .
" having an allotment in the center of town is perfect because it 's so easy to reach - and it 's great for the kids to have somewhere to play , " he says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dirk is part of a wider movement of 30-somethings who 've tired of late nights in smoky clubs and want to get back to nature . three years ago , he and his girlfriend leased a garden allotment in prenzlauer berg - a district in central berlin more commonly associated with fashionable bars and boutiques - and they 've never looked back .
" allotments have become trendy " , confirmed jürgen hurt , president of the berlin association for gardeners in an interview with the daily berliner zeitung .
according to a study conducted by the association , the average age of tenants has dropped from 56 to 46 in the last six years .
the " schrebergarten " -lrb- allotment -rrb- phenomenon , born a century ago , was named after the leipzig-based doctor daniel schreber - a staunch believer in exercise in the great outdoors for pasty-faced city children .
plots of land leased from the state became increasingly popular with tenants seeking gardens for their young , plus an opportunity to stock up their pantries with home-grown garden produce .
meet the weekend warriors today , pedestrians on the busy bornholmer bridge , which earned its place in history as the first border-crossing to be opened to east germans back in 1989 , can look down on the " garden colony " where dirk and his family now spend most of their free time .
flanked by railway lines and shopping malls , it 's a haven of tranquillity in an otherwise bleak urban landscape .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rosy-cheeked garden gnomes preside over well-kept lawns , framed by rows of flourishing hollyhocks and crispy-looking lettuces .
if it were n't for the not-so-distant hum of traffic , it would be a rural idyll .
but what 's most striking is that few of the residents are lounging around with a beer and the sports section of the sunday paper - they 're all getting their hands dirty .
" i put in at least ten hours of work a week , " says dirk , who 's been digging in his flower-bed all day .
his neighbor is busy putting up a trellis , while across the way , mrs sturmer is fixing her roof .
she 's part of the colony 's elder generation , who can remember a time when allotments were about survival rather than leisure .
" my allotment has been in the family for three generations , " she explained .
" my grandfather leased it during the recession in the 1920s , when people in the city really needed their allotments .
back then , it was a necessity , because if you did n't grow your own vegetables , you did n't have any . "
dig it ?
but times have changed , and these days , growing your own spinach is a lifestyle choice .
herbaceous borders are hipper than prada pumps .
in the uk , the times has even dubbed gardening " the new sex . "
so if you think weeding , digging and planting is for frustrated housewives , think again .
bildunterschrift : for just a few hundred euros a year , some 4 million germans enjoy the pastoral perks of an allotment garden , and waiting lists are long .
experts say this love affair with all things horticultural is a sign of the times .
" allotments used to be seen as conventional and boring , but not anymore , " said trend researcher eike wenzel .
it 's not even that vacations are a luxury few can afford when 5 million germans are unemployed .
" it does n't actually have anything to do with the country 's financial difficulties , " he said .
" it 's more about getting back to nature - the satisfaction of doing things yourself and using your hands . "
he would even go so far as to say it reflects a slow shift in values .
" it ties in with a return to tradition and a desire for a slower pace of life .
the 1990s were a very stormy decade of accelerated technology , modernization and digitalization , " he explained .
" but people now feel that they 've been disappointed by these developments and what they really want is a grounded family life and old-fashioned values .
bonding with nature is a key factor in that shift . "

its job is to make sure everyone sticks to the rules , which range from keeping the noise down between midday and 3 p.m. to making sure trees never grow beyond a prescribed height and using at least one third of the garden as a vegetable patch .
" you have to fit in , and if you do n't like it , you should n't bother coming here , " says frau sturmer in no uncertain terms .
" young families have to adjust to the rules like everyone else . "
and most of them do .
an allotment garden is a coveted commodity , and not even the younger generation is prepared to risk being banished for bad behavior .
according to wenzel , germany 's new outdoor types are a conscientious bunch .
they have consumer clout , believe in buying organic , and - reflecting the trend to domestic tourism - they 're more likely to go on an eco-friendly holiday to germany 's baltic coast than a package tour to thailand .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but while the healthy hedonists draw spiritual satisfaction from watching their carrots grow , the old-school allotment residents appreciate their leafy retreats for more prosaic reasons .

germany kick-off their confederations cup campaign on wednesday with high hopes of lifting the cup on june 29 .
but as dw-world 's blog reporter nick amies writes , a defensive flaw may end the dream before the final . the confederations cup begins on wednesday and , if the majority of pundits can be trusted in their evaluation , a south american team will be collecting the spoils on june 29 , therefore breaking the cycle of the trophy being retained by the holding federation . this line of thinking has already ruled out a german or greek victory , as the hosts and the european champions are the only ones who can take over from france , the current holders from uefa . this is doing a major disservice to the europeans even before a ball has been kicked in anger .
while greece may actually turn out to be the flash-in-the-pan that many expect , for germany it seems especially harsh . to write off the chances of jürgen klinsmann 's young eagles without even a badly sung national anthem passing their lips is a more of an insult than a disservice .
no doubt the tired argument of their inability to beat any of the top sides in the world in the last five years is being used to support the opinion that germany will fail to win the confederations cup . this , in my opinion , is just laziness ; an excuse to avoid delving deeper into the machinations of the german team and asking why they may not have what it takes to deliver on home soil this month . underlying flaws bildunterschrift : while it is bad form to give the germans no chance at all before the tournament begins , it is entirely likely that the issues that many analysts avoid in their rush to praise the brazilians and argentineans may be the undoing of this undoubtedly talented but flawed german team . ironically , the germans suffer from the same problem that plagues the world champions at times - they have problems defending . this is a relatively new malaise for germany , a team which has been world famous for decades for stinginess on the international stage .
it used to be the germans couldn ’ t score .
but when they did , they had the resources to shut up shop and defend the 1-0 lead through to victory . the current problem became evident under rudi völler and , while the german defense is tighter since klinsmann took the helm , germany 's improving offensive play distracts from a continuing problem left over from the previous era . exciting attackers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann finds himself with one problem most teams would dream to have : an excess of exciting , attacking players .
you can tick them off as you look down the squad sheet … ballack , schweinsteiger -lrb- photo -rrb- , deisler , podolski … germany 's threat comes from up-front and from midfield , giving the coach and the team unenviable options when attacking . but what happens if they get caught on the break ? i would probably get laughed at or shouted down in any discussion on the subject by saying that the biggest loss to the german team for the confed cup has been the injury to dietmar hamann .
for those holding their sides , wait until you see the argentinean midfield breaking and bearing down on thorsten frings and then see who ’ s laughing . lacking an experienced protector germany have a potentially majestic back four in andreas hinkel , per mertesacker , robert huth and thomas hitzlsperger but this new generation lack the classic holding midfielder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense starts in front of the defenders and frings is not disciplined enough to play the role that franz beckenbauer and , to a lesser degree , hamann have done to such effect if the germans play 4-4-2 .
the defenders are even more exposed if klinsmann opts for a 4-3-3 with frings and fabian ernst deployed to the left and right with the central role going to an attack-minded michael ballack . and it is n't just the fault of frings .
bernd schneider and ballack often go missing when defensive duties come calling but it is the role bestowed on frings that bears the responsibility .
my jury remains out on his ability to protect his defenders . the young back four without a savvy guardian in front of them may find themselves pulled all over the place by the likes of javier saviola and juan riquelme in the final group a game against argentina on june 21 . attacking prowess bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : that said , germany 's attacking prowess against australia and tunisia is likely to be too much for these outside challengers and any threat the oceania and african champions may present is unlikely to cause the germans any irretrievable damage , seeing the home side through as runners-up . but in the latter stages , against the free-wheeling brazilians or meticulous greeks , germany may have more problems .
overcoming either of the top teams in group b could set germany up for a final against argentina who are definitely one of the teams to beat . it is they , not brazil , who are my south american tip for the confederation cup with germany suffering painful , but encouraging , heartbreak at the final hurdle . extracted from dw-world 's confederations cup blog nick amies , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the confederations cup comes to germany the fifa 2005 confederations cup kicks off in germany on june 15 , bringing the leading teams from the world 's six soccer federations together to compete for the title of champion of champions .

no doubt the tired argument of their inability to beat any of the top sides in the world in the last five years is being used to support the opinion that germany will fail to win the confederations cup . this , in my opinion , is just laziness ; an excuse to avoid delving deeper into the machinations of the german team and asking why they may not have what it takes to deliver on home soil this month . underlying flaws bildunterschrift : while it is bad form to give the germans no chance at all before the tournament begins , it is entirely likely that the issues that many analysts avoid in their rush to praise the brazilians and argentineans may be the undoing of this undoubtedly talented but flawed german team . ironically , the germans suffer from the same problem that plagues the world champions at times - they have problems defending . this is a relatively new malaise for germany , a team which has been world famous for decades for stinginess on the international stage .
it used to be the germans couldn ’ t score .
but when they did , they had the resources to shut up shop and defend the 1-0 lead through to victory . the current problem became evident under rudi völler and , while the german defense is tighter since klinsmann took the helm , germany 's improving offensive play distracts from a continuing problem left over from the previous era . exciting attackers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann finds himself with one problem most teams would dream to have : an excess of exciting , attacking players .
you can tick them off as you look down the squad sheet … ballack , schweinsteiger -lrb- photo -rrb- , deisler , podolski … germany 's threat comes from up-front and from midfield , giving the coach and the team unenviable options when attacking . but what happens if they get caught on the break ? i would probably get laughed at or shouted down in any discussion on the subject by saying that the biggest loss to the german team for the confed cup has been the injury to dietmar hamann .
for those holding their sides , wait until you see the argentinean midfield breaking and bearing down on thorsten frings and then see who ’ s laughing . lacking an experienced protector germany have a potentially majestic back four in andreas hinkel , per mertesacker , robert huth and thomas hitzlsperger but this new generation lack the classic holding midfielder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense starts in front of the defenders and frings is not disciplined enough to play the role that franz beckenbauer and , to a lesser degree , hamann have done to such effect if the germans play 4-4-2 .
the defenders are even more exposed if klinsmann opts for a 4-3-3 with frings and fabian ernst deployed to the left and right with the central role going to an attack-minded michael ballack . and it is n't just the fault of frings .
bernd schneider and ballack often go missing when defensive duties come calling but it is the role bestowed on frings that bears the responsibility .
my jury remains out on his ability to protect his defenders . the young back four without a savvy guardian in front of them may find themselves pulled all over the place by the likes of javier saviola and juan riquelme in the final group a game against argentina on june 21 . attacking prowess bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : that said , germany 's attacking prowess against australia and tunisia is likely to be too much for these outside challengers and any threat the oceania and african champions may present is unlikely to cause the germans any irretrievable damage , seeing the home side through as runners-up . but in the latter stages , against the free-wheeling brazilians or meticulous greeks , germany may have more problems .
overcoming either of the top teams in group b could set germany up for a final against argentina who are definitely one of the teams to beat . it is they , not brazil , who are my south american tip for the confederation cup with germany suffering painful , but encouraging , heartbreak at the final hurdle . extracted from dw-world 's confederations cup blog nick amies , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the confederations cup comes to germany the fifa 2005 confederations cup kicks off in germany on june 15 , bringing the leading teams from the world 's six soccer federations together to compete for the title of champion of champions .

he said such a step could only be taken by way of a referendum . the appeal has little chance of success , however , as gauweiler already failed to convince judges with an earlier appeal in april . a further setback bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : has the eu reached a dead end ?
but köhler 's decision to halt ratification represents a further setback for the document after french and dutch voters rejected the constitution in referendums on may 29 and june 1 respectively . britain subsequently said it would postpone a planned referendum until further notice , throwing into doubt the constitution 's chance of survival .
besides germany , 10 of the 25 member states have so far ratified the treaty . eu leaders are meeting in brussels on thursday to discuss the union 's future .

germany kick-off their confederations cup campaign on wednesday with high hopes of lifting the cup on june 29 .
but as dw-world 's blog reporter nick amies writes , a defensive flaw may end the dream before the final . the confederations cup begins on wednesday and , if the majority of pundits can be trusted in their evaluation , a south american team will be collecting the spoils on june 29 , therefore breaking the cycle of the trophy being retained by the holding federation . this line of thinking has already ruled out a german or greek victory , as the hosts and the european champions are the only ones who can take over from france , the current holders from uefa . this is doing a major disservice to the europeans even before a ball has been kicked in anger .
while greece may actually turn out to be the flash-in-the-pan that many expect , for germany it seems especially harsh . to write off the chances of jürgen klinsmann 's young eagles without even a badly sung national anthem passing their lips is a more of an insult than a disservice .
no doubt the tired argument of their inability to beat any of the top sides in the world in the last five years is being used to support the opinion that germany will fail to win the confederations cup . this , in my opinion , is just laziness ; an excuse to avoid delving deeper into the machinations of the german team and asking why they may not have what it takes to deliver on home soil this month . underlying flaws bildunterschrift : while it is bad form to give the germans no chance at all before the tournament begins , it is entirely likely that the issues that many analysts avoid in their rush to praise the brazilians and argentineans may be the undoing of this undoubtedly talented but flawed german team . ironically , the germans suffer from the same problem that plagues the world champions at times - they have problems defending . this is a relatively new malaise for germany , a team which has been world famous for decades for stinginess on the international stage .
it used to be the germans couldn ’ t score .
but when they did , they had the resources to shut up shop and defend the 1-0 lead through to victory . the current problem became evident under rudi völler and , while the german defense is tighter since klinsmann took the helm , germany 's improving offensive play distracts from a continuing problem left over from the previous era . exciting attackers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann finds himself with one problem most teams would dream to have : an excess of exciting , attacking players .

for those holding their sides , wait until you see the argentinean midfield breaking and bearing down on thorsten frings and then see who ’ s laughing . lacking an experienced protector germany have a potentially majestic back four in andreas hinkel , per mertesacker , robert huth and thomas hitzlsperger but this new generation lack the classic holding midfielder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense starts in front of the defenders and frings is not disciplined enough to play the role that franz beckenbauer and , to a lesser degree , hamann have done to such effect if the germans play 4-4-2 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 15.06.2005 invasion of the healthy hedonists großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : residents keep their eyes peeled for anyone breaking the rules young people are no longer spending their sundays nursing hangovers in front of the tv .
they head out to their private allotments to tend to their vegetables .
so when did that most suburban of activities become so hip ? undeterred by the bracing easterly wind , dirk ziegler is deadheading his geraniums .
" it 's good to get outside at the weekend , " exclaims the 35-year-old father-of-two as he surveys his modest kingdom .
raising his voice above the roar of a passing train , he shrugs off the obvious downsides of the urban garden .
" having an allotment in the center of town is perfect because it 's so easy to reach - and it 's great for the kids to have somewhere to play , " he says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dirk is part of a wider movement of 30-somethings who 've tired of late nights in smoky clubs and want to get back to nature . three years ago , he and his girlfriend leased a garden allotment in prenzlauer berg - a district in central berlin more commonly associated with fashionable bars and boutiques - and they 've never looked back .
" allotments have become trendy " , confirmed jürgen hurt , president of the berlin association for gardeners in an interview with the daily berliner zeitung .
according to a study conducted by the association , the average age of tenants has dropped from 56 to 46 in the last six years .
the " schrebergarten " -lrb- allotment -rrb- phenomenon , born a century ago , was named after the leipzig-based doctor daniel schreber - a staunch believer in exercise in the great outdoors for pasty-faced city children .
plots of land leased from the state became increasingly popular with tenants seeking gardens for their young , plus an opportunity to stock up their pantries with home-grown garden produce .
meet the weekend warriors today , pedestrians on the busy bornholmer bridge , which earned its place in history as the first border-crossing to be opened to east germans back in 1989 , can look down on the " garden colony " where dirk and his family now spend most of their free time .
flanked by railway lines and shopping malls , it 's a haven of tranquillity in an otherwise bleak urban landscape .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rosy-cheeked garden gnomes preside over well-kept lawns , framed by rows of flourishing hollyhocks and crispy-looking lettuces .
if it were n't for the not-so-distant hum of traffic , it would be a rural idyll .
but what 's most striking is that few of the residents are lounging around with a beer and the sports section of the sunday paper - they 're all getting their hands dirty .
" i put in at least ten hours of work a week , " says dirk , who 's been digging in his flower-bed all day .
his neighbor is busy putting up a trellis , while across the way , mrs sturmer is fixing her roof .
she 's part of the colony 's elder generation , who can remember a time when allotments were about survival rather than leisure .
" my allotment has been in the family for three generations , " she explained .
" my grandfather leased it during the recession in the 1920s , when people in the city really needed their allotments .
back then , it was a necessity , because if you did n't grow your own vegetables , you did n't have any . "
dig it ?
but times have changed , and these days , growing your own spinach is a lifestyle choice .
herbaceous borders are hipper than prada pumps .
in the uk , the times has even dubbed gardening " the new sex . "
so if you think weeding , digging and planting is for frustrated housewives , think again .
bildunterschrift : for just a few hundred euros a year , some 4 million germans enjoy the pastoral perks of an allotment garden , and waiting lists are long .
experts say this love affair with all things horticultural is a sign of the times .
" allotments used to be seen as conventional and boring , but not anymore , " said trend researcher eike wenzel .
it 's not even that vacations are a luxury few can afford when 5 million germans are unemployed .
" it does n't actually have anything to do with the country 's financial difficulties , " he said .
" it 's more about getting back to nature - the satisfaction of doing things yourself and using your hands . "
he would even go so far as to say it reflects a slow shift in values .
" it ties in with a return to tradition and a desire for a slower pace of life .
the 1990s were a very stormy decade of accelerated technology , modernization and digitalization , " he explained .
" but people now feel that they 've been disappointed by these developments and what they really want is a grounded family life and old-fashioned values .
bonding with nature is a key factor in that shift . "
urban refugees bildunterschrift : most of berlin 's 840 garden colonies are made up of 20 to 100 plots , each roughly 300 meters square , overseen by a highly authoritative residents ' association .
its job is to make sure everyone sticks to the rules , which range from keeping the noise down between midday and 3 p.m. to making sure trees never grow beyond a prescribed height and using at least one third of the garden as a vegetable patch .
" you have to fit in , and if you do n't like it , you should n't bother coming here , " says frau sturmer in no uncertain terms .
" young families have to adjust to the rules like everyone else . "
and most of them do .
an allotment garden is a coveted commodity , and not even the younger generation is prepared to risk being banished for bad behavior .
according to wenzel , germany 's new outdoor types are a conscientious bunch .
they have consumer clout , believe in buying organic , and - reflecting the trend to domestic tourism - they 're more likely to go on an eco-friendly holiday to germany 's baltic coast than a package tour to thailand .
the lohas " in advertising , there 's a lot of talk of what 's called lohas - lifestyle of health and sustainability , " he explained .
" we predict that in future , more and more germans will be living in a way that 's environmentally responsible - but enjoying themselves in the process .
the healthy hedonists are idealistic and political correct , but they 're also pleasure-seeking . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but while the healthy hedonists draw spiritual satisfaction from watching their carrots grow , the old-school allotment residents appreciate their leafy retreats for more prosaic reasons .

german organizers hope they like what they see . so far , more than 500,000 tickets have been sold to the confederations cup tournament , which kicks off wednesday night when argentina plays tunisia in cologne . most of the fans will be locals , eager to get a measure of how organizers , as well as their team , are coming along ahead of the world cup next summer .
both organizers and political officials are hoping not to disappoint . the two-week tournament will be televised in 170 countries across the world , and organizers are hoping the 600,000-ticket barrier is reached some time during the tournament .
top matches like argentina and germany on june 21 and greece vs. brazil in leipzig on june 16 are already sold out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece , the surprise 2004 european champions , will be out to prove their victory was no fluke " the tournament is much more than a dress rehearsal for next year 's world cup , " fifa president joseph blatter told journalists .
" it 's a prestigious international tournament in its own right : you just have to cast an eye over the starting field . " win the confed cup , win the world cup hosts germany will be joined by mexico , japan , brazil , argentina , greece , australia and tunisia , the top teams from the world 's soccer federations .
though several teams are n't arriving with their top players - who are either injured or , like brazilian star ronaldo , " taking a rest " - coaches say each team is taking the tournament seriously .
german coach jürgen klinsmann -lrb- photo -rrb- said the tournament will be crucial to seeing how his young squad measures up against top competition , one year before it plays the world cup at home .
soccer officials have promised each player a 60,000 euro -lrb- $ 72,000 -rrb- bonus if they hoist the trophy on june 29 .
the reason ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen klinsmann wants nothing short of victory " he who wants to win the world cup , should also win the confederations cup , " said german soccer association president theo zwanziger . security also getting a test run the same philosophy might apply to german security officials .
one year before welcoming more than a million soccer fans into the country , germany 's police are eager to show the world that they can put on a peaceful tournament . the national information and cooperation center , a new body created expressly to coordinate policing activities for the 2006 tournament , will get a test run during the confederations cup .
the center will provide situation reports culled from information coming in from germany 's federal and 16 state police forces .
" we wo n't have the really big groups of -lrb- foreign -rrb- fans that we expect for the world cup , " said organizing committee vice-president wolfgang niersbach .
" but otherwise the measures in respect of security are the same … there will be an external security ring right around the stadium . " too many tournaments the heightened security measures are at the same time an acknowledgement of how far the confed cup has come since its humble beginnings as an invitation-only tournament of four teams in saudi arabia in 1992 .
but not all are happy about its progress . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ronaldo will be resting , not playing , this time around the inclusion of yet another tournament in a playing schedule that can be gruelling for top-flight players has reaped criticism from some team managers .
four mexican players , registered to play for the national team in the tournament , might not show up because of playing commitments to their clubs .
fifa has threatened to take action . " the players do n't have enough vacation , " said karl-heinz rummenigge , a german soccer legend and chairman of bundesliga champions fc bayern munich , adding that the tournament should be phased out . organizers , of course , do n't want to hear such talk now .
everyone from the local fan to the kaiser himself , world cup 2006 organizing committee chief franz beckenbauer , is singing the confed cup 's praises - and hoping the home country -lrb- and team -rrb- make a strong showing .

both organizers and political officials are hoping not to disappoint . the two-week tournament will be televised in 170 countries across the world , and organizers are hoping the 600,000-ticket barrier is reached some time during the tournament .
top matches like argentina and germany on june 21 and greece vs. brazil in leipzig on june 16 are already sold out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece , the surprise 2004 european champions , will be out to prove their victory was no fluke " the tournament is much more than a dress rehearsal for next year 's world cup , " fifa president joseph blatter told journalists .
" it 's a prestigious international tournament in its own right : you just have to cast an eye over the starting field . " win the confed cup , win the world cup hosts germany will be joined by mexico , japan , brazil , argentina , greece , australia and tunisia , the top teams from the world 's soccer federations .
though several teams are n't arriving with their top players - who are either injured or , like brazilian star ronaldo , " taking a rest " - coaches say each team is taking the tournament seriously .
german coach jürgen klinsmann -lrb- photo -rrb- said the tournament will be crucial to seeing how his young squad measures up against top competition , one year before it plays the world cup at home .
soccer officials have promised each player a 60,000 euro -lrb- $ 72,000 -rrb- bonus if they hoist the trophy on june 29 .
the reason ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen klinsmann wants nothing short of victory " he who wants to win the world cup , should also win the confederations cup , " said german soccer association president theo zwanziger . security also getting a test run the same philosophy might apply to german security officials .
one year before welcoming more than a million soccer fans into the country , germany 's police are eager to show the world that they can put on a peaceful tournament . the national information and cooperation center , a new body created expressly to coordinate policing activities for the 2006 tournament , will get a test run during the confederations cup .
the center will provide situation reports culled from information coming in from germany 's federal and 16 state police forces .
" we wo n't have the really big groups of -lrb- foreign -rrb- fans that we expect for the world cup , " said organizing committee vice-president wolfgang niersbach .
" but otherwise the measures in respect of security are the same … there will be an external security ring right around the stadium . " too many tournaments the heightened security measures are at the same time an acknowledgement of how far the confed cup has come since its humble beginnings as an invitation-only tournament of four teams in saudi arabia in 1992 .
but not all are happy about its progress . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ronaldo will be resting , not playing , this time around the inclusion of yet another tournament in a playing schedule that can be gruelling for top-flight players has reaped criticism from some team managers .
four mexican players , registered to play for the national team in the tournament , might not show up because of playing commitments to their clubs .
fifa has threatened to take action . " the players do n't have enough vacation , " said karl-heinz rummenigge , a german soccer legend and chairman of bundesliga champions fc bayern munich , adding that the tournament should be phased out . organizers , of course , do n't want to hear such talk now .
everyone from the local fan to the kaiser himself , world cup 2006 organizing committee chief franz beckenbauer , is singing the confed cup 's praises - and hoping the home country -lrb- and team -rrb- make a strong showing .
" i 'm looking forward to the tournament , " said beckenbauer .

tunisia was left rueing an early missed penalty shot that might have changed the flow of the match .
and referee roberto rosetti will probably want to review the game tape to take a second look at some of his calls .
tunisia started quick in the first half , as argentina found itself confounded by the coach roger lemerre 's disciplined backfield . still , a couple of close calls came right at the beginning , when saviola failed to get past goalie khaled fadhel in the 14th minute , and galletti 's header went above the crossbar a minute later . penalty shot on counter tunisia rarely ventured into the argentine half of the field after an initial storm of action .
when they did , it was usually on dangerous counters .

in the 32nd minute , rosetti pointed to the spot after a dubious fall by argentine defender maximiliano rodriguez .
replays showed the call was anything but 100 percent , but riquelme calmly slotted in the penalty to give argentina the lead . the gauchos played patient at the second half , giving tunisia the opportunity to come into their side of the field .
but gabriel heinze , fabricio coloccini and co. kept the door shut tight .
in the 57th minute , luciano galletti was sprung down the right side .

but according to a recent study concerning the service sector , it 's still something of a novelty in germany , though that 's rapidly changing . in the early 1900s , henry ford revolutionized manufacturing when he introduced the assembly line to build cars .
the 1980s saw the next revolution : subcontractors took over part of the manufacturing process .
outsourcing has now taken hold of the service sector , where it 's called " offshoring . "
deutsche bank and the it organization bitkom presented a study on the effects of this change for the german workforce on tuesday in berlin that suggests that german it students may want to shift their emphasis . germany 's offshoring sales volume currently amounts to about 600 million euros -lrb- $ 723 million -rrb- .
an increase of more than 20 percent is expected over the next five years , and it 's a development that ca n't be halted , according to bitkom vice president jörg menno harms . " we can decide whether we want to react to globalization passively - as victims - or actively by having a say in the future division of labor in the world , " harms said .
" offshoring should n't be a taboo topic .
we 've got to acknowledge that companies use offshoring to keep up and to improve their international competitiveness . " due to the change , young computer scientists with fresh degrees in hand are likely to discover they can only get work in the sector as highly specialized experts with experience in project management or as consultants and customer advisors .
mere programmers are simply not needed in germany , since their work is now done in india , ireland and israel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relocating jobs abroad continues to be at the heart of heated discussions in germany .
the fact that only 570 of the 4,000 companies contacted for the study participated illustrates how touchy it is .
despite promises of anonymity , many companies were concerned about their image .
but , the study actually showed that offshoring does n't necessarily have a negative effect on the jobs that remain in germany .
on the contrary , the savings allow the companies to grow and to hire more employees , harms said .
not always feasible though india is still the main destination for offshoring projects - it has 90 percent of the western european market - contractors from eastern europe are gaining ground , the study showed . " we do feel a cultural proximity to eastern european countries , " one of the study 's authors , jürgen schaaf , said .
" the great advantage the us and britain have in india is a common language .
that 's an advantage germans do n't have in india .
but in many eastern european countries , german is spoken well enough to communicate on a working level . " in its own attempts to send jobs offshore , deutsche bank discovered firsthand the importance of language for the service sector .
the bank tried to establish a call-center abroad , but ended up leaving again because customers were n't satisfied . bildunterschrift : deutsche bank chief economist norbert walter " you learn that many languages are spoken all over the world , but often in such a manner that only locals can understand them , not our customers , " said deutsche bank chief economist norbert walter -lrb- photo -rrb- . now , one of the bank 's two global call-centers is located in berlin .
the way of the future ? but it 's not only customer services , bookkeeping and personnel that are prey to offshoring .
about 40 percent of the firms questioned in the study said they 'd partly offshored research and development as well .
but in this case , cost efficiency was n't the only reason .
there just are n't enough highly specialized experts in germany and that 's what the country needs , walter said . in view of all the schools that - due to germany 's low birth rate - are expected to stand empty in the future , the country could start making a name for itself as a global contractor of education , " walter suggested .

but according to a recent study concerning the service sector , it 's still something of a novelty in germany , though that 's rapidly changing . in the early 1900s , henry ford revolutionized manufacturing when he introduced the assembly line to build cars .
the 1980s saw the next revolution : subcontractors took over part of the manufacturing process .
outsourcing has now taken hold of the service sector , where it 's called " offshoring . "
deutsche bank and the it organization bitkom presented a study on the effects of this change for the german workforce on tuesday in berlin that suggests that german it students may want to shift their emphasis . germany 's offshoring sales volume currently amounts to about 600 million euros -lrb- $ 723 million -rrb- .
an increase of more than 20 percent is expected over the next five years , and it 's a development that ca n't be halted , according to bitkom vice president jörg menno harms . " we can decide whether we want to react to globalization passively - as victims - or actively by having a say in the future division of labor in the world , " harms said .
" offshoring should n't be a taboo topic .
we 've got to acknowledge that companies use offshoring to keep up and to improve their international competitiveness . " due to the change , young computer scientists with fresh degrees in hand are likely to discover they can only get work in the sector as highly specialized experts with experience in project management or as consultants and customer advisors .
mere programmers are simply not needed in germany , since their work is now done in india , ireland and israel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relocating jobs abroad continues to be at the heart of heated discussions in germany .
the fact that only 570 of the 4,000 companies contacted for the study participated illustrates how touchy it is .
despite promises of anonymity , many companies were concerned about their image .
but , the study actually showed that offshoring does n't necessarily have a negative effect on the jobs that remain in germany .
on the contrary , the savings allow the companies to grow and to hire more employees , harms said .
not always feasible though india is still the main destination for offshoring projects - it has 90 percent of the western european market - contractors from eastern europe are gaining ground , the study showed . " we do feel a cultural proximity to eastern european countries , " one of the study 's authors , jürgen schaaf , said .
" the great advantage the us and britain have in india is a common language .
that 's an advantage germans do n't have in india .
but in many eastern european countries , german is spoken well enough to communicate on a working level . " in its own attempts to send jobs offshore , deutsche bank discovered firsthand the importance of language for the service sector .
the bank tried to establish a call-center abroad , but ended up leaving again because customers were n't satisfied . bildunterschrift : deutsche bank chief economist norbert walter " you learn that many languages are spoken all over the world , but often in such a manner that only locals can understand them , not our customers , " said deutsche bank chief economist norbert walter -lrb- photo -rrb- . now , one of the bank 's two global call-centers is located in berlin .
the way of the future ? but it 's not only customer services , bookkeeping and personnel that are prey to offshoring .
about 40 percent of the firms questioned in the study said they 'd partly offshored research and development as well .
but in this case , cost efficiency was n't the only reason .
there just are n't enough highly specialized experts in germany and that 's what the country needs , walter said . in view of all the schools that - due to germany 's low birth rate - are expected to stand empty in the future , the country could start making a name for itself as a global contractor of education , " walter suggested .
germany could make a name for itself for " inshoring " instead of offshoring . sabine kinkartz -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de giving globalization a coy voice what would happen if india 's formidable army of call center operators dropped their professional tone and got personal on the phone ?
a german artist group is looking for the answer with their project , " call cutta . "

fears are growing that the european union summit on thursday and friday in brussels will not resolve the bloc 's most pressing problems .
dw-world explains the two issues the heads of government and state will tackle . the budget the summit will aim to agree on the eu 's budgetary framework for 2007-2012 .
the so-called net contributors - including germany , the netherlands and sweden - which put more into the eu coffers than they get back , want to cut their payments and limit spending to no more than one percent of the bloc 's gross national income . in the run-up to the summit , britain has come under fire from eu leaders headed by french president jacques chirac for refusing to freeze the rebate it negotiated in 1984 , when it was the bloc 's poorest member .
currently , the rebate totals an average of 4.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.55 billion -rrb- annually , and almost 10 percent of it is now paid by the poorer eu members from eastern europe who joined last year .
british prime minister tony blair has been adamant that his country will not give way on the rebate unless agriculture subsidies , from which britain hardly profits , are subjected to drastic cuts .
france 's chirac has categorically ruled out any reduction in the subsidies , which his country 's farmers rely on . the european constitution the eu leaders will also debate what to do about the bloc constitution in the wake of french and dutch rejection of the document in may 29 and june 1 referendums .
the constitution was meant to help combat the unwieldy decision-making process in the enlarged bloc of 25 countries and 455 million people .
it can not be ratified without approval from all eu states . the summit participants may decide the treaty ca n't be ratified at all or call member states to go ahead with votes to see what the final results bring .
several eu leaders have called for the ratification process to be extended beyond the two-year period originally foreseen ; it was initially expected to be implemented in november 2006 .
the leaders could also indefinitely delay ratification .
it 's unlikely they will decide to renegotiate the treaty , as its drafting was a long and difficult process the first time round .

fears are growing that the european union summit on thursday and friday in brussels will not resolve the bloc 's most pressing problems .
dw-world explains the two issues the heads of government and state will tackle . the budget the summit will aim to agree on the eu 's budgetary framework for 2007-2012 .
the so-called net contributors - including germany , the netherlands and sweden - which put more into the eu coffers than they get back , want to cut their payments and limit spending to no more than one percent of the bloc 's gross national income . in the run-up to the summit , britain has come under fire from eu leaders headed by french president jacques chirac for refusing to freeze the rebate it negotiated in 1984 , when it was the bloc 's poorest member .
currently , the rebate totals an average of 4.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.55 billion -rrb- annually , and almost 10 percent of it is now paid by the poorer eu members from eastern europe who joined last year .
british prime minister tony blair has been adamant that his country will not give way on the rebate unless agriculture subsidies , from which britain hardly profits , are subjected to drastic cuts .
france 's chirac has categorically ruled out any reduction in the subsidies , which his country 's farmers rely on . the european constitution the eu leaders will also debate what to do about the bloc constitution in the wake of french and dutch rejection of the document in may 29 and june 1 referendums .
the constitution was meant to help combat the unwieldy decision-making process in the enlarged bloc of 25 countries and 455 million people .
it can not be ratified without approval from all eu states . the summit participants may decide the treaty ca n't be ratified at all or call member states to go ahead with votes to see what the final results bring .
several eu leaders have called for the ratification process to be extended beyond the two-year period originally foreseen ; it was initially expected to be implemented in november 2006 .
the leaders could also indefinitely delay ratification .
it 's unlikely they will decide to renegotiate the treaty , as its drafting was a long and difficult process the first time round .
observers warn that the summit might not result in any progress at all . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german duo squeezed in brussels german chancellor gerhard schröder has appealed for unity and compromise at this week 's european union summit in brussels .

german organizers hope they like what they see . so far , more than 500,000 tickets have been sold to the confederations cup tournament , which kicks off wednesday night when argentina plays tunisia in cologne . most of the fans will be locals , eager to get a measure of how organizers , as well as their team , are coming along ahead of the world cup next summer .
both organizers and political officials are hoping not to disappoint . the two-week tournament will be televised in 170 countries across the world , and organizers are hoping the 600,000-ticket barrier is reached some time during the tournament .
top matches like argentina and germany on june 21 and greece vs. brazil in leipzig on june 16 are already sold out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece , the surprise 2004 european champions , will be out to prove their victory was no fluke " the tournament is much more than a dress rehearsal for next year 's world cup , " fifa president joseph blatter told journalists .
" it 's a prestigious international tournament in its own right : you just have to cast an eye over the starting field . " win the confed cup , win the world cup hosts germany will be joined by mexico , japan , brazil , argentina , greece , australia and tunisia , the top teams from the world 's soccer federations .
though several teams are n't arriving with their top players - who are either injured or , like brazilian star ronaldo , " taking a rest " - coaches say each team is taking the tournament seriously .
german coach jürgen klinsmann -lrb- photo -rrb- said the tournament will be crucial to seeing how his young squad measures up against top competition , one year before it plays the world cup at home .
soccer officials have promised each player a 60,000 euro -lrb- $ 72,000 -rrb- bonus if they hoist the trophy on june 29 .
the reason ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen klinsmann wants nothing short of victory " he who wants to win the world cup , should also win the confederations cup , " said german soccer association president theo zwanziger . security also getting a test run the same philosophy might apply to german security officials .
one year before welcoming more than a million soccer fans into the country , germany 's police are eager to show the world that they can put on a peaceful tournament . the national information and cooperation center , a new body created expressly to coordinate policing activities for the 2006 tournament , will get a test run during the confederations cup .
the center will provide situation reports culled from information coming in from germany 's federal and 16 state police forces .
" we wo n't have the really big groups of -lrb- foreign -rrb- fans that we expect for the world cup , " said organizing committee vice-president wolfgang niersbach .
" but otherwise the measures in respect of security are the same … there will be an external security ring right around the stadium . " too many tournaments the heightened security measures are at the same time an acknowledgement of how far the confed cup has come since its humble beginnings as an invitation-only tournament of four teams in saudi arabia in 1992 .
but not all are happy about its progress . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ronaldo will be resting , not playing , this time around the inclusion of yet another tournament in a playing schedule that can be gruelling for top-flight players has reaped criticism from some team managers .
four mexican players , registered to play for the national team in the tournament , might not show up because of playing commitments to their clubs .
fifa has threatened to take action . " the players do n't have enough vacation , " said karl-heinz rummenigge , a german soccer legend and chairman of bundesliga champions fc bayern munich , adding that the tournament should be phased out . organizers , of course , do n't want to hear such talk now .
everyone from the local fan to the kaiser himself , world cup 2006 organizing committee chief franz beckenbauer , is singing the confed cup 's praises - and hoping the home country -lrb- and team -rrb- make a strong showing .

germany faces off against australia in the second match .
who has the best shot ? argentina - tunisia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : striker javier saviola , nicknamed " the rabbit " , is a massive goal-scoring threat though playing without stars hernan crespo , roberto ayala and juan sebastian veron , argentina is one of those countries that produces soccer talent like other countries produce co2 emissions .
coach jose pekerman still has javier saviola , juan roman riquelme , javier zanetti , and defender gabriel heinze to pick from , all of whom will figure prominently in the gauchos ' attacking style .
high off of a 3-1 spanking of brazil in the world cup qualifying rounds that secured them a spot in the 2006 world cup , argentina comes into the confederations cup tournament playing well enough to earn its " favorite " status . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : silva has been a serious threat ever since tunisia one the africa cup tunisia 's star player is its coach , the frenchman roger lemerre , who won the european championship with france in 2000 , and the confederations cup a year later .
lemerre has the tunisians playing tight and disciplined in the back , waiting for the chance to counter .
when they do , it 's usually over the wings - a mirror image of argentina 's style - and to francileude dos santos silva .
the native brazilian , who took tunisian citizenship just before the africa cup last year , became the tournament 's shooting star .
now , he 's ready to make problems for the big names in the confederations cup .
" on paper , we have no chance against germany and argentina , " said lemerre .
" but you never know . " possible lineup : tunisia - boumnijel - trabelsi , jaidi , abdi , clayton - ghodhbane , nafti , ben saada , mnari - santos , jaziri argentina - leo franco - coloccini , milito , heinze - j. zanetti , cambiasso , bernardi , sorin - riquelme - tevez , saviola germany - australia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kevin kuranyi will have to show he 's up to shouldering the goal-scoring burden germany comes into the tournament with a number of questions : can the strikers score goals ?
will the young defense stand up against major international competition ?
as a matter of fact , will the rest of the team stand up to major international competition ?
because it is hosting the world cup next year , germany has been spared the intensity and pressure of qualification .
as a result , coach jürgen klinsmann has been allowed to juggle around all sorts of lineup changes in the team 's friendly matches .
after this tournament , that should end .
tonight 's match against australia will be a chance for the strikers , most likely kevin kuranyi and gerald asamoah , to show their mettle in klinsmann 's offense-oriented playing style .
the german defense , who all hover around the age of 22 , will also have to prove itself - klinsmann ended practice this week with extra work for the defenders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : australia has a chance to surprise others at the tournament , but only a small one .
the definite underdog in this match-up , australia , is nevertheless a team with big dreams .
their past confed cup performances give them good reason to hope .
the team finished second in riyadh in 1997 , playing their way into the final before getting walloped by brazil .
in 2001 , in south korea and japan , the team beat brazil 1-0 to win third place and get their revenge .
coach frank farina remains confident : " we believe in ourselves , " he told reporters the other day .
his side is arguably one of the better ones in recent years , even without liverpool striker harry kewell , who is injured .
midfielders tim cahill , brett merton and striker mark viduka all play in the english premiership .
cahill will be responsible for directing the " socceroos " attack , and will look to take advantage of germany 's maligned and relatively slow defense .
the everton midfielder also remains a goal-scoring threat , notching 12 for his club as it marched to a champion 's league qualifying spot and seven for his country in as many appearances .
captian craig moore will anchor the defense . possible lineup : germany - kahn - b. schneider , a. friedrich , mertesacker , hitzlsperger - frings - deisler , schweinsteiger - ballack - kuranyi , podolski australia - schwarzer - neill , popovic , moore , muscat - milicevic - chipperfield , skoko , emerton - cahill - viduka dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the mini-world cup kicks off hundreds of thousands of fans will follow the fortunes of eight teams at five stadiums across germany over the next two weeks .

but according to a recent study concerning the service sector , it 's still something of a novelty in germany , though that 's rapidly changing . in the early 1900s , henry ford revolutionized manufacturing when he introduced the assembly line to build cars .
the 1980s saw the next revolution : subcontractors took over part of the manufacturing process .
outsourcing has now taken hold of the service sector , where it 's called " offshoring . "
deutsche bank and the it organization bitkom presented a study on the effects of this change for the german workforce on tuesday in berlin that suggests that german it students may want to shift their emphasis . germany 's offshoring sales volume currently amounts to about 600 million euros -lrb- $ 723 million -rrb- .
an increase of more than 20 percent is expected over the next five years , and it 's a development that ca n't be halted , according to bitkom vice president jörg menno harms . " we can decide whether we want to react to globalization passively - as victims - or actively by having a say in the future division of labor in the world , " harms said .
" offshoring should n't be a taboo topic .
we 've got to acknowledge that companies use offshoring to keep up and to improve their international competitiveness . " due to the change , young computer scientists with fresh degrees in hand are likely to discover they can only get work in the sector as highly specialized experts with experience in project management or as consultants and customer advisors .
mere programmers are simply not needed in germany , since their work is now done in india , ireland and israel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relocating jobs abroad continues to be at the heart of heated discussions in germany .
the fact that only 570 of the 4,000 companies contacted for the study participated illustrates how touchy it is .
despite promises of anonymity , many companies were concerned about their image .
but , the study actually showed that offshoring does n't necessarily have a negative effect on the jobs that remain in germany .
on the contrary , the savings allow the companies to grow and to hire more employees , harms said .
not always feasible though india is still the main destination for offshoring projects - it has 90 percent of the western european market - contractors from eastern europe are gaining ground , the study showed . " we do feel a cultural proximity to eastern european countries , " one of the study 's authors , jürgen schaaf , said .
" the great advantage the us and britain have in india is a common language .
that 's an advantage germans do n't have in india .
but in many eastern european countries , german is spoken well enough to communicate on a working level . " in its own attempts to send jobs offshore , deutsche bank discovered firsthand the importance of language for the service sector .
the bank tried to establish a call-center abroad , but ended up leaving again because customers were n't satisfied . bildunterschrift : deutsche bank chief economist norbert walter " you learn that many languages are spoken all over the world , but often in such a manner that only locals can understand them , not our customers , " said deutsche bank chief economist norbert walter -lrb- photo -rrb- . now , one of the bank 's two global call-centers is located in berlin .
the way of the future ? but it 's not only customer services , bookkeeping and personnel that are prey to offshoring .
about 40 percent of the firms questioned in the study said they 'd partly offshored research and development as well .
but in this case , cost efficiency was n't the only reason .
there just are n't enough highly specialized experts in germany and that 's what the country needs , walter said . in view of all the schools that - due to germany 's low birth rate - are expected to stand empty in the future , the country could start making a name for itself as a global contractor of education , " walter suggested .
germany could make a name for itself for " inshoring " instead of offshoring . sabine kinkartz -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de giving globalization a coy voice what would happen if india 's formidable army of call center operators dropped their professional tone and got personal on the phone ?

germany faces off against australia in the second match .
who has the best shot ? argentina - tunisia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : striker javier saviola , nicknamed " the rabbit " , is a massive goal-scoring threat though playing without stars hernan crespo , roberto ayala and juan sebastian veron , argentina is one of those countries that produces soccer talent like other countries produce co2 emissions .
coach jose pekerman still has javier saviola , juan roman riquelme , javier zanetti , and defender gabriel heinze to pick from , all of whom will figure prominently in the gauchos ' attacking style .
high off of a 3-1 spanking of brazil in the world cup qualifying rounds that secured them a spot in the 2006 world cup , argentina comes into the confederations cup tournament playing well enough to earn its " favorite " status . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : silva has been a serious threat ever since tunisia one the africa cup tunisia 's star player is its coach , the frenchman roger lemerre , who won the european championship with france in 2000 , and the confederations cup a year later .
lemerre has the tunisians playing tight and disciplined in the back , waiting for the chance to counter .
when they do , it 's usually over the wings - a mirror image of argentina 's style - and to francileude dos santos silva .
the native brazilian , who took tunisian citizenship just before the africa cup last year , became the tournament 's shooting star .
now , he 's ready to make problems for the big names in the confederations cup .
" on paper , we have no chance against germany and argentina , " said lemerre .
" but you never know . " possible lineup : tunisia - boumnijel - trabelsi , jaidi , abdi , clayton - ghodhbane , nafti , ben saada , mnari - santos , jaziri argentina - leo franco - coloccini , milito , heinze - j. zanetti , cambiasso , bernardi , sorin - riquelme - tevez , saviola germany - australia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kevin kuranyi will have to show he 's up to shouldering the goal-scoring burden germany comes into the tournament with a number of questions : can the strikers score goals ?
will the young defense stand up against major international competition ?
as a matter of fact , will the rest of the team stand up to major international competition ?
because it is hosting the world cup next year , germany has been spared the intensity and pressure of qualification .
as a result , coach jürgen klinsmann has been allowed to juggle around all sorts of lineup changes in the team 's friendly matches .
after this tournament , that should end .
tonight 's match against australia will be a chance for the strikers , most likely kevin kuranyi and gerald asamoah , to show their mettle in klinsmann 's offense-oriented playing style .
the german defense , who all hover around the age of 22 , will also have to prove itself - klinsmann ended practice this week with extra work for the defenders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : australia has a chance to surprise others at the tournament , but only a small one .
the definite underdog in this match-up , australia , is nevertheless a team with big dreams .
their past confed cup performances give them good reason to hope .
the team finished second in riyadh in 1997 , playing their way into the final before getting walloped by brazil .
in 2001 , in south korea and japan , the team beat brazil 1-0 to win third place and get their revenge .
coach frank farina remains confident : " we believe in ourselves , " he told reporters the other day .
his side is arguably one of the better ones in recent years , even without liverpool striker harry kewell , who is injured .
midfielders tim cahill , brett merton and striker mark viduka all play in the english premiership .
cahill will be responsible for directing the " socceroos " attack , and will look to take advantage of germany 's maligned and relatively slow defense .
the everton midfielder also remains a goal-scoring threat , notching 12 for his club as it marched to a champion 's league qualifying spot and seven for his country in as many appearances .
captian craig moore will anchor the defense . possible lineup : germany - kahn - b. schneider , a. friedrich , mertesacker , hitzlsperger - frings - deisler , schweinsteiger - ballack - kuranyi , podolski australia - schwarzer - neill , popovic , moore , muscat - milicevic - chipperfield , skoko , emerton - cahill - viduka dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the mini-world cup kicks off hundreds of thousands of fans will follow the fortunes of eight teams at five stadiums across germany over the next two weeks .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 15.06.2005 invasion of the healthy hedonists großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : residents keep their eyes peeled for anyone breaking the rules young people are no longer spending their sundays nursing hangovers in front of the tv .
they head out to their private allotments to tend to their vegetables .
so when did that most suburban of activities become so hip ? undeterred by the bracing easterly wind , dirk ziegler is deadheading his geraniums .
" it 's good to get outside at the weekend , " exclaims the 35-year-old father-of-two as he surveys his modest kingdom .
raising his voice above the roar of a passing train , he shrugs off the obvious downsides of the urban garden .
" having an allotment in the center of town is perfect because it 's so easy to reach - and it 's great for the kids to have somewhere to play , " he says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dirk is part of a wider movement of 30-somethings who 've tired of late nights in smoky clubs and want to get back to nature . three years ago , he and his girlfriend leased a garden allotment in prenzlauer berg - a district in central berlin more commonly associated with fashionable bars and boutiques - and they 've never looked back .
" allotments have become trendy " , confirmed jürgen hurt , president of the berlin association for gardeners in an interview with the daily berliner zeitung .
according to a study conducted by the association , the average age of tenants has dropped from 56 to 46 in the last six years .
the " schrebergarten " -lrb- allotment -rrb- phenomenon , born a century ago , was named after the leipzig-based doctor daniel schreber - a staunch believer in exercise in the great outdoors for pasty-faced city children .
plots of land leased from the state became increasingly popular with tenants seeking gardens for their young , plus an opportunity to stock up their pantries with home-grown garden produce .
meet the weekend warriors today , pedestrians on the busy bornholmer bridge , which earned its place in history as the first border-crossing to be opened to east germans back in 1989 , can look down on the " garden colony " where dirk and his family now spend most of their free time .
flanked by railway lines and shopping malls , it 's a haven of tranquillity in an otherwise bleak urban landscape .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rosy-cheeked garden gnomes preside over well-kept lawns , framed by rows of flourishing hollyhocks and crispy-looking lettuces .
if it were n't for the not-so-distant hum of traffic , it would be a rural idyll .
but what 's most striking is that few of the residents are lounging around with a beer and the sports section of the sunday paper - they 're all getting their hands dirty .
" i put in at least ten hours of work a week , " says dirk , who 's been digging in his flower-bed all day .
his neighbor is busy putting up a trellis , while across the way , mrs sturmer is fixing her roof .
she 's part of the colony 's elder generation , who can remember a time when allotments were about survival rather than leisure .
" my allotment has been in the family for three generations , " she explained .
" my grandfather leased it during the recession in the 1920s , when people in the city really needed their allotments .
back then , it was a necessity , because if you did n't grow your own vegetables , you did n't have any . "
dig it ?
but times have changed , and these days , growing your own spinach is a lifestyle choice .
herbaceous borders are hipper than prada pumps .
in the uk , the times has even dubbed gardening " the new sex . "
so if you think weeding , digging and planting is for frustrated housewives , think again .
bildunterschrift : for just a few hundred euros a year , some 4 million germans enjoy the pastoral perks of an allotment garden , and waiting lists are long .
experts say this love affair with all things horticultural is a sign of the times .
" allotments used to be seen as conventional and boring , but not anymore , " said trend researcher eike wenzel .
it 's not even that vacations are a luxury few can afford when 5 million germans are unemployed .
" it does n't actually have anything to do with the country 's financial difficulties , " he said .
" it 's more about getting back to nature - the satisfaction of doing things yourself and using your hands . "
he would even go so far as to say it reflects a slow shift in values .
" it ties in with a return to tradition and a desire for a slower pace of life .
the 1990s were a very stormy decade of accelerated technology , modernization and digitalization , " he explained .
" but people now feel that they 've been disappointed by these developments and what they really want is a grounded family life and old-fashioned values .
bonding with nature is a key factor in that shift . "
urban refugees bildunterschrift : most of berlin 's 840 garden colonies are made up of 20 to 100 plots , each roughly 300 meters square , overseen by a highly authoritative residents ' association .
its job is to make sure everyone sticks to the rules , which range from keeping the noise down between midday and 3 p.m. to making sure trees never grow beyond a prescribed height and using at least one third of the garden as a vegetable patch .
" you have to fit in , and if you do n't like it , you should n't bother coming here , " says frau sturmer in no uncertain terms .
" young families have to adjust to the rules like everyone else . "
and most of them do .
an allotment garden is a coveted commodity , and not even the younger generation is prepared to risk being banished for bad behavior .
according to wenzel , germany 's new outdoor types are a conscientious bunch .
they have consumer clout , believe in buying organic , and - reflecting the trend to domestic tourism - they 're more likely to go on an eco-friendly holiday to germany 's baltic coast than a package tour to thailand .
the lohas " in advertising , there 's a lot of talk of what 's called lohas - lifestyle of health and sustainability , " he explained .
" we predict that in future , more and more germans will be living in a way that 's environmentally responsible - but enjoying themselves in the process .
the healthy hedonists are idealistic and political correct , but they 're also pleasure-seeking . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but while the healthy hedonists draw spiritual satisfaction from watching their carrots grow , the old-school allotment residents appreciate their leafy retreats for more prosaic reasons .

who has the best shot ? argentina - tunisia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : striker javier saviola , nicknamed " the rabbit " , is a massive goal-scoring threat though playing without stars hernan crespo , roberto ayala and juan sebastian veron , argentina is one of those countries that produces soccer talent like other countries produce co2 emissions .
coach jose pekerman still has javier saviola , juan roman riquelme , javier zanetti , and defender gabriel heinze to pick from , all of whom will figure prominently in the gauchos ' attacking style .
high off of a 3-1 spanking of brazil in the world cup qualifying rounds that secured them a spot in the 2006 world cup , argentina comes into the confederations cup tournament playing well enough to earn its " favorite " status . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : silva has been a serious threat ever since tunisia one the africa cup tunisia 's star player is its coach , the frenchman roger lemerre , who won the european championship with france in 2000 , and the confederations cup a year later .
lemerre has the tunisians playing tight and disciplined in the back , waiting for the chance to counter .
when they do , it 's usually over the wings - a mirror image of argentina 's style - and to francileude dos santos silva .
the native brazilian , who took tunisian citizenship just before the africa cup last year , became the tournament 's shooting star .
now , he 's ready to make problems for the big names in the confederations cup .
" on paper , we have no chance against germany and argentina , " said lemerre .
" but you never know . " possible lineup : tunisia - boumnijel - trabelsi , jaidi , abdi , clayton - ghodhbane , nafti , ben saada , mnari - santos , jaziri argentina - leo franco - coloccini , milito , heinze - j. zanetti , cambiasso , bernardi , sorin - riquelme - tevez , saviola germany - australia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kevin kuranyi will have to show he 's up to shouldering the goal-scoring burden germany comes into the tournament with a number of questions : can the strikers score goals ?
will the young defense stand up against major international competition ?
as a matter of fact , will the rest of the team stand up to major international competition ?
because it is hosting the world cup next year , germany has been spared the intensity and pressure of qualification .
as a result , coach jürgen klinsmann has been allowed to juggle around all sorts of lineup changes in the team 's friendly matches .
after this tournament , that should end .
tonight 's match against australia will be a chance for the strikers , most likely kevin kuranyi and gerald asamoah , to show their mettle in klinsmann 's offense-oriented playing style .
the german defense , who all hover around the age of 22 , will also have to prove itself - klinsmann ended practice this week with extra work for the defenders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : australia has a chance to surprise others at the tournament , but only a small one .
the definite underdog in this match-up , australia , is nevertheless a team with big dreams .
their past confed cup performances give them good reason to hope .
the team finished second in riyadh in 1997 , playing their way into the final before getting walloped by brazil .
in 2001 , in south korea and japan , the team beat brazil 1-0 to win third place and get their revenge .
coach frank farina remains confident : " we believe in ourselves , " he told reporters the other day .
his side is arguably one of the better ones in recent years , even without liverpool striker harry kewell , who is injured .
midfielders tim cahill , brett merton and striker mark viduka all play in the english premiership .
cahill will be responsible for directing the " socceroos " attack , and will look to take advantage of germany 's maligned and relatively slow defense .
the everton midfielder also remains a goal-scoring threat , notching 12 for his club as it marched to a champion 's league qualifying spot and seven for his country in as many appearances .
captian craig moore will anchor the defense . possible lineup : germany - kahn - b. schneider , a. friedrich , mertesacker , hitzlsperger - frings - deisler , schweinsteiger - ballack - kuranyi , podolski australia - schwarzer - neill , popovic , moore , muscat - milicevic - chipperfield , skoko , emerton - cahill - viduka dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the mini-world cup kicks off hundreds of thousands of fans will follow the fortunes of eight teams at five stadiums across germany over the next two weeks .

everyone was pleased with bringing home the three points but the porous defense is turning into a serious problem . for the 48,000 fans at the sold out waldstadion in frankfurt , germany 's opening match victory against australia was largely entertaining , if not at times nerve-wracking .
a soccer coach would have pulled out his or her hair , wondering how a team can suffer such lapses of concentration . " winning the opening match and the three points are very important , " said germany coach jürgen klinsmann , " but we also know some things did n't work optimally . " namely , giving up two first-half equalizers to the socceroos and then also a goal in stoppage time , but fortunately at that point , klinsmann 's squad had a two-goal advantage . six minutes of excitement bildunterschrift : australia 's josip skoko -lrb- yellow -rrb- squeezes the ball under germany 's jumping wall the first 15 minutes of the match were uneventful with both sides walking on pins and needles , playing stiffly .
kevin kuranyi 's goal in the 17th minute started what would be a toe-to-toe punchout in the following six minutes . before the fans could sit back down after celebrating the newly-acquired striker by schalke , germany 's central defender robert huth mugged john aloisi unnecessarily outside the german penalty box .
josip skoko took the free-kick and instead of lifting the ball , he kept it on the ground .
that was unfortunate because the wall jumped and watched the leather roll under their feet .
after 19 minutes , the score stood 1-1 . germany roared right back , with per mertesacker the benefactor of some sloppy defending by the australian defense and scored in the 23rd minute .
it was his first goal with the national squad , leaving many of the fans rubbing their eyes as their squad decided that attacking soccer , hardly what germany has been known for the past decade and a half , would bring success . since taking over last july , jürgen klinsmann promised more offense from the german team and he has held true to his promise .
at a cost , namely a porous defense . amateurish defense bildunterschrift : germany 's michael ballack -lrb- right -rrb- converts a penalty kick to put his side ahead 3-2 eight minutes after resecuring the lead , some very sharp passing and flat-footed defending allowed australia to get a second equalizer .
this time john aloisi beat his defender easily to streak into the penalty box and beat kahn .
the remainder of the second half , germany played insecurely and receiving a few catcalls when the referee carlos amarilla blew his whistle to end the first half . coming out of the locker room , germany were rejuvenated and put australia 's back against the wall .
it paid off in the 60th minute when arne friedrich , one of germany 's best players in the match , drew a penalty .
team captain michael ballack stepped and calmly sunk the spot kick and germany led 3-2 . the goal broke the australian resistance as the teams who both had expended much energy in the first hour , slowed the pace down .
the game started getting sloppy as passes frequently landed on an opponent 's foot or out of bounds . podolski secures victory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john aloisi scores australia 's second equalizer , getting past defender robert huth to do so lukas podolski was less affected by the fast pace .
in the 88th minute , he scored what would turn out to be the gamewinning goal after a strong run by ballack .
the two-goal lead was a relief to the sell-out crowd who could finally start singing after a night filled more with wonderment as the mostly unknown socceroos put world soccer power germany through the paces .
but it was almost not enough . in stoppage time , the german backline fell asleep as it did against russia one week ago .
aloisi again could break free and scored as the defenders wondered how he got behind them . the fans then had to wait only another 30 seconds before amarilla blew the final whistle and they could breathe a collective sigh of relief . klinsmann has promised excitement and that is what they got . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de argentina dominates tunisia in opener argentina played a superior game against tunisia , winning 2-1 with the help of a penalty kick and a nicely-played second goal .

after 19 minutes , the score stood 1-1 . germany roared right back , with per mertesacker the benefactor of some sloppy defending by the australian defense and scored in the 23rd minute .
it was his first goal with the national squad , leaving many of the fans rubbing their eyes as their squad decided that attacking soccer , hardly what germany has been known for the past decade and a half , would bring success . since taking over last july , jürgen klinsmann promised more offense from the german team and he has held true to his promise .
at a cost , namely a porous defense . amateurish defense bildunterschrift : germany 's michael ballack -lrb- right -rrb- converts a penalty kick to put his side ahead 3-2 eight minutes after resecuring the lead , some very sharp passing and flat-footed defending allowed australia to get a second equalizer .
this time john aloisi beat his defender easily to streak into the penalty box and beat kahn .
the remainder of the second half , germany played insecurely and receiving a few catcalls when the referee carlos amarilla blew his whistle to end the first half . coming out of the locker room , germany were rejuvenated and put australia 's back against the wall .
it paid off in the 60th minute when arne friedrich , one of germany 's best players in the match , drew a penalty .
team captain michael ballack stepped and calmly sunk the spot kick and germany led 3-2 . the goal broke the australian resistance as the teams who both had expended much energy in the first hour , slowed the pace down .
the game started getting sloppy as passes frequently landed on an opponent 's foot or out of bounds . podolski secures victory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john aloisi scores australia 's second equalizer , getting past defender robert huth to do so lukas podolski was less affected by the fast pace .
in the 88th minute , he scored what would turn out to be the gamewinning goal after a strong run by ballack .
the two-goal lead was a relief to the sell-out crowd who could finally start singing after a night filled more with wonderment as the mostly unknown socceroos put world soccer power germany through the paces .
but it was almost not enough . in stoppage time , the german backline fell asleep as it did against russia one week ago .
aloisi again could break free and scored as the defenders wondered how he got behind them . the fans then had to wait only another 30 seconds before amarilla blew the final whistle and they could breathe a collective sigh of relief . klinsmann has promised excitement and that is what they got . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de argentina dominates tunisia in opener argentina played a superior game against tunisia , winning 2-1 with the help of a penalty kick and a nicely-played second goal .

german organizers hope they like what they see . so far , more than 500,000 tickets have been sold to the confederations cup tournament , which kicks off wednesday night when argentina plays tunisia in cologne . most of the fans will be locals , eager to get a measure of how organizers , as well as their team , are coming along ahead of the world cup next summer .
both organizers and political officials are hoping not to disappoint . the two-week tournament will be televised in 170 countries across the world , and organizers are hoping the 600,000-ticket barrier is reached some time during the tournament .
top matches like argentina and germany on june 21 and greece vs. brazil in leipzig on june 16 are already sold out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece , the surprise 2004 european champions , will be out to prove their victory was no fluke " the tournament is much more than a dress rehearsal for next year 's world cup , " fifa president joseph blatter told journalists .
" it 's a prestigious international tournament in its own right : you just have to cast an eye over the starting field . " win the confed cup , win the world cup hosts germany will be joined by mexico , japan , brazil , argentina , greece , australia and tunisia , the top teams from the world 's soccer federations .
though several teams are n't arriving with their top players - who are either injured or , like brazilian star ronaldo , " taking a rest " - coaches say each team is taking the tournament seriously .
german coach jürgen klinsmann -lrb- photo -rrb- said the tournament will be crucial to seeing how his young squad measures up against top competition , one year before it plays the world cup at home .
soccer officials have promised each player a 60,000 euro -lrb- $ 72,000 -rrb- bonus if they hoist the trophy on june 29 .
the reason ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen klinsmann wants nothing short of victory " he who wants to win the world cup , should also win the confederations cup , " said german soccer association president theo zwanziger . security also getting a test run the same philosophy might apply to german security officials .
one year before welcoming more than a million soccer fans into the country , germany 's police are eager to show the world that they can put on a peaceful tournament . the national information and cooperation center , a new body created expressly to coordinate policing activities for the 2006 tournament , will get a test run during the confederations cup .
the center will provide situation reports culled from information coming in from germany 's federal and 16 state police forces .
" we wo n't have the really big groups of -lrb- foreign -rrb- fans that we expect for the world cup , " said organizing committee vice-president wolfgang niersbach .
" but otherwise the measures in respect of security are the same … there will be an external security ring right around the stadium . " too many tournaments the heightened security measures are at the same time an acknowledgement of how far the confed cup has come since its humble beginnings as an invitation-only tournament of four teams in saudi arabia in 1992 .
but not all are happy about its progress . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ronaldo will be resting , not playing , this time around the inclusion of yet another tournament in a playing schedule that can be gruelling for top-flight players has reaped criticism from some team managers .
four mexican players , registered to play for the national team in the tournament , might not show up because of playing commitments to their clubs .
fifa has threatened to take action . " the players do n't have enough vacation , " said karl-heinz rummenigge , a german soccer legend and chairman of bundesliga champions fc bayern munich , adding that the tournament should be phased out . organizers , of course , do n't want to hear such talk now .
everyone from the local fan to the kaiser himself , world cup 2006 organizing committee chief franz beckenbauer , is singing the confed cup 's praises - and hoping the home country -lrb- and team -rrb- make a strong showing .
" i 'm looking forward to the tournament , " said beckenbauer .

germany faces off against australia in the second match .
who has the best shot ? argentina - tunisia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : striker javier saviola , nicknamed " the rabbit " , is a massive goal-scoring threat though playing without stars hernan crespo , roberto ayala and juan sebastian veron , argentina is one of those countries that produces soccer talent like other countries produce co2 emissions .
coach jose pekerman still has javier saviola , juan roman riquelme , javier zanetti , and defender gabriel heinze to pick from , all of whom will figure prominently in the gauchos ' attacking style .
high off of a 3-1 spanking of brazil in the world cup qualifying rounds that secured them a spot in the 2006 world cup , argentina comes into the confederations cup tournament playing well enough to earn its " favorite " status . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : silva has been a serious threat ever since tunisia one the africa cup tunisia 's star player is its coach , the frenchman roger lemerre , who won the european championship with france in 2000 , and the confederations cup a year later .
lemerre has the tunisians playing tight and disciplined in the back , waiting for the chance to counter .
when they do , it 's usually over the wings - a mirror image of argentina 's style - and to francileude dos santos silva .
the native brazilian , who took tunisian citizenship just before the africa cup last year , became the tournament 's shooting star .
now , he 's ready to make problems for the big names in the confederations cup .
" on paper , we have no chance against germany and argentina , " said lemerre .
" but you never know . " possible lineup : tunisia - boumnijel - trabelsi , jaidi , abdi , clayton - ghodhbane , nafti , ben saada , mnari - santos , jaziri argentina - leo franco - coloccini , milito , heinze - j. zanetti , cambiasso , bernardi , sorin - riquelme - tevez , saviola germany - australia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kevin kuranyi will have to show he 's up to shouldering the goal-scoring burden germany comes into the tournament with a number of questions : can the strikers score goals ?
will the young defense stand up against major international competition ?
as a matter of fact , will the rest of the team stand up to major international competition ?
because it is hosting the world cup next year , germany has been spared the intensity and pressure of qualification .
as a result , coach jürgen klinsmann has been allowed to juggle around all sorts of lineup changes in the team 's friendly matches .
after this tournament , that should end .
tonight 's match against australia will be a chance for the strikers , most likely kevin kuranyi and gerald asamoah , to show their mettle in klinsmann 's offense-oriented playing style .
the german defense , who all hover around the age of 22 , will also have to prove itself - klinsmann ended practice this week with extra work for the defenders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : australia has a chance to surprise others at the tournament , but only a small one .
the definite underdog in this match-up , australia , is nevertheless a team with big dreams .
their past confed cup performances give them good reason to hope .
the team finished second in riyadh in 1997 , playing their way into the final before getting walloped by brazil .
in 2001 , in south korea and japan , the team beat brazil 1-0 to win third place and get their revenge .
coach frank farina remains confident : " we believe in ourselves , " he told reporters the other day .
his side is arguably one of the better ones in recent years , even without liverpool striker harry kewell , who is injured .
midfielders tim cahill , brett merton and striker mark viduka all play in the english premiership .
cahill will be responsible for directing the " socceroos " attack , and will look to take advantage of germany 's maligned and relatively slow defense .
the everton midfielder also remains a goal-scoring threat , notching 12 for his club as it marched to a champion 's league qualifying spot and seven for his country in as many appearances .
captian craig moore will anchor the defense . possible lineup : germany - kahn - b. schneider , a. friedrich , mertesacker , hitzlsperger - frings - deisler , schweinsteiger - ballack - kuranyi , podolski australia - schwarzer - neill , popovic , moore , muscat - milicevic - chipperfield , skoko , emerton - cahill - viduka dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the mini-world cup kicks off hundreds of thousands of fans will follow the fortunes of eight teams at five stadiums across germany over the next two weeks .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 15.06.2005 invasion of the healthy hedonists großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : residents keep their eyes peeled for anyone breaking the rules young people are no longer spending their sundays nursing hangovers in front of the tv .
they head out to their private allotments to tend to their vegetables .
so when did that most suburban of activities become so hip ? undeterred by the bracing easterly wind , dirk ziegler is deadheading his geraniums .
" it 's good to get outside at the weekend , " exclaims the 35-year-old father-of-two as he surveys his modest kingdom .
raising his voice above the roar of a passing train , he shrugs off the obvious downsides of the urban garden .
" having an allotment in the center of town is perfect because it 's so easy to reach - and it 's great for the kids to have somewhere to play , " he says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dirk is part of a wider movement of 30-somethings who 've tired of late nights in smoky clubs and want to get back to nature . three years ago , he and his girlfriend leased a garden allotment in prenzlauer berg - a district in central berlin more commonly associated with fashionable bars and boutiques - and they 've never looked back .
" allotments have become trendy " , confirmed jürgen hurt , president of the berlin association for gardeners in an interview with the daily berliner zeitung .
according to a study conducted by the association , the average age of tenants has dropped from 56 to 46 in the last six years .
the " schrebergarten " -lrb- allotment -rrb- phenomenon , born a century ago , was named after the leipzig-based doctor daniel schreber - a staunch believer in exercise in the great outdoors for pasty-faced city children .
plots of land leased from the state became increasingly popular with tenants seeking gardens for their young , plus an opportunity to stock up their pantries with home-grown garden produce .
meet the weekend warriors today , pedestrians on the busy bornholmer bridge , which earned its place in history as the first border-crossing to be opened to east germans back in 1989 , can look down on the " garden colony " where dirk and his family now spend most of their free time .
flanked by railway lines and shopping malls , it 's a haven of tranquillity in an otherwise bleak urban landscape .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rosy-cheeked garden gnomes preside over well-kept lawns , framed by rows of flourishing hollyhocks and crispy-looking lettuces .
if it were n't for the not-so-distant hum of traffic , it would be a rural idyll .
but what 's most striking is that few of the residents are lounging around with a beer and the sports section of the sunday paper - they 're all getting their hands dirty .
" i put in at least ten hours of work a week , " says dirk , who 's been digging in his flower-bed all day .
his neighbor is busy putting up a trellis , while across the way , mrs sturmer is fixing her roof .
she 's part of the colony 's elder generation , who can remember a time when allotments were about survival rather than leisure .
" my allotment has been in the family for three generations , " she explained .
" my grandfather leased it during the recession in the 1920s , when people in the city really needed their allotments .
back then , it was a necessity , because if you did n't grow your own vegetables , you did n't have any . "
dig it ?
but times have changed , and these days , growing your own spinach is a lifestyle choice .
herbaceous borders are hipper than prada pumps .
in the uk , the times has even dubbed gardening " the new sex . "
so if you think weeding , digging and planting is for frustrated housewives , think again .
bildunterschrift : for just a few hundred euros a year , some 4 million germans enjoy the pastoral perks of an allotment garden , and waiting lists are long .
experts say this love affair with all things horticultural is a sign of the times .
" allotments used to be seen as conventional and boring , but not anymore , " said trend researcher eike wenzel .
it 's not even that vacations are a luxury few can afford when 5 million germans are unemployed .
" it does n't actually have anything to do with the country 's financial difficulties , " he said .
" it 's more about getting back to nature - the satisfaction of doing things yourself and using your hands . "
he would even go so far as to say it reflects a slow shift in values .
" it ties in with a return to tradition and a desire for a slower pace of life .
the 1990s were a very stormy decade of accelerated technology , modernization and digitalization , " he explained .
" but people now feel that they 've been disappointed by these developments and what they really want is a grounded family life and old-fashioned values .
bonding with nature is a key factor in that shift . "
urban refugees bildunterschrift : most of berlin 's 840 garden colonies are made up of 20 to 100 plots , each roughly 300 meters square , overseen by a highly authoritative residents ' association .
its job is to make sure everyone sticks to the rules , which range from keeping the noise down between midday and 3 p.m. to making sure trees never grow beyond a prescribed height and using at least one third of the garden as a vegetable patch .
" you have to fit in , and if you do n't like it , you should n't bother coming here , " says frau sturmer in no uncertain terms .
" young families have to adjust to the rules like everyone else . "
and most of them do .
an allotment garden is a coveted commodity , and not even the younger generation is prepared to risk being banished for bad behavior .
according to wenzel , germany 's new outdoor types are a conscientious bunch .
they have consumer clout , believe in buying organic , and - reflecting the trend to domestic tourism - they 're more likely to go on an eco-friendly holiday to germany 's baltic coast than a package tour to thailand .
the lohas " in advertising , there 's a lot of talk of what 's called lohas - lifestyle of health and sustainability , " he explained .
" we predict that in future , more and more germans will be living in a way that 's environmentally responsible - but enjoying themselves in the process .
the healthy hedonists are idealistic and political correct , but they 're also pleasure-seeking . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but while the healthy hedonists draw spiritual satisfaction from watching their carrots grow , the old-school allotment residents appreciate their leafy retreats for more prosaic reasons .

more than half of the 13,000 people who participated in an online survey for celebrity magazine bunte on tuesday welcomed the court decision.only 27 percent were opposed , while 21 percent were undecided . jackson 's europe manager ralf sesselberg said that the jackson family was planning a " thank-you " party for jacko 's loyal fans in germany .
" some family members could come for it , maybe his father , " said sesselberg in lower saxony .
but he ruled out the possibility of the so-called " king of pop " personally making an appearance . bildunterschrift : michael jackson fans display hearts and signed messages in support of jackson outside his neverland ranch in california . meanwhile , jackson 's lawyers have come in for praise for their expert handling of the controversial long-drawn out trial that attracted frenzied media attention . german legal expert dietmar herz said that jackson 's lawyers had been " brilliant . "
in an interview with " spiegel online " news site , herz said the trial had been just and fair . " naturally jackson is an overwhelmingly prominent defendant who sparked worldwide support as well as criticism and stirred a media storm , " herz said .
" but his stardom did not bring him any recognizable advantages .
his only plus point was that he could hire one of the best lawyers in the country . " " he 's just a wreck " newspapers across the continent , however , were n't so forgiving . spanish daily el mundo wrote that michael jackson 's reputation had taken a serious battering .
" the singer was acquitted but only because of lack of evidence .
jackson did n't contribute to the defense at all , " the paper said .
it added that the trial had illustrated the physical and psychological decay of the star .
" his records do n't sell and he does n't even attract fans the way he used to .
he 's like a broken toy .
the former child prodigy stood in the spotlight almost all his life .
but the singer could n't come to terms with his fame and getting older . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael jackson italian newspaper il messaggero was equally scathing .
" there 's no doubt that the peter pan of rock would still fill entire stadiums today , " it wrote .
" but there 's also a concrete risk that he could lose face doing that -lrb- and that not only as a consequence of too many plastic surgeries -rrb- , " the paper said .
" the jackson of today is not in the slightest the jackson from ' thriller ' and ' bad ' . " dutch daily de volkskrant said the trial had visibly aged and weakened jackson and that he left the california courtroom a broken man who only invoked pity .
" a people-shy megastar whose career is practically over and who 's financially dead , who may not have indulged in any proven buggery but who is obviously caught in the grip of an unmistakable and sick preference for the company of children , " is how the paper described him .
" the king of pop is finally rid of his throne . " germany 's munich-based münchner merkur lashed out at the trial , saying the evidence was too thin , the witness testimonies too contradictory and the suspicion too deep that the relatives of the apparent victim were mainly driven by financial motives .
" the former king of pop may not be perfectly rehabilitated , but he is rightly a free man , " the paper opined .
" however , the talent of the century with a childlike psyche will have to live with the stigma of a pedophile , " it wrote .
" a comeback to the pinnacle of pop will , however , remain off-limits - despite all the hysterical swearing of loyalty from his fans . " germany 's mass-selling tabloid newspaper bild titled " but what has the trial done to the king of pop ? - he 's just a wreck .

more than half of the 13,000 people who participated in an online survey for celebrity magazine bunte on tuesday welcomed the court decision.only 27 percent were opposed , while 21 percent were undecided . jackson 's europe manager ralf sesselberg said that the jackson family was planning a " thank-you " party for jacko 's loyal fans in germany .
" some family members could come for it , maybe his father , " said sesselberg in lower saxony .
but he ruled out the possibility of the so-called " king of pop " personally making an appearance . bildunterschrift : michael jackson fans display hearts and signed messages in support of jackson outside his neverland ranch in california . meanwhile , jackson 's lawyers have come in for praise for their expert handling of the controversial long-drawn out trial that attracted frenzied media attention . german legal expert dietmar herz said that jackson 's lawyers had been " brilliant . "
in an interview with " spiegel online " news site , herz said the trial had been just and fair . " naturally jackson is an overwhelmingly prominent defendant who sparked worldwide support as well as criticism and stirred a media storm , " herz said .
" but his stardom did not bring him any recognizable advantages .
his only plus point was that he could hire one of the best lawyers in the country . " " he 's just a wreck " newspapers across the continent , however , were n't so forgiving . spanish daily el mundo wrote that michael jackson 's reputation had taken a serious battering .
" the singer was acquitted but only because of lack of evidence .
jackson did n't contribute to the defense at all , " the paper said .
it added that the trial had illustrated the physical and psychological decay of the star .
" his records do n't sell and he does n't even attract fans the way he used to .
he 's like a broken toy .
the former child prodigy stood in the spotlight almost all his life .
but the singer could n't come to terms with his fame and getting older . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael jackson italian newspaper il messaggero was equally scathing .
" there 's no doubt that the peter pan of rock would still fill entire stadiums today , " it wrote .
" but there 's also a concrete risk that he could lose face doing that -lrb- and that not only as a consequence of too many plastic surgeries -rrb- , " the paper said .
" the jackson of today is not in the slightest the jackson from ' thriller ' and ' bad ' . " dutch daily de volkskrant said the trial had visibly aged and weakened jackson and that he left the california courtroom a broken man who only invoked pity .
" a people-shy megastar whose career is practically over and who 's financially dead , who may not have indulged in any proven buggery but who is obviously caught in the grip of an unmistakable and sick preference for the company of children , " is how the paper described him .
" the king of pop is finally rid of his throne . " germany 's munich-based münchner merkur lashed out at the trial , saying the evidence was too thin , the witness testimonies too contradictory and the suspicion too deep that the relatives of the apparent victim were mainly driven by financial motives .
" the former king of pop may not be perfectly rehabilitated , but he is rightly a free man , " the paper opined .
" however , the talent of the century with a childlike psyche will have to live with the stigma of a pedophile , " it wrote .
" a comeback to the pinnacle of pop will , however , remain off-limits - despite all the hysterical swearing of loyalty from his fans .

fears are growing that the european union summit on thursday and friday in brussels will not resolve the bloc 's most pressing problems .
dw-world explains the two issues the heads of government and state will tackle . the budget the summit will aim to agree on the eu 's budgetary framework for 2007-2012 .
the so-called net contributors - including germany , the netherlands and sweden - which put more into the eu coffers than they get back , want to cut their payments and limit spending to no more than one percent of the bloc 's gross national income . in the run-up to the summit , britain has come under fire from eu leaders headed by french president jacques chirac for refusing to freeze the rebate it negotiated in 1984 , when it was the bloc 's poorest member .
currently , the rebate totals an average of 4.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.55 billion -rrb- annually , and almost 10 percent of it is now paid by the poorer eu members from eastern europe who joined last year .
british prime minister tony blair has been adamant that his country will not give way on the rebate unless agriculture subsidies , from which britain hardly profits , are subjected to drastic cuts .
france 's chirac has categorically ruled out any reduction in the subsidies , which his country 's farmers rely on . the european constitution the eu leaders will also debate what to do about the bloc constitution in the wake of french and dutch rejection of the document in may 29 and june 1 referendums .
the constitution was meant to help combat the unwieldy decision-making process in the enlarged bloc of 25 countries and 455 million people .
it can not be ratified without approval from all eu states . the summit participants may decide the treaty ca n't be ratified at all or call member states to go ahead with votes to see what the final results bring .
several eu leaders have called for the ratification process to be extended beyond the two-year period originally foreseen ; it was initially expected to be implemented in november 2006 .
the leaders could also indefinitely delay ratification .
it 's unlikely they will decide to renegotiate the treaty , as its drafting was a long and difficult process the first time round .
observers warn that the summit might not result in any progress at all . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german duo squeezed in brussels german chancellor gerhard schröder has appealed for unity and compromise at this week 's european union summit in brussels .

" the meeting i 've just had with president chirac was immensely amicable but obviously there 's sharp disagreement , " blair told a news briefing after talks .
" i think it is difficult to see these differences being bridged , but of course you know we continue to talk . " british rebate and french farm subsidies the dispute centers on britain 's controversial 5.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.4 billion -rrb- eu rebate , forged by margaret thatcher 's iron will two decades ago , that is under fire from other eu members sick of footing the bill .
france , germany , spain and the netherlands in particular want the rebate to be reconsidered , claiming that since it was introduced britain has grown much richer and the eu much bigger . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french dairy farmer jean-marc guigue repairs fencing on his dairy farm in mognard , france britain wants a reform of agricultural subsidies , agreed upon in 2002 , which consumes more than 40 percent of the eu 's budget and especially benefits french farmers .
blair wants chirac to give ground on the topic before it agrees to submit its annual rebate from european coffers for renegotiation - a demand that chirac is unlikely to give in to for fear it could anger powerful french farmers at a time when his personal popularity at home has slipped to dismal levels . chirac has called for a " gesture of solidarity " from britain to freeze or surrender its debate . on wednesday , chirac 's spokesman jerome bonnafont told reuters that france wanted " a fair and reasonable agreement " in which everyone made a contribution .
he made no reference to any french concessions .
bonnafont said chirac believed it was " important we do not add financial difficulties to the current political crisis in europe , " sparked by the rejection of the eu constitution in france and the netherlands . eu treaty ratification tricky issue wednesday 's meeting with chirac marked the end of a two-day whirlwind diplomatic tour for blair which also took him to russia and germany .
the tour was meant to focus principally on the summit of the group of eight industrialized countries in gleneagles next month .
britain is chairing the g8 this year and has made ending chronic poverty in africa one of its top concerns for meetings , along with real progress on confronting climate change . britain 's own decision to shelve plans for a planned referendum on the eu constitution next year in the wake of the two rejections in france and the netherlands has not gone down well with other eu members who still want to push ahead with the ratification process . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair , left , with schröder in germany , chancellor gerhard schröder has emerged as a vocal champion of the embattled eu constitution , urging the bloc to press on with the ratification process despite london 's decision to call off a planned referendum on it .
he has also taken the french side in the farm subsidies row , which blair has said must also be put on the table in brussels this week . " chancellor schröder is clearly on the same lines as the french president as far as agricultural subsidies are concerned , " government spokesman bela anda said monday ahead of the meeting between schröder and blair . a clear political direction britain 's position on both the constitution and the budget and blair 's row with chirac have left it looking increasingly isolated within the eu - a situation similar to the time when britain joined the us-led invasion in iraq in 2003 in the face of fierce franco-german opposition . experts are pessimistic about the prospect of a deal on either of the issues at a two-day eu summit that kicks off in brussels on thursday . luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , whose country currently holds the six-month rotating eu presidency , said he was fairly certain a deal would n't be brokered at the summit . " i am pretty sure we wo n't get the financial perspectives through at this summit , " juncker told a european parliament committee , hours before he was due to circulate a compromise proposal on the 2007-2013 budget to eu leaders .
" there is agreement , more or less , on the total amount of funding .
we differ as to payments to the budget , the structure of expenditure and who is a net contributor , " juncker said . tony blair , who has rejected a long-term freeze on britain 's widely-criticized eu budget rebate , has linked the budget dispute to the constitutional and political crisis gripping the eu and called for a pause for reflection . " if we want to reconnect people in europe with the idea of the european union , we 've got to set a clear political direction , " blair said after wednesday 's meeting with chirac . " we 've got to , even in the financing of europe , in fact , in some respects particularly in the financing of europe , reconnect the priorities that people have in europe with the way that we spend the money in europe , " blair said . " if we were to set out some of that forward path and direction , then i think it would be a lot easier to persuade people why it 's necessary also to have a new set of rules to govern europe .

everyone was pleased with bringing home the three points but the porous defense is turning into a serious problem . for the 48,000 fans at the sold out waldstadion in frankfurt , germany 's opening match victory against australia was largely entertaining , if not at times nerve-wracking .
a soccer coach would have pulled out his or her hair , wondering how a team can suffer such lapses of concentration . " winning the opening match and the three points are very important , " said germany coach jürgen klinsmann , " but we also know some things did n't work optimally . " namely , giving up two first-half equalizers to the socceroos and then also a goal in stoppage time , but fortunately at that point , klinsmann 's squad had a two-goal advantage . six minutes of excitement bildunterschrift : australia 's josip skoko -lrb- yellow -rrb- squeezes the ball under germany 's jumping wall the first 15 minutes of the match were uneventful with both sides walking on pins and needles , playing stiffly .
kevin kuranyi 's goal in the 17th minute started what would be a toe-to-toe punchout in the following six minutes . before the fans could sit back down after celebrating the newly-acquired striker by schalke , germany 's central defender robert huth mugged john aloisi unnecessarily outside the german penalty box .
josip skoko took the free-kick and instead of lifting the ball , he kept it on the ground .
that was unfortunate because the wall jumped and watched the leather roll under their feet .
after 19 minutes , the score stood 1-1 . germany roared right back , with per mertesacker the benefactor of some sloppy defending by the australian defense and scored in the 23rd minute .
it was his first goal with the national squad , leaving many of the fans rubbing their eyes as their squad decided that attacking soccer , hardly what germany has been known for the past decade and a half , would bring success . since taking over last july , jürgen klinsmann promised more offense from the german team and he has held true to his promise .
at a cost , namely a porous defense . amateurish defense bildunterschrift : germany 's michael ballack -lrb- right -rrb- converts a penalty kick to put his side ahead 3-2 eight minutes after resecuring the lead , some very sharp passing and flat-footed defending allowed australia to get a second equalizer .
this time john aloisi beat his defender easily to streak into the penalty box and beat kahn .
the remainder of the second half , germany played insecurely and receiving a few catcalls when the referee carlos amarilla blew his whistle to end the first half . coming out of the locker room , germany were rejuvenated and put australia 's back against the wall .
it paid off in the 60th minute when arne friedrich , one of germany 's best players in the match , drew a penalty .
team captain michael ballack stepped and calmly sunk the spot kick and germany led 3-2 . the goal broke the australian resistance as the teams who both had expended much energy in the first hour , slowed the pace down .
the game started getting sloppy as passes frequently landed on an opponent 's foot or out of bounds . podolski secures victory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john aloisi scores australia 's second equalizer , getting past defender robert huth to do so lukas podolski was less affected by the fast pace .
in the 88th minute , he scored what would turn out to be the gamewinning goal after a strong run by ballack .
the two-goal lead was a relief to the sell-out crowd who could finally start singing after a night filled more with wonderment as the mostly unknown socceroos put world soccer power germany through the paces .
but it was almost not enough . in stoppage time , the german backline fell asleep as it did against russia one week ago .
aloisi again could break free and scored as the defenders wondered how he got behind them . the fans then had to wait only another 30 seconds before amarilla blew the final whistle and they could breathe a collective sigh of relief . klinsmann has promised excitement and that is what they got . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de argentina dominates tunisia in opener argentina played a superior game against tunisia , winning 2-1 with the help of a penalty kick and a nicely-played second goal .

at a cost , namely a porous defense . amateurish defense bildunterschrift : germany 's michael ballack -lrb- right -rrb- converts a penalty kick to put his side ahead 3-2 eight minutes after resecuring the lead , some very sharp passing and flat-footed defending allowed australia to get a second equalizer .
this time john aloisi beat his defender easily to streak into the penalty box and beat kahn .
the remainder of the second half , germany played insecurely and receiving a few catcalls when the referee carlos amarilla blew his whistle to end the first half . coming out of the locker room , germany were rejuvenated and put australia 's back against the wall .
it paid off in the 60th minute when arne friedrich , one of germany 's best players in the match , drew a penalty .
team captain michael ballack stepped and calmly sunk the spot kick and germany led 3-2 . the goal broke the australian resistance as the teams who both had expended much energy in the first hour , slowed the pace down .
the game started getting sloppy as passes frequently landed on an opponent 's foot or out of bounds . podolski secures victory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john aloisi scores australia 's second equalizer , getting past defender robert huth to do so lukas podolski was less affected by the fast pace .
in the 88th minute , he scored what would turn out to be the gamewinning goal after a strong run by ballack .
the two-goal lead was a relief to the sell-out crowd who could finally start singing after a night filled more with wonderment as the mostly unknown socceroos put world soccer power germany through the paces .
but it was almost not enough . in stoppage time , the german backline fell asleep as it did against russia one week ago .
aloisi again could break free and scored as the defenders wondered how he got behind them . the fans then had to wait only another 30 seconds before amarilla blew the final whistle and they could breathe a collective sigh of relief . klinsmann has promised excitement and that is what they got . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de argentina dominates tunisia in opener argentina played a superior game against tunisia , winning 2-1 with the help of a penalty kick and a nicely-played second goal .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 15.06.2005 invasion of the healthy hedonists großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : residents keep their eyes peeled for anyone breaking the rules young people are no longer spending their sundays nursing hangovers in front of the tv .
they head out to their private allotments to tend to their vegetables .
so when did that most suburban of activities become so hip ? undeterred by the bracing easterly wind , dirk ziegler is deadheading his geraniums .
" it 's good to get outside at the weekend , " exclaims the 35-year-old father-of-two as he surveys his modest kingdom .
raising his voice above the roar of a passing train , he shrugs off the obvious downsides of the urban garden .
" having an allotment in the center of town is perfect because it 's so easy to reach - and it 's great for the kids to have somewhere to play , " he says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dirk is part of a wider movement of 30-somethings who 've tired of late nights in smoky clubs and want to get back to nature . three years ago , he and his girlfriend leased a garden allotment in prenzlauer berg - a district in central berlin more commonly associated with fashionable bars and boutiques - and they 've never looked back .
" allotments have become trendy " , confirmed jürgen hurt , president of the berlin association for gardeners in an interview with the daily berliner zeitung .
according to a study conducted by the association , the average age of tenants has dropped from 56 to 46 in the last six years .
the " schrebergarten " -lrb- allotment -rrb- phenomenon , born a century ago , was named after the leipzig-based doctor daniel schreber - a staunch believer in exercise in the great outdoors for pasty-faced city children .
plots of land leased from the state became increasingly popular with tenants seeking gardens for their young , plus an opportunity to stock up their pantries with home-grown garden produce .
meet the weekend warriors today , pedestrians on the busy bornholmer bridge , which earned its place in history as the first border-crossing to be opened to east germans back in 1989 , can look down on the " garden colony " where dirk and his family now spend most of their free time .
flanked by railway lines and shopping malls , it 's a haven of tranquillity in an otherwise bleak urban landscape .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rosy-cheeked garden gnomes preside over well-kept lawns , framed by rows of flourishing hollyhocks and crispy-looking lettuces .
if it were n't for the not-so-distant hum of traffic , it would be a rural idyll .
but what 's most striking is that few of the residents are lounging around with a beer and the sports section of the sunday paper - they 're all getting their hands dirty .
" i put in at least ten hours of work a week , " says dirk , who 's been digging in his flower-bed all day .
his neighbor is busy putting up a trellis , while across the way , mrs sturmer is fixing her roof .
she 's part of the colony 's elder generation , who can remember a time when allotments were about survival rather than leisure .
" my allotment has been in the family for three generations , " she explained .
" my grandfather leased it during the recession in the 1920s , when people in the city really needed their allotments .
back then , it was a necessity , because if you did n't grow your own vegetables , you did n't have any . "
dig it ?
but times have changed , and these days , growing your own spinach is a lifestyle choice .
herbaceous borders are hipper than prada pumps .
in the uk , the times has even dubbed gardening " the new sex . "
so if you think weeding , digging and planting is for frustrated housewives , think again .
bildunterschrift : for just a few hundred euros a year , some 4 million germans enjoy the pastoral perks of an allotment garden , and waiting lists are long .
experts say this love affair with all things horticultural is a sign of the times .
" allotments used to be seen as conventional and boring , but not anymore , " said trend researcher eike wenzel .
it 's not even that vacations are a luxury few can afford when 5 million germans are unemployed .
" it does n't actually have anything to do with the country 's financial difficulties , " he said .
" it 's more about getting back to nature - the satisfaction of doing things yourself and using your hands . "
he would even go so far as to say it reflects a slow shift in values .
" it ties in with a return to tradition and a desire for a slower pace of life .
the 1990s were a very stormy decade of accelerated technology , modernization and digitalization , " he explained .
" but people now feel that they 've been disappointed by these developments and what they really want is a grounded family life and old-fashioned values .
bonding with nature is a key factor in that shift . "
urban refugees bildunterschrift : most of berlin 's 840 garden colonies are made up of 20 to 100 plots , each roughly 300 meters square , overseen by a highly authoritative residents ' association .
its job is to make sure everyone sticks to the rules , which range from keeping the noise down between midday and 3 p.m. to making sure trees never grow beyond a prescribed height and using at least one third of the garden as a vegetable patch .
" you have to fit in , and if you do n't like it , you should n't bother coming here , " says frau sturmer in no uncertain terms .
" young families have to adjust to the rules like everyone else . "
and most of them do .
an allotment garden is a coveted commodity , and not even the younger generation is prepared to risk being banished for bad behavior .
according to wenzel , germany 's new outdoor types are a conscientious bunch .
they have consumer clout , believe in buying organic , and - reflecting the trend to domestic tourism - they 're more likely to go on an eco-friendly holiday to germany 's baltic coast than a package tour to thailand .
the lohas " in advertising , there 's a lot of talk of what 's called lohas - lifestyle of health and sustainability , " he explained .
" we predict that in future , more and more germans will be living in a way that 's environmentally responsible - but enjoying themselves in the process .
the healthy hedonists are idealistic and political correct , but they 're also pleasure-seeking . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but while the healthy hedonists draw spiritual satisfaction from watching their carrots grow , the old-school allotment residents appreciate their leafy retreats for more prosaic reasons .

they head out to their private allotments to tend to their vegetables .
so when did that most suburban of activities become so hip ? undeterred by the bracing easterly wind , dirk ziegler is deadheading his geraniums .
" it 's good to get outside at the weekend , " exclaims the 35-year-old father-of-two as he surveys his modest kingdom .
raising his voice above the roar of a passing train , he shrugs off the obvious downsides of the urban garden .
" having an allotment in the center of town is perfect because it 's so easy to reach - and it 's great for the kids to have somewhere to play , " he says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dirk is part of a wider movement of 30-somethings who 've tired of late nights in smoky clubs and want to get back to nature . three years ago , he and his girlfriend leased a garden allotment in prenzlauer berg - a district in central berlin more commonly associated with fashionable bars and boutiques - and they 've never looked back .
" allotments have become trendy " , confirmed jürgen hurt , president of the berlin association for gardeners in an interview with the daily berliner zeitung .
according to a study conducted by the association , the average age of tenants has dropped from 56 to 46 in the last six years .
the " schrebergarten " -lrb- allotment -rrb- phenomenon , born a century ago , was named after the leipzig-based doctor daniel schreber - a staunch believer in exercise in the great outdoors for pasty-faced city children .
plots of land leased from the state became increasingly popular with tenants seeking gardens for their young , plus an opportunity to stock up their pantries with home-grown garden produce .
meet the weekend warriors today , pedestrians on the busy bornholmer bridge , which earned its place in history as the first border-crossing to be opened to east germans back in 1989 , can look down on the " garden colony " where dirk and his family now spend most of their free time .
flanked by railway lines and shopping malls , it 's a haven of tranquillity in an otherwise bleak urban landscape .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rosy-cheeked garden gnomes preside over well-kept lawns , framed by rows of flourishing hollyhocks and crispy-looking lettuces .
if it were n't for the not-so-distant hum of traffic , it would be a rural idyll .
but what 's most striking is that few of the residents are lounging around with a beer and the sports section of the sunday paper - they 're all getting their hands dirty .
" i put in at least ten hours of work a week , " says dirk , who 's been digging in his flower-bed all day .
his neighbor is busy putting up a trellis , while across the way , mrs sturmer is fixing her roof .
she 's part of the colony 's elder generation , who can remember a time when allotments were about survival rather than leisure .
" my allotment has been in the family for three generations , " she explained .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the 2005 confederations cup confed cup : from riyadh to the world the mini-world cup kicks off the confederations cup comes to germany argentina bounces roos world cup 2006 -pipe- 15.06.2005 germany lacking bricks in defensive wall großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's defense may be the future but what about the present ?
germany kick-off their confederations cup campaign on wednesday with high hopes of lifting the cup on june 29 .
but as dw-world 's blog reporter nick amies writes , a defensive flaw may end the dream before the final . the confederations cup begins on wednesday and , if the majority of pundits can be trusted in their evaluation , a south american team will be collecting the spoils on june 29 , therefore breaking the cycle of the trophy being retained by the holding federation . this line of thinking has already ruled out a german or greek victory , as the hosts and the european champions are the only ones who can take over from france , the current holders from uefa . this is doing a major disservice to the europeans even before a ball has been kicked in anger .
while greece may actually turn out to be the flash-in-the-pan that many expect , for germany it seems especially harsh . to write off the chances of jürgen klinsmann 's young eagles without even a badly sung national anthem passing their lips is a more of an insult than a disservice .
no doubt the tired argument of their inability to beat any of the top sides in the world in the last five years is being used to support the opinion that germany will fail to win the confederations cup . this , in my opinion , is just laziness ; an excuse to avoid delving deeper into the machinations of the german team and asking why they may not have what it takes to deliver on home soil this month . underlying flaws bildunterschrift : while it is bad form to give the germans no chance at all before the tournament begins , it is entirely likely that the issues that many analysts avoid in their rush to praise the brazilians and argentineans may be the undoing of this undoubtedly talented but flawed german team . ironically , the germans suffer from the same problem that plagues the world champions at times - they have problems defending . this is a relatively new malaise for germany , a team which has been world famous for decades for stinginess on the international stage .
it used to be the germans couldn ’ t score .
but when they did , they had the resources to shut up shop and defend the 1-0 lead through to victory . the current problem became evident under rudi völler and , while the german defense is tighter since klinsmann took the helm , germany 's improving offensive play distracts from a continuing problem left over from the previous era . exciting attackers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann finds himself with one problem most teams would dream to have : an excess of exciting , attacking players .
you can tick them off as you look down the squad sheet … ballack , schweinsteiger -lrb- photo -rrb- , deisler , podolski … germany 's threat comes from up-front and from midfield , giving the coach and the team unenviable options when attacking . but what happens if they get caught on the break ? i would probably get laughed at or shouted down in any discussion on the subject by saying that the biggest loss to the german team for the confed cup has been the injury to dietmar hamann .
for those holding their sides , wait until you see the argentinean midfield breaking and bearing down on thorsten frings and then see who ’ s laughing . lacking an experienced protector germany have a potentially majestic back four in andreas hinkel , per mertesacker , robert huth and thomas hitzlsperger but this new generation lack the classic holding midfielder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense starts in front of the defenders and frings is not disciplined enough to play the role that franz beckenbauer and , to a lesser degree , hamann have done to such effect if the germans play 4-4-2 .
the defenders are even more exposed if klinsmann opts for a 4-3-3 with frings and fabian ernst deployed to the left and right with the central role going to an attack-minded michael ballack . and it is n't just the fault of frings .
bernd schneider and ballack often go missing when defensive duties come calling but it is the role bestowed on frings that bears the responsibility .
my jury remains out on his ability to protect his defenders . the young back four without a savvy guardian in front of them may find themselves pulled all over the place by the likes of javier saviola and juan riquelme in the final group a game against argentina on june 21 . attacking prowess bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : that said , germany 's attacking prowess against australia and tunisia is likely to be too much for these outside challengers and any threat the oceania and african champions may present is unlikely to cause the germans any irretrievable damage , seeing the home side through as runners-up . but in the latter stages , against the free-wheeling brazilians or meticulous greeks , germany may have more problems .
overcoming either of the top teams in group b could set germany up for a final against argentina who are definitely one of the teams to beat . it is they , not brazil , who are my south american tip for the confederation cup with germany suffering painful , but encouraging , heartbreak at the final hurdle . extracted from dw-world 's confederations cup blog nick amies , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the confederations cup comes to germany the fifa 2005 confederations cup kicks off in germany on june 15 , bringing the leading teams from the world 's six soccer federations together to compete for the title of champion of champions .

germany kick-off their confederations cup campaign on wednesday with high hopes of lifting the cup on june 29 .
but as dw-world 's blog reporter nick amies writes , a defensive flaw may end the dream before the final . the confederations cup begins on wednesday and , if the majority of pundits can be trusted in their evaluation , a south american team will be collecting the spoils on june 29 , therefore breaking the cycle of the trophy being retained by the holding federation . this line of thinking has already ruled out a german or greek victory , as the hosts and the european champions are the only ones who can take over from france , the current holders from uefa . this is doing a major disservice to the europeans even before a ball has been kicked in anger .
while greece may actually turn out to be the flash-in-the-pan that many expect , for germany it seems especially harsh . to write off the chances of jürgen klinsmann 's young eagles without even a badly sung national anthem passing their lips is a more of an insult than a disservice .
no doubt the tired argument of their inability to beat any of the top sides in the world in the last five years is being used to support the opinion that germany will fail to win the confederations cup . this , in my opinion , is just laziness ; an excuse to avoid delving deeper into the machinations of the german team and asking why they may not have what it takes to deliver on home soil this month . underlying flaws bildunterschrift : while it is bad form to give the germans no chance at all before the tournament begins , it is entirely likely that the issues that many analysts avoid in their rush to praise the brazilians and argentineans may be the undoing of this undoubtedly talented but flawed german team . ironically , the germans suffer from the same problem that plagues the world champions at times - they have problems defending . this is a relatively new malaise for germany , a team which has been world famous for decades for stinginess on the international stage .
it used to be the germans couldn ’ t score .
but when they did , they had the resources to shut up shop and defend the 1-0 lead through to victory . the current problem became evident under rudi völler and , while the german defense is tighter since klinsmann took the helm , germany 's improving offensive play distracts from a continuing problem left over from the previous era . exciting attackers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann finds himself with one problem most teams would dream to have : an excess of exciting , attacking players .
you can tick them off as you look down the squad sheet … ballack , schweinsteiger -lrb- photo -rrb- , deisler , podolski … germany 's threat comes from up-front and from midfield , giving the coach and the team unenviable options when attacking . but what happens if they get caught on the break ? i would probably get laughed at or shouted down in any discussion on the subject by saying that the biggest loss to the german team for the confed cup has been the injury to dietmar hamann .
for those holding their sides , wait until you see the argentinean midfield breaking and bearing down on thorsten frings and then see who ’ s laughing . lacking an experienced protector germany have a potentially majestic back four in andreas hinkel , per mertesacker , robert huth and thomas hitzlsperger but this new generation lack the classic holding midfielder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense starts in front of the defenders and frings is not disciplined enough to play the role that franz beckenbauer and , to a lesser degree , hamann have done to such effect if the germans play 4-4-2 .
the defenders are even more exposed if klinsmann opts for a 4-3-3 with frings and fabian ernst deployed to the left and right with the central role going to an attack-minded michael ballack . and it is n't just the fault of frings .
bernd schneider and ballack often go missing when defensive duties come calling but it is the role bestowed on frings that bears the responsibility .
my jury remains out on his ability to protect his defenders . the young back four without a savvy guardian in front of them may find themselves pulled all over the place by the likes of javier saviola and juan riquelme in the final group a game against argentina on june 21 . attacking prowess bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : that said , germany 's attacking prowess against australia and tunisia is likely to be too much for these outside challengers and any threat the oceania and african champions may present is unlikely to cause the germans any irretrievable damage , seeing the home side through as runners-up . but in the latter stages , against the free-wheeling brazilians or meticulous greeks , germany may have more problems .
overcoming either of the top teams in group b could set germany up for a final against argentina who are definitely one of the teams to beat . it is they , not brazil , who are my south american tip for the confederation cup with germany suffering painful , but encouraging , heartbreak at the final hurdle . extracted from dw-world 's confederations cup blog nick amies , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the confederations cup comes to germany the fifa 2005 confederations cup kicks off in germany on june 15 , bringing the leading teams from the world 's six soccer federations together to compete for the title of champion of champions .

they head out to their private allotments to tend to their vegetables .
so when did that most suburban of activities become so hip ? undeterred by the bracing easterly wind , dirk ziegler is deadheading his geraniums .
" it 's good to get outside at the weekend , " exclaims the 35-year-old father-of-two as he surveys his modest kingdom .
raising his voice above the roar of a passing train , he shrugs off the obvious downsides of the urban garden .
" having an allotment in the center of town is perfect because it 's so easy to reach - and it 's great for the kids to have somewhere to play , " he says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dirk is part of a wider movement of 30-somethings who 've tired of late nights in smoky clubs and want to get back to nature . three years ago , he and his girlfriend leased a garden allotment in prenzlauer berg - a district in central berlin more commonly associated with fashionable bars and boutiques - and they 've never looked back .
" allotments have become trendy " , confirmed jürgen hurt , president of the berlin association for gardeners in an interview with the daily berliner zeitung .
according to a study conducted by the association , the average age of tenants has dropped from 56 to 46 in the last six years .
the " schrebergarten " -lrb- allotment -rrb- phenomenon , born a century ago , was named after the leipzig-based doctor daniel schreber - a staunch believer in exercise in the great outdoors for pasty-faced city children .
plots of land leased from the state became increasingly popular with tenants seeking gardens for their young , plus an opportunity to stock up their pantries with home-grown garden produce .
meet the weekend warriors today , pedestrians on the busy bornholmer bridge , which earned its place in history as the first border-crossing to be opened to east germans back in 1989 , can look down on the " garden colony " where dirk and his family now spend most of their free time .
flanked by railway lines and shopping malls , it 's a haven of tranquillity in an otherwise bleak urban landscape .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rosy-cheeked garden gnomes preside over well-kept lawns , framed by rows of flourishing hollyhocks and crispy-looking lettuces .
if it were n't for the not-so-distant hum of traffic , it would be a rural idyll .
but what 's most striking is that few of the residents are lounging around with a beer and the sports section of the sunday paper - they 're all getting their hands dirty .
" i put in at least ten hours of work a week , " says dirk , who 's been digging in his flower-bed all day .
his neighbor is busy putting up a trellis , while across the way , mrs sturmer is fixing her roof .
she 's part of the colony 's elder generation , who can remember a time when allotments were about survival rather than leisure .
" my allotment has been in the family for three generations , " she explained .
" my grandfather leased it during the recession in the 1920s , when people in the city really needed their allotments .
back then , it was a necessity , because if you did n't grow your own vegetables , you did n't have any . "
dig it ?
but times have changed , and these days , growing your own spinach is a lifestyle choice .
herbaceous borders are hipper than prada pumps .
in the uk , the times has even dubbed gardening " the new sex . "
so if you think weeding , digging and planting is for frustrated housewives , think again .
bildunterschrift : for just a few hundred euros a year , some 4 million germans enjoy the pastoral perks of an allotment garden , and waiting lists are long .
experts say this love affair with all things horticultural is a sign of the times .
" allotments used to be seen as conventional and boring , but not anymore , " said trend researcher eike wenzel .
it 's not even that vacations are a luxury few can afford when 5 million germans are unemployed .
" it does n't actually have anything to do with the country 's financial difficulties , " he said .
" it 's more about getting back to nature - the satisfaction of doing things yourself and using your hands . "
he would even go so far as to say it reflects a slow shift in values .
" it ties in with a return to tradition and a desire for a slower pace of life .
the 1990s were a very stormy decade of accelerated technology , modernization and digitalization , " he explained .
" but people now feel that they 've been disappointed by these developments and what they really want is a grounded family life and old-fashioned values .
bonding with nature is a key factor in that shift . "
urban refugees bildunterschrift : most of berlin 's 840 garden colonies are made up of 20 to 100 plots , each roughly 300 meters square , overseen by a highly authoritative residents ' association .
its job is to make sure everyone sticks to the rules , which range from keeping the noise down between midday and 3 p.m. to making sure trees never grow beyond a prescribed height and using at least one third of the garden as a vegetable patch .
" you have to fit in , and if you do n't like it , you should n't bother coming here , " says frau sturmer in no uncertain terms .
" young families have to adjust to the rules like everyone else . "
and most of them do .
an allotment garden is a coveted commodity , and not even the younger generation is prepared to risk being banished for bad behavior .
according to wenzel , germany 's new outdoor types are a conscientious bunch .
they have consumer clout , believe in buying organic , and - reflecting the trend to domestic tourism - they 're more likely to go on an eco-friendly holiday to germany 's baltic coast than a package tour to thailand .
the lohas " in advertising , there 's a lot of talk of what 's called lohas - lifestyle of health and sustainability , " he explained .
" we predict that in future , more and more germans will be living in a way that 's environmentally responsible - but enjoying themselves in the process .
the healthy hedonists are idealistic and political correct , but they 're also pleasure-seeking . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but while the healthy hedonists draw spiritual satisfaction from watching their carrots grow , the old-school allotment residents appreciate their leafy retreats for more prosaic reasons .

" i put in at least ten hours of work a week , " says dirk , who 's been digging in his flower-bed all day .
his neighbor is busy putting up a trellis , while across the way , mrs sturmer is fixing her roof .
she 's part of the colony 's elder generation , who can remember a time when allotments were about survival rather than leisure .
" my allotment has been in the family for three generations , " she explained .
" my grandfather leased it during the recession in the 1920s , when people in the city really needed their allotments .
back then , it was a necessity , because if you did n't grow your own vegetables , you did n't have any . "
dig it ?
but times have changed , and these days , growing your own spinach is a lifestyle choice .
herbaceous borders are hipper than prada pumps .
in the uk , the times has even dubbed gardening " the new sex . "
so if you think weeding , digging and planting is for frustrated housewives , think again .
bildunterschrift : for just a few hundred euros a year , some 4 million germans enjoy the pastoral perks of an allotment garden , and waiting lists are long .
experts say this love affair with all things horticultural is a sign of the times .
" allotments used to be seen as conventional and boring , but not anymore , " said trend researcher eike wenzel .
it 's not even that vacations are a luxury few can afford when 5 million germans are unemployed .
" it does n't actually have anything to do with the country 's financial difficulties , " he said .
" it 's more about getting back to nature - the satisfaction of doing things yourself and using your hands . "
he would even go so far as to say it reflects a slow shift in values .
" it ties in with a return to tradition and a desire for a slower pace of life .
the 1990s were a very stormy decade of accelerated technology , modernization and digitalization , " he explained .
" but people now feel that they 've been disappointed by these developments and what they really want is a grounded family life and old-fashioned values .
bonding with nature is a key factor in that shift . "
urban refugees bildunterschrift : most of berlin 's 840 garden colonies are made up of 20 to 100 plots , each roughly 300 meters square , overseen by a highly authoritative residents ' association .
its job is to make sure everyone sticks to the rules , which range from keeping the noise down between midday and 3 p.m. to making sure trees never grow beyond a prescribed height and using at least one third of the garden as a vegetable patch .
" you have to fit in , and if you do n't like it , you should n't bother coming here , " says frau sturmer in no uncertain terms .
" young families have to adjust to the rules like everyone else . "
and most of them do .
an allotment garden is a coveted commodity , and not even the younger generation is prepared to risk being banished for bad behavior .
according to wenzel , germany 's new outdoor types are a conscientious bunch .
they have consumer clout , believe in buying organic , and - reflecting the trend to domestic tourism - they 're more likely to go on an eco-friendly holiday to germany 's baltic coast than a package tour to thailand .
the lohas " in advertising , there 's a lot of talk of what 's called lohas - lifestyle of health and sustainability , " he explained .
" we predict that in future , more and more germans will be living in a way that 's environmentally responsible - but enjoying themselves in the process .
the healthy hedonists are idealistic and political correct , but they 're also pleasure-seeking . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but while the healthy hedonists draw spiritual satisfaction from watching their carrots grow , the old-school allotment residents appreciate their leafy retreats for more prosaic reasons .
" tempers can fray when you 're both retired , " admits 65-year-old herr mittelstadt .
" it 's nice to know there 's always somewhere to escape to . " jane paulick , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de conservatism : the new rebellion ?
much has been made lately of the idea that teenage " cool " is giving way to a renaissance of conservatism .
but are young germans really seeking the security and stability of anachronistic values over their right to rebel ?

germany faces off against australia in the second match .
who has the best shot ? argentina - tunisia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : striker javier saviola , nicknamed " the rabbit " , is a massive goal-scoring threat though playing without stars hernan crespo , roberto ayala and juan sebastian veron , argentina is one of those countries that produces soccer talent like other countries produce co2 emissions .
coach jose pekerman still has javier saviola , juan roman riquelme , javier zanetti , and defender gabriel heinze to pick from , all of whom will figure prominently in the gauchos ' attacking style .
high off of a 3-1 spanking of brazil in the world cup qualifying rounds that secured them a spot in the 2006 world cup , argentina comes into the confederations cup tournament playing well enough to earn its " favorite " status . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : silva has been a serious threat ever since tunisia one the africa cup tunisia 's star player is its coach , the frenchman roger lemerre , who won the european championship with france in 2000 , and the confederations cup a year later .
lemerre has the tunisians playing tight and disciplined in the back , waiting for the chance to counter .
when they do , it 's usually over the wings - a mirror image of argentina 's style - and to francileude dos santos silva .
the native brazilian , who took tunisian citizenship just before the africa cup last year , became the tournament 's shooting star .
now , he 's ready to make problems for the big names in the confederations cup .
" on paper , we have no chance against germany and argentina , " said lemerre .
" but you never know . " possible lineup : tunisia - boumnijel - trabelsi , jaidi , abdi , clayton - ghodhbane , nafti , ben saada , mnari - santos , jaziri argentina - leo franco - coloccini , milito , heinze - j. zanetti , cambiasso , bernardi , sorin - riquelme - tevez , saviola germany - australia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kevin kuranyi will have to show he 's up to shouldering the goal-scoring burden germany comes into the tournament with a number of questions : can the strikers score goals ?
will the young defense stand up against major international competition ?
as a matter of fact , will the rest of the team stand up to major international competition ?
because it is hosting the world cup next year , germany has been spared the intensity and pressure of qualification .
as a result , coach jürgen klinsmann has been allowed to juggle around all sorts of lineup changes in the team 's friendly matches .
after this tournament , that should end .
tonight 's match against australia will be a chance for the strikers , most likely kevin kuranyi and gerald asamoah , to show their mettle in klinsmann 's offense-oriented playing style .
the german defense , who all hover around the age of 22 , will also have to prove itself - klinsmann ended practice this week with extra work for the defenders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : australia has a chance to surprise others at the tournament , but only a small one .
the definite underdog in this match-up , australia , is nevertheless a team with big dreams .
their past confed cup performances give them good reason to hope .
the team finished second in riyadh in 1997 , playing their way into the final before getting walloped by brazil .
in 2001 , in south korea and japan , the team beat brazil 1-0 to win third place and get their revenge .
coach frank farina remains confident : " we believe in ourselves , " he told reporters the other day .
his side is arguably one of the better ones in recent years , even without liverpool striker harry kewell , who is injured .
midfielders tim cahill , brett merton and striker mark viduka all play in the english premiership .
cahill will be responsible for directing the " socceroos " attack , and will look to take advantage of germany 's maligned and relatively slow defense .
the everton midfielder also remains a goal-scoring threat , notching 12 for his club as it marched to a champion 's league qualifying spot and seven for his country in as many appearances .

lemerre has the tunisians playing tight and disciplined in the back , waiting for the chance to counter .
when they do , it 's usually over the wings - a mirror image of argentina 's style - and to francileude dos santos silva .
the native brazilian , who took tunisian citizenship just before the africa cup last year , became the tournament 's shooting star .

because it is hosting the world cup next year , germany has been spared the intensity and pressure of qualification .
as a result , coach jürgen klinsmann has been allowed to juggle around all sorts of lineup changes in the team 's friendly matches .
after this tournament , that should end .
tonight 's match against australia will be a chance for the strikers , most likely kevin kuranyi and gerald asamoah , to show their mettle in klinsmann 's offense-oriented playing style .

" the meeting i 've just had with president chirac was immensely amicable but obviously there 's sharp disagreement , " blair told a news briefing after talks .
" i think it is difficult to see these differences being bridged , but of course you know we continue to talk . " british rebate and french farm subsidies the dispute centers on britain 's controversial 5.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.4 billion -rrb- eu rebate , forged by margaret thatcher 's iron will two decades ago , that is under fire from other eu members sick of footing the bill .

blair wants chirac to give ground on the topic before it agrees to submit its annual rebate from european coffers for renegotiation - a demand that chirac is unlikely to give in to for fear it could anger powerful french farmers at a time when his personal popularity at home has slipped to dismal levels . chirac has called for a " gesture of solidarity " from britain to freeze or surrender its debate . on wednesday , chirac 's spokesman jerome bonnafont told reuters that france wanted " a fair and reasonable agreement " in which everyone made a contribution .
he made no reference to any french concessions .
bonnafont said chirac believed it was " important we do not add financial difficulties to the current political crisis in europe , " sparked by the rejection of the eu constitution in france and the netherlands . eu treaty ratification tricky issue wednesday 's meeting with chirac marked the end of a two-day whirlwind diplomatic tour for blair which also took him to russia and germany .
the tour was meant to focus principally on the summit of the group of eight industrialized countries in gleneagles next month .
britain is chairing the g8 this year and has made ending chronic poverty in africa one of its top concerns for meetings , along with real progress on confronting climate change . britain 's own decision to shelve plans for a planned referendum on the eu constitution next year in the wake of the two rejections in france and the netherlands has not gone down well with other eu members who still want to push ahead with the ratification process . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair , left , with schröder in germany , chancellor gerhard schröder has emerged as a vocal champion of the embattled eu constitution , urging the bloc to press on with the ratification process despite london 's decision to call off a planned referendum on it .

but according to a recent study concerning the service sector , it 's still something of a novelty in germany , though that 's rapidly changing . in the early 1900s , henry ford revolutionized manufacturing when he introduced the assembly line to build cars .
the 1980s saw the next revolution : subcontractors took over part of the manufacturing process .
outsourcing has now taken hold of the service sector , where it 's called " offshoring . "
deutsche bank and the it organization bitkom presented a study on the effects of this change for the german workforce on tuesday in berlin that suggests that german it students may want to shift their emphasis . germany 's offshoring sales volume currently amounts to about 600 million euros -lrb- $ 723 million -rrb- .
an increase of more than 20 percent is expected over the next five years , and it 's a development that ca n't be halted , according to bitkom vice president jörg menno harms . " we can decide whether we want to react to globalization passively - as victims - or actively by having a say in the future division of labor in the world , " harms said .
" offshoring should n't be a taboo topic .
we 've got to acknowledge that companies use offshoring to keep up and to improve their international competitiveness . " due to the change , young computer scientists with fresh degrees in hand are likely to discover they can only get work in the sector as highly specialized experts with experience in project management or as consultants and customer advisors .

the fact that only 570 of the 4,000 companies contacted for the study participated illustrates how touchy it is .
despite promises of anonymity , many companies were concerned about their image .
but , the study actually showed that offshoring does n't necessarily have a negative effect on the jobs that remain in germany .
on the contrary , the savings allow the companies to grow and to hire more employees , harms said .
not always feasible though india is still the main destination for offshoring projects - it has 90 percent of the western european market - contractors from eastern europe are gaining ground , the study showed .

there just are n't enough highly specialized experts in germany and that 's what the country needs , walter said . in view of all the schools that - due to germany 's low birth rate - are expected to stand empty in the future , the country could start making a name for itself as a global contractor of education , " walter suggested .

but according to a recent study concerning the service sector , it 's still something of a novelty in germany , though that 's rapidly changing . in the early 1900s , henry ford revolutionized manufacturing when he introduced the assembly line to build cars .
the 1980s saw the next revolution : subcontractors took over part of the manufacturing process .
outsourcing has now taken hold of the service sector , where it 's called " offshoring . "
deutsche bank and the it organization bitkom presented a study on the effects of this change for the german workforce on tuesday in berlin that suggests that german it students may want to shift their emphasis . germany 's offshoring sales volume currently amounts to about 600 million euros -lrb- $ 723 million -rrb- .
an increase of more than 20 percent is expected over the next five years , and it 's a development that ca n't be halted , according to bitkom vice president jörg menno harms . " we can decide whether we want to react to globalization passively - as victims - or actively by having a say in the future division of labor in the world , " harms said .
" offshoring should n't be a taboo topic .
we 've got to acknowledge that companies use offshoring to keep up and to improve their international competitiveness . " due to the change , young computer scientists with fresh degrees in hand are likely to discover they can only get work in the sector as highly specialized experts with experience in project management or as consultants and customer advisors .
mere programmers are simply not needed in germany , since their work is now done in india , ireland and israel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relocating jobs abroad continues to be at the heart of heated discussions in germany .
the fact that only 570 of the 4,000 companies contacted for the study participated illustrates how touchy it is .
despite promises of anonymity , many companies were concerned about their image .
but , the study actually showed that offshoring does n't necessarily have a negative effect on the jobs that remain in germany .
on the contrary , the savings allow the companies to grow and to hire more employees , harms said .
not always feasible though india is still the main destination for offshoring projects - it has 90 percent of the western european market - contractors from eastern europe are gaining ground , the study showed . " we do feel a cultural proximity to eastern european countries , " one of the study 's authors , jürgen schaaf , said .
" the great advantage the us and britain have in india is a common language .
that 's an advantage germans do n't have in india .
but in many eastern european countries , german is spoken well enough to communicate on a working level . " in its own attempts to send jobs offshore , deutsche bank discovered firsthand the importance of language for the service sector .
the bank tried to establish a call-center abroad , but ended up leaving again because customers were n't satisfied . bildunterschrift : deutsche bank chief economist norbert walter " you learn that many languages are spoken all over the world , but often in such a manner that only locals can understand them , not our customers , " said deutsche bank chief economist norbert walter -lrb- photo -rrb- . now , one of the bank 's two global call-centers is located in berlin .
the way of the future ? but it 's not only customer services , bookkeeping and personnel that are prey to offshoring .
about 40 percent of the firms questioned in the study said they 'd partly offshored research and development as well .
but in this case , cost efficiency was n't the only reason .
there just are n't enough highly specialized experts in germany and that 's what the country needs , walter said . in view of all the schools that - due to germany 's low birth rate - are expected to stand empty in the future , the country could start making a name for itself as a global contractor of education , " walter suggested .
germany could make a name for itself for " inshoring " instead of offshoring . sabine kinkartz -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de giving globalization a coy voice what would happen if india 's formidable army of call center operators dropped their professional tone and got personal on the phone ?

fears are growing that the european union summit on thursday and friday in brussels will not resolve the bloc 's most pressing problems .
dw-world explains the two issues the heads of government and state will tackle . the budget the summit will aim to agree on the eu 's budgetary framework for 2007-2012 .
the so-called net contributors - including germany , the netherlands and sweden - which put more into the eu coffers than they get back , want to cut their payments and limit spending to no more than one percent of the bloc 's gross national income . in the run-up to the summit , britain has come under fire from eu leaders headed by french president jacques chirac for refusing to freeze the rebate it negotiated in 1984 , when it was the bloc 's poorest member .
currently , the rebate totals an average of 4.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.55 billion -rrb- annually , and almost 10 percent of it is now paid by the poorer eu members from eastern europe who joined last year .
british prime minister tony blair has been adamant that his country will not give way on the rebate unless agriculture subsidies , from which britain hardly profits , are subjected to drastic cuts .
france 's chirac has categorically ruled out any reduction in the subsidies , which his country 's farmers rely on . the european constitution the eu leaders will also debate what to do about the bloc constitution in the wake of french and dutch rejection of the document in may 29 and june 1 referendums .
the constitution was meant to help combat the unwieldy decision-making process in the enlarged bloc of 25 countries and 455 million people .
it can not be ratified without approval from all eu states . the summit participants may decide the treaty ca n't be ratified at all or call member states to go ahead with votes to see what the final results bring .
several eu leaders have called for the ratification process to be extended beyond the two-year period originally foreseen ; it was initially expected to be implemented in november 2006 .
the leaders could also indefinitely delay ratification .
it 's unlikely they will decide to renegotiate the treaty , as its drafting was a long and difficult process the first time round .

germany kick-off their confederations cup campaign on wednesday with high hopes of lifting the cup on june 29 .
but as dw-world 's blog reporter nick amies writes , a defensive flaw may end the dream before the final . the confederations cup begins on wednesday and , if the majority of pundits can be trusted in their evaluation , a south american team will be collecting the spoils on june 29 , therefore breaking the cycle of the trophy being retained by the holding federation . this line of thinking has already ruled out a german or greek victory , as the hosts and the european champions are the only ones who can take over from france , the current holders from uefa . this is doing a major disservice to the europeans even before a ball has been kicked in anger .
while greece may actually turn out to be the flash-in-the-pan that many expect , for germany it seems especially harsh . to write off the chances of jürgen klinsmann 's young eagles without even a badly sung national anthem passing their lips is a more of an insult than a disservice .

for those holding their sides , wait until you see the argentinean midfield breaking and bearing down on thorsten frings and then see who ’ s laughing . lacking an experienced protector germany have a potentially majestic back four in andreas hinkel , per mertesacker , robert huth and thomas hitzlsperger but this new generation lack the classic holding midfielder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense starts in front of the defenders and frings is not disciplined enough to play the role that franz beckenbauer and , to a lesser degree , hamann have done to such effect if the germans play 4-4-2 .

germany kick-off their confederations cup campaign on wednesday with high hopes of lifting the cup on june 29 .
but as dw-world 's blog reporter nick amies writes , a defensive flaw may end the dream before the final . the confederations cup begins on wednesday and , if the majority of pundits can be trusted in their evaluation , a south american team will be collecting the spoils on june 29 , therefore breaking the cycle of the trophy being retained by the holding federation . this line of thinking has already ruled out a german or greek victory , as the hosts and the european champions are the only ones who can take over from france , the current holders from uefa . this is doing a major disservice to the europeans even before a ball has been kicked in anger .
while greece may actually turn out to be the flash-in-the-pan that many expect , for germany it seems especially harsh . to write off the chances of jürgen klinsmann 's young eagles without even a badly sung national anthem passing their lips is a more of an insult than a disservice .
no doubt the tired argument of their inability to beat any of the top sides in the world in the last five years is being used to support the opinion that germany will fail to win the confederations cup . this , in my opinion , is just laziness ; an excuse to avoid delving deeper into the machinations of the german team and asking why they may not have what it takes to deliver on home soil this month . underlying flaws bildunterschrift : while it is bad form to give the germans no chance at all before the tournament begins , it is entirely likely that the issues that many analysts avoid in their rush to praise the brazilians and argentineans may be the undoing of this undoubtedly talented but flawed german team . ironically , the germans suffer from the same problem that plagues the world champions at times - they have problems defending . this is a relatively new malaise for germany , a team which has been world famous for decades for stinginess on the international stage .
it used to be the germans couldn ’ t score .
but when they did , they had the resources to shut up shop and defend the 1-0 lead through to victory . the current problem became evident under rudi völler and , while the german defense is tighter since klinsmann took the helm , germany 's improving offensive play distracts from a continuing problem left over from the previous era . exciting attackers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann finds himself with one problem most teams would dream to have : an excess of exciting , attacking players .
you can tick them off as you look down the squad sheet … ballack , schweinsteiger -lrb- photo -rrb- , deisler , podolski … germany 's threat comes from up-front and from midfield , giving the coach and the team unenviable options when attacking . but what happens if they get caught on the break ? i would probably get laughed at or shouted down in any discussion on the subject by saying that the biggest loss to the german team for the confed cup has been the injury to dietmar hamann .
for those holding their sides , wait until you see the argentinean midfield breaking and bearing down on thorsten frings and then see who ’ s laughing . lacking an experienced protector germany have a potentially majestic back four in andreas hinkel , per mertesacker , robert huth and thomas hitzlsperger but this new generation lack the classic holding midfielder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense starts in front of the defenders and frings is not disciplined enough to play the role that franz beckenbauer and , to a lesser degree , hamann have done to such effect if the germans play 4-4-2 .
the defenders are even more exposed if klinsmann opts for a 4-3-3 with frings and fabian ernst deployed to the left and right with the central role going to an attack-minded michael ballack . and it is n't just the fault of frings .
bernd schneider and ballack often go missing when defensive duties come calling but it is the role bestowed on frings that bears the responsibility .
my jury remains out on his ability to protect his defenders . the young back four without a savvy guardian in front of them may find themselves pulled all over the place by the likes of javier saviola and juan riquelme in the final group a game against argentina on june 21 . attacking prowess bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : that said , germany 's attacking prowess against australia and tunisia is likely to be too much for these outside challengers and any threat the oceania and african champions may present is unlikely to cause the germans any irretrievable damage , seeing the home side through as runners-up . but in the latter stages , against the free-wheeling brazilians or meticulous greeks , germany may have more problems .

they head out to their private allotments to tend to their vegetables .
so when did that most suburban of activities become so hip ? undeterred by the bracing easterly wind , dirk ziegler is deadheading his geraniums .
" it 's good to get outside at the weekend , " exclaims the 35-year-old father-of-two as he surveys his modest kingdom .
raising his voice above the roar of a passing train , he shrugs off the obvious downsides of the urban garden .
" having an allotment in the center of town is perfect because it 's so easy to reach - and it 's great for the kids to have somewhere to play , " he says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dirk is part of a wider movement of 30-somethings who 've tired of late nights in smoky clubs and want to get back to nature . three years ago , he and his girlfriend leased a garden allotment in prenzlauer berg - a district in central berlin more commonly associated with fashionable bars and boutiques - and they 've never looked back .
" allotments have become trendy " , confirmed jürgen hurt , president of the berlin association for gardeners in an interview with the daily berliner zeitung .
according to a study conducted by the association , the average age of tenants has dropped from 56 to 46 in the last six years .
the " schrebergarten " -lrb- allotment -rrb- phenomenon , born a century ago , was named after the leipzig-based doctor daniel schreber - a staunch believer in exercise in the great outdoors for pasty-faced city children .
plots of land leased from the state became increasingly popular with tenants seeking gardens for their young , plus an opportunity to stock up their pantries with home-grown garden produce .
meet the weekend warriors today , pedestrians on the busy bornholmer bridge , which earned its place in history as the first border-crossing to be opened to east germans back in 1989 , can look down on the " garden colony " where dirk and his family now spend most of their free time .
flanked by railway lines and shopping malls , it 's a haven of tranquillity in an otherwise bleak urban landscape .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rosy-cheeked garden gnomes preside over well-kept lawns , framed by rows of flourishing hollyhocks and crispy-looking lettuces .
if it were n't for the not-so-distant hum of traffic , it would be a rural idyll .
but what 's most striking is that few of the residents are lounging around with a beer and the sports section of the sunday paper - they 're all getting their hands dirty .
" i put in at least ten hours of work a week , " says dirk , who 's been digging in his flower-bed all day .
his neighbor is busy putting up a trellis , while across the way , mrs sturmer is fixing her roof .
she 's part of the colony 's elder generation , who can remember a time when allotments were about survival rather than leisure .
" my allotment has been in the family for three generations , " she explained .
" my grandfather leased it during the recession in the 1920s , when people in the city really needed their allotments .
back then , it was a necessity , because if you did n't grow your own vegetables , you did n't have any . "
dig it ?
but times have changed , and these days , growing your own spinach is a lifestyle choice .
herbaceous borders are hipper than prada pumps .
in the uk , the times has even dubbed gardening " the new sex . "
so if you think weeding , digging and planting is for frustrated housewives , think again .
bildunterschrift : for just a few hundred euros a year , some 4 million germans enjoy the pastoral perks of an allotment garden , and waiting lists are long .
experts say this love affair with all things horticultural is a sign of the times .
" allotments used to be seen as conventional and boring , but not anymore , " said trend researcher eike wenzel .
it 's not even that vacations are a luxury few can afford when 5 million germans are unemployed .
" it does n't actually have anything to do with the country 's financial difficulties , " he said .
" it 's more about getting back to nature - the satisfaction of doing things yourself and using your hands . "
he would even go so far as to say it reflects a slow shift in values .
" it ties in with a return to tradition and a desire for a slower pace of life .
the 1990s were a very stormy decade of accelerated technology , modernization and digitalization , " he explained .
" but people now feel that they 've been disappointed by these developments and what they really want is a grounded family life and old-fashioned values .
bonding with nature is a key factor in that shift . "
urban refugees bildunterschrift : most of berlin 's 840 garden colonies are made up of 20 to 100 plots , each roughly 300 meters square , overseen by a highly authoritative residents ' association .
its job is to make sure everyone sticks to the rules , which range from keeping the noise down between midday and 3 p.m. to making sure trees never grow beyond a prescribed height and using at least one third of the garden as a vegetable patch .
" you have to fit in , and if you do n't like it , you should n't bother coming here , " says frau sturmer in no uncertain terms .
" young families have to adjust to the rules like everyone else . "
and most of them do .
an allotment garden is a coveted commodity , and not even the younger generation is prepared to risk being banished for bad behavior .
according to wenzel , germany 's new outdoor types are a conscientious bunch .
they have consumer clout , believe in buying organic , and - reflecting the trend to domestic tourism - they 're more likely to go on an eco-friendly holiday to germany 's baltic coast than a package tour to thailand .
the lohas " in advertising , there 's a lot of talk of what 's called lohas - lifestyle of health and sustainability , " he explained .
" we predict that in future , more and more germans will be living in a way that 's environmentally responsible - but enjoying themselves in the process .
the healthy hedonists are idealistic and political correct , but they 're also pleasure-seeking . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but while the healthy hedonists draw spiritual satisfaction from watching their carrots grow , the old-school allotment residents appreciate their leafy retreats for more prosaic reasons .

" allotments have become trendy " , confirmed jürgen hurt , president of the berlin association for gardeners in an interview with the daily berliner zeitung .
according to a study conducted by the association , the average age of tenants has dropped from 56 to 46 in the last six years .
the " schrebergarten " -lrb- allotment -rrb- phenomenon , born a century ago , was named after the leipzig-based doctor daniel schreber - a staunch believer in exercise in the great outdoors for pasty-faced city children .
plots of land leased from the state became increasingly popular with tenants seeking gardens for their young , plus an opportunity to stock up their pantries with home-grown garden produce .
meet the weekend warriors today , pedestrians on the busy bornholmer bridge , which earned its place in history as the first border-crossing to be opened to east germans back in 1989 , can look down on the " garden colony " where dirk and his family now spend most of their free time .
flanked by railway lines and shopping malls , it 's a haven of tranquillity in an otherwise bleak urban landscape .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rosy-cheeked garden gnomes preside over well-kept lawns , framed by rows of flourishing hollyhocks and crispy-looking lettuces .
if it were n't for the not-so-distant hum of traffic , it would be a rural idyll .
but what 's most striking is that few of the residents are lounging around with a beer and the sports section of the sunday paper - they 're all getting their hands dirty .
" i put in at least ten hours of work a week , " says dirk , who 's been digging in his flower-bed all day .
his neighbor is busy putting up a trellis , while across the way , mrs sturmer is fixing her roof .
she 's part of the colony 's elder generation , who can remember a time when allotments were about survival rather than leisure .
" my allotment has been in the family for three generations , " she explained .
" my grandfather leased it during the recession in the 1920s , when people in the city really needed their allotments .
back then , it was a necessity , because if you did n't grow your own vegetables , you did n't have any . "
dig it ?
but times have changed , and these days , growing your own spinach is a lifestyle choice .
herbaceous borders are hipper than prada pumps .
in the uk , the times has even dubbed gardening " the new sex . "
so if you think weeding , digging and planting is for frustrated housewives , think again .
bildunterschrift : for just a few hundred euros a year , some 4 million germans enjoy the pastoral perks of an allotment garden , and waiting lists are long .
experts say this love affair with all things horticultural is a sign of the times .
" allotments used to be seen as conventional and boring , but not anymore , " said trend researcher eike wenzel .
it 's not even that vacations are a luxury few can afford when 5 million germans are unemployed .
" it does n't actually have anything to do with the country 's financial difficulties , " he said .
" it 's more about getting back to nature - the satisfaction of doing things yourself and using your hands . "
he would even go so far as to say it reflects a slow shift in values .
" it ties in with a return to tradition and a desire for a slower pace of life .
the 1990s were a very stormy decade of accelerated technology , modernization and digitalization , " he explained .
" but people now feel that they 've been disappointed by these developments and what they really want is a grounded family life and old-fashioned values .
bonding with nature is a key factor in that shift . "
urban refugees bildunterschrift : most of berlin 's 840 garden colonies are made up of 20 to 100 plots , each roughly 300 meters square , overseen by a highly authoritative residents ' association .
its job is to make sure everyone sticks to the rules , which range from keeping the noise down between midday and 3 p.m. to making sure trees never grow beyond a prescribed height and using at least one third of the garden as a vegetable patch .
" you have to fit in , and if you do n't like it , you should n't bother coming here , " says frau sturmer in no uncertain terms .
" young families have to adjust to the rules like everyone else . "
and most of them do .
an allotment garden is a coveted commodity , and not even the younger generation is prepared to risk being banished for bad behavior .
according to wenzel , germany 's new outdoor types are a conscientious bunch .
they have consumer clout , believe in buying organic , and - reflecting the trend to domestic tourism - they 're more likely to go on an eco-friendly holiday to germany 's baltic coast than a package tour to thailand .
the lohas " in advertising , there 's a lot of talk of what 's called lohas - lifestyle of health and sustainability , " he explained .
" we predict that in future , more and more germans will be living in a way that 's environmentally responsible - but enjoying themselves in the process .
the healthy hedonists are idealistic and political correct , but they 're also pleasure-seeking . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but while the healthy hedonists draw spiritual satisfaction from watching their carrots grow , the old-school allotment residents appreciate their leafy retreats for more prosaic reasons .

" my allotment has been in the family for three generations , " she explained .

back then , it was a necessity , because if you did n't grow your own vegetables , you did n't have any . "

everyone was pleased with bringing home the three points but the porous defense is turning into a serious problem . for the 48,000 fans at the sold out waldstadion in frankfurt , germany 's opening match victory against australia was largely entertaining , if not at times nerve-wracking .
a soccer coach would have pulled out his or her hair , wondering how a team can suffer such lapses of concentration . " winning the opening match and the three points are very important , " said germany coach jürgen klinsmann , " but we also know some things did n't work optimally . " namely , giving up two first-half equalizers to the socceroos and then also a goal in stoppage time , but fortunately at that point , klinsmann 's squad had a two-goal advantage . six minutes of excitement bildunterschrift : australia 's josip skoko -lrb- yellow -rrb- squeezes the ball under germany 's jumping wall the first 15 minutes of the match were uneventful with both sides walking on pins and needles , playing stiffly .
kevin kuranyi 's goal in the 17th minute started what would be a toe-to-toe punchout in the following six minutes . before the fans could sit back down after celebrating the newly-acquired striker by schalke , germany 's central defender robert huth mugged john aloisi unnecessarily outside the german penalty box .
josip skoko took the free-kick and instead of lifting the ball , he kept it on the ground .
that was unfortunate because the wall jumped and watched the leather roll under their feet .
after 19 minutes , the score stood 1-1 . germany roared right back , with per mertesacker the benefactor of some sloppy defending by the australian defense and scored in the 23rd minute .
it was his first goal with the national squad , leaving many of the fans rubbing their eyes as their squad decided that attacking soccer , hardly what germany has been known for the past decade and a half , would bring success . since taking over last july , jürgen klinsmann promised more offense from the german team and he has held true to his promise .
at a cost , namely a porous defense . amateurish defense bildunterschrift : germany 's michael ballack -lrb- right -rrb- converts a penalty kick to put his side ahead 3-2 eight minutes after resecuring the lead , some very sharp passing and flat-footed defending allowed australia to get a second equalizer .
this time john aloisi beat his defender easily to streak into the penalty box and beat kahn .
the remainder of the second half , germany played insecurely and receiving a few catcalls when the referee carlos amarilla blew his whistle to end the first half . coming out of the locker room , germany were rejuvenated and put australia 's back against the wall .
it paid off in the 60th minute when arne friedrich , one of germany 's best players in the match , drew a penalty .
team captain michael ballack stepped and calmly sunk the spot kick and germany led 3-2 . the goal broke the australian resistance as the teams who both had expended much energy in the first hour , slowed the pace down .
the game started getting sloppy as passes frequently landed on an opponent 's foot or out of bounds . podolski secures victory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john aloisi scores australia 's second equalizer , getting past defender robert huth to do so lukas podolski was less affected by the fast pace .
in the 88th minute , he scored what would turn out to be the gamewinning goal after a strong run by ballack .
the two-goal lead was a relief to the sell-out crowd who could finally start singing after a night filled more with wonderment as the mostly unknown socceroos put world soccer power germany through the paces .

" around 150 addresses of a wide range of people suspected of being involved with child pornography were searched -lrb- tuesday -rrb- morning , " europol , the european police organization , said in a press release . the raids , codenamed " icebreaker , " were launched simultaneously in 13 countries after a six-month probe that started with a tip-off from a child defense group . europol director max-peter ratzel -lrb- photo , below -rrb- said he hoped they will " lead the investigators to some of the producers behind these evil deeds . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europol director max-peter ratzel of germany at least 23 people were arrested , and police seized large quantities of equipment including computers , laptop computers , videos and other material containing images of child abuse , mostly of young boys and girls from eastern europe and southeast asia .
most suspects are subject to further investigation , according to europol . members of the network downloaded and exchanged pictures of molested children .
europol did not say whether the investigation targeted child sex consumers or producers or both .

" this is an important day for the protection of children in europe , " said eu justice and home affairs commissioner franco frattini -lrb- photo -rrb- .
" but it is equally an important day for europe as such as it clearly demonstrates that only with a european joint approach cross-border issues such as organized crime can be effectively addressed . " " the investigation started in italy around a year ago after we received information from a child defense association and we contacted the europol when we realized that this was an international network , " italian police colonel leonardo alestra told afp in rome . according to a french source close to the investigation , the italian police , while investigating the contents of a computer hard disk , started up a server that allowed them to connect to up to 200 child sex web sites from some 20 different countries , most within the european union . in italy , some 60 houses were searched tuesday but the police did not make any arrests , according to alestra .

three people were placed under investigation in portugal . policeman and teacher arrested bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europol said the network 's members used advanced techniques to hide their electronic identity and to encrypt their communication .
according to alestra , the users of the internet sites containing what he called extremely shocking images could only get access to the images after typing several different passwords . europol said it coordinated the exchange of information among the different police forces and helped in the identification of suspects . in france , police arrested 15 people including a policeman and a teacher .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 15.06.2005 moving german service to foreign shores großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indians assume the lion 's share of german service jobs sent abroad outsourcing has become standard in manufacturing .
but according to a recent study concerning the service sector , it 's still something of a novelty in germany , though that 's rapidly changing . in the early 1900s , henry ford revolutionized manufacturing when he introduced the assembly line to build cars .
the 1980s saw the next revolution : subcontractors took over part of the manufacturing process .
outsourcing has now taken hold of the service sector , where it 's called " offshoring . "
deutsche bank and the it organization bitkom presented a study on the effects of this change for the german workforce on tuesday in berlin that suggests that german it students may want to shift their emphasis . germany 's offshoring sales volume currently amounts to about 600 million euros -lrb- $ 723 million -rrb- .
an increase of more than 20 percent is expected over the next five years , and it 's a development that ca n't be halted , according to bitkom vice president jörg menno harms . " we can decide whether we want to react to globalization passively - as victims - or actively by having a say in the future division of labor in the world , " harms said .
" offshoring should n't be a taboo topic .
we 've got to acknowledge that companies use offshoring to keep up and to improve their international competitiveness . " due to the change , young computer scientists with fresh degrees in hand are likely to discover they can only get work in the sector as highly specialized experts with experience in project management or as consultants and customer advisors .
mere programmers are simply not needed in germany , since their work is now done in india , ireland and israel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relocating jobs abroad continues to be at the heart of heated discussions in germany .
the fact that only 570 of the 4,000 companies contacted for the study participated illustrates how touchy it is .
despite promises of anonymity , many companies were concerned about their image .
but , the study actually showed that offshoring does n't necessarily have a negative effect on the jobs that remain in germany .
on the contrary , the savings allow the companies to grow and to hire more employees , harms said .
not always feasible though india is still the main destination for offshoring projects - it has 90 percent of the western european market - contractors from eastern europe are gaining ground , the study showed . " we do feel a cultural proximity to eastern european countries , " one of the study 's authors , jürgen schaaf , said .
" the great advantage the us and britain have in india is a common language .
that 's an advantage germans do n't have in india .
but in many eastern european countries , german is spoken well enough to communicate on a working level . " in its own attempts to send jobs offshore , deutsche bank discovered firsthand the importance of language for the service sector .
the bank tried to establish a call-center abroad , but ended up leaving again because customers were n't satisfied . bildunterschrift : deutsche bank chief economist norbert walter " you learn that many languages are spoken all over the world , but often in such a manner that only locals can understand them , not our customers , " said deutsche bank chief economist norbert walter -lrb- photo -rrb- . now , one of the bank 's two global call-centers is located in berlin .
the way of the future ? but it 's not only customer services , bookkeeping and personnel that are prey to offshoring .
about 40 percent of the firms questioned in the study said they 'd partly offshored research and development as well .
but in this case , cost efficiency was n't the only reason .
there just are n't enough highly specialized experts in germany and that 's what the country needs , walter said . in view of all the schools that - due to germany 's low birth rate - are expected to stand empty in the future , the country could start making a name for itself as a global contractor of education , " walter suggested .
germany could make a name for itself for " inshoring " instead of offshoring . sabine kinkartz -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de giving globalization a coy voice what would happen if india 's formidable army of call center operators dropped their professional tone and got personal on the phone ?

germany kick-off their confederations cup campaign on wednesday with high hopes of lifting the cup on june 29 .
but as dw-world 's blog reporter nick amies writes , a defensive flaw may end the dream before the final . the confederations cup begins on wednesday and , if the majority of pundits can be trusted in their evaluation , a south american team will be collecting the spoils on june 29 , therefore breaking the cycle of the trophy being retained by the holding federation . this line of thinking has already ruled out a german or greek victory , as the hosts and the european champions are the only ones who can take over from france , the current holders from uefa . this is doing a major disservice to the europeans even before a ball has been kicked in anger .
while greece may actually turn out to be the flash-in-the-pan that many expect , for germany it seems especially harsh . to write off the chances of jürgen klinsmann 's young eagles without even a badly sung national anthem passing their lips is a more of an insult than a disservice .
no doubt the tired argument of their inability to beat any of the top sides in the world in the last five years is being used to support the opinion that germany will fail to win the confederations cup . this , in my opinion , is just laziness ; an excuse to avoid delving deeper into the machinations of the german team and asking why they may not have what it takes to deliver on home soil this month . underlying flaws bildunterschrift : while it is bad form to give the germans no chance at all before the tournament begins , it is entirely likely that the issues that many analysts avoid in their rush to praise the brazilians and argentineans may be the undoing of this undoubtedly talented but flawed german team . ironically , the germans suffer from the same problem that plagues the world champions at times - they have problems defending . this is a relatively new malaise for germany , a team which has been world famous for decades for stinginess on the international stage .

for those holding their sides , wait until you see the argentinean midfield breaking and bearing down on thorsten frings and then see who ’ s laughing . lacking an experienced protector germany have a potentially majestic back four in andreas hinkel , per mertesacker , robert huth and thomas hitzlsperger but this new generation lack the classic holding midfielder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense starts in front of the defenders and frings is not disciplined enough to play the role that franz beckenbauer and , to a lesser degree , hamann have done to such effect if the germans play 4-4-2 .

they head out to their private allotments to tend to their vegetables .
so when did that most suburban of activities become so hip ? undeterred by the bracing easterly wind , dirk ziegler is deadheading his geraniums .
" it 's good to get outside at the weekend , " exclaims the 35-year-old father-of-two as he surveys his modest kingdom .
raising his voice above the roar of a passing train , he shrugs off the obvious downsides of the urban garden .
" having an allotment in the center of town is perfect because it 's so easy to reach - and it 's great for the kids to have somewhere to play , " he says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dirk is part of a wider movement of 30-somethings who 've tired of late nights in smoky clubs and want to get back to nature . three years ago , he and his girlfriend leased a garden allotment in prenzlauer berg - a district in central berlin more commonly associated with fashionable bars and boutiques - and they 've never looked back .
" allotments have become trendy " , confirmed jürgen hurt , president of the berlin association for gardeners in an interview with the daily berliner zeitung .
according to a study conducted by the association , the average age of tenants has dropped from 56 to 46 in the last six years .
the " schrebergarten " -lrb- allotment -rrb- phenomenon , born a century ago , was named after the leipzig-based doctor daniel schreber - a staunch believer in exercise in the great outdoors for pasty-faced city children .
plots of land leased from the state became increasingly popular with tenants seeking gardens for their young , plus an opportunity to stock up their pantries with home-grown garden produce .
meet the weekend warriors today , pedestrians on the busy bornholmer bridge , which earned its place in history as the first border-crossing to be opened to east germans back in 1989 , can look down on the " garden colony " where dirk and his family now spend most of their free time .
flanked by railway lines and shopping malls , it 's a haven of tranquillity in an otherwise bleak urban landscape .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rosy-cheeked garden gnomes preside over well-kept lawns , framed by rows of flourishing hollyhocks and crispy-looking lettuces .
if it were n't for the not-so-distant hum of traffic , it would be a rural idyll .
but what 's most striking is that few of the residents are lounging around with a beer and the sports section of the sunday paper - they 're all getting their hands dirty .
" i put in at least ten hours of work a week , " says dirk , who 's been digging in his flower-bed all day .
his neighbor is busy putting up a trellis , while across the way , mrs sturmer is fixing her roof .
she 's part of the colony 's elder generation , who can remember a time when allotments were about survival rather than leisure .
" my allotment has been in the family for three generations , " she explained .
" my grandfather leased it during the recession in the 1920s , when people in the city really needed their allotments .
back then , it was a necessity , because if you did n't grow your own vegetables , you did n't have any . "
dig it ?
but times have changed , and these days , growing your own spinach is a lifestyle choice .
herbaceous borders are hipper than prada pumps .
in the uk , the times has even dubbed gardening " the new sex . "
so if you think weeding , digging and planting is for frustrated housewives , think again .
bildunterschrift : for just a few hundred euros a year , some 4 million germans enjoy the pastoral perks of an allotment garden , and waiting lists are long .
experts say this love affair with all things horticultural is a sign of the times .
" allotments used to be seen as conventional and boring , but not anymore , " said trend researcher eike wenzel .
it 's not even that vacations are a luxury few can afford when 5 million germans are unemployed .
" it does n't actually have anything to do with the country 's financial difficulties , " he said .
" it 's more about getting back to nature - the satisfaction of doing things yourself and using your hands . "
he would even go so far as to say it reflects a slow shift in values .
" it ties in with a return to tradition and a desire for a slower pace of life .
the 1990s were a very stormy decade of accelerated technology , modernization and digitalization , " he explained .
" but people now feel that they 've been disappointed by these developments and what they really want is a grounded family life and old-fashioned values .
bonding with nature is a key factor in that shift . "
urban refugees bildunterschrift : most of berlin 's 840 garden colonies are made up of 20 to 100 plots , each roughly 300 meters square , overseen by a highly authoritative residents ' association .
its job is to make sure everyone sticks to the rules , which range from keeping the noise down between midday and 3 p.m. to making sure trees never grow beyond a prescribed height and using at least one third of the garden as a vegetable patch .
" you have to fit in , and if you do n't like it , you should n't bother coming here , " says frau sturmer in no uncertain terms .
" young families have to adjust to the rules like everyone else . "
and most of them do .
an allotment garden is a coveted commodity , and not even the younger generation is prepared to risk being banished for bad behavior .
according to wenzel , germany 's new outdoor types are a conscientious bunch .
they have consumer clout , believe in buying organic , and - reflecting the trend to domestic tourism - they 're more likely to go on an eco-friendly holiday to germany 's baltic coast than a package tour to thailand .
the lohas " in advertising , there 's a lot of talk of what 's called lohas - lifestyle of health and sustainability , " he explained .
" we predict that in future , more and more germans will be living in a way that 's environmentally responsible - but enjoying themselves in the process .
the healthy hedonists are idealistic and political correct , but they 're also pleasure-seeking . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but while the healthy hedonists draw spiritual satisfaction from watching their carrots grow , the old-school allotment residents appreciate their leafy retreats for more prosaic reasons .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 15.06.2005 moving german service to foreign shores großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indians assume the lion 's share of german service jobs sent abroad outsourcing has become standard in manufacturing .
but according to a recent study concerning the service sector , it 's still something of a novelty in germany , though that 's rapidly changing . in the early 1900s , henry ford revolutionized manufacturing when he introduced the assembly line to build cars .
the 1980s saw the next revolution : subcontractors took over part of the manufacturing process .
outsourcing has now taken hold of the service sector , where it 's called " offshoring . "
deutsche bank and the it organization bitkom presented a study on the effects of this change for the german workforce on tuesday in berlin that suggests that german it students may want to shift their emphasis . germany 's offshoring sales volume currently amounts to about 600 million euros -lrb- $ 723 million -rrb- .
an increase of more than 20 percent is expected over the next five years , and it 's a development that ca n't be halted , according to bitkom vice president jörg menno harms . " we can decide whether we want to react to globalization passively - as victims - or actively by having a say in the future division of labor in the world , " harms said .
" offshoring should n't be a taboo topic .
we 've got to acknowledge that companies use offshoring to keep up and to improve their international competitiveness . " due to the change , young computer scientists with fresh degrees in hand are likely to discover they can only get work in the sector as highly specialized experts with experience in project management or as consultants and customer advisors .
mere programmers are simply not needed in germany , since their work is now done in india , ireland and israel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relocating jobs abroad continues to be at the heart of heated discussions in germany .
the fact that only 570 of the 4,000 companies contacted for the study participated illustrates how touchy it is .
despite promises of anonymity , many companies were concerned about their image .
but , the study actually showed that offshoring does n't necessarily have a negative effect on the jobs that remain in germany .
on the contrary , the savings allow the companies to grow and to hire more employees , harms said .
not always feasible though india is still the main destination for offshoring projects - it has 90 percent of the western european market - contractors from eastern europe are gaining ground , the study showed . " we do feel a cultural proximity to eastern european countries , " one of the study 's authors , jürgen schaaf , said .
" the great advantage the us and britain have in india is a common language .
that 's an advantage germans do n't have in india .
but in many eastern european countries , german is spoken well enough to communicate on a working level . " in its own attempts to send jobs offshore , deutsche bank discovered firsthand the importance of language for the service sector .
the bank tried to establish a call-center abroad , but ended up leaving again because customers were n't satisfied . bildunterschrift : deutsche bank chief economist norbert walter " you learn that many languages are spoken all over the world , but often in such a manner that only locals can understand them , not our customers , " said deutsche bank chief economist norbert walter -lrb- photo -rrb- . now , one of the bank 's two global call-centers is located in berlin .
the way of the future ? but it 's not only customer services , bookkeeping and personnel that are prey to offshoring .
about 40 percent of the firms questioned in the study said they 'd partly offshored research and development as well .
but in this case , cost efficiency was n't the only reason .
there just are n't enough highly specialized experts in germany and that 's what the country needs , walter said . in view of all the schools that - due to germany 's low birth rate - are expected to stand empty in the future , the country could start making a name for itself as a global contractor of education , " walter suggested .
germany could make a name for itself for " inshoring " instead of offshoring . sabine kinkartz -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de giving globalization a coy voice what would happen if india 's formidable army of call center operators dropped their professional tone and got personal on the phone ?

german organizers hope they like what they see . so far , more than 500,000 tickets have been sold to the confederations cup tournament , which kicks off wednesday night when argentina plays tunisia in cologne . most of the fans will be locals , eager to get a measure of how organizers , as well as their team , are coming along ahead of the world cup next summer .
both organizers and political officials are hoping not to disappoint . the two-week tournament will be televised in 170 countries across the world , and organizers are hoping the 600,000-ticket barrier is reached some time during the tournament .
top matches like argentina and germany on june 21 and greece vs. brazil in leipzig on june 16 are already sold out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece , the surprise 2004 european champions , will be out to prove their victory was no fluke " the tournament is much more than a dress rehearsal for next year 's world cup , " fifa president joseph blatter told journalists .
" it 's a prestigious international tournament in its own right : you just have to cast an eye over the starting field . " win the confed cup , win the world cup hosts germany will be joined by mexico , japan , brazil , argentina , greece , australia and tunisia , the top teams from the world 's soccer federations .
though several teams are n't arriving with their top players - who are either injured or , like brazilian star ronaldo , " taking a rest " - coaches say each team is taking the tournament seriously .
german coach jürgen klinsmann -lrb- photo -rrb- said the tournament will be crucial to seeing how his young squad measures up against top competition , one year before it plays the world cup at home .
soccer officials have promised each player a 60,000 euro -lrb- $ 72,000 -rrb- bonus if they hoist the trophy on june 29 .
the reason ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen klinsmann wants nothing short of victory " he who wants to win the world cup , should also win the confederations cup , " said german soccer association president theo zwanziger . security also getting a test run the same philosophy might apply to german security officials .
one year before welcoming more than a million soccer fans into the country , germany 's police are eager to show the world that they can put on a peaceful tournament . the national information and cooperation center , a new body created expressly to coordinate policing activities for the 2006 tournament , will get a test run during the confederations cup .
the center will provide situation reports culled from information coming in from germany 's federal and 16 state police forces .
" we wo n't have the really big groups of -lrb- foreign -rrb- fans that we expect for the world cup , " said organizing committee vice-president wolfgang niersbach .

everyone was pleased with bringing home the three points but the porous defense is turning into a serious problem . for the 48,000 fans at the sold out waldstadion in frankfurt , germany 's opening match victory against australia was largely entertaining , if not at times nerve-wracking .
a soccer coach would have pulled out his or her hair , wondering how a team can suffer such lapses of concentration . " winning the opening match and the three points are very important , " said germany coach jürgen klinsmann , " but we also know some things did n't work optimally . " namely , giving up two first-half equalizers to the socceroos and then also a goal in stoppage time , but fortunately at that point , klinsmann 's squad had a two-goal advantage . six minutes of excitement bildunterschrift : australia 's josip skoko -lrb- yellow -rrb- squeezes the ball under germany 's jumping wall the first 15 minutes of the match were uneventful with both sides walking on pins and needles , playing stiffly .
kevin kuranyi 's goal in the 17th minute started what would be a toe-to-toe punchout in the following six minutes . before the fans could sit back down after celebrating the newly-acquired striker by schalke , germany 's central defender robert huth mugged john aloisi unnecessarily outside the german penalty box .
josip skoko took the free-kick and instead of lifting the ball , he kept it on the ground .
that was unfortunate because the wall jumped and watched the leather roll under their feet .
after 19 minutes , the score stood 1-1 . germany roared right back , with per mertesacker the benefactor of some sloppy defending by the australian defense and scored in the 23rd minute .
it was his first goal with the national squad , leaving many of the fans rubbing their eyes as their squad decided that attacking soccer , hardly what germany has been known for the past decade and a half , would bring success . since taking over last july , jürgen klinsmann promised more offense from the german team and he has held true to his promise .
at a cost , namely a porous defense . amateurish defense bildunterschrift : germany 's michael ballack -lrb- right -rrb- converts a penalty kick to put his side ahead 3-2 eight minutes after resecuring the lead , some very sharp passing and flat-footed defending allowed australia to get a second equalizer .
this time john aloisi beat his defender easily to streak into the penalty box and beat kahn .
the remainder of the second half , germany played insecurely and receiving a few catcalls when the referee carlos amarilla blew his whistle to end the first half . coming out of the locker room , germany were rejuvenated and put australia 's back against the wall .
it paid off in the 60th minute when arne friedrich , one of germany 's best players in the match , drew a penalty .
team captain michael ballack stepped and calmly sunk the spot kick and germany led 3-2 . the goal broke the australian resistance as the teams who both had expended much energy in the first hour , slowed the pace down .
the game started getting sloppy as passes frequently landed on an opponent 's foot or out of bounds . podolski secures victory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john aloisi scores australia 's second equalizer , getting past defender robert huth to do so lukas podolski was less affected by the fast pace .
in the 88th minute , he scored what would turn out to be the gamewinning goal after a strong run by ballack .
the two-goal lead was a relief to the sell-out crowd who could finally start singing after a night filled more with wonderment as the mostly unknown socceroos put world soccer power germany through the paces .
but it was almost not enough . in stoppage time , the german backline fell asleep as it did against russia one week ago .
aloisi again could break free and scored as the defenders wondered how he got behind them . the fans then had to wait only another 30 seconds before amarilla blew the final whistle and they could breathe a collective sigh of relief . klinsmann has promised excitement and that is what they got . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de argentina dominates tunisia in opener argentina played a superior game against tunisia , winning 2-1 with the help of a penalty kick and a nicely-played second goal .

more than half of the 13,000 people who participated in an online survey for celebrity magazine bunte on tuesday welcomed the court decision.only 27 percent were opposed , while 21 percent were undecided . jackson 's europe manager ralf sesselberg said that the jackson family was planning a " thank-you " party for jacko 's loyal fans in germany .
" some family members could come for it , maybe his father , " said sesselberg in lower saxony .
but he ruled out the possibility of the so-called " king of pop " personally making an appearance . bildunterschrift : michael jackson fans display hearts and signed messages in support of jackson outside his neverland ranch in california . meanwhile , jackson 's lawyers have come in for praise for their expert handling of the controversial long-drawn out trial that attracted frenzied media attention . german legal expert dietmar herz said that jackson 's lawyers had been " brilliant . "
in an interview with " spiegel online " news site , herz said the trial had been just and fair . " naturally jackson is an overwhelmingly prominent defendant who sparked worldwide support as well as criticism and stirred a media storm , " herz said .
" but his stardom did not bring him any recognizable advantages .
his only plus point was that he could hire one of the best lawyers in the country . " " he 's just a wreck " newspapers across the continent , however , were n't so forgiving . spanish daily el mundo wrote that michael jackson 's reputation had taken a serious battering .
" the singer was acquitted but only because of lack of evidence .
jackson did n't contribute to the defense at all , " the paper said .
it added that the trial had illustrated the physical and psychological decay of the star .
" his records do n't sell and he does n't even attract fans the way he used to .
he 's like a broken toy .
the former child prodigy stood in the spotlight almost all his life .
but the singer could n't come to terms with his fame and getting older . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael jackson italian newspaper il messaggero was equally scathing .
" there 's no doubt that the peter pan of rock would still fill entire stadiums today , " it wrote .
" but there 's also a concrete risk that he could lose face doing that -lrb- and that not only as a consequence of too many plastic surgeries -rrb- , " the paper said .
" the jackson of today is not in the slightest the jackson from ' thriller ' and ' bad ' . " dutch daily de volkskrant said the trial had visibly aged and weakened jackson and that he left the california courtroom a broken man who only invoked pity .
" a people-shy megastar whose career is practically over and who 's financially dead , who may not have indulged in any proven buggery but who is obviously caught in the grip of an unmistakable and sick preference for the company of children , " is how the paper described him .
" the king of pop is finally rid of his throne . " germany 's munich-based münchner merkur lashed out at the trial , saying the evidence was too thin , the witness testimonies too contradictory and the suspicion too deep that the relatives of the apparent victim were mainly driven by financial motives .
" the former king of pop may not be perfectly rehabilitated , but he is rightly a free man , " the paper opined .
" however , the talent of the century with a childlike psyche will have to live with the stigma of a pedophile , " it wrote .
" a comeback to the pinnacle of pop will , however , remain off-limits - despite all the hysterical swearing of loyalty from his fans . " germany 's mass-selling tabloid newspaper bild titled " but what has the trial done to the king of pop ? - he 's just a wreck .

" british rebate and french farm subsidies the dispute centers on britain 's controversial 5.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.4 billion -rrb- eu rebate , forged by margaret thatcher 's iron will two decades ago , that is under fire from other eu members sick of footing the bill .
france , germany , spain and the netherlands in particular want the rebate to be reconsidered , claiming that since it was introduced britain has grown much richer and the eu much bigger . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french dairy farmer jean-marc guigue repairs fencing on his dairy farm in mognard , france britain wants a reform of agricultural subsidies , agreed upon in 2002 , which consumes more than 40 percent of the eu 's budget and especially benefits french farmers .
blair wants chirac to give ground on the topic before it agrees to submit its annual rebate from european coffers for renegotiation - a demand that chirac is unlikely to give in to for fear it could anger powerful french farmers at a time when his personal popularity at home has slipped to dismal levels . chirac has called for a " gesture of solidarity " from britain to freeze or surrender its debate . on wednesday , chirac 's spokesman jerome bonnafont told reuters that france wanted " a fair and reasonable agreement " in which everyone made a contribution .
he made no reference to any french concessions .
bonnafont said chirac believed it was " important we do not add financial difficulties to the current political crisis in europe , " sparked by the rejection of the eu constitution in france and the netherlands . eu treaty ratification tricky issue wednesday 's meeting with chirac marked the end of a two-day whirlwind diplomatic tour for blair which also took him to russia and germany .
the tour was meant to focus principally on the summit of the group of eight industrialized countries in gleneagles next month .
britain is chairing the g8 this year and has made ending chronic poverty in africa one of its top concerns for meetings , along with real progress on confronting climate change . britain 's own decision to shelve plans for a planned referendum on the eu constitution next year in the wake of the two rejections in france and the netherlands has not gone down well with other eu members who still want to push ahead with the ratification process . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair , left , with schröder in germany , chancellor gerhard schröder has emerged as a vocal champion of the embattled eu constitution , urging the bloc to press on with the ratification process despite london 's decision to call off a planned referendum on it .
he has also taken the french side in the farm subsidies row , which blair has said must also be put on the table in brussels this week . " chancellor schröder is clearly on the same lines as the french president as far as agricultural subsidies are concerned , " government spokesman bela anda said monday ahead of the meeting between schröder and blair . a clear political direction britain 's position on both the constitution and the budget and blair 's row with chirac have left it looking increasingly isolated within the eu - a situation similar to the time when britain joined the us-led invasion in iraq in 2003 in the face of fierce franco-german opposition . experts are pessimistic about the prospect of a deal on either of the issues at a two-day eu summit that kicks off in brussels on thursday . luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , whose country currently holds the six-month rotating eu presidency , said he was fairly certain a deal would n't be brokered at the summit . " i am pretty sure we wo n't get the financial perspectives through at this summit , " juncker told a european parliament committee , hours before he was due to circulate a compromise proposal on the 2007-2013 budget to eu leaders .
" there is agreement , more or less , on the total amount of funding .
we differ as to payments to the budget , the structure of expenditure and who is a net contributor , " juncker said . tony blair , who has rejected a long-term freeze on britain 's widely-criticized eu budget rebate , has linked the budget dispute to the constitutional and political crisis gripping the eu and called for a pause for reflection .

germany kick-off their confederations cup campaign on wednesday with high hopes of lifting the cup on june 29 .
but as dw-world 's blog reporter nick amies writes , a defensive flaw may end the dream before the final . the confederations cup begins on wednesday and , if the majority of pundits can be trusted in their evaluation , a south american team will be collecting the spoils on june 29 , therefore breaking the cycle of the trophy being retained by the holding federation . this line of thinking has already ruled out a german or greek victory , as the hosts and the european champions are the only ones who can take over from france , the current holders from uefa . this is doing a major disservice to the europeans even before a ball has been kicked in anger .
while greece may actually turn out to be the flash-in-the-pan that many expect , for germany it seems especially harsh . to write off the chances of jürgen klinsmann 's young eagles without even a badly sung national anthem passing their lips is a more of an insult than a disservice .
no doubt the tired argument of their inability to beat any of the top sides in the world in the last five years is being used to support the opinion that germany will fail to win the confederations cup . this , in my opinion , is just laziness ; an excuse to avoid delving deeper into the machinations of the german team and asking why they may not have what it takes to deliver on home soil this month . underlying flaws bildunterschrift : while it is bad form to give the germans no chance at all before the tournament begins , it is entirely likely that the issues that many analysts avoid in their rush to praise the brazilians and argentineans may be the undoing of this undoubtedly talented but flawed german team . ironically , the germans suffer from the same problem that plagues the world champions at times - they have problems defending . this is a relatively new malaise for germany , a team which has been world famous for decades for stinginess on the international stage .
it used to be the germans couldn ’ t score .
but when they did , they had the resources to shut up shop and defend the 1-0 lead through to victory . the current problem became evident under rudi völler and , while the german defense is tighter since klinsmann took the helm , germany 's improving offensive play distracts from a continuing problem left over from the previous era . exciting attackers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann finds himself with one problem most teams would dream to have : an excess of exciting , attacking players .
you can tick them off as you look down the squad sheet … ballack , schweinsteiger -lrb- photo -rrb- , deisler , podolski … germany 's threat comes from up-front and from midfield , giving the coach and the team unenviable options when attacking . but what happens if they get caught on the break ? i would probably get laughed at or shouted down in any discussion on the subject by saying that the biggest loss to the german team for the confed cup has been the injury to dietmar hamann .
for those holding their sides , wait until you see the argentinean midfield breaking and bearing down on thorsten frings and then see who ’ s laughing . lacking an experienced protector germany have a potentially majestic back four in andreas hinkel , per mertesacker , robert huth and thomas hitzlsperger but this new generation lack the classic holding midfielder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense starts in front of the defenders and frings is not disciplined enough to play the role that franz beckenbauer and , to a lesser degree , hamann have done to such effect if the germans play 4-4-2 .
the defenders are even more exposed if klinsmann opts for a 4-3-3 with frings and fabian ernst deployed to the left and right with the central role going to an attack-minded michael ballack . and it is n't just the fault of frings .
bernd schneider and ballack often go missing when defensive duties come calling but it is the role bestowed on frings that bears the responsibility .
my jury remains out on his ability to protect his defenders . the young back four without a savvy guardian in front of them may find themselves pulled all over the place by the likes of javier saviola and juan riquelme in the final group a game against argentina on june 21 . attacking prowess bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : that said , germany 's attacking prowess against australia and tunisia is likely to be too much for these outside challengers and any threat the oceania and african champions may present is unlikely to cause the germans any irretrievable damage , seeing the home side through as runners-up . but in the latter stages , against the free-wheeling brazilians or meticulous greeks , germany may have more problems .
overcoming either of the top teams in group b could set germany up for a final against argentina who are definitely one of the teams to beat . it is they , not brazil , who are my south american tip for the confederation cup with germany suffering painful , but encouraging , heartbreak at the final hurdle . extracted from dw-world 's confederations cup blog nick amies , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the confederations cup comes to germany the fifa 2005 confederations cup kicks off in germany on june 15 , bringing the leading teams from the world 's six soccer federations together to compete for the title of champion of champions .

germany kick-off their confederations cup campaign on wednesday with high hopes of lifting the cup on june 29 .
but as dw-world 's blog reporter nick amies writes , a defensive flaw may end the dream before the final . the confederations cup begins on wednesday and , if the majority of pundits can be trusted in their evaluation , a south american team will be collecting the spoils on june 29 , therefore breaking the cycle of the trophy being retained by the holding federation . this line of thinking has already ruled out a german or greek victory , as the hosts and the european champions are the only ones who can take over from france , the current holders from uefa . this is doing a major disservice to the europeans even before a ball has been kicked in anger .
while greece may actually turn out to be the flash-in-the-pan that many expect , for germany it seems especially harsh . to write off the chances of jürgen klinsmann 's young eagles without even a badly sung national anthem passing their lips is a more of an insult than a disservice .
no doubt the tired argument of their inability to beat any of the top sides in the world in the last five years is being used to support the opinion that germany will fail to win the confederations cup . this , in my opinion , is just laziness ; an excuse to avoid delving deeper into the machinations of the german team and asking why they may not have what it takes to deliver on home soil this month . underlying flaws bildunterschrift : while it is bad form to give the germans no chance at all before the tournament begins , it is entirely likely that the issues that many analysts avoid in their rush to praise the brazilians and argentineans may be the undoing of this undoubtedly talented but flawed german team . ironically , the germans suffer from the same problem that plagues the world champions at times - they have problems defending . this is a relatively new malaise for germany , a team which has been world famous for decades for stinginess on the international stage .
it used to be the germans couldn ’ t score .
but when they did , they had the resources to shut up shop and defend the 1-0 lead through to victory . the current problem became evident under rudi völler and , while the german defense is tighter since klinsmann took the helm , germany 's improving offensive play distracts from a continuing problem left over from the previous era . exciting attackers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann finds himself with one problem most teams would dream to have : an excess of exciting , attacking players .
you can tick them off as you look down the squad sheet … ballack , schweinsteiger -lrb- photo -rrb- , deisler , podolski … germany 's threat comes from up-front and from midfield , giving the coach and the team unenviable options when attacking . but what happens if they get caught on the break ? i would probably get laughed at or shouted down in any discussion on the subject by saying that the biggest loss to the german team for the confed cup has been the injury to dietmar hamann .
for those holding their sides , wait until you see the argentinean midfield breaking and bearing down on thorsten frings and then see who ’ s laughing . lacking an experienced protector germany have a potentially majestic back four in andreas hinkel , per mertesacker , robert huth and thomas hitzlsperger but this new generation lack the classic holding midfielder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense starts in front of the defenders and frings is not disciplined enough to play the role that franz beckenbauer and , to a lesser degree , hamann have done to such effect if the germans play 4-4-2 .
the defenders are even more exposed if klinsmann opts for a 4-3-3 with frings and fabian ernst deployed to the left and right with the central role going to an attack-minded michael ballack . and it is n't just the fault of frings .
bernd schneider and ballack often go missing when defensive duties come calling but it is the role bestowed on frings that bears the responsibility .
my jury remains out on his ability to protect his defenders . the young back four without a savvy guardian in front of them may find themselves pulled all over the place by the likes of javier saviola and juan riquelme in the final group a game against argentina on june 21 . attacking prowess bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : that said , germany 's attacking prowess against australia and tunisia is likely to be too much for these outside challengers and any threat the oceania and african champions may present is unlikely to cause the germans any irretrievable damage , seeing the home side through as runners-up . but in the latter stages , against the free-wheeling brazilians or meticulous greeks , germany may have more problems .

both organizers and political officials are hoping not to disappoint . the two-week tournament will be televised in 170 countries across the world , and organizers are hoping the 600,000-ticket barrier is reached some time during the tournament .

germany kick-off their confederations cup campaign on wednesday with high hopes of lifting the cup on june 29 .
but as dw-world 's blog reporter nick amies writes , a defensive flaw may end the dream before the final . the confederations cup begins on wednesday and , if the majority of pundits can be trusted in their evaluation , a south american team will be collecting the spoils on june 29 , therefore breaking the cycle of the trophy being retained by the holding federation . this line of thinking has already ruled out a german or greek victory , as the hosts and the european champions are the only ones who can take over from france , the current holders from uefa . this is doing a major disservice to the europeans even before a ball has been kicked in anger .
while greece may actually turn out to be the flash-in-the-pan that many expect , for germany it seems especially harsh . to write off the chances of jürgen klinsmann 's young eagles without even a badly sung national anthem passing their lips is a more of an insult than a disservice .
no doubt the tired argument of their inability to beat any of the top sides in the world in the last five years is being used to support the opinion that germany will fail to win the confederations cup . this , in my opinion , is just laziness ; an excuse to avoid delving deeper into the machinations of the german team and asking why they may not have what it takes to deliver on home soil this month . underlying flaws bildunterschrift : while it is bad form to give the germans no chance at all before the tournament begins , it is entirely likely that the issues that many analysts avoid in their rush to praise the brazilians and argentineans may be the undoing of this undoubtedly talented but flawed german team . ironically , the germans suffer from the same problem that plagues the world champions at times - they have problems defending . this is a relatively new malaise for germany , a team which has been world famous for decades for stinginess on the international stage .
it used to be the germans couldn ’ t score .
but when they did , they had the resources to shut up shop and defend the 1-0 lead through to victory . the current problem became evident under rudi völler and , while the german defense is tighter since klinsmann took the helm , germany 's improving offensive play distracts from a continuing problem left over from the previous era . exciting attackers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann finds himself with one problem most teams would dream to have : an excess of exciting , attacking players .
you can tick them off as you look down the squad sheet … ballack , schweinsteiger -lrb- photo -rrb- , deisler , podolski … germany 's threat comes from up-front and from midfield , giving the coach and the team unenviable options when attacking . but what happens if they get caught on the break ? i would probably get laughed at or shouted down in any discussion on the subject by saying that the biggest loss to the german team for the confed cup has been the injury to dietmar hamann .
for those holding their sides , wait until you see the argentinean midfield breaking and bearing down on thorsten frings and then see who ’ s laughing . lacking an experienced protector germany have a potentially majestic back four in andreas hinkel , per mertesacker , robert huth and thomas hitzlsperger but this new generation lack the classic holding midfielder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense starts in front of the defenders and frings is not disciplined enough to play the role that franz beckenbauer and , to a lesser degree , hamann have done to such effect if the germans play 4-4-2 .
the defenders are even more exposed if klinsmann opts for a 4-3-3 with frings and fabian ernst deployed to the left and right with the central role going to an attack-minded michael ballack . and it is n't just the fault of frings .
bernd schneider and ballack often go missing when defensive duties come calling but it is the role bestowed on frings that bears the responsibility .
my jury remains out on his ability to protect his defenders . the young back four without a savvy guardian in front of them may find themselves pulled all over the place by the likes of javier saviola and juan riquelme in the final group a game against argentina on june 21 . attacking prowess bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : that said , germany 's attacking prowess against australia and tunisia is likely to be too much for these outside challengers and any threat the oceania and african champions may present is unlikely to cause the germans any irretrievable damage , seeing the home side through as runners-up . but in the latter stages , against the free-wheeling brazilians or meticulous greeks , germany may have more problems .
overcoming either of the top teams in group b could set germany up for a final against argentina who are definitely one of the teams to beat . it is they , not brazil , who are my south american tip for the confederation cup with germany suffering painful , but encouraging , heartbreak at the final hurdle . extracted from dw-world 's confederations cup blog nick amies , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the confederations cup comes to germany the fifa 2005 confederations cup kicks off in germany on june 15 , bringing the leading teams from the world 's six soccer federations together to compete for the title of champion of champions .

german organizers hope they like what they see . so far , more than 500,000 tickets have been sold to the confederations cup tournament , which kicks off wednesday night when argentina plays tunisia in cologne . most of the fans will be locals , eager to get a measure of how organizers , as well as their team , are coming along ahead of the world cup next summer .
both organizers and political officials are hoping not to disappoint . the two-week tournament will be televised in 170 countries across the world , and organizers are hoping the 600,000-ticket barrier is reached some time during the tournament .
top matches like argentina and germany on june 21 and greece vs. brazil in leipzig on june 16 are already sold out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece , the surprise 2004 european champions , will be out to prove their victory was no fluke " the tournament is much more than a dress rehearsal for next year 's world cup , " fifa president joseph blatter told journalists .
" it 's a prestigious international tournament in its own right : you just have to cast an eye over the starting field . " win the confed cup , win the world cup hosts germany will be joined by mexico , japan , brazil , argentina , greece , australia and tunisia , the top teams from the world 's soccer federations .
though several teams are n't arriving with their top players - who are either injured or , like brazilian star ronaldo , " taking a rest " - coaches say each team is taking the tournament seriously .
german coach jürgen klinsmann -lrb- photo -rrb- said the tournament will be crucial to seeing how his young squad measures up against top competition , one year before it plays the world cup at home .
soccer officials have promised each player a 60,000 euro -lrb- $ 72,000 -rrb- bonus if they hoist the trophy on june 29 .
the reason ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen klinsmann wants nothing short of victory " he who wants to win the world cup , should also win the confederations cup , " said german soccer association president theo zwanziger . security also getting a test run the same philosophy might apply to german security officials .
one year before welcoming more than a million soccer fans into the country , germany 's police are eager to show the world that they can put on a peaceful tournament . the national information and cooperation center , a new body created expressly to coordinate policing activities for the 2006 tournament , will get a test run during the confederations cup .
the center will provide situation reports culled from information coming in from germany 's federal and 16 state police forces .
" we wo n't have the really big groups of -lrb- foreign -rrb- fans that we expect for the world cup , " said organizing committee vice-president wolfgang niersbach .
" but otherwise the measures in respect of security are the same … there will be an external security ring right around the stadium . " too many tournaments the heightened security measures are at the same time an acknowledgement of how far the confed cup has come since its humble beginnings as an invitation-only tournament of four teams in saudi arabia in 1992 .
but not all are happy about its progress . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ronaldo will be resting , not playing , this time around the inclusion of yet another tournament in a playing schedule that can be gruelling for top-flight players has reaped criticism from some team managers .
four mexican players , registered to play for the national team in the tournament , might not show up because of playing commitments to their clubs .
fifa has threatened to take action . " the players do n't have enough vacation , " said karl-heinz rummenigge , a german soccer legend and chairman of bundesliga champions fc bayern munich , adding that the tournament should be phased out . organizers , of course , do n't want to hear such talk now .
everyone from the local fan to the kaiser himself , world cup 2006 organizing committee chief franz beckenbauer , is singing the confed cup 's praises - and hoping the home country -lrb- and team -rrb- make a strong showing .
" i 'm looking forward to the tournament , " said beckenbauer .

fears are growing that the european union summit on thursday and friday in brussels will not resolve the bloc 's most pressing problems .
dw-world explains the two issues the heads of government and state will tackle . the budget the summit will aim to agree on the eu 's budgetary framework for 2007-2012 .
the so-called net contributors - including germany , the netherlands and sweden - which put more into the eu coffers than they get back , want to cut their payments and limit spending to no more than one percent of the bloc 's gross national income . in the run-up to the summit , britain has come under fire from eu leaders headed by french president jacques chirac for refusing to freeze the rebate it negotiated in 1984 , when it was the bloc 's poorest member .
currently , the rebate totals an average of 4.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.55 billion -rrb- annually , and almost 10 percent of it is now paid by the poorer eu members from eastern europe who joined last year .
british prime minister tony blair has been adamant that his country will not give way on the rebate unless agriculture subsidies , from which britain hardly profits , are subjected to drastic cuts .
france 's chirac has categorically ruled out any reduction in the subsidies , which his country 's farmers rely on . the european constitution the eu leaders will also debate what to do about the bloc constitution in the wake of french and dutch rejection of the document in may 29 and june 1 referendums .
the constitution was meant to help combat the unwieldy decision-making process in the enlarged bloc of 25 countries and 455 million people .
it can not be ratified without approval from all eu states . the summit participants may decide the treaty ca n't be ratified at all or call member states to go ahead with votes to see what the final results bring .
several eu leaders have called for the ratification process to be extended beyond the two-year period originally foreseen ; it was initially expected to be implemented in november 2006 .
the leaders could also indefinitely delay ratification .
it 's unlikely they will decide to renegotiate the treaty , as its drafting was a long and difficult process the first time round .
observers warn that the summit might not result in any progress at all . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german duo squeezed in brussels german chancellor gerhard schröder has appealed for unity and compromise at this week 's european union summit in brussels .

-lrb- june 14 , 2005 -rrb- eu attempts to untie budget tangles eu foreign ministers are meeting monday to discuss the future spending of the eu .
despite expectations of reaching a compromise on the issue , positions hardened in the run-up to the talks .

tunisia was left rueing an early missed penalty shot that might have changed the flow of the match .
and referee roberto rosetti will probably want to review the game tape to take a second look at some of his calls .
tunisia started quick in the first half , as argentina found itself confounded by the coach roger lemerre 's disciplined backfield . still , a couple of close calls came right at the beginning , when saviola failed to get past goalie khaled fadhel in the 14th minute , and galletti 's header went above the crossbar a minute later . penalty shot on counter tunisia rarely ventured into the argentine half of the field after an initial storm of action .

fears are growing that the european union summit on thursday and friday in brussels will not resolve the bloc 's most pressing problems .
dw-world explains the two issues the heads of government and state will tackle . the budget the summit will aim to agree on the eu 's budgetary framework for 2007-2012 .
the so-called net contributors - including germany , the netherlands and sweden - which put more into the eu coffers than they get back , want to cut their payments and limit spending to no more than one percent of the bloc 's gross national income . in the run-up to the summit , britain has come under fire from eu leaders headed by french president jacques chirac for refusing to freeze the rebate it negotiated in 1984 , when it was the bloc 's poorest member .
currently , the rebate totals an average of 4.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.55 billion -rrb- annually , and almost 10 percent of it is now paid by the poorer eu members from eastern europe who joined last year .
british prime minister tony blair has been adamant that his country will not give way on the rebate unless agriculture subsidies , from which britain hardly profits , are subjected to drastic cuts .
france 's chirac has categorically ruled out any reduction in the subsidies , which his country 's farmers rely on . the european constitution the eu leaders will also debate what to do about the bloc constitution in the wake of french and dutch rejection of the document in may 29 and june 1 referendums .
the constitution was meant to help combat the unwieldy decision-making process in the enlarged bloc of 25 countries and 455 million people .
it can not be ratified without approval from all eu states . the summit participants may decide the treaty ca n't be ratified at all or call member states to go ahead with votes to see what the final results bring .
several eu leaders have called for the ratification process to be extended beyond the two-year period originally foreseen ; it was initially expected to be implemented in november 2006 .
the leaders could also indefinitely delay ratification .
it 's unlikely they will decide to renegotiate the treaty , as its drafting was a long and difficult process the first time round .
observers warn that the summit might not result in any progress at all . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german duo squeezed in brussels german chancellor gerhard schröder has appealed for unity and compromise at this week 's european union summit in brussels .

germany faces off against australia in the second match .
who has the best shot ? argentina - tunisia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : striker javier saviola , nicknamed " the rabbit " , is a massive goal-scoring threat though playing without stars hernan crespo , roberto ayala and juan sebastian veron , argentina is one of those countries that produces soccer talent like other countries produce co2 emissions .
coach jose pekerman still has javier saviola , juan roman riquelme , javier zanetti , and defender gabriel heinze to pick from , all of whom will figure prominently in the gauchos ' attacking style .
high off of a 3-1 spanking of brazil in the world cup qualifying rounds that secured them a spot in the 2006 world cup , argentina comes into the confederations cup tournament playing well enough to earn its " favorite " status . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : silva has been a serious threat ever since tunisia one the africa cup tunisia 's star player is its coach , the frenchman roger lemerre , who won the european championship with france in 2000 , and the confederations cup a year later .
lemerre has the tunisians playing tight and disciplined in the back , waiting for the chance to counter .
when they do , it 's usually over the wings - a mirror image of argentina 's style - and to francileude dos santos silva .
the native brazilian , who took tunisian citizenship just before the africa cup last year , became the tournament 's shooting star .
now , he 's ready to make problems for the big names in the confederations cup .
" on paper , we have no chance against germany and argentina , " said lemerre .
" but you never know . " possible lineup : tunisia - boumnijel - trabelsi , jaidi , abdi , clayton - ghodhbane , nafti , ben saada , mnari - santos , jaziri argentina - leo franco - coloccini , milito , heinze - j. zanetti , cambiasso , bernardi , sorin - riquelme - tevez , saviola germany - australia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kevin kuranyi will have to show he 's up to shouldering the goal-scoring burden germany comes into the tournament with a number of questions : can the strikers score goals ?
will the young defense stand up against major international competition ?
as a matter of fact , will the rest of the team stand up to major international competition ?
because it is hosting the world cup next year , germany has been spared the intensity and pressure of qualification .
as a result , coach jürgen klinsmann has been allowed to juggle around all sorts of lineup changes in the team 's friendly matches .
after this tournament , that should end .
tonight 's match against australia will be a chance for the strikers , most likely kevin kuranyi and gerald asamoah , to show their mettle in klinsmann 's offense-oriented playing style .
the german defense , who all hover around the age of 22 , will also have to prove itself - klinsmann ended practice this week with extra work for the defenders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : australia has a chance to surprise others at the tournament , but only a small one .
the definite underdog in this match-up , australia , is nevertheless a team with big dreams .
their past confed cup performances give them good reason to hope .
the team finished second in riyadh in 1997 , playing their way into the final before getting walloped by brazil .
in 2001 , in south korea and japan , the team beat brazil 1-0 to win third place and get their revenge .
coach frank farina remains confident : " we believe in ourselves , " he told reporters the other day .
his side is arguably one of the better ones in recent years , even without liverpool striker harry kewell , who is injured .
midfielders tim cahill , brett merton and striker mark viduka all play in the english premiership .
cahill will be responsible for directing the " socceroos " attack , and will look to take advantage of germany 's maligned and relatively slow defense .
the everton midfielder also remains a goal-scoring threat , notching 12 for his club as it marched to a champion 's league qualifying spot and seven for his country in as many appearances .
captian craig moore will anchor the defense . possible lineup : germany - kahn - b. schneider , a. friedrich , mertesacker , hitzlsperger - frings - deisler , schweinsteiger - ballack - kuranyi , podolski australia - schwarzer - neill , popovic , moore , muscat - milicevic - chipperfield , skoko , emerton - cahill - viduka dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the mini-world cup kicks off hundreds of thousands of fans will follow the fortunes of eight teams at five stadiums across germany over the next two weeks .

he said such a step could only be taken by way of a referendum . the appeal has little chance of success , however , as gauweiler already failed to convince judges with an earlier appeal in april . a further setback bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : has the eu reached a dead end ?

coach jose pekerman still has javier saviola , juan roman riquelme , javier zanetti , and defender gabriel heinze to pick from , all of whom will figure prominently in the gauchos ' attacking style .

lemerre has the tunisians playing tight and disciplined in the back , waiting for the chance to counter .
when they do , it 's usually over the wings - a mirror image of argentina 's style - and to francileude dos santos silva .
the native brazilian , who took tunisian citizenship just before the africa cup last year , became the tournament 's shooting star .

as a matter of fact , will the rest of the team stand up to major international competition ?
because it is hosting the world cup next year , germany has been spared the intensity and pressure of qualification .
as a result , coach jürgen klinsmann has been allowed to juggle around all sorts of lineup changes in the team 's friendly matches .
after this tournament , that should end .
tonight 's match against australia will be a chance for the strikers , most likely kevin kuranyi and gerald asamoah , to show their mettle in klinsmann 's offense-oriented playing style .
the german defense , who all hover around the age of 22 , will also have to prove itself - klinsmann ended practice this week with extra work for the defenders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : australia has a chance to surprise others at the tournament , but only a small one .
the definite underdog in this match-up , australia , is nevertheless a team with big dreams .

the team finished second in riyadh in 1997 , playing their way into the final before getting walloped by brazil .
in 2001 , in south korea and japan , the team beat brazil 1-0 to win third place and get their revenge .
coach frank farina remains confident : " we believe in ourselves , " he told reporters the other day .
his side is arguably one of the better ones in recent years , even without liverpool striker harry kewell , who is injured .
midfielders tim cahill , brett merton and striker mark viduka all play in the english premiership .
cahill will be responsible for directing the " socceroos " attack , and will look to take advantage of germany 's maligned and relatively slow defense .
the everton midfielder also remains a goal-scoring threat , notching 12 for his club as it marched to a champion 's league qualifying spot and seven for his country in as many appearances .

everyone was pleased with bringing home the three points but the porous defense is turning into a serious problem . for the 48,000 fans at the sold out waldstadion in frankfurt , germany 's opening match victory against australia was largely entertaining , if not at times nerve-wracking .
a soccer coach would have pulled out his or her hair , wondering how a team can suffer such lapses of concentration . " winning the opening match and the three points are very important , " said germany coach jürgen klinsmann , " but we also know some things did n't work optimally . " namely , giving up two first-half equalizers to the socceroos and then also a goal in stoppage time , but fortunately at that point , klinsmann 's squad had a two-goal advantage . six minutes of excitement bildunterschrift : australia 's josip skoko -lrb- yellow -rrb- squeezes the ball under germany 's jumping wall the first 15 minutes of the match were uneventful with both sides walking on pins and needles , playing stiffly .
kevin kuranyi 's goal in the 17th minute started what would be a toe-to-toe punchout in the following six minutes . before the fans could sit back down after celebrating the newly-acquired striker by schalke , germany 's central defender robert huth mugged john aloisi unnecessarily outside the german penalty box .
josip skoko took the free-kick and instead of lifting the ball , he kept it on the ground .
that was unfortunate because the wall jumped and watched the leather roll under their feet .
after 19 minutes , the score stood 1-1 . germany roared right back , with per mertesacker the benefactor of some sloppy defending by the australian defense and scored in the 23rd minute .
it was his first goal with the national squad , leaving many of the fans rubbing their eyes as their squad decided that attacking soccer , hardly what germany has been known for the past decade and a half , would bring success . since taking over last july , jürgen klinsmann promised more offense from the german team and he has held true to his promise .
at a cost , namely a porous defense . amateurish defense bildunterschrift : germany 's michael ballack -lrb- right -rrb- converts a penalty kick to put his side ahead 3-2 eight minutes after resecuring the lead , some very sharp passing and flat-footed defending allowed australia to get a second equalizer .
this time john aloisi beat his defender easily to streak into the penalty box and beat kahn .
the remainder of the second half , germany played insecurely and receiving a few catcalls when the referee carlos amarilla blew his whistle to end the first half . coming out of the locker room , germany were rejuvenated and put australia 's back against the wall .
it paid off in the 60th minute when arne friedrich , one of germany 's best players in the match , drew a penalty .
team captain michael ballack stepped and calmly sunk the spot kick and germany led 3-2 . the goal broke the australian resistance as the teams who both had expended much energy in the first hour , slowed the pace down .
the game started getting sloppy as passes frequently landed on an opponent 's foot or out of bounds . podolski secures victory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john aloisi scores australia 's second equalizer , getting past defender robert huth to do so lukas podolski was less affected by the fast pace .
in the 88th minute , he scored what would turn out to be the gamewinning goal after a strong run by ballack .
the two-goal lead was a relief to the sell-out crowd who could finally start singing after a night filled more with wonderment as the mostly unknown socceroos put world soccer power germany through the paces .
but it was almost not enough . in stoppage time , the german backline fell asleep as it did against russia one week ago .
aloisi again could break free and scored as the defenders wondered how he got behind them . the fans then had to wait only another 30 seconds before amarilla blew the final whistle and they could breathe a collective sigh of relief . klinsmann has promised excitement and that is what they got . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de argentina dominates tunisia in opener argentina played a superior game against tunisia , winning 2-1 with the help of a penalty kick and a nicely-played second goal .

everyone was pleased with bringing home the three points but the porous defense is turning into a serious problem . for the 48,000 fans at the sold out waldstadion in frankfurt , germany 's opening match victory against australia was largely entertaining , if not at times nerve-wracking .
a soccer coach would have pulled out his or her hair , wondering how a team can suffer such lapses of concentration . " winning the opening match and the three points are very important , " said germany coach jürgen klinsmann , " but we also know some things did n't work optimally . " namely , giving up two first-half equalizers to the socceroos and then also a goal in stoppage time , but fortunately at that point , klinsmann 's squad had a two-goal advantage . six minutes of excitement bildunterschrift : australia 's josip skoko -lrb- yellow -rrb- squeezes the ball under germany 's jumping wall the first 15 minutes of the match were uneventful with both sides walking on pins and needles , playing stiffly .
kevin kuranyi 's goal in the 17th minute started what would be a toe-to-toe punchout in the following six minutes . before the fans could sit back down after celebrating the newly-acquired striker by schalke , germany 's central defender robert huth mugged john aloisi unnecessarily outside the german penalty box .
josip skoko took the free-kick and instead of lifting the ball , he kept it on the ground .
that was unfortunate because the wall jumped and watched the leather roll under their feet .
after 19 minutes , the score stood 1-1 . germany roared right back , with per mertesacker the benefactor of some sloppy defending by the australian defense and scored in the 23rd minute .
it was his first goal with the national squad , leaving many of the fans rubbing their eyes as their squad decided that attacking soccer , hardly what germany has been known for the past decade and a half , would bring success . since taking over last july , jürgen klinsmann promised more offense from the german team and he has held true to his promise .
at a cost , namely a porous defense . amateurish defense bildunterschrift : germany 's michael ballack -lrb- right -rrb- converts a penalty kick to put his side ahead 3-2 eight minutes after resecuring the lead , some very sharp passing and flat-footed defending allowed australia to get a second equalizer .
this time john aloisi beat his defender easily to streak into the penalty box and beat kahn .
the remainder of the second half , germany played insecurely and receiving a few catcalls when the referee carlos amarilla blew his whistle to end the first half . coming out of the locker room , germany were rejuvenated and put australia 's back against the wall .
it paid off in the 60th minute when arne friedrich , one of germany 's best players in the match , drew a penalty .
team captain michael ballack stepped and calmly sunk the spot kick and germany led 3-2 . the goal broke the australian resistance as the teams who both had expended much energy in the first hour , slowed the pace down .
the game started getting sloppy as passes frequently landed on an opponent 's foot or out of bounds . podolski secures victory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john aloisi scores australia 's second equalizer , getting past defender robert huth to do so lukas podolski was less affected by the fast pace .

more than half of the 13,000 people who participated in an online survey for celebrity magazine bunte on tuesday welcomed the court decision.only 27 percent were opposed , while 21 percent were undecided . jackson 's europe manager ralf sesselberg said that the jackson family was planning a " thank-you " party for jacko 's loyal fans in germany .
" some family members could come for it , maybe his father , " said sesselberg in lower saxony .
but he ruled out the possibility of the so-called " king of pop " personally making an appearance . bildunterschrift : michael jackson fans display hearts and signed messages in support of jackson outside his neverland ranch in california . meanwhile , jackson 's lawyers have come in for praise for their expert handling of the controversial long-drawn out trial that attracted frenzied media attention . german legal expert dietmar herz said that jackson 's lawyers had been " brilliant . "
in an interview with " spiegel online " news site , herz said the trial had been just and fair . " naturally jackson is an overwhelmingly prominent defendant who sparked worldwide support as well as criticism and stirred a media storm , " herz said .
" but his stardom did not bring him any recognizable advantages .
his only plus point was that he could hire one of the best lawyers in the country . " " he 's just a wreck " newspapers across the continent , however , were n't so forgiving . spanish daily el mundo wrote that michael jackson 's reputation had taken a serious battering .
" the singer was acquitted but only because of lack of evidence .
jackson did n't contribute to the defense at all , " the paper said .
it added that the trial had illustrated the physical and psychological decay of the star .
" his records do n't sell and he does n't even attract fans the way he used to .
he 's like a broken toy .
the former child prodigy stood in the spotlight almost all his life .
but the singer could n't come to terms with his fame and getting older . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael jackson italian newspaper il messaggero was equally scathing .
" there 's no doubt that the peter pan of rock would still fill entire stadiums today , " it wrote .
" but there 's also a concrete risk that he could lose face doing that -lrb- and that not only as a consequence of too many plastic surgeries -rrb- , " the paper said .
" the jackson of today is not in the slightest the jackson from ' thriller ' and ' bad ' . " dutch daily de volkskrant said the trial had visibly aged and weakened jackson and that he left the california courtroom a broken man who only invoked pity .
" a people-shy megastar whose career is practically over and who 's financially dead , who may not have indulged in any proven buggery but who is obviously caught in the grip of an unmistakable and sick preference for the company of children , " is how the paper described him .
" the king of pop is finally rid of his throne . " germany 's munich-based münchner merkur lashed out at the trial , saying the evidence was too thin , the witness testimonies too contradictory and the suspicion too deep that the relatives of the apparent victim were mainly driven by financial motives .
" the former king of pop may not be perfectly rehabilitated , but he is rightly a free man , " the paper opined .
" however , the talent of the century with a childlike psyche will have to live with the stigma of a pedophile , " it wrote .
" a comeback to the pinnacle of pop will , however , remain off-limits - despite all the hysterical swearing of loyalty from his fans .

but according to a recent study concerning the service sector , it 's still something of a novelty in germany , though that 's rapidly changing . in the early 1900s , henry ford revolutionized manufacturing when he introduced the assembly line to build cars .
the 1980s saw the next revolution : subcontractors took over part of the manufacturing process .
outsourcing has now taken hold of the service sector , where it 's called " offshoring . "
deutsche bank and the it organization bitkom presented a study on the effects of this change for the german workforce on tuesday in berlin that suggests that german it students may want to shift their emphasis . germany 's offshoring sales volume currently amounts to about 600 million euros -lrb- $ 723 million -rrb- .
an increase of more than 20 percent is expected over the next five years , and it 's a development that ca n't be halted , according to bitkom vice president jörg menno harms . " we can decide whether we want to react to globalization passively - as victims - or actively by having a say in the future division of labor in the world , " harms said .
" offshoring should n't be a taboo topic .
we 've got to acknowledge that companies use offshoring to keep up and to improve their international competitiveness . " due to the change , young computer scientists with fresh degrees in hand are likely to discover they can only get work in the sector as highly specialized experts with experience in project management or as consultants and customer advisors .
mere programmers are simply not needed in germany , since their work is now done in india , ireland and israel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relocating jobs abroad continues to be at the heart of heated discussions in germany .
the fact that only 570 of the 4,000 companies contacted for the study participated illustrates how touchy it is .
despite promises of anonymity , many companies were concerned about their image .
but , the study actually showed that offshoring does n't necessarily have a negative effect on the jobs that remain in germany .
on the contrary , the savings allow the companies to grow and to hire more employees , harms said .
not always feasible though india is still the main destination for offshoring projects - it has 90 percent of the western european market - contractors from eastern europe are gaining ground , the study showed . " we do feel a cultural proximity to eastern european countries , " one of the study 's authors , jürgen schaaf , said .
" the great advantage the us and britain have in india is a common language .
that 's an advantage germans do n't have in india .
but in many eastern european countries , german is spoken well enough to communicate on a working level . " in its own attempts to send jobs offshore , deutsche bank discovered firsthand the importance of language for the service sector .
the bank tried to establish a call-center abroad , but ended up leaving again because customers were n't satisfied . bildunterschrift : deutsche bank chief economist norbert walter " you learn that many languages are spoken all over the world , but often in such a manner that only locals can understand them , not our customers , " said deutsche bank chief economist norbert walter -lrb- photo -rrb- . now , one of the bank 's two global call-centers is located in berlin .
the way of the future ? but it 's not only customer services , bookkeeping and personnel that are prey to offshoring .
about 40 percent of the firms questioned in the study said they 'd partly offshored research and development as well .
but in this case , cost efficiency was n't the only reason .
there just are n't enough highly specialized experts in germany and that 's what the country needs , walter said . in view of all the schools that - due to germany 's low birth rate - are expected to stand empty in the future , the country could start making a name for itself as a global contractor of education , " walter suggested .
germany could make a name for itself for " inshoring " instead of offshoring . sabine kinkartz -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de giving globalization a coy voice what would happen if india 's formidable army of call center operators dropped their professional tone and got personal on the phone ?

more than half of the 13,000 people who participated in an online survey for celebrity magazine bunte on tuesday welcomed the court decision.only 27 percent were opposed , while 21 percent were undecided . jackson 's europe manager ralf sesselberg said that the jackson family was planning a " thank-you " party for jacko 's loyal fans in germany .
" some family members could come for it , maybe his father , " said sesselberg in lower saxony .
but he ruled out the possibility of the so-called " king of pop " personally making an appearance . bildunterschrift : michael jackson fans display hearts and signed messages in support of jackson outside his neverland ranch in california . meanwhile , jackson 's lawyers have come in for praise for their expert handling of the controversial long-drawn out trial that attracted frenzied media attention . german legal expert dietmar herz said that jackson 's lawyers had been " brilliant . "
in an interview with " spiegel online " news site , herz said the trial had been just and fair . " naturally jackson is an overwhelmingly prominent defendant who sparked worldwide support as well as criticism and stirred a media storm , " herz said .
" but his stardom did not bring him any recognizable advantages .
his only plus point was that he could hire one of the best lawyers in the country . " " he 's just a wreck " newspapers across the continent , however , were n't so forgiving . spanish daily el mundo wrote that michael jackson 's reputation had taken a serious battering .
" the singer was acquitted but only because of lack of evidence .
jackson did n't contribute to the defense at all , " the paper said .
it added that the trial had illustrated the physical and psychological decay of the star .
" his records do n't sell and he does n't even attract fans the way he used to .
he 's like a broken toy .
the former child prodigy stood in the spotlight almost all his life .
but the singer could n't come to terms with his fame and getting older . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael jackson italian newspaper il messaggero was equally scathing .
" there 's no doubt that the peter pan of rock would still fill entire stadiums today , " it wrote .
" but there 's also a concrete risk that he could lose face doing that -lrb- and that not only as a consequence of too many plastic surgeries -rrb- , " the paper said .
" the jackson of today is not in the slightest the jackson from ' thriller ' and ' bad ' . " dutch daily de volkskrant said the trial had visibly aged and weakened jackson and that he left the california courtroom a broken man who only invoked pity .
" a people-shy megastar whose career is practically over and who 's financially dead , who may not have indulged in any proven buggery but who is obviously caught in the grip of an unmistakable and sick preference for the company of children , " is how the paper described him .
" the king of pop is finally rid of his throne . " germany 's munich-based münchner merkur lashed out at the trial , saying the evidence was too thin , the witness testimonies too contradictory and the suspicion too deep that the relatives of the apparent victim were mainly driven by financial motives .
" the former king of pop may not be perfectly rehabilitated , but he is rightly a free man , " the paper opined .
" however , the talent of the century with a childlike psyche will have to live with the stigma of a pedophile , " it wrote .
" a comeback to the pinnacle of pop will , however , remain off-limits - despite all the hysterical swearing of loyalty from his fans . " germany 's mass-selling tabloid newspaper bild titled " but what has the trial done to the king of pop ? - he 's just a wreck .

the 1980s saw the next revolution : subcontractors took over part of the manufacturing process .
outsourcing has now taken hold of the service sector , where it 's called " offshoring . "
deutsche bank and the it organization bitkom presented a study on the effects of this change for the german workforce on tuesday in berlin that suggests that german it students may want to shift their emphasis . germany 's offshoring sales volume currently amounts to about 600 million euros -lrb- $ 723 million -rrb- .
an increase of more than 20 percent is expected over the next five years , and it 's a development that ca n't be halted , according to bitkom vice president jörg menno harms .

coach jose pekerman 's side , missing stars like hernan crespo and juan sebastian veron , nevertheless controlled play virtually from the start .
tunisia was left rueing an early missed penalty shot that might have changed the flow of the match .
and referee roberto rosetti will probably want to review the game tape to take a second look at some of his calls .
tunisia started quick in the first half , as argentina found itself confounded by the coach roger lemerre 's disciplined backfield . still , a couple of close calls came right at the beginning , when saviola failed to get past goalie khaled fadhel in the 14th minute , and galletti 's header went above the crossbar a minute later . penalty shot on counter tunisia rarely ventured into the argentine half of the field after an initial storm of action .
when they did , it was usually on dangerous counters .

coach jose pekerman 's side , missing stars like hernan crespo and juan sebastian veron , nevertheless controlled play virtually from the start .
tunisia was left rueing an early missed penalty shot that might have changed the flow of the match .
and referee roberto rosetti will probably want to review the game tape to take a second look at some of his calls .
tunisia started quick in the first half , as argentina found itself confounded by the coach roger lemerre 's disciplined backfield . still , a couple of close calls came right at the beginning , when saviola failed to get past goalie khaled fadhel in the 14th minute , and galletti 's header went above the crossbar a minute later . penalty shot on counter tunisia rarely ventured into the argentine half of the field after an initial storm of action .
when they did , it was usually on dangerous counters .
shortly after galletti 's chance , tunisia replied .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gonazalo rodriguez against tunisia 's chadli .
the teams were evenly matched only at the very beginning of the match . sprung forward on the left side of the field , haykel guemamdia ran hard after a ball , and goalie german lux cut him down on the bottom side of the penalty box close to the goal .
referee rosetti did n't hesitate in awarding a penalty shot .
but imed mhadhebi sent his shot wide and to the left , squandering an opportunity that would have been so valuable later . riquelme gives gauchos the lead argentina started taking control after the 20th minute . playmaker juan riquelme distributed some nice passes around the top of the penalty area .
in the 32nd minute , rosetti pointed to the spot after a dubious fall by argentine defender maximiliano rodriguez .
replays showed the call was anything but 100 percent , but riquelme calmly slotted in the penalty to give argentina the lead . the gauchos played patient at the second half , giving tunisia the opportunity to come into their side of the field .
but gabriel heinze , fabricio coloccini and co. kept the door shut tight .
in the 57th minute , luciano galletti was sprung down the right side .
left unmarked until the last moment , he had time to pick out a charging saviola who pocketed the ball in the left side of the net for a 2-0 lead . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : good reason to be happy tunisia claws back shaky argentine keeper german lux then almost let tunisia back into the game when he weakly cleared a ball directly to a charging slim benachour .
but the tunisian midfielder 's shot at the 67th minute went just right of the goal . but his side would soon get their chance .
guemamdia ended up one on one with lux again , and fell as the keeper dove for his feet .
replays showed the tunisian striker took off nice and early , completely missing lux 's outstretched fingertips .
but rosetti pointed to the spot .
guemamdia took the penalty himself this time , slotting it into the corner and making it interesting again in the 72nd minute . the two sides traded a couple of opportunities in the closing phase of the match , but both keepers showed they were on point .
tunisia showed it did n't have a solution for the solid argentine defense in font of lux , and bowed to a superior opponent . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the mini-world cup kicks off hundreds of thousands of fans will follow the fortunes of eight teams at five stadiums across germany over the next two weeks .

everyone was pleased with bringing home the three points but the porous defense is turning into a serious problem . for the 48,000 fans at the sold out waldstadion in frankfurt , germany 's opening match victory against australia was largely entertaining , if not at times nerve-wracking .
a soccer coach would have pulled out his or her hair , wondering how a team can suffer such lapses of concentration . " winning the opening match and the three points are very important , " said germany coach jürgen klinsmann , " but we also know some things did n't work optimally . " namely , giving up two first-half equalizers to the socceroos and then also a goal in stoppage time , but fortunately at that point , klinsmann 's squad had a two-goal advantage . six minutes of excitement bildunterschrift : australia 's josip skoko -lrb- yellow -rrb- squeezes the ball under germany 's jumping wall the first 15 minutes of the match were uneventful with both sides walking on pins and needles , playing stiffly .
kevin kuranyi 's goal in the 17th minute started what would be a toe-to-toe punchout in the following six minutes . before the fans could sit back down after celebrating the newly-acquired striker by schalke , germany 's central defender robert huth mugged john aloisi unnecessarily outside the german penalty box .
josip skoko took the free-kick and instead of lifting the ball , he kept it on the ground .
that was unfortunate because the wall jumped and watched the leather roll under their feet .
after 19 minutes , the score stood 1-1 . germany roared right back , with per mertesacker the benefactor of some sloppy defending by the australian defense and scored in the 23rd minute .
it was his first goal with the national squad , leaving many of the fans rubbing their eyes as their squad decided that attacking soccer , hardly what germany has been known for the past decade and a half , would bring success . since taking over last july , jürgen klinsmann promised more offense from the german team and he has held true to his promise .
at a cost , namely a porous defense . amateurish defense bildunterschrift : germany 's michael ballack -lrb- right -rrb- converts a penalty kick to put his side ahead 3-2 eight minutes after resecuring the lead , some very sharp passing and flat-footed defending allowed australia to get a second equalizer .
this time john aloisi beat his defender easily to streak into the penalty box and beat kahn .
the remainder of the second half , germany played insecurely and receiving a few catcalls when the referee carlos amarilla blew his whistle to end the first half . coming out of the locker room , germany were rejuvenated and put australia 's back against the wall .
it paid off in the 60th minute when arne friedrich , one of germany 's best players in the match , drew a penalty .
team captain michael ballack stepped and calmly sunk the spot kick and germany led 3-2 . the goal broke the australian resistance as the teams who both had expended much energy in the first hour , slowed the pace down .
the game started getting sloppy as passes frequently landed on an opponent 's foot or out of bounds . podolski secures victory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john aloisi scores australia 's second equalizer , getting past defender robert huth to do so lukas podolski was less affected by the fast pace .
in the 88th minute , he scored what would turn out to be the gamewinning goal after a strong run by ballack .
the two-goal lead was a relief to the sell-out crowd who could finally start singing after a night filled more with wonderment as the mostly unknown socceroos put world soccer power germany through the paces .
but it was almost not enough . in stoppage time , the german backline fell asleep as it did against russia one week ago .
aloisi again could break free and scored as the defenders wondered how he got behind them . the fans then had to wait only another 30 seconds before amarilla blew the final whistle and they could breathe a collective sigh of relief . klinsmann has promised excitement and that is what they got . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de argentina dominates tunisia in opener argentina played a superior game against tunisia , winning 2-1 with the help of a penalty kick and a nicely-played second goal .

at a cost , namely a porous defense . amateurish defense bildunterschrift : germany 's michael ballack -lrb- right -rrb- converts a penalty kick to put his side ahead 3-2 eight minutes after resecuring the lead , some very sharp passing and flat-footed defending allowed australia to get a second equalizer .
this time john aloisi beat his defender easily to streak into the penalty box and beat kahn .
the remainder of the second half , germany played insecurely and receiving a few catcalls when the referee carlos amarilla blew his whistle to end the first half . coming out of the locker room , germany were rejuvenated and put australia 's back against the wall .
it paid off in the 60th minute when arne friedrich , one of germany 's best players in the match , drew a penalty .
team captain michael ballack stepped and calmly sunk the spot kick and germany led 3-2 . the goal broke the australian resistance as the teams who both had expended much energy in the first hour , slowed the pace down .
the game started getting sloppy as passes frequently landed on an opponent 's foot or out of bounds . podolski secures victory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john aloisi scores australia 's second equalizer , getting past defender robert huth to do so lukas podolski was less affected by the fast pace .
in the 88th minute , he scored what would turn out to be the gamewinning goal after a strong run by ballack .
the two-goal lead was a relief to the sell-out crowd who could finally start singing after a night filled more with wonderment as the mostly unknown socceroos put world soccer power germany through the paces .
but it was almost not enough . in stoppage time , the german backline fell asleep as it did against russia one week ago .
aloisi again could break free and scored as the defenders wondered how he got behind them . the fans then had to wait only another 30 seconds before amarilla blew the final whistle and they could breathe a collective sigh of relief . klinsmann has promised excitement and that is what they got . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de argentina dominates tunisia in opener argentina played a superior game against tunisia , winning 2-1 with the help of a penalty kick and a nicely-played second goal .

everyone was pleased with bringing home the three points but the porous defense is turning into a serious problem . for the 48,000 fans at the sold out waldstadion in frankfurt , germany 's opening match victory against australia was largely entertaining , if not at times nerve-wracking .
a soccer coach would have pulled out his or her hair , wondering how a team can suffer such lapses of concentration . " winning the opening match and the three points are very important , " said germany coach jürgen klinsmann , " but we also know some things did n't work optimally .

kevin kuranyi 's goal in the 17th minute started what would be a toe-to-toe punchout in the following six minutes . before the fans could sit back down after celebrating the newly-acquired striker by schalke , germany 's central defender robert huth mugged john aloisi unnecessarily outside the german penalty box .

both organizers and political officials are hoping not to disappoint . the two-week tournament will be televised in 170 countries across the world , and organizers are hoping the 600,000-ticket barrier is reached some time during the tournament .

german organizers hope they like what they see . so far , more than 500,000 tickets have been sold to the confederations cup tournament , which kicks off wednesday night when argentina plays tunisia in cologne . most of the fans will be locals , eager to get a measure of how organizers , as well as their team , are coming along ahead of the world cup next summer .
both organizers and political officials are hoping not to disappoint . the two-week tournament will be televised in 170 countries across the world , and organizers are hoping the 600,000-ticket barrier is reached some time during the tournament .
top matches like argentina and germany on june 21 and greece vs. brazil in leipzig on june 16 are already sold out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece , the surprise 2004 european champions , will be out to prove their victory was no fluke " the tournament is much more than a dress rehearsal for next year 's world cup , " fifa president joseph blatter told journalists .

" win the confed cup , win the world cup hosts germany will be joined by mexico , japan , brazil , argentina , greece , australia and tunisia , the top teams from the world 's soccer federations .
though several teams are n't arriving with their top players - who are either injured or , like brazilian star ronaldo , " taking a rest " - coaches say each team is taking the tournament seriously .
german coach jürgen klinsmann -lrb- photo -rrb- said the tournament will be crucial to seeing how his young squad measures up against top competition , one year before it plays the world cup at home .

one year before welcoming more than a million soccer fans into the country , germany 's police are eager to show the world that they can put on a peaceful tournament . the national information and cooperation center , a new body created expressly to coordinate policing activities for the 2006 tournament , will get a test run during the confederations cup .
the center will provide situation reports culled from information coming in from germany 's federal and 16 state police forces .
" we wo n't have the really big groups of -lrb- foreign -rrb- fans that we expect for the world cup , " said organizing committee vice-president wolfgang niersbach .
" but otherwise the measures in respect of security are the same … there will be an external security ring right around the stadium . " too many tournaments the heightened security measures are at the same time an acknowledgement of how far the confed cup has come since its humble beginnings as an invitation-only tournament of four teams in saudi arabia in 1992 .
but not all are happy about its progress . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ronaldo will be resting , not playing , this time around the inclusion of yet another tournament in a playing schedule that can be gruelling for top-flight players has reaped criticism from some team managers .
four mexican players , registered to play for the national team in the tournament , might not show up because of playing commitments to their clubs .
fifa has threatened to take action . " the players do n't have enough vacation , " said karl-heinz rummenigge , a german soccer legend and chairman of bundesliga champions fc bayern munich , adding that the tournament should be phased out . organizers , of course , do n't want to hear such talk now .
everyone from the local fan to the kaiser himself , world cup 2006 organizing committee chief franz beckenbauer , is singing the confed cup 's praises - and hoping the home country -lrb- and team -rrb- make a strong showing .

fears are growing that the european union summit on thursday and friday in brussels will not resolve the bloc 's most pressing problems .
dw-world explains the two issues the heads of government and state will tackle . the budget the summit will aim to agree on the eu 's budgetary framework for 2007-2012 .
the so-called net contributors - including germany , the netherlands and sweden - which put more into the eu coffers than they get back , want to cut their payments and limit spending to no more than one percent of the bloc 's gross national income . in the run-up to the summit , britain has come under fire from eu leaders headed by french president jacques chirac for refusing to freeze the rebate it negotiated in 1984 , when it was the bloc 's poorest member .
currently , the rebate totals an average of 4.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.55 billion -rrb- annually , and almost 10 percent of it is now paid by the poorer eu members from eastern europe who joined last year .
british prime minister tony blair has been adamant that his country will not give way on the rebate unless agriculture subsidies , from which britain hardly profits , are subjected to drastic cuts .
france 's chirac has categorically ruled out any reduction in the subsidies , which his country 's farmers rely on . the european constitution the eu leaders will also debate what to do about the bloc constitution in the wake of french and dutch rejection of the document in may 29 and june 1 referendums .
the constitution was meant to help combat the unwieldy decision-making process in the enlarged bloc of 25 countries and 455 million people .
it can not be ratified without approval from all eu states . the summit participants may decide the treaty ca n't be ratified at all or call member states to go ahead with votes to see what the final results bring .
several eu leaders have called for the ratification process to be extended beyond the two-year period originally foreseen ; it was initially expected to be implemented in november 2006 .
the leaders could also indefinitely delay ratification .
it 's unlikely they will decide to renegotiate the treaty , as its drafting was a long and difficult process the first time round .

france , germany , spain and the netherlands in particular want the rebate to be reconsidered , claiming that since it was introduced britain has grown much richer and the eu much bigger . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french dairy farmer jean-marc guigue repairs fencing on his dairy farm in mognard , france britain wants a reform of agricultural subsidies , agreed upon in 2002 , which consumes more than 40 percent of the eu 's budget and especially benefits french farmers .
blair wants chirac to give ground on the topic before it agrees to submit its annual rebate from european coffers for renegotiation - a demand that chirac is unlikely to give in to for fear it could anger powerful french farmers at a time when his personal popularity at home has slipped to dismal levels . chirac has called for a " gesture of solidarity " from britain to freeze or surrender its debate . on wednesday , chirac 's spokesman jerome bonnafont told reuters that france wanted " a fair and reasonable agreement " in which everyone made a contribution .
he made no reference to any french concessions .
bonnafont said chirac believed it was " important we do not add financial difficulties to the current political crisis in europe , " sparked by the rejection of the eu constitution in france and the netherlands . eu treaty ratification tricky issue wednesday 's meeting with chirac marked the end of a two-day whirlwind diplomatic tour for blair which also took him to russia and germany .
the tour was meant to focus principally on the summit of the group of eight industrialized countries in gleneagles next month .
britain is chairing the g8 this year and has made ending chronic poverty in africa one of its top concerns for meetings , along with real progress on confronting climate change . britain 's own decision to shelve plans for a planned referendum on the eu constitution next year in the wake of the two rejections in france and the netherlands has not gone down well with other eu members who still want to push ahead with the ratification process . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair , left , with schröder in germany , chancellor gerhard schröder has emerged as a vocal champion of the embattled eu constitution , urging the bloc to press on with the ratification process despite london 's decision to call off a planned referendum on it .
he has also taken the french side in the farm subsidies row , which blair has said must also be put on the table in brussels this week . " chancellor schröder is clearly on the same lines as the french president as far as agricultural subsidies are concerned , " government spokesman bela anda said monday ahead of the meeting between schröder and blair . a clear political direction britain 's position on both the constitution and the budget and blair 's row with chirac have left it looking increasingly isolated within the eu - a situation similar to the time when britain joined the us-led invasion in iraq in 2003 in the face of fierce franco-german opposition . experts are pessimistic about the prospect of a deal on either of the issues at a two-day eu summit that kicks off in brussels on thursday . luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , whose country currently holds the six-month rotating eu presidency , said he was fairly certain a deal would n't be brokered at the summit . " i am pretty sure we wo n't get the financial perspectives through at this summit , " juncker told a european parliament committee , hours before he was due to circulate a compromise proposal on the 2007-2013 budget to eu leaders .
" there is agreement , more or less , on the total amount of funding .
we differ as to payments to the budget , the structure of expenditure and who is a net contributor , " juncker said . tony blair , who has rejected a long-term freeze on britain 's widely-criticized eu budget rebate , has linked the budget dispute to the constitutional and political crisis gripping the eu and called for a pause for reflection . " if we want to reconnect people in europe with the idea of the european union , we 've got to set a clear political direction , " blair said after wednesday 's meeting with chirac . " we 've got to , even in the financing of europe , in fact , in some respects particularly in the financing of europe , reconnect the priorities that people have in europe with the way that we spend the money in europe , " blair said . " if we were to set out some of that forward path and direction , then i think it would be a lot easier to persuade people why it 's necessary also to have a new set of rules to govern europe .

everyone was pleased with bringing home the three points but the porous defense is turning into a serious problem . for the 48,000 fans at the sold out waldstadion in frankfurt , germany 's opening match victory against australia was largely entertaining , if not at times nerve-wracking .
a soccer coach would have pulled out his or her hair , wondering how a team can suffer such lapses of concentration . " winning the opening match and the three points are very important , " said germany coach jürgen klinsmann , " but we also know some things did n't work optimally . " namely , giving up two first-half equalizers to the socceroos and then also a goal in stoppage time , but fortunately at that point , klinsmann 's squad had a two-goal advantage . six minutes of excitement bildunterschrift : australia 's josip skoko -lrb- yellow -rrb- squeezes the ball under germany 's jumping wall the first 15 minutes of the match were uneventful with both sides walking on pins and needles , playing stiffly .

josip skoko took the free-kick and instead of lifting the ball , he kept it on the ground .
that was unfortunate because the wall jumped and watched the leather roll under their feet .

the remainder of the second half , germany played insecurely and receiving a few catcalls when the referee carlos amarilla blew his whistle to end the first half . coming out of the locker room , germany were rejuvenated and put australia 's back against the wall .
it paid off in the 60th minute when arne friedrich , one of germany 's best players in the match , drew a penalty .
team captain michael ballack stepped and calmly sunk the spot kick and germany led 3-2 . the goal broke the australian resistance as the teams who both had expended much energy in the first hour , slowed the pace down .

but it was almost not enough . in stoppage time , the german backline fell asleep as it did against russia one week ago .

everyone was pleased with bringing home the three points but the porous defense is turning into a serious problem . for the 48,000 fans at the sold out waldstadion in frankfurt , germany 's opening match victory against australia was largely entertaining , if not at times nerve-wracking .
a soccer coach would have pulled out his or her hair , wondering how a team can suffer such lapses of concentration . " winning the opening match and the three points are very important , " said germany coach jürgen klinsmann , " but we also know some things did n't work optimally . " namely , giving up two first-half equalizers to the socceroos and then also a goal in stoppage time , but fortunately at that point , klinsmann 's squad had a two-goal advantage . six minutes of excitement bildunterschrift : australia 's josip skoko -lrb- yellow -rrb- squeezes the ball under germany 's jumping wall the first 15 minutes of the match were uneventful with both sides walking on pins and needles , playing stiffly .
kevin kuranyi 's goal in the 17th minute started what would be a toe-to-toe punchout in the following six minutes . before the fans could sit back down after celebrating the newly-acquired striker by schalke , germany 's central defender robert huth mugged john aloisi unnecessarily outside the german penalty box .
josip skoko took the free-kick and instead of lifting the ball , he kept it on the ground .
that was unfortunate because the wall jumped and watched the leather roll under their feet .
after 19 minutes , the score stood 1-1 . germany roared right back , with per mertesacker the benefactor of some sloppy defending by the australian defense and scored in the 23rd minute .
it was his first goal with the national squad , leaving many of the fans rubbing their eyes as their squad decided that attacking soccer , hardly what germany has been known for the past decade and a half , would bring success . since taking over last july , jürgen klinsmann promised more offense from the german team and he has held true to his promise .
at a cost , namely a porous defense . amateurish defense bildunterschrift : germany 's michael ballack -lrb- right -rrb- converts a penalty kick to put his side ahead 3-2 eight minutes after resecuring the lead , some very sharp passing and flat-footed defending allowed australia to get a second equalizer .

he said such a step could only be taken by way of a referendum . the appeal has little chance of success , however , as gauweiler already failed to convince judges with an earlier appeal in april . a further setback bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : has the eu reached a dead end ?
but köhler 's decision to halt ratification represents a further setback for the document after french and dutch voters rejected the constitution in referendums on may 29 and june 1 respectively . britain subsequently said it would postpone a planned referendum until further notice , throwing into doubt the constitution 's chance of survival .
besides germany , 10 of the 25 member states have so far ratified the treaty . eu leaders are meeting in brussels on thursday to discuss the union 's future .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 15.06.2005 moving german service to foreign shores großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indians assume the lion 's share of german service jobs sent abroad outsourcing has become standard in manufacturing .
but according to a recent study concerning the service sector , it 's still something of a novelty in germany , though that 's rapidly changing . in the early 1900s , henry ford revolutionized manufacturing when he introduced the assembly line to build cars .
the 1980s saw the next revolution : subcontractors took over part of the manufacturing process .
outsourcing has now taken hold of the service sector , where it 's called " offshoring . "
deutsche bank and the it organization bitkom presented a study on the effects of this change for the german workforce on tuesday in berlin that suggests that german it students may want to shift their emphasis . germany 's offshoring sales volume currently amounts to about 600 million euros -lrb- $ 723 million -rrb- .
an increase of more than 20 percent is expected over the next five years , and it 's a development that ca n't be halted , according to bitkom vice president jörg menno harms . " we can decide whether we want to react to globalization passively - as victims - or actively by having a say in the future division of labor in the world , " harms said .
" offshoring should n't be a taboo topic .
we 've got to acknowledge that companies use offshoring to keep up and to improve their international competitiveness . " due to the change , young computer scientists with fresh degrees in hand are likely to discover they can only get work in the sector as highly specialized experts with experience in project management or as consultants and customer advisors .
mere programmers are simply not needed in germany , since their work is now done in india , ireland and israel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relocating jobs abroad continues to be at the heart of heated discussions in germany .
the fact that only 570 of the 4,000 companies contacted for the study participated illustrates how touchy it is .
despite promises of anonymity , many companies were concerned about their image .
but , the study actually showed that offshoring does n't necessarily have a negative effect on the jobs that remain in germany .
on the contrary , the savings allow the companies to grow and to hire more employees , harms said .
not always feasible though india is still the main destination for offshoring projects - it has 90 percent of the western european market - contractors from eastern europe are gaining ground , the study showed . " we do feel a cultural proximity to eastern european countries , " one of the study 's authors , jürgen schaaf , said .
" the great advantage the us and britain have in india is a common language .
that 's an advantage germans do n't have in india .
but in many eastern european countries , german is spoken well enough to communicate on a working level . " in its own attempts to send jobs offshore , deutsche bank discovered firsthand the importance of language for the service sector .
the bank tried to establish a call-center abroad , but ended up leaving again because customers were n't satisfied . bildunterschrift : deutsche bank chief economist norbert walter " you learn that many languages are spoken all over the world , but often in such a manner that only locals can understand them , not our customers , " said deutsche bank chief economist norbert walter -lrb- photo -rrb- . now , one of the bank 's two global call-centers is located in berlin .
the way of the future ? but it 's not only customer services , bookkeeping and personnel that are prey to offshoring .
about 40 percent of the firms questioned in the study said they 'd partly offshored research and development as well .
but in this case , cost efficiency was n't the only reason .
there just are n't enough highly specialized experts in germany and that 's what the country needs , walter said . in view of all the schools that - due to germany 's low birth rate - are expected to stand empty in the future , the country could start making a name for itself as a global contractor of education , " walter suggested .
germany could make a name for itself for " inshoring " instead of offshoring . sabine kinkartz -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de giving globalization a coy voice what would happen if india 's formidable army of call center operators dropped their professional tone and got personal on the phone ?

an increase of more than 20 percent is expected over the next five years , and it 's a development that ca n't be halted , according to bitkom vice president jörg menno harms . " we can decide whether we want to react to globalization passively - as victims - or actively by having a say in the future division of labor in the world , " harms said .
" offshoring should n't be a taboo topic .
we 've got to acknowledge that companies use offshoring to keep up and to improve their international competitiveness . " due to the change , young computer scientists with fresh degrees in hand are likely to discover they can only get work in the sector as highly specialized experts with experience in project management or as consultants and customer advisors .
mere programmers are simply not needed in germany , since their work is now done in india , ireland and israel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relocating jobs abroad continues to be at the heart of heated discussions in germany .
the fact that only 570 of the 4,000 companies contacted for the study participated illustrates how touchy it is .
despite promises of anonymity , many companies were concerned about their image .
but , the study actually showed that offshoring does n't necessarily have a negative effect on the jobs that remain in germany .
on the contrary , the savings allow the companies to grow and to hire more employees , harms said .
not always feasible though india is still the main destination for offshoring projects - it has 90 percent of the western european market - contractors from eastern europe are gaining ground , the study showed . " we do feel a cultural proximity to eastern european countries , " one of the study 's authors , jürgen schaaf , said .
" the great advantage the us and britain have in india is a common language .
that 's an advantage germans do n't have in india .

the bank tried to establish a call-center abroad , but ended up leaving again because customers were n't satisfied . bildunterschrift : deutsche bank chief economist norbert walter " you learn that many languages are spoken all over the world , but often in such a manner that only locals can understand them , not our customers , " said deutsche bank chief economist norbert walter -lrb- photo -rrb- . now , one of the bank 's two global call-centers is located in berlin .
the way of the future ? but it 's not only customer services , bookkeeping and personnel that are prey to offshoring .
about 40 percent of the firms questioned in the study said they 'd partly offshored research and development as well .
but in this case , cost efficiency was n't the only reason .
there just are n't enough highly specialized experts in germany and that 's what the country needs , walter said . in view of all the schools that - due to germany 's low birth rate - are expected to stand empty in the future , the country could start making a name for itself as a global contractor of education , " walter suggested .

coach jose pekerman 's side , missing stars like hernan crespo and juan sebastian veron , nevertheless controlled play virtually from the start .
tunisia was left rueing an early missed penalty shot that might have changed the flow of the match .
and referee roberto rosetti will probably want to review the game tape to take a second look at some of his calls .
tunisia started quick in the first half , as argentina found itself confounded by the coach roger lemerre 's disciplined backfield . still , a couple of close calls came right at the beginning , when saviola failed to get past goalie khaled fadhel in the 14th minute , and galletti 's header went above the crossbar a minute later . penalty shot on counter tunisia rarely ventured into the argentine half of the field after an initial storm of action .
when they did , it was usually on dangerous counters .

german organizers hope they like what they see . so far , more than 500,000 tickets have been sold to the confederations cup tournament , which kicks off wednesday night when argentina plays tunisia in cologne . most of the fans will be locals , eager to get a measure of how organizers , as well as their team , are coming along ahead of the world cup next summer .
both organizers and political officials are hoping not to disappoint . the two-week tournament will be televised in 170 countries across the world , and organizers are hoping the 600,000-ticket barrier is reached some time during the tournament .
top matches like argentina and germany on june 21 and greece vs. brazil in leipzig on june 16 are already sold out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece , the surprise 2004 european champions , will be out to prove their victory was no fluke " the tournament is much more than a dress rehearsal for next year 's world cup , " fifa president joseph blatter told journalists .
" it 's a prestigious international tournament in its own right : you just have to cast an eye over the starting field . " win the confed cup , win the world cup hosts germany will be joined by mexico , japan , brazil , argentina , greece , australia and tunisia , the top teams from the world 's soccer federations .
though several teams are n't arriving with their top players - who are either injured or , like brazilian star ronaldo , " taking a rest " - coaches say each team is taking the tournament seriously .
german coach jürgen klinsmann -lrb- photo -rrb- said the tournament will be crucial to seeing how his young squad measures up against top competition , one year before it plays the world cup at home .
soccer officials have promised each player a 60,000 euro -lrb- $ 72,000 -rrb- bonus if they hoist the trophy on june 29 .
the reason ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen klinsmann wants nothing short of victory " he who wants to win the world cup , should also win the confederations cup , " said german soccer association president theo zwanziger . security also getting a test run the same philosophy might apply to german security officials .
one year before welcoming more than a million soccer fans into the country , germany 's police are eager to show the world that they can put on a peaceful tournament . the national information and cooperation center , a new body created expressly to coordinate policing activities for the 2006 tournament , will get a test run during the confederations cup .
the center will provide situation reports culled from information coming in from germany 's federal and 16 state police forces .
" we wo n't have the really big groups of -lrb- foreign -rrb- fans that we expect for the world cup , " said organizing committee vice-president wolfgang niersbach .
" but otherwise the measures in respect of security are the same … there will be an external security ring right around the stadium . " too many tournaments the heightened security measures are at the same time an acknowledgement of how far the confed cup has come since its humble beginnings as an invitation-only tournament of four teams in saudi arabia in 1992 .
but not all are happy about its progress . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ronaldo will be resting , not playing , this time around the inclusion of yet another tournament in a playing schedule that can be gruelling for top-flight players has reaped criticism from some team managers .
four mexican players , registered to play for the national team in the tournament , might not show up because of playing commitments to their clubs .
fifa has threatened to take action . " the players do n't have enough vacation , " said karl-heinz rummenigge , a german soccer legend and chairman of bundesliga champions fc bayern munich , adding that the tournament should be phased out . organizers , of course , do n't want to hear such talk now .
everyone from the local fan to the kaiser himself , world cup 2006 organizing committee chief franz beckenbauer , is singing the confed cup 's praises - and hoping the home country -lrb- and team -rrb- make a strong showing .
" i 'm looking forward to the tournament , " said beckenbauer .

germany faces off against australia in the second match .
who has the best shot ? argentina - tunisia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : striker javier saviola , nicknamed " the rabbit " , is a massive goal-scoring threat though playing without stars hernan crespo , roberto ayala and juan sebastian veron , argentina is one of those countries that produces soccer talent like other countries produce co2 emissions .
coach jose pekerman still has javier saviola , juan roman riquelme , javier zanetti , and defender gabriel heinze to pick from , all of whom will figure prominently in the gauchos ' attacking style .
high off of a 3-1 spanking of brazil in the world cup qualifying rounds that secured them a spot in the 2006 world cup , argentina comes into the confederations cup tournament playing well enough to earn its " favorite " status . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : silva has been a serious threat ever since tunisia one the africa cup tunisia 's star player is its coach , the frenchman roger lemerre , who won the european championship with france in 2000 , and the confederations cup a year later .
lemerre has the tunisians playing tight and disciplined in the back , waiting for the chance to counter .
when they do , it 's usually over the wings - a mirror image of argentina 's style - and to francileude dos santos silva .
the native brazilian , who took tunisian citizenship just before the africa cup last year , became the tournament 's shooting star .
now , he 's ready to make problems for the big names in the confederations cup .

he said such a step could only be taken by way of a referendum . the appeal has little chance of success , however , as gauweiler already failed to convince judges with an earlier appeal in april . a further setback bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : has the eu reached a dead end ?

he said such a step could only be taken by way of a referendum . the appeal has little chance of success , however , as gauweiler already failed to convince judges with an earlier appeal in april . a further setback bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : has the eu reached a dead end ?
but köhler 's decision to halt ratification represents a further setback for the document after french and dutch voters rejected the constitution in referendums on may 29 and june 1 respectively . britain subsequently said it would postpone a planned referendum until further notice , throwing into doubt the constitution 's chance of survival .
besides germany , 10 of the 25 member states have so far ratified the treaty . eu leaders are meeting in brussels on thursday to discuss the union 's future .

coach jose pekerman 's side , missing stars like hernan crespo and juan sebastian veron , nevertheless controlled play virtually from the start .
tunisia was left rueing an early missed penalty shot that might have changed the flow of the match .
and referee roberto rosetti will probably want to review the game tape to take a second look at some of his calls .
tunisia started quick in the first half , as argentina found itself confounded by the coach roger lemerre 's disciplined backfield . still , a couple of close calls came right at the beginning , when saviola failed to get past goalie khaled fadhel in the 14th minute , and galletti 's header went above the crossbar a minute later . penalty shot on counter tunisia rarely ventured into the argentine half of the field after an initial storm of action .
when they did , it was usually on dangerous counters .
shortly after galletti 's chance , tunisia replied .

the teams were evenly matched only at the very beginning of the match . sprung forward on the left side of the field , haykel guemamdia ran hard after a ball , and goalie german lux cut him down on the bottom side of the penalty box close to the goal .
referee rosetti did n't hesitate in awarding a penalty shot .

in the 32nd minute , rosetti pointed to the spot after a dubious fall by argentine defender maximiliano rodriguez .
replays showed the call was anything but 100 percent , but riquelme calmly slotted in the penalty to give argentina the lead . the gauchos played patient at the second half , giving tunisia the opportunity to come into their side of the field .
but gabriel heinze , fabricio coloccini and co. kept the door shut tight .
in the 57th minute , luciano galletti was sprung down the right side .
left unmarked until the last moment , he had time to pick out a charging saviola who pocketed the ball in the left side of the net for a 2-0 lead . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : good reason to be happy tunisia claws back shaky argentine keeper german lux then almost let tunisia back into the game when he weakly cleared a ball directly to a charging slim benachour .
but the tunisian midfielder 's shot at the 67th minute went just right of the goal . but his side would soon get their chance .
guemamdia ended up one on one with lux again , and fell as the keeper dove for his feet .
replays showed the tunisian striker took off nice and early , completely missing lux 's outstretched fingertips .
but rosetti pointed to the spot .
guemamdia took the penalty himself this time , slotting it into the corner and making it interesting again in the 72nd minute . the two sides traded a couple of opportunities in the closing phase of the match , but both keepers showed they were on point .

everyone was pleased with bringing home the three points but the porous defense is turning into a serious problem . for the 48,000 fans at the sold out waldstadion in frankfurt , germany 's opening match victory against australia was largely entertaining , if not at times nerve-wracking .
a soccer coach would have pulled out his or her hair , wondering how a team can suffer such lapses of concentration . " winning the opening match and the three points are very important , " said germany coach jürgen klinsmann , " but we also know some things did n't work optimally . " namely , giving up two first-half equalizers to the socceroos and then also a goal in stoppage time , but fortunately at that point , klinsmann 's squad had a two-goal advantage . six minutes of excitement bildunterschrift : australia 's josip skoko -lrb- yellow -rrb- squeezes the ball under germany 's jumping wall the first 15 minutes of the match were uneventful with both sides walking on pins and needles , playing stiffly .
kevin kuranyi 's goal in the 17th minute started what would be a toe-to-toe punchout in the following six minutes . before the fans could sit back down after celebrating the newly-acquired striker by schalke , germany 's central defender robert huth mugged john aloisi unnecessarily outside the german penalty box .
josip skoko took the free-kick and instead of lifting the ball , he kept it on the ground .
that was unfortunate because the wall jumped and watched the leather roll under their feet .
after 19 minutes , the score stood 1-1 . germany roared right back , with per mertesacker the benefactor of some sloppy defending by the australian defense and scored in the 23rd minute .
it was his first goal with the national squad , leaving many of the fans rubbing their eyes as their squad decided that attacking soccer , hardly what germany has been known for the past decade and a half , would bring success . since taking over last july , jürgen klinsmann promised more offense from the german team and he has held true to his promise .
at a cost , namely a porous defense . amateurish defense bildunterschrift : germany 's michael ballack -lrb- right -rrb- converts a penalty kick to put his side ahead 3-2 eight minutes after resecuring the lead , some very sharp passing and flat-footed defending allowed australia to get a second equalizer .
this time john aloisi beat his defender easily to streak into the penalty box and beat kahn .
the remainder of the second half , germany played insecurely and receiving a few catcalls when the referee carlos amarilla blew his whistle to end the first half . coming out of the locker room , germany were rejuvenated and put australia 's back against the wall .
it paid off in the 60th minute when arne friedrich , one of germany 's best players in the match , drew a penalty .
team captain michael ballack stepped and calmly sunk the spot kick and germany led 3-2 . the goal broke the australian resistance as the teams who both had expended much energy in the first hour , slowed the pace down .
the game started getting sloppy as passes frequently landed on an opponent 's foot or out of bounds . podolski secures victory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john aloisi scores australia 's second equalizer , getting past defender robert huth to do so lukas podolski was less affected by the fast pace .
in the 88th minute , he scored what would turn out to be the gamewinning goal after a strong run by ballack .
the two-goal lead was a relief to the sell-out crowd who could finally start singing after a night filled more with wonderment as the mostly unknown socceroos put world soccer power germany through the paces .
but it was almost not enough . in stoppage time , the german backline fell asleep as it did against russia one week ago .
aloisi again could break free and scored as the defenders wondered how he got behind them . the fans then had to wait only another 30 seconds before amarilla blew the final whistle and they could breathe a collective sigh of relief . klinsmann has promised excitement and that is what they got . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de argentina dominates tunisia in opener argentina played a superior game against tunisia , winning 2-1 with the help of a penalty kick and a nicely-played second goal .

coach jose pekerman 's side , missing stars like hernan crespo and juan sebastian veron , nevertheless controlled play virtually from the start .
tunisia was left rueing an early missed penalty shot that might have changed the flow of the match .
and referee roberto rosetti will probably want to review the game tape to take a second look at some of his calls .
tunisia started quick in the first half , as argentina found itself confounded by the coach roger lemerre 's disciplined backfield . still , a couple of close calls came right at the beginning , when saviola failed to get past goalie khaled fadhel in the 14th minute , and galletti 's header went above the crossbar a minute later . penalty shot on counter tunisia rarely ventured into the argentine half of the field after an initial storm of action .
when they did , it was usually on dangerous counters .
shortly after galletti 's chance , tunisia replied .

the teams were evenly matched only at the very beginning of the match . sprung forward on the left side of the field , haykel guemamdia ran hard after a ball , and goalie german lux cut him down on the bottom side of the penalty box close to the goal .
referee rosetti did n't hesitate in awarding a penalty shot .
but imed mhadhebi sent his shot wide and to the left , squandering an opportunity that would have been so valuable later . riquelme gives gauchos the lead argentina started taking control after the 20th minute . playmaker juan riquelme distributed some nice passes around the top of the penalty area .
in the 32nd minute , rosetti pointed to the spot after a dubious fall by argentine defender maximiliano rodriguez .
replays showed the call was anything but 100 percent , but riquelme calmly slotted in the penalty to give argentina the lead . the gauchos played patient at the second half , giving tunisia the opportunity to come into their side of the field .
but gabriel heinze , fabricio coloccini and co. kept the door shut tight .
in the 57th minute , luciano galletti was sprung down the right side .
left unmarked until the last moment , he had time to pick out a charging saviola who pocketed the ball in the left side of the net for a 2-0 lead . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : good reason to be happy tunisia claws back shaky argentine keeper german lux then almost let tunisia back into the game when he weakly cleared a ball directly to a charging slim benachour .
but the tunisian midfielder 's shot at the 67th minute went just right of the goal . but his side would soon get their chance .
guemamdia ended up one on one with lux again , and fell as the keeper dove for his feet .
replays showed the tunisian striker took off nice and early , completely missing lux 's outstretched fingertips .
but rosetti pointed to the spot .
guemamdia took the penalty himself this time , slotting it into the corner and making it interesting again in the 72nd minute . the two sides traded a couple of opportunities in the closing phase of the match , but both keepers showed they were on point .
tunisia showed it did n't have a solution for the solid argentine defense in font of lux , and bowed to a superior opponent . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the mini-world cup kicks off hundreds of thousands of fans will follow the fortunes of eight teams at five stadiums across germany over the next two weeks .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 15.06.2005 moving german service to foreign shores großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indians assume the lion 's share of german service jobs sent abroad outsourcing has become standard in manufacturing .
but according to a recent study concerning the service sector , it 's still something of a novelty in germany , though that 's rapidly changing . in the early 1900s , henry ford revolutionized manufacturing when he introduced the assembly line to build cars .
the 1980s saw the next revolution : subcontractors took over part of the manufacturing process .
outsourcing has now taken hold of the service sector , where it 's called " offshoring . "
deutsche bank and the it organization bitkom presented a study on the effects of this change for the german workforce on tuesday in berlin that suggests that german it students may want to shift their emphasis . germany 's offshoring sales volume currently amounts to about 600 million euros -lrb- $ 723 million -rrb- .
an increase of more than 20 percent is expected over the next five years , and it 's a development that ca n't be halted , according to bitkom vice president jörg menno harms . " we can decide whether we want to react to globalization passively - as victims - or actively by having a say in the future division of labor in the world , " harms said .
" offshoring should n't be a taboo topic .
we 've got to acknowledge that companies use offshoring to keep up and to improve their international competitiveness . " due to the change , young computer scientists with fresh degrees in hand are likely to discover they can only get work in the sector as highly specialized experts with experience in project management or as consultants and customer advisors .
mere programmers are simply not needed in germany , since their work is now done in india , ireland and israel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relocating jobs abroad continues to be at the heart of heated discussions in germany .
the fact that only 570 of the 4,000 companies contacted for the study participated illustrates how touchy it is .
despite promises of anonymity , many companies were concerned about their image .
but , the study actually showed that offshoring does n't necessarily have a negative effect on the jobs that remain in germany .
on the contrary , the savings allow the companies to grow and to hire more employees , harms said .
not always feasible though india is still the main destination for offshoring projects - it has 90 percent of the western european market - contractors from eastern europe are gaining ground , the study showed . " we do feel a cultural proximity to eastern european countries , " one of the study 's authors , jürgen schaaf , said .
" the great advantage the us and britain have in india is a common language .
that 's an advantage germans do n't have in india .
but in many eastern european countries , german is spoken well enough to communicate on a working level . " in its own attempts to send jobs offshore , deutsche bank discovered firsthand the importance of language for the service sector .
the bank tried to establish a call-center abroad , but ended up leaving again because customers were n't satisfied . bildunterschrift : deutsche bank chief economist norbert walter " you learn that many languages are spoken all over the world , but often in such a manner that only locals can understand them , not our customers , " said deutsche bank chief economist norbert walter -lrb- photo -rrb- . now , one of the bank 's two global call-centers is located in berlin .
the way of the future ? but it 's not only customer services , bookkeeping and personnel that are prey to offshoring .
about 40 percent of the firms questioned in the study said they 'd partly offshored research and development as well .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 15.06.2005 moving german service to foreign shores großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indians assume the lion 's share of german service jobs sent abroad outsourcing has become standard in manufacturing .
but according to a recent study concerning the service sector , it 's still something of a novelty in germany , though that 's rapidly changing . in the early 1900s , henry ford revolutionized manufacturing when he introduced the assembly line to build cars .
the 1980s saw the next revolution : subcontractors took over part of the manufacturing process .
outsourcing has now taken hold of the service sector , where it 's called " offshoring . "
deutsche bank and the it organization bitkom presented a study on the effects of this change for the german workforce on tuesday in berlin that suggests that german it students may want to shift their emphasis . germany 's offshoring sales volume currently amounts to about 600 million euros -lrb- $ 723 million -rrb- .
an increase of more than 20 percent is expected over the next five years , and it 's a development that ca n't be halted , according to bitkom vice president jörg menno harms . " we can decide whether we want to react to globalization passively - as victims - or actively by having a say in the future division of labor in the world , " harms said .
" offshoring should n't be a taboo topic .
we 've got to acknowledge that companies use offshoring to keep up and to improve their international competitiveness . " due to the change , young computer scientists with fresh degrees in hand are likely to discover they can only get work in the sector as highly specialized experts with experience in project management or as consultants and customer advisors .
mere programmers are simply not needed in germany , since their work is now done in india , ireland and israel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relocating jobs abroad continues to be at the heart of heated discussions in germany .
the fact that only 570 of the 4,000 companies contacted for the study participated illustrates how touchy it is .
despite promises of anonymity , many companies were concerned about their image .
but , the study actually showed that offshoring does n't necessarily have a negative effect on the jobs that remain in germany .
on the contrary , the savings allow the companies to grow and to hire more employees , harms said .
not always feasible though india is still the main destination for offshoring projects - it has 90 percent of the western european market - contractors from eastern europe are gaining ground , the study showed . " we do feel a cultural proximity to eastern european countries , " one of the study 's authors , jürgen schaaf , said .
" the great advantage the us and britain have in india is a common language .
that 's an advantage germans do n't have in india .
but in many eastern european countries , german is spoken well enough to communicate on a working level . " in its own attempts to send jobs offshore , deutsche bank discovered firsthand the importance of language for the service sector .
the bank tried to establish a call-center abroad , but ended up leaving again because customers were n't satisfied . bildunterschrift : deutsche bank chief economist norbert walter " you learn that many languages are spoken all over the world , but often in such a manner that only locals can understand them , not our customers , " said deutsche bank chief economist norbert walter -lrb- photo -rrb- . now , one of the bank 's two global call-centers is located in berlin .
the way of the future ? but it 's not only customer services , bookkeeping and personnel that are prey to offshoring .
about 40 percent of the firms questioned in the study said they 'd partly offshored research and development as well .
but in this case , cost efficiency was n't the only reason .
there just are n't enough highly specialized experts in germany and that 's what the country needs , walter said . in view of all the schools that - due to germany 's low birth rate - are expected to stand empty in the future , the country could start making a name for itself as a global contractor of education , " walter suggested .

more than half of the 13,000 people who participated in an online survey for celebrity magazine bunte on tuesday welcomed the court decision.only 27 percent were opposed , while 21 percent were undecided . jackson 's europe manager ralf sesselberg said that the jackson family was planning a " thank-you " party for jacko 's loyal fans in germany .
" some family members could come for it , maybe his father , " said sesselberg in lower saxony .
but he ruled out the possibility of the so-called " king of pop " personally making an appearance . bildunterschrift : michael jackson fans display hearts and signed messages in support of jackson outside his neverland ranch in california . meanwhile , jackson 's lawyers have come in for praise for their expert handling of the controversial long-drawn out trial that attracted frenzied media attention . german legal expert dietmar herz said that jackson 's lawyers had been " brilliant . "
in an interview with " spiegel online " news site , herz said the trial had been just and fair . " naturally jackson is an overwhelmingly prominent defendant who sparked worldwide support as well as criticism and stirred a media storm , " herz said .
" but his stardom did not bring him any recognizable advantages .

" the singer was acquitted but only because of lack of evidence .

it added that the trial had illustrated the physical and psychological decay of the star .

" the jackson of today is not in the slightest the jackson from ' thriller ' and ' bad ' . " dutch daily de volkskrant said the trial had visibly aged and weakened jackson and that he left the california courtroom a broken man who only invoked pity .
" a people-shy megastar whose career is practically over and who 's financially dead , who may not have indulged in any proven buggery but who is obviously caught in the grip of an unmistakable and sick preference for the company of children , " is how the paper described him .
" the king of pop is finally rid of his throne .

11 , 2001 attacks .
a lawyer for abdelghani mzoudi , whose not-guilty verdict was upheld in a federal court last week , said he would run the risk of being prosecuted again if he told the court what he knew about the defendant , mounir el motassadeq .
both mzoudi and motassadeq , friends of three sept .
11 suicide hijackers who were based in the northern german port city of hamburg , faced separate trials here for complicity in the attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon which killed some 3,000 people .
motassadeq was convicted in february 2003 and sentenced to the maximum 15 years in prison .
but the following year a federal court ordered a retrial , which is now underway here .
mzoudi was acquitted of the same charges - membership in a terrorist organization and more than 3,000 counts of accessory to murder - in october 2004 .
a federal court last week rejected an appeal from federal prosecutors for a new trial , citing a lack of evidence against him .
the hamburg court had hoped to gain more information from mzoudi about motassadeq 's alleged role in the so-called hamburg cell led by the hijackers ' ringleader , mohammed atta .

everyone was pleased with bringing home the three points but the porous defense is turning into a serious problem . for the 48,000 fans at the sold out waldstadion in frankfurt , germany 's opening match victory against australia was largely entertaining , if not at times nerve-wracking .
a soccer coach would have pulled out his or her hair , wondering how a team can suffer such lapses of concentration . " winning the opening match and the three points are very important , " said germany coach jürgen klinsmann , " but we also know some things did n't work optimally . " namely , giving up two first-half equalizers to the socceroos and then also a goal in stoppage time , but fortunately at that point , klinsmann 's squad had a two-goal advantage . six minutes of excitement bildunterschrift : australia 's josip skoko -lrb- yellow -rrb- squeezes the ball under germany 's jumping wall the first 15 minutes of the match were uneventful with both sides walking on pins and needles , playing stiffly .
kevin kuranyi 's goal in the 17th minute started what would be a toe-to-toe punchout in the following six minutes . before the fans could sit back down after celebrating the newly-acquired striker by schalke , germany 's central defender robert huth mugged john aloisi unnecessarily outside the german penalty box .
josip skoko took the free-kick and instead of lifting the ball , he kept it on the ground .
that was unfortunate because the wall jumped and watched the leather roll under their feet .
after 19 minutes , the score stood 1-1 . germany roared right back , with per mertesacker the benefactor of some sloppy defending by the australian defense and scored in the 23rd minute .
it was his first goal with the national squad , leaving many of the fans rubbing their eyes as their squad decided that attacking soccer , hardly what germany has been known for the past decade and a half , would bring success . since taking over last july , jürgen klinsmann promised more offense from the german team and he has held true to his promise .
at a cost , namely a porous defense . amateurish defense bildunterschrift : germany 's michael ballack -lrb- right -rrb- converts a penalty kick to put his side ahead 3-2 eight minutes after resecuring the lead , some very sharp passing and flat-footed defending allowed australia to get a second equalizer .
this time john aloisi beat his defender easily to streak into the penalty box and beat kahn .
the remainder of the second half , germany played insecurely and receiving a few catcalls when the referee carlos amarilla blew his whistle to end the first half . coming out of the locker room , germany were rejuvenated and put australia 's back against the wall .
it paid off in the 60th minute when arne friedrich , one of germany 's best players in the match , drew a penalty .
team captain michael ballack stepped and calmly sunk the spot kick and germany led 3-2 . the goal broke the australian resistance as the teams who both had expended much energy in the first hour , slowed the pace down .
the game started getting sloppy as passes frequently landed on an opponent 's foot or out of bounds . podolski secures victory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john aloisi scores australia 's second equalizer , getting past defender robert huth to do so lukas podolski was less affected by the fast pace .
in the 88th minute , he scored what would turn out to be the gamewinning goal after a strong run by ballack .
the two-goal lead was a relief to the sell-out crowd who could finally start singing after a night filled more with wonderment as the mostly unknown socceroos put world soccer power germany through the paces .
but it was almost not enough . in stoppage time , the german backline fell asleep as it did against russia one week ago .
aloisi again could break free and scored as the defenders wondered how he got behind them . the fans then had to wait only another 30 seconds before amarilla blew the final whistle and they could breathe a collective sigh of relief . klinsmann has promised excitement and that is what they got . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de argentina dominates tunisia in opener argentina played a superior game against tunisia , winning 2-1 with the help of a penalty kick and a nicely-played second goal .

he said such a step could only be taken by way of a referendum . the appeal has little chance of success , however , as gauweiler already failed to convince judges with an earlier appeal in april . a further setback bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : has the eu reached a dead end ?
but köhler 's decision to halt ratification represents a further setback for the document after french and dutch voters rejected the constitution in referendums on may 29 and june 1 respectively . britain subsequently said it would postpone a planned referendum until further notice , throwing into doubt the constitution 's chance of survival .
besides germany , 10 of the 25 member states have so far ratified the treaty . eu leaders are meeting in brussels on thursday to discuss the union 's future .
apart from the constitution , the eu budget has also caused a rift between member states as britain is unwilling to give up a decade-old rebate and others , including france , refuse to renegotiate subsidies for their agricultural sectors . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de britain , france lock horns over budget not since britain 's joining of the us-led invasion of iraq has the country seemed so isolated in the eu as tony blair remains at loggerheads with france and germany over eu spending plans ahead of a crucial summit .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup 2006 -pipe- 15.06.2005 argentina dominates tunisia in opener großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juan riquelme started the scoring , and led his team to victory argentina played a superior game against tunisia , winning 2-1 with the help of a penalty kick and a nicely-played second goal . though the final score was a little closer than some had expected , argentina left no doubt who was the master on the field .
coach jose pekerman 's side , missing stars like hernan crespo and juan sebastian veron , nevertheless controlled play virtually from the start .
tunisia was left rueing an early missed penalty shot that might have changed the flow of the match .
and referee roberto rosetti will probably want to review the game tape to take a second look at some of his calls .
tunisia started quick in the first half , as argentina found itself confounded by the coach roger lemerre 's disciplined backfield . still , a couple of close calls came right at the beginning , when saviola failed to get past goalie khaled fadhel in the 14th minute , and galletti 's header went above the crossbar a minute later . penalty shot on counter tunisia rarely ventured into the argentine half of the field after an initial storm of action .
when they did , it was usually on dangerous counters .
shortly after galletti 's chance , tunisia replied .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gonazalo rodriguez against tunisia 's chadli .
the teams were evenly matched only at the very beginning of the match . sprung forward on the left side of the field , haykel guemamdia ran hard after a ball , and goalie german lux cut him down on the bottom side of the penalty box close to the goal .
referee rosetti did n't hesitate in awarding a penalty shot .
but imed mhadhebi sent his shot wide and to the left , squandering an opportunity that would have been so valuable later . riquelme gives gauchos the lead argentina started taking control after the 20th minute . playmaker juan riquelme distributed some nice passes around the top of the penalty area .
in the 32nd minute , rosetti pointed to the spot after a dubious fall by argentine defender maximiliano rodriguez .
replays showed the call was anything but 100 percent , but riquelme calmly slotted in the penalty to give argentina the lead . the gauchos played patient at the second half , giving tunisia the opportunity to come into their side of the field .
but gabriel heinze , fabricio coloccini and co. kept the door shut tight .
in the 57th minute , luciano galletti was sprung down the right side .
left unmarked until the last moment , he had time to pick out a charging saviola who pocketed the ball in the left side of the net for a 2-0 lead . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : good reason to be happy tunisia claws back shaky argentine keeper german lux then almost let tunisia back into the game when he weakly cleared a ball directly to a charging slim benachour .
but the tunisian midfielder 's shot at the 67th minute went just right of the goal . but his side would soon get their chance .
guemamdia ended up one on one with lux again , and fell as the keeper dove for his feet .
replays showed the tunisian striker took off nice and early , completely missing lux 's outstretched fingertips .
but rosetti pointed to the spot .
guemamdia took the penalty himself this time , slotting it into the corner and making it interesting again in the 72nd minute . the two sides traded a couple of opportunities in the closing phase of the match , but both keepers showed they were on point .
tunisia showed it did n't have a solution for the solid argentine defense in font of lux , and bowed to a superior opponent . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the mini-world cup kicks off hundreds of thousands of fans will follow the fortunes of eight teams at five stadiums across germany over the next two weeks .

fears are growing that the european union summit on thursday and friday in brussels will not resolve the bloc 's most pressing problems .
dw-world explains the two issues the heads of government and state will tackle . the budget the summit will aim to agree on the eu 's budgetary framework for 2007-2012 .
the so-called net contributors - including germany , the netherlands and sweden - which put more into the eu coffers than they get back , want to cut their payments and limit spending to no more than one percent of the bloc 's gross national income . in the run-up to the summit , britain has come under fire from eu leaders headed by french president jacques chirac for refusing to freeze the rebate it negotiated in 1984 , when it was the bloc 's poorest member .
currently , the rebate totals an average of 4.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.55 billion -rrb- annually , and almost 10 percent of it is now paid by the poorer eu members from eastern europe who joined last year .
british prime minister tony blair has been adamant that his country will not give way on the rebate unless agriculture subsidies , from which britain hardly profits , are subjected to drastic cuts .
france 's chirac has categorically ruled out any reduction in the subsidies , which his country 's farmers rely on . the european constitution the eu leaders will also debate what to do about the bloc constitution in the wake of french and dutch rejection of the document in may 29 and june 1 referendums .
the constitution was meant to help combat the unwieldy decision-making process in the enlarged bloc of 25 countries and 455 million people .
it can not be ratified without approval from all eu states . the summit participants may decide the treaty ca n't be ratified at all or call member states to go ahead with votes to see what the final results bring .
several eu leaders have called for the ratification process to be extended beyond the two-year period originally foreseen ; it was initially expected to be implemented in november 2006 .
the leaders could also indefinitely delay ratification .
it 's unlikely they will decide to renegotiate the treaty , as its drafting was a long and difficult process the first time round .

dw-world explains the two issues the heads of government and state will tackle . the budget the summit will aim to agree on the eu 's budgetary framework for 2007-2012 .

currently , the rebate totals an average of 4.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.55 billion -rrb- annually , and almost 10 percent of it is now paid by the poorer eu members from eastern europe who joined last year .
british prime minister tony blair has been adamant that his country will not give way on the rebate unless agriculture subsidies , from which britain hardly profits , are subjected to drastic cuts .
france 's chirac has categorically ruled out any reduction in the subsidies , which his country 's farmers rely on . the european constitution the eu leaders will also debate what to do about the bloc constitution in the wake of french and dutch rejection of the document in may 29 and june 1 referendums .
the constitution was meant to help combat the unwieldy decision-making process in the enlarged bloc of 25 countries and 455 million people .
it can not be ratified without approval from all eu states . the summit participants may decide the treaty ca n't be ratified at all or call member states to go ahead with votes to see what the final results bring .
several eu leaders have called for the ratification process to be extended beyond the two-year period originally foreseen ; it was initially expected to be implemented in november 2006 .

everyone was pleased with bringing home the three points but the porous defense is turning into a serious problem . for the 48,000 fans at the sold out waldstadion in frankfurt , germany 's opening match victory against australia was largely entertaining , if not at times nerve-wracking .
a soccer coach would have pulled out his or her hair , wondering how a team can suffer such lapses of concentration . " winning the opening match and the three points are very important , " said germany coach jürgen klinsmann , " but we also know some things did n't work optimally . " namely , giving up two first-half equalizers to the socceroos and then also a goal in stoppage time , but fortunately at that point , klinsmann 's squad had a two-goal advantage . six minutes of excitement bildunterschrift : australia 's josip skoko -lrb- yellow -rrb- squeezes the ball under germany 's jumping wall the first 15 minutes of the match were uneventful with both sides walking on pins and needles , playing stiffly .
kevin kuranyi 's goal in the 17th minute started what would be a toe-to-toe punchout in the following six minutes . before the fans could sit back down after celebrating the newly-acquired striker by schalke , germany 's central defender robert huth mugged john aloisi unnecessarily outside the german penalty box .
josip skoko took the free-kick and instead of lifting the ball , he kept it on the ground .
that was unfortunate because the wall jumped and watched the leather roll under their feet .
after 19 minutes , the score stood 1-1 . germany roared right back , with per mertesacker the benefactor of some sloppy defending by the australian defense and scored in the 23rd minute .
it was his first goal with the national squad , leaving many of the fans rubbing their eyes as their squad decided that attacking soccer , hardly what germany has been known for the past decade and a half , would bring success . since taking over last july , jürgen klinsmann promised more offense from the german team and he has held true to his promise .
at a cost , namely a porous defense . amateurish defense bildunterschrift : germany 's michael ballack -lrb- right -rrb- converts a penalty kick to put his side ahead 3-2 eight minutes after resecuring the lead , some very sharp passing and flat-footed defending allowed australia to get a second equalizer .
this time john aloisi beat his defender easily to streak into the penalty box and beat kahn .
the remainder of the second half , germany played insecurely and receiving a few catcalls when the referee carlos amarilla blew his whistle to end the first half . coming out of the locker room , germany were rejuvenated and put australia 's back against the wall .
it paid off in the 60th minute when arne friedrich , one of germany 's best players in the match , drew a penalty .
team captain michael ballack stepped and calmly sunk the spot kick and germany led 3-2 . the goal broke the australian resistance as the teams who both had expended much energy in the first hour , slowed the pace down .
the game started getting sloppy as passes frequently landed on an opponent 's foot or out of bounds . podolski secures victory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john aloisi scores australia 's second equalizer , getting past defender robert huth to do so lukas podolski was less affected by the fast pace .
in the 88th minute , he scored what would turn out to be the gamewinning goal after a strong run by ballack .
the two-goal lead was a relief to the sell-out crowd who could finally start singing after a night filled more with wonderment as the mostly unknown socceroos put world soccer power germany through the paces .
but it was almost not enough . in stoppage time , the german backline fell asleep as it did against russia one week ago .
aloisi again could break free and scored as the defenders wondered how he got behind them . the fans then had to wait only another 30 seconds before amarilla blew the final whistle and they could breathe a collective sigh of relief . klinsmann has promised excitement and that is what they got . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de argentina dominates tunisia in opener argentina played a superior game against tunisia , winning 2-1 with the help of a penalty kick and a nicely-played second goal .

everyone was pleased with bringing home the three points but the porous defense is turning into a serious problem . for the 48,000 fans at the sold out waldstadion in frankfurt , germany 's opening match victory against australia was largely entertaining , if not at times nerve-wracking .
a soccer coach would have pulled out his or her hair , wondering how a team can suffer such lapses of concentration . " winning the opening match and the three points are very important , " said germany coach jürgen klinsmann , " but we also know some things did n't work optimally . " namely , giving up two first-half equalizers to the socceroos and then also a goal in stoppage time , but fortunately at that point , klinsmann 's squad had a two-goal advantage . six minutes of excitement bildunterschrift : australia 's josip skoko -lrb- yellow -rrb- squeezes the ball under germany 's jumping wall the first 15 minutes of the match were uneventful with both sides walking on pins and needles , playing stiffly .
kevin kuranyi 's goal in the 17th minute started what would be a toe-to-toe punchout in the following six minutes . before the fans could sit back down after celebrating the newly-acquired striker by schalke , germany 's central defender robert huth mugged john aloisi unnecessarily outside the german penalty box .
josip skoko took the free-kick and instead of lifting the ball , he kept it on the ground .
that was unfortunate because the wall jumped and watched the leather roll under their feet .
after 19 minutes , the score stood 1-1 . germany roared right back , with per mertesacker the benefactor of some sloppy defending by the australian defense and scored in the 23rd minute .
it was his first goal with the national squad , leaving many of the fans rubbing their eyes as their squad decided that attacking soccer , hardly what germany has been known for the past decade and a half , would bring success . since taking over last july , jürgen klinsmann promised more offense from the german team and he has held true to his promise .
at a cost , namely a porous defense . amateurish defense bildunterschrift : germany 's michael ballack -lrb- right -rrb- converts a penalty kick to put his side ahead 3-2 eight minutes after resecuring the lead , some very sharp passing and flat-footed defending allowed australia to get a second equalizer .
this time john aloisi beat his defender easily to streak into the penalty box and beat kahn .
the remainder of the second half , germany played insecurely and receiving a few catcalls when the referee carlos amarilla blew his whistle to end the first half . coming out of the locker room , germany were rejuvenated and put australia 's back against the wall .
it paid off in the 60th minute when arne friedrich , one of germany 's best players in the match , drew a penalty .
team captain michael ballack stepped and calmly sunk the spot kick and germany led 3-2 . the goal broke the australian resistance as the teams who both had expended much energy in the first hour , slowed the pace down .
the game started getting sloppy as passes frequently landed on an opponent 's foot or out of bounds . podolski secures victory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john aloisi scores australia 's second equalizer , getting past defender robert huth to do so lukas podolski was less affected by the fast pace .
in the 88th minute , he scored what would turn out to be the gamewinning goal after a strong run by ballack .
the two-goal lead was a relief to the sell-out crowd who could finally start singing after a night filled more with wonderment as the mostly unknown socceroos put world soccer power germany through the paces .
but it was almost not enough . in stoppage time , the german backline fell asleep as it did against russia one week ago .
aloisi again could break free and scored as the defenders wondered how he got behind them . the fans then had to wait only another 30 seconds before amarilla blew the final whistle and they could breathe a collective sigh of relief . klinsmann has promised excitement and that is what they got . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de argentina dominates tunisia in opener argentina played a superior game against tunisia , winning 2-1 with the help of a penalty kick and a nicely-played second goal .

but as dw-world 's blog reporter nick amies writes , a defensive flaw may end the dream before the final .

india 's tata steel plans to increase output to cater for growing demand from india , china and other parts of asia .
the deal was announced shortly after monday 's $ 22bn -lrb- £ 12bn -rrb- deal under which iran will supply india with five million tonnes of gas a year .
the deals highlight the two countries ' growing dependence on each other .
interdependence we plan to take advantage of the low-cost gas and ... availability of iron ore there b. muthuraman , tata steel managing director india produces only half the natural gas it needs and imports 70 % of the oil it requires , currently at very high cost .
the steel agreement also makes sense for tata steel , part of india 's giant tata group , as it expects to see a sharp rise in demand as its government has promised to spend $ 15bn on huge infrastructure building projects .
the firm has said it intends to raise its total steel production to 15 million tonnes by 2010 , nearly four times its current capacity .
iran is likely to welcome the cash on offer from the indian investors , as political risk has made many investors unwilling to do business there .
deal terms under the terms of the deal , tata steel will develop iron-ore mines , currently controlled by iranian mines and mining industries development and renovation organization -lrb- imidro -rrb- , a government-aided company .
each company will own a 49 % stake of their joint ventures , with an iranian pension fund owning the rest .
indian domestic demand is strong and china also beckons the iranian mines are thought to have reserves of two to three billion tonnes of iron ore .
tata and imidro will build a 1.5 million tonnes a year steel-slab plant and a 1.5 million tonnes a year billets plan , as well as an export-oriented steel plant .
the first steel plant to be completed will come on stream in april 2008 .
they will also co-operate in the exploration and mining of unexplored iron ore mines .
" owing to favourable factors in terms of production , the envisaged steel plants would emerge to be amongst the lowest-cost producers of steel in the world , " tata steel managing director b. muthuraman told a news conference in india .
" we can even bring the steel billets from iran to bombay at a cheaper rate than from our own facilities in india , " he added .

the transport and general workers union is to ballot 170 cleaners on action as they battle for a pay rise from £ 5 to £ 6.70 an hour and extra holidays .
the cleaners were being " screwed " by parliamentary authorities , jack dromey of the tgwu said .
he said 250 mps and peers supported the workers .
a commons spokeswoman said a " mutually acceptable solution " was being sought .
she said the authorities were working closely with the employers and the union to sort out the dispute .
but mr dromey , deputy general secretary of the union , singled out parliament 's handling of cleaning contracts for criticism .
he said : " the problem is parliament .
parliament screwed the contractors and as a result our members are getting screwed .
" parliament must now face up to its responsibilities .
that means varying the contracts , putting more money into the contracts so that the two contractors can pay the london living wage . "
he said the members " wanted a decent standard of living in what is europe 's most expensive capital city " .
he said any industrial action was likely to take place before parliament 's summer recess , scheduled for 21 july .

the cleaners were being " screwed " by parliamentary authorities , jack dromey of the tgwu said .
he said 250 mps and peers supported the workers .
a commons spokeswoman said a " mutually acceptable solution " was being sought .
she said the authorities were working closely with the employers and the union to sort out the dispute .
but mr dromey , deputy general secretary of the union , singled out parliament 's handling of cleaning contracts for criticism .
he said : " the problem is parliament .
parliament screwed the contractors and as a result our members are getting screwed .
" parliament must now face up to its responsibilities .
that means varying the contracts , putting more money into the contracts so that the two contractors can pay the london living wage . "
he said the members " wanted a decent standard of living in what is europe 's most expensive capital city " .
he said any industrial action was likely to take place before parliament 's summer recess , scheduled for 21 july .

squirrel pox is said to have been carried over the border by grey squirrels migrating north from cumbria .
red squirrels with the virus will suffer skin ulcers , lesions and scabs , with swelling and discharge around the eyes , mouth , feet and genitals .
the moredun research institute near edinburgh found the virus after taking blood samples from grey squirrels .
grey squirrels are seldom harmed by the virus , but red squirrels have no immunity and usually die within 15 days .
scientists say it is the first evidence of squirrel pox virus in southern scotland and has serious implications for the endangered red squirrel population . "
they pass it into red squirrels who once the have caught it die within two weeks " elly hamilton red squirrel conservation officer infected animals resemble rabbits with myxomatosis and are sometimes found shivering and lethargic .
roger cook , the chief executive of the european squirrel initiative , urged people to report any sightings of sick or dead red squirrels .
elly hamilton , a red squirrel conservation officer from the scottish borders , said this was the first convincing case of the pox crossing the border .
she said : " all we know is that the grey squirrels carry it .
they are unaffected clinically by it so they act as a reservoir host for the disease .
they pass it into red squirrels , who once they have caught it , die within two weeks . "
the disease was first confirmed in grey squirrels in east anglia in the 1980s , ms hamilton said .
it had been working its way north since , she added .
" it is believed that where grey squirrels are carrying antibodies to this virus that they replace red squirrels 20 times faster than they would do normally . "
