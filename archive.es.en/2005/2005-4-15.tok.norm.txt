" " we believe and i believe that the stability and growth pact has served europe well , " he told a news conference on the eve of a meeting of finance ministers from the powerful group of seven nations .
" in a very difficult moment of very low growth in many countries , the pact has been able to make a contribution ... to avoid an undesirable increase in public deficits in europe . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : work on creating jobs , imf leader says the reformed pact " should guarantee that all countries are treated in the same way and in a transparent way , " rato added , echoing criticism of the way in which the pact 's key deficit stricture was suspended for france and germany . endorsing reforms to weaken pact at summit talks last month , eu leaders endorsed reforms to the 1997 pact , which enshrines the rules underpinning europe 's single currency . eurozone heavyweights france and germany fought hardest to push the changes through , having struggled for years to meet its headline limit requiring budget deficits be kept below 3.0 percent of output . the european central bank , the guardian of the euro , expressed " serious concern " about the planned reforms , fearful they will encourage fiscal profligacy . rato said that in the new-look pact , euro zone governments should make reduction of their national debts a priority to get their healthcare and pension systems in shape for a rapidly ageing population . " that should be the aim of any agreement between the european governments , " he said .
" one thing is clear : europe needs to have better conditions for work with more people working , and working longer .
the impediments to people finding work , and to working longer , should be removed . " slashing growth forecasts in its twice-yearly world economic outlook released wednesday , the imf slashed its 2005 growth forecast for the 12-nation euro zone to 1.6 percent owing to the impact of high oil prices and global economic uncertainty . the report renewed calls for eu nations to revitalise their economies through long-term reforms in key areas such as labour markets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chronic violators imf chief economist raghuram rajan said the euro zone 's potential growth rate was now down to just 2.0 percent a year .
" at those rates , europe can not afford its welfare state , " he said .
" european governments should face the facts that are needed to make that growth potential bigger . " he welcomed commitments to reform such as shake-ups to the pensions system in france and to the labour market in germany .
but much more needs to be done , he said . " what europe needs as a whole is more competition ... as part of the strategy of europe to be a more dynamic player in the global market , " he said . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu to loosen stability pact rules eu finance ministers clinched a last-minute deal sunday that eases much-flouted budget rules to assist germany , the prime architect of the regulations and one of its main transgressors .

" elbe , an experineced diplomat who had served as ambassador to switzerland since july 2003 and had previously served in poland , japan and india , found out on thursday that such comments would not be tolerated by hsi boss .
elbe was recalled from switzerland and removed from his post . the issue against which elbe rebelled arose after it became known that a 2003 posthumous tribute had been paid to franz nüsslein , a convicted war criminal . nüsslein was a former nazi prosecutor in german-occupied czechoslovakia where he was involved in numerous death sentences handed down to the enemies of nazi germany .
after the war , a court in prague sentenced him to 20 years in prison for war crimes , but he was released after serving only seven years . retired ministry employee marga henseler recalled that nüsslein joined the foreign service shortly thereafter and after internal protests , he was shipped off to franco 's spain .
it was henseler who complained to fischer after seeing his obituary , urging him " not to tolerate this . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a long overdue investigation issue long ignored historians have long said that two-thirds of german diplomats were former nazis .
efforts are now underway to open up the ministry 's recent past to public scrutiny , according to klaus scharioth , undersecretary in the foreign ministry . " we need to look into the history of the foreign office under the nazis in a systematic manner , " he said recently .
" foreign minister joschka fischer is currently thinking of establishing an independent panel of historians who would carry out this task . " determined to battle on earlier this year , joschka fischer also refused to pay full tribute to franz krapf , a former ss and nazi party member who later became germany 's ambassador to nato .
fischer 's actions provoked a revolt by some 70 diplomats who publicly accused the foreign minister of applying double standards in a reference to his own past as a leftist militant . although weakened by a different scandal over lax visa regulations , fischer appears determined to battle on in this dispute , which historians say should have reached the public domain long ago .
ministry sources say fischer is now planning an internal reshuffle of posts in what appears to be an effort to finally purge the foreign ministry of the last remnants of nazism . " there is a problem in the ministry in confronting our own understanding of history that we must deal with , " he told tageszeitung , a berlin newspaper . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german diplomats fight over obituaries more than 70 german diplomats have signed a petition to protest foreign minister joschka fischer banning internal death notices that honor colleagues with nazi pasts , according to frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung weekly .

on april 25 , television history will be made in germany when the parliamentary committee investigating the visa affair lets the cameras in on its grilling of foreign minister joschka fischer . when joschka fischer appears before the committee to answer questions about his role in the recent high-profile visa scandal , he 'll be making history . his evidence will be watched by millions of television viewers assessing his every gesture and expression . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : * * jahresrueckblick * * santa barbara county sheriff 's deputy freddy cortez electronically searches michael jackson as he arrives at the santa maria , calif . , courthouse on jan .
16 , 2004 , for his arraignment on child molestation charges .
jackson is charged with seven counts of performing lewd or lascivious acts on a child under 14 and two counts of administering an intoxicating agent .
-lrb- ap photo / kevork djansezian -rrb- but unlike in the us , where televised inquiries and trials have become part of the fabric of popular culture , no cameras or recording equipment have ever been permitted in german parliamentary committee proceedings before . improved transparency the inquiry will look into whether lax visa procedures introduced by the foreign ministry led to massive immigration abuses .
fischer himself has been accused of indirectly allowing thousands of clandestine immigrants from the former soviet bloc - ukraine in particular - to enter germany between 2000 and 2003 after the tourist visa criteria were relaxed . a leading member of the christian democratic union , eckart von klaeden from the visa enquiry committee says he hopes the landmark decision to broadcast fischer 's testimony will ensure greater political transparency . " we want the public to get as authentic an impression of the case as possible , " he explained . is it all just spin ? critics of the plan , however , have said the move marks a further step towards the " americanization " of german politics . " as soon as the cameras are switched on , communication within the committee will transform enormously , " lamented political scientist ulrich sarcinelli in an interview with ap news agency .
" the politicians will know that millions are watching , and will start trying to score brownie points .
the whole process will be overshadowed by their calculated media strategy . " banking on charisma he may have a point .
fischer , long the government 's ace-in-the-hole , has fallen badly out of favor with the voters as of late .
but personal charm has always been his strong point , so what could suit him better than a chance to hog the limelight on prime-time tv ? it was the red-green coalition government itself that requested the live broadcast .
one month ahead of the key state elections in north rhine-westphalia , berlin is hoping that its charismatic foreign minister 's much-touted media finesse will help win over the voters - after recent months saw his seemingly unassailable popularity plummet dramatically . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the details of the revolutionary broadcast will be fleshed out by a government working group over the next few days .
will the cameras be allowed to show the beads of sweat on joschka 's brow , or will they be obliged to maintain a discreet distance ? tune in and find out when fischer tv airs on april 25 . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de an end to superstar fischer ?
foreign minister joschka fischer has long been one of germany 's most popular politicians .
but a scandal involving the abuse of tourist visas has dented his reputation and is threatening to unravel his political future .
-lrb- march 3 , 2005 -rrb- former diplomats turn against fischer several ex-diplomats in germany have struck out against their former boss joschka fischer for his role in the visa scandal .
the attacks may mean another nail in the foreign minister 's political coffin .
-lrb- march 30 , 2005 -rrb- fischer fires dissenting diplomat attempts to avoid embarrassing tributes to diplomats who served under the nazis have led to the removal of one long-time diplomat critical of the foreign minister 's handling of the matter .
-lrb- april 15 , 2005 -rrb- feedback do you think cameras should be allowed in government inquiries and trials ?

" with our policy towards china , we should pursue a long-term relationship with china in all areas , including security policy , " he argued .
" sanctions are designed to isolate and punish .
the german government wants to develop cooperation , which can bring about change . "
an unpopular view but there was plenty of resistance to the chancellor 's proposal .
conservative opposition leader angela merkel said she doubted that ending the embargo would speed up democratization in china , while the spd 's junior coalition partner , the greens , were equally reserved .
" at this point in time , -lrb- we -rrb- do not support lifting the weapons ' embargo against china , " said the greens ' foreign policy spokesman fritz kuhn said .
no common voice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green foreign minister joschka fischer , meanwhile , said he was obliged by eu policy to work towards a consensus on the issue .
but he said china also had to do more .
" i 'm appealing here to the chinese government and the people 's congress to ratify the human rights treaties , " he said .
" that would send out a positive signal . "
the arms embargo is one issue on which the chancellor and his foreign minister have yet to find a common voice .
france and germany have led the push to lift the " outdated " eu arms embargo , rejecting criticism that they are ignoring serious concerns to curry favour with the emerging chinese economic giant .
but wolfgang schäuble , vice chairman of the christian democratic union , stressed that lifting the ban needed to be discussed with the us .
and washington is still firmly opposed to the move .
for now , at the urging of the united states , the european union looks set to agree to keeping the embargo .
luxembourg talks but questions over the 25-member bloc 's plans to end the china arms ban , in place since the 1989 tiananmen square massacre , seem certain to fuel intense debate at the meeting of eu foreign ministers in luxembourg friday .
despite fierce opposition notably from the us and japan , eu leaders last december asked their foreign ministers to work towards lifting the ban by this june , when luxembourg hands over the eu presidency to britain .
the balance of power but the issue has been complicated by china 's adoption last month of an anti-secession law which authorizes the use of force against taiwan if the island moves towards full independence .
washington has warned that an end to the eu ban would upset the balance of power between beijing and taipei .
if an eu decision is not taken by june - an increasingly likely scenario - the issue could be left in limbo until 2006 after the end of britain 's six-month presidency of the eu starting on july 1 .
no decisions are expected from the luxembourg meeting , not least because of the absence of british foreign secretary jack straw , who is unable to attend the meeting in luxembourg on account of an election campaign at home .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a spokeswoman for eu foreign policy chief javier solana -lrb- photo -rrb- said ahead of the talks that , while the eu still plans to lift the ban , the anti-secession law and other issues had " had an impact . "
" it could affect the time line " of when the ban is lifted , she said .
china-japan tension the eu also insists it will put in beef up its own code of conduct on arms sales , while also pushing for china to make a gesture on human right in exchange for lifting the ban .
but on top of the anti-secession law , tensions between china and japan have flared up recently in disputes over their shared wartime past and tokyo 's decision to allow drilling for gas and oil in disputed waters .

france and germany have led the push to lift the " outdated " eu arms embargo , rejecting criticism that they are ignoring serious concerns to curry favour with the emerging chinese economic giant .
but wolfgang schäuble , vice chairman of the christian democratic union , stressed that lifting the ban needed to be discussed with the us .
and washington is still firmly opposed to the move .
for now , at the urging of the united states , the european union looks set to agree to keeping the embargo .
luxembourg talks but questions over the 25-member bloc 's plans to end the china arms ban , in place since the 1989 tiananmen square massacre , seem certain to fuel intense debate at the meeting of eu foreign ministers in luxembourg friday .
despite fierce opposition notably from the us and japan , eu leaders last december asked their foreign ministers to work towards lifting the ban by this june , when luxembourg hands over the eu presidency to britain .
the balance of power but the issue has been complicated by china 's adoption last month of an anti-secession law which authorizes the use of force against taiwan if the island moves towards full independence .
washington has warned that an end to the eu ban would upset the balance of power between beijing and taipei .
if an eu decision is not taken by june - an increasingly likely scenario - the issue could be left in limbo until 2006 after the end of britain 's six-month presidency of the eu starting on july 1 .
no decisions are expected from the luxembourg meeting , not least because of the absence of british foreign secretary jack straw , who is unable to attend the meeting in luxembourg on account of an election campaign at home .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a spokeswoman for eu foreign policy chief javier solana -lrb- photo -rrb- said ahead of the talks that , while the eu still plans to lift the ban , the anti-secession law and other issues had " had an impact . "

" with our policy towards china , we should pursue a long-term relationship with china in all areas , including security policy , " he argued .
" sanctions are designed to isolate and punish .
the german government wants to develop cooperation , which can bring about change . "
an unpopular view but there was plenty of resistance to the chancellor 's proposal .
conservative opposition leader angela merkel said she doubted that ending the embargo would speed up democratization in china , while the spd 's junior coalition partner , the greens , were equally reserved .
" at this point in time , -lrb- we -rrb- do not support lifting the weapons ' embargo against china , " said the greens ' foreign policy spokesman fritz kuhn said .
no common voice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green foreign minister joschka fischer , meanwhile , said he was obliged by eu policy to work towards a consensus on the issue .
but he said china also had to do more .
" i 'm appealing here to the chinese government and the people 's congress to ratify the human rights treaties , " he said .
" that would send out a positive signal . "

" elbe , an experineced diplomat who had served as ambassador to switzerland since july 2003 and had previously served in poland , japan and india , found out on thursday that such comments would not be tolerated by hsi boss .
elbe was recalled from switzerland and removed from his post . the issue against which elbe rebelled arose after it became known that a 2003 posthumous tribute had been paid to franz nüsslein , a convicted war criminal . nüsslein was a former nazi prosecutor in german-occupied czechoslovakia where he was involved in numerous death sentences handed down to the enemies of nazi germany .
after the war , a court in prague sentenced him to 20 years in prison for war crimes , but he was released after serving only seven years . retired ministry employee marga henseler recalled that nüsslein joined the foreign service shortly thereafter and after internal protests , he was shipped off to franco 's spain .
it was henseler who complained to fischer after seeing his obituary , urging him " not to tolerate this . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a long overdue investigation issue long ignored historians have long said that two-thirds of german diplomats were former nazis .
efforts are now underway to open up the ministry 's recent past to public scrutiny , according to klaus scharioth , undersecretary in the foreign ministry . " we need to look into the history of the foreign office under the nazis in a systematic manner , " he said recently .
" foreign minister joschka fischer is currently thinking of establishing an independent panel of historians who would carry out this task . " determined to battle on earlier this year , joschka fischer also refused to pay full tribute to franz krapf , a former ss and nazi party member who later became germany 's ambassador to nato .
fischer 's actions provoked a revolt by some 70 diplomats who publicly accused the foreign minister of applying double standards in a reference to his own past as a leftist militant . although weakened by a different scandal over lax visa regulations , fischer appears determined to battle on in this dispute , which historians say should have reached the public domain long ago .
ministry sources say fischer is now planning an internal reshuffle of posts in what appears to be an effort to finally purge the foreign ministry of the last remnants of nazism . " there is a problem in the ministry in confronting our own understanding of history that we must deal with , " he told tageszeitung , a berlin newspaper . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german diplomats fight over obituaries more than 70 german diplomats have signed a petition to protest foreign minister joschka fischer banning internal death notices that honor colleagues with nazi pasts , according to frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung weekly .

" france would cease to exist " " today , our political power alone , within europe , allows us to defend our interests .
if tomorrow we were to vote no , we would no longer have any power , " chirac told a group of 80 young adults picked by the sofres polling institute . " the reality is that you would have 24 countries that voted yes and then the black sheep that blocked everything " , he said . " france would be considerably weakened , " he warned , adding that within europe , " france would cease to exist politically . " chirac also cautioned that " european construction would stop , " adding : " the argument that we could renegotiate -lrb- the treaty -rrb- is not a serious one . " " let 's not be afraid , " he urged the audience . treaty in jeopardy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu symbol over european convention logo and draft treaty on constitution for europe , partial graphic the constitution , which aims to streamline decision-making in the expanded 25-member european union , must be ratified by all member states .
a rejection in france , one of the eu 's largest countries , would effectively kill the treaty . since mid-march , more than a dozen opinion polls have indicated that french voters will reject the constitution in may .
the most recent survey , published thursday , put support for the ' no ' camp at 55 percent . chirac argued that the constitution was necessary to create a " strong and organized " eu which could act as a counterweight to established powers like the united states and emerging states like china , india and russia . " you need rules to be organized .
these rules are in the constitution , " he said . a tool of protest ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french president also implored voters not to turn the referendum into a protest vote against the center-right government 's gradual economic reforms , stubborn unemployment and decreasing purchasing power . " domestic policy has its own rules , rhythms and demands , " he said .
" at the moment when we are about to make a fundamental decision for the future of our country , for the future of europe ...

" france would cease to exist " " today , our political power alone , within europe , allows us to defend our interests .
if tomorrow we were to vote no , we would no longer have any power , " chirac told a group of 80 young adults picked by the sofres polling institute . " the reality is that you would have 24 countries that voted yes and then the black sheep that blocked everything " , he said . " france would be considerably weakened , " he warned , adding that within europe , " france would cease to exist politically . " chirac also cautioned that " european construction would stop , " adding : " the argument that we could renegotiate -lrb- the treaty -rrb- is not a serious one . " " let 's not be afraid , " he urged the audience . treaty in jeopardy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu symbol over european convention logo and draft treaty on constitution for europe , partial graphic the constitution , which aims to streamline decision-making in the expanded 25-member european union , must be ratified by all member states .
a rejection in france , one of the eu 's largest countries , would effectively kill the treaty . since mid-march , more than a dozen opinion polls have indicated that french voters will reject the constitution in may .
the most recent survey , published thursday , put support for the ' no ' camp at 55 percent . chirac argued that the constitution was necessary to create a " strong and organized " eu which could act as a counterweight to established powers like the united states and emerging states like china , india and russia . " you need rules to be organized .
these rules are in the constitution , " he said . a tool of protest ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french president also implored voters not to turn the referendum into a protest vote against the center-right government 's gradual economic reforms , stubborn unemployment and decreasing purchasing power . " domestic policy has its own rules , rhythms and demands , " he said .
" at the moment when we are about to make a fundamental decision for the future of our country , for the future of europe ...
i do n't want that to be mixed up with the day-to-day politics of a european country , " chirac said . on the issue of turkey 's bid to join the eu , cited in some opinion polls as a reason for french opposition to the constitution , chirac said the two ideas should not be mixed up , as turkey 's possible entry was " 10 , 15 , 20 years " off . " wanting to confuse this issue with the constitution is absolutely either in bad faith or due to rather lightweight reasoning , " the french leader added , while encouraging turkey to pursue democratic reforms . preferential treatment for ' yes ' campaign meanwhile , organizers said some 6000 people attended a ' no ' rally at a central paris theater , taking aim at chirac and other supporters of the european constitution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french anti-globalization activist jose bove criticized chirac 's television appearance as a " media-friendly show with tv presenters , without any real debate . " those in the ' no ' camp had also complained that chirac did not face a political adversary on thursday 's broadcast , claiming the ' yes ' campaign was getting preferential treatment in prime-time viewing hours . chirac 's union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- supports the constitution , as does its ally in government , the union for french democracy -lrb- udf -rrb- . the opposition socialists are officially campaigning for the treaty but riven by an internal split on the issue .

britney 's got hundreds , cher 's got her share .
in fact , any celeb from minor on up has an internet fan site .
so does the grand inquisitor for mother rome , cardinal joseph ratzinger , known as " ratzy " to internet friends . some call him god 's rottweiler ; some say he could be the next pope ; others just sigh and smile , and maybe cross themselves , when talking about their " ratzy . "
members of this latter group have set up a fan club on the internet for their fave man in red , cardinal joseph ratzinger , formerly archbishop of munich , but for the past two decades , he was pope john paul ii 's right-hand man . the cardinal ratzinger fan club web site has nothing but praise for the 78-year-old german who heads the catholic church 's congregation for the doctrine of the faith , which , according to the site , keeps him busy " correcting theological error , silencing dissenting theologians , and stomping down heresy wherever it may rear its ugly head . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ratzinger 's supporters appear to share the same conservative , and often controversial , views as their hero .
ratzinger once wrote a letter of advice to us bishops on denying communion to politicians who support abortion rights .
in another epistle to bishops worldwide , he decried a sort of feminism that makes women ' ' adversaries " of men .
he once called homosexuality a tendency toward " intrinsic moral evil . " no matter to his adherents , who pooh-pooh any criticism , saying he " has received somewhat of a notorious reputation among the liberal media and ' enlightened ' intelligentsia of pseudo-catholic universities . " web site visitors can read a glowing biography of the man once known as the " vice-pope , " read collections of stories in the media about him , or learn what books they should be reading that reflect his own brand of muscular , some would say unforgiving , catholicism . if showing your devotion to the man in the virtual world is n't enough , fans can let their love be known out in the real world , too .
the site features a ratzinger shop , offering t-shirts , bumper stickers , coffee mugs and even a black-and-white baseball cap that lets the world know where you stand .

officials for the organization that buries them say that reminding people of the wasted human lives is still relevant today . just half an hour south of berlin , an idyllic pine forest outside the town of halbe stands as a silent reminder of the nazi regime 's monstrosities : more than 23,000 german soldiers who died during the final days of world war ii are buried here .
some , such as alfred boroske , heinz borcherdt or hans-jürgen steltzner were killed before they turned 18 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while east germany 's communist government grudgingly agreed to set up the cemetery , crosses were banned until after reunification covering more than seven hectares -lrb- 17 acres -rrb- , halbe 's soldiers ' cemetery is the largest in germany and will likely keep growing .
some 20,000 men are still believed to lie in the sandy ground around halbe , their lives wasted because german generals refused to capitulate to the soviets , who had already completely surrounded them . construction workers , but also illegal treasure hunters looking for military memorabilia constantly find more skeletons .
the former alert members of germany 's volksbund deutsche kriegsgräberfürsorge , a humanitarian organization that cares for the graves of germany 's war dead , to exhume the bodies .
the latter simply drop off the bones at a shack behind the house of erdmute labes , the local pastor . a proper burial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sixty years after werner seidler 's death , his wife , karla -lrb- right -rrb- finally got a chance to attend his funeral on thursday " every person has a right to a proper burial , " labes said , adding that the funerals for soldiers who died six decades earlier are also important to give closure to relatives and help them find some peace . on thursday , labes and others gathered at halbe 's soldiers ' cemetery to lay to rest 38 recently found bodies , their remains encased in small , black coffins made out of cardboard , a white rose lying on each of them . " why ca n't people learn from this ?
why do n't they understand ? " asked labes as she stood before the open mass grave .
" we can not remind people enough of what happened . " educating the young bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some coffins contain the remains of more than one soldier that 's more important today than ever as the generation that lived through the war is dying out , volksbund officials said . " we show young people what war means , " said reinhard führer , the organization 's president , adding that thousands of teenagers participate in youth camps organized by the volksbund each year .
" it clearly has an effect on them when they read on the grave stones that these were as old as they are now when they died . " reforming neo-nazis while neo-nazis still abuse halbe and other cemeteries as venues to stage demonstrations , führer said the graves can also help to instigate a thinking process . " halbe is the best example of the nazi regime 's inhumanity , " he said , adding that he supports plans to include the cemetery in a list of sites where neo-nazi gatherings are prohibited .
" these people were wasted in april 1945 , when the germans had already lost the war . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " 4 unkown war dead , " reads the plate the graves might convince some right-extremist teenagers to rethink their political views .
but visiting cemeteries does n't necessarily turn young germans into active supporters of the organization - something the volksbund badly needs . financial troubles ahead ? it 's losing many of its 220,000 members due to old age , with few new ones signing up to replace them .
officials are starting to worry about how they 'll manage to bring in enough donations to cover annual expenses of 40 million euros -lrb- $ 51 million -rrb- they need to maintain more than 800 cemeteries worldwide .
the german government contributes 4 million euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers attended the ceremony , but will these young men support the volksbund financially ?
" it 's a serious problem , " said fritz kirchmeier , the volksbund 's spokesman .
" you ca n't get 25-year-olds interested in a group that 's focused on the past . " the volksbund 's image as a backwards-looking organization has also done its part in making it suspicious to young germans .
führer said for many years , his organization was criticized for honoring german soldiers as victims of the war . " people said , ' you 're just thinking about your own , " ' führer said .
" the horror caused by the germans naturally and rightly did n't make it easy for us to remember our own suffering . " a willingness to reconcile but that 's changed over the years as germans are beginning to feel more comfortable about mourning their own dead . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " 1 german soldier , " reads the plate " we 're no longer the fascist enemy , we 're partners , " he said , adding that while germans taking care of war cemeteries in western europe were still attacked 50 years ago , they 're now accepted as friends . the situation in eastern europe , where the volksbund became active after the collapse of the soviet union , is also improving .
führer said that plans to set up a cemetery for 80,000 german soldiers near st. petersburg have had a positive reception by and large .

" france would cease to exist " " today , our political power alone , within europe , allows us to defend our interests .
if tomorrow we were to vote no , we would no longer have any power , " chirac told a group of 80 young adults picked by the sofres polling institute . " the reality is that you would have 24 countries that voted yes and then the black sheep that blocked everything " , he said . " france would be considerably weakened , " he warned , adding that within europe , " france would cease to exist politically . " chirac also cautioned that " european construction would stop , " adding : " the argument that we could renegotiate -lrb- the treaty -rrb- is not a serious one . " " let 's not be afraid , " he urged the audience . treaty in jeopardy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu symbol over european convention logo and draft treaty on constitution for europe , partial graphic the constitution , which aims to streamline decision-making in the expanded 25-member european union , must be ratified by all member states .
a rejection in france , one of the eu 's largest countries , would effectively kill the treaty . since mid-march , more than a dozen opinion polls have indicated that french voters will reject the constitution in may .
the most recent survey , published thursday , put support for the ' no ' camp at 55 percent . chirac argued that the constitution was necessary to create a " strong and organized " eu which could act as a counterweight to established powers like the united states and emerging states like china , india and russia . " you need rules to be organized .
these rules are in the constitution , " he said . a tool of protest ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french president also implored voters not to turn the referendum into a protest vote against the center-right government 's gradual economic reforms , stubborn unemployment and decreasing purchasing power . " domestic policy has its own rules , rhythms and demands , " he said .
" at the moment when we are about to make a fundamental decision for the future of our country , for the future of europe ...
i do n't want that to be mixed up with the day-to-day politics of a european country , " chirac said . on the issue of turkey 's bid to join the eu , cited in some opinion polls as a reason for french opposition to the constitution , chirac said the two ideas should not be mixed up , as turkey 's possible entry was " 10 , 15 , 20 years " off . " wanting to confuse this issue with the constitution is absolutely either in bad faith or due to rather lightweight reasoning , " the french leader added , while encouraging turkey to pursue democratic reforms . preferential treatment for ' yes ' campaign meanwhile , organizers said some 6000 people attended a ' no ' rally at a central paris theater , taking aim at chirac and other supporters of the european constitution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french anti-globalization activist jose bove criticized chirac 's television appearance as a " media-friendly show with tv presenters , without any real debate . " those in the ' no ' camp had also complained that chirac did not face a political adversary on thursday 's broadcast , claiming the ' yes ' campaign was getting preferential treatment in prime-time viewing hours . chirac 's union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- supports the constitution , as does its ally in government , the union for french democracy -lrb- udf -rrb- . the opposition socialists are officially campaigning for the treaty but riven by an internal split on the issue .

the latter simply drop off the bones at a shack behind the house of erdmute labes , the local pastor . a proper burial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sixty years after werner seidler 's death , his wife , karla -lrb- right -rrb- finally got a chance to attend his funeral on thursday " every person has a right to a proper burial , " labes said , adding that the funerals for soldiers who died six decades earlier are also important to give closure to relatives and help them find some peace . on thursday , labes and others gathered at halbe 's soldiers ' cemetery to lay to rest 38 recently found bodies , their remains encased in small , black coffins made out of cardboard , a white rose lying on each of them . " why ca n't people learn from this ?
why do n't they understand ? " asked labes as she stood before the open mass grave .
" we can not remind people enough of what happened . " educating the young bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some coffins contain the remains of more than one soldier that 's more important today than ever as the generation that lived through the war is dying out , volksbund officials said . " we show young people what war means , " said reinhard führer , the organization 's president , adding that thousands of teenagers participate in youth camps organized by the volksbund each year .
" it clearly has an effect on them when they read on the grave stones that these were as old as they are now when they died . " reforming neo-nazis while neo-nazis still abuse halbe and other cemeteries as venues to stage demonstrations , führer said the graves can also help to instigate a thinking process . " halbe is the best example of the nazi regime 's inhumanity , " he said , adding that he supports plans to include the cemetery in a list of sites where neo-nazi gatherings are prohibited .

but visiting cemeteries does n't necessarily turn young germans into active supporters of the organization - something the volksbund badly needs . financial troubles ahead ? it 's losing many of its 220,000 members due to old age , with few new ones signing up to replace them .
officials are starting to worry about how they 'll manage to bring in enough donations to cover annual expenses of 40 million euros -lrb- $ 51 million -rrb- they need to maintain more than 800 cemeteries worldwide .
the german government contributes 4 million euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers attended the ceremony , but will these young men support the volksbund financially ?
" it 's a serious problem , " said fritz kirchmeier , the volksbund 's spokesman .
" you ca n't get 25-year-olds interested in a group that 's focused on the past . " the volksbund 's image as a backwards-looking organization has also done its part in making it suspicious to young germans .
führer said for many years , his organization was criticized for honoring german soldiers as victims of the war . " people said , ' you 're just thinking about your own , " ' führer said .
" the horror caused by the germans naturally and rightly did n't make it easy for us to remember our own suffering .

officials for the organization that buries them say that reminding people of the wasted human lives is still relevant today . just half an hour south of berlin , an idyllic pine forest outside the town of halbe stands as a silent reminder of the nazi regime 's monstrosities : more than 23,000 german soldiers who died during the final days of world war ii are buried here .
some , such as alfred boroske , heinz borcherdt or hans-jürgen steltzner were killed before they turned 18 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while east germany 's communist government grudgingly agreed to set up the cemetery , crosses were banned until after reunification covering more than seven hectares -lrb- 17 acres -rrb- , halbe 's soldiers ' cemetery is the largest in germany and will likely keep growing .

" elbe , an experineced diplomat who had served as ambassador to switzerland since july 2003 and had previously served in poland , japan and india , found out on thursday that such comments would not be tolerated by hsi boss .
elbe was recalled from switzerland and removed from his post . the issue against which elbe rebelled arose after it became known that a 2003 posthumous tribute had been paid to franz nüsslein , a convicted war criminal . nüsslein was a former nazi prosecutor in german-occupied czechoslovakia where he was involved in numerous death sentences handed down to the enemies of nazi germany .
after the war , a court in prague sentenced him to 20 years in prison for war crimes , but he was released after serving only seven years . retired ministry employee marga henseler recalled that nüsslein joined the foreign service shortly thereafter and after internal protests , he was shipped off to franco 's spain .
it was henseler who complained to fischer after seeing his obituary , urging him " not to tolerate this . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a long overdue investigation issue long ignored historians have long said that two-thirds of german diplomats were former nazis .
efforts are now underway to open up the ministry 's recent past to public scrutiny , according to klaus scharioth , undersecretary in the foreign ministry . " we need to look into the history of the foreign office under the nazis in a systematic manner , " he said recently .
" foreign minister joschka fischer is currently thinking of establishing an independent panel of historians who would carry out this task . " determined to battle on earlier this year , joschka fischer also refused to pay full tribute to franz krapf , a former ss and nazi party member who later became germany 's ambassador to nato .
fischer 's actions provoked a revolt by some 70 diplomats who publicly accused the foreign minister of applying double standards in a reference to his own past as a leftist militant . although weakened by a different scandal over lax visa regulations , fischer appears determined to battle on in this dispute , which historians say should have reached the public domain long ago .
ministry sources say fischer is now planning an internal reshuffle of posts in what appears to be an effort to finally purge the foreign ministry of the last remnants of nazism . " there is a problem in the ministry in confronting our own understanding of history that we must deal with , " he told tageszeitung , a berlin newspaper . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german diplomats fight over obituaries more than 70 german diplomats have signed a petition to protest foreign minister joschka fischer banning internal death notices that honor colleagues with nazi pasts , according to frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung weekly .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 15.04.2005 monaco buries prince rainier großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rainier left his palace for the last time on friday residents of the tiny principality of monaco bid farewell friday to prince rainier iii , who ruled the state for 56 years .
rainier will rest beside his wife , grace kelly who died in a car accident in 1982 . in spring sunshine a crowd of several hundred watched uniformed members of the royal guard carry rainier 's bier through the black-draped palace gates and along the 200-meter route - across the palace square and down a narrow side street - to the cathedral of st. nicholas . a cannon fired from a fort overlooking the harbor , slow bells chimed and a band played a funeral match to the beat of muffled drums .
a line of penitents - members of a roman catholic order dressed in white and black robes - accompanied the coffin , which was covered with a monegasque banner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : princess stephanie of monaco , right , prince albert , center , and princess caroline of hanover leading the mourners were rainier 's three children by the us actress grace kelly : caroline , albert , who has succeeded him as prince , and stephanie .
caroline 's three elder children andrea , charlotte and pierre were also at the head of the procession . wreathes of flowers covered security barricades and were arranged over the steps of the white 19th century cathedral , which stands high on the edge of monaco 's old quarter with a stunning view over the mediterranean sea . a descendant of the 700-year-old grimaldi dynasty , rainier took power in 1949 and was europe 's longest-ruling monarch when he died on april 6 after a month in hospital battling heart , lung and kidney problems . security clampdown bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's king juan carlos , right , chats with french president jacques chirac , while his wife bernadette chirac looks on french president jacques chirac , king juan carlos of spain and britain 's prince andrew were among the dignitaries attending the funeral , which triggered an unprecedented security clampdown by monegasque and french authorities . hundreds of police lined roads into the principality and much of the rock - the promontory over the harbour where palace and cathedral both lie - was sealed off to non-residents .
airspace over the area was closed and waters off the coast declared off-limits . shops and businesses were closed across the tiny state - which is no bigger than new york 's central park - and red-and-white monegasque flags were at half mast or furled with black ribbon .

rainier will rest beside his wife , grace kelly who died in a car accident in 1982 . in spring sunshine a crowd of several hundred watched uniformed members of the royal guard carry rainier 's bier through the black-draped palace gates and along the 200-meter route - across the palace square and down a narrow side street - to the cathedral of st. nicholas . a cannon fired from a fort overlooking the harbor , slow bells chimed and a band played a funeral match to the beat of muffled drums .
a line of penitents - members of a roman catholic order dressed in white and black robes - accompanied the coffin , which was covered with a monegasque banner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : princess stephanie of monaco , right , prince albert , center , and princess caroline of hanover leading the mourners were rainier 's three children by the us actress grace kelly : caroline , albert , who has succeeded him as prince , and stephanie .
caroline 's three elder children andrea , charlotte and pierre were also at the head of the procession . wreathes of flowers covered security barricades and were arranged over the steps of the white 19th century cathedral , which stands high on the edge of monaco 's old quarter with a stunning view over the mediterranean sea . a descendant of the 700-year-old grimaldi dynasty , rainier took power in 1949 and was europe 's longest-ruling monarch when he died on april 6 after a month in hospital battling heart , lung and kidney problems . security clampdown bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's king juan carlos , right , chats with french president jacques chirac , while his wife bernadette chirac looks on french president jacques chirac , king juan carlos of spain and britain 's prince andrew were among the dignitaries attending the funeral , which triggered an unprecedented security clampdown by monegasque and french authorities . hundreds of police lined roads into the principality and much of the rock - the promontory over the harbour where palace and cathedral both lie - was sealed off to non-residents .
airspace over the area was closed and waters off the coast declared off-limits . shops and businesses were closed across the tiny state - which is no bigger than new york 's central park - and red-and-white monegasque flags were at half mast or furled with black ribbon .
many shop-windows bore portraits of the late prince and his family . a fairy-tale prince over his long rule rainier is credited with turning monaco from a riviera backwater into a thriving center of tourism and banking .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 15.04.2005 fischer fires dissenting diplomat großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer is being drawn further into the " obit-gate " row attempts to avoid embarrassing tributes to diplomats who served under the nazis have led to the removal of one long-time diplomat critical of the foreign minister 's handling of the matter . german foreign minister joschka fischer last month introduced a rule reducing obituaries of deceased diplomats in a foreign ministry magazine to only the barest information in order to avoid mentioning the nazi pasts of some of those in his charge . the move angered many staffers including frank elbe , the ambassador to switzerland , who wrote a letter published in bild newspaper in march complaining that the issue was managed " poorly . " elbe , an experineced diplomat who had served as ambassador to switzerland since july 2003 and had previously served in poland , japan and india , found out on thursday that such comments would not be tolerated by hsi boss .
elbe was recalled from switzerland and removed from his post . the issue against which elbe rebelled arose after it became known that a 2003 posthumous tribute had been paid to franz nüsslein , a convicted war criminal . nüsslein was a former nazi prosecutor in german-occupied czechoslovakia where he was involved in numerous death sentences handed down to the enemies of nazi germany .
after the war , a court in prague sentenced him to 20 years in prison for war crimes , but he was released after serving only seven years . retired ministry employee marga henseler recalled that nüsslein joined the foreign service shortly thereafter and after internal protests , he was shipped off to franco 's spain .
it was henseler who complained to fischer after seeing his obituary , urging him " not to tolerate this . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a long overdue investigation issue long ignored historians have long said that two-thirds of german diplomats were former nazis .
efforts are now underway to open up the ministry 's recent past to public scrutiny , according to klaus scharioth , undersecretary in the foreign ministry . " we need to look into the history of the foreign office under the nazis in a systematic manner , " he said recently .
" foreign minister joschka fischer is currently thinking of establishing an independent panel of historians who would carry out this task . " determined to battle on earlier this year , joschka fischer also refused to pay full tribute to franz krapf , a former ss and nazi party member who later became germany 's ambassador to nato .
fischer 's actions provoked a revolt by some 70 diplomats who publicly accused the foreign minister of applying double standards in a reference to his own past as a leftist militant . although weakened by a different scandal over lax visa regulations , fischer appears determined to battle on in this dispute , which historians say should have reached the public domain long ago .
ministry sources say fischer is now planning an internal reshuffle of posts in what appears to be an effort to finally purge the foreign ministry of the last remnants of nazism . " there is a problem in the ministry in confronting our own understanding of history that we must deal with , " he told tageszeitung , a berlin newspaper . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german diplomats fight over obituaries more than 70 german diplomats have signed a petition to protest foreign minister joschka fischer banning internal death notices that honor colleagues with nazi pasts , according to frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung weekly .

" with our policy towards china , we should pursue a long-term relationship with china in all areas , including security policy , " he argued .
" sanctions are designed to isolate and punish .
the german government wants to develop cooperation , which can bring about change . "
an unpopular view but there was plenty of resistance to the chancellor 's proposal .
conservative opposition leader angela merkel said she doubted that ending the embargo would speed up democratization in china , while the spd 's junior coalition partner , the greens , were equally reserved .
" at this point in time , -lrb- we -rrb- do not support lifting the weapons ' embargo against china , " said the greens ' foreign policy spokesman fritz kuhn said .
no common voice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green foreign minister joschka fischer , meanwhile , said he was obliged by eu policy to work towards a consensus on the issue .
but he said china also had to do more .
" i 'm appealing here to the chinese government and the people 's congress to ratify the human rights treaties , " he said .
" that would send out a positive signal . "
the arms embargo is one issue on which the chancellor and his foreign minister have yet to find a common voice .
france and germany have led the push to lift the " outdated " eu arms embargo , rejecting criticism that they are ignoring serious concerns to curry favour with the emerging chinese economic giant .
but wolfgang schäuble , vice chairman of the christian democratic union , stressed that lifting the ban needed to be discussed with the us .
and washington is still firmly opposed to the move .
for now , at the urging of the united states , the european union looks set to agree to keeping the embargo .
luxembourg talks but questions over the 25-member bloc 's plans to end the china arms ban , in place since the 1989 tiananmen square massacre , seem certain to fuel intense debate at the meeting of eu foreign ministers in luxembourg friday .
despite fierce opposition notably from the us and japan , eu leaders last december asked their foreign ministers to work towards lifting the ban by this june , when luxembourg hands over the eu presidency to britain .
the balance of power but the issue has been complicated by china 's adoption last month of an anti-secession law which authorizes the use of force against taiwan if the island moves towards full independence .
washington has warned that an end to the eu ban would upset the balance of power between beijing and taipei .
if an eu decision is not taken by june - an increasingly likely scenario - the issue could be left in limbo until 2006 after the end of britain 's six-month presidency of the eu starting on july 1 .
no decisions are expected from the luxembourg meeting , not least because of the absence of british foreign secretary jack straw , who is unable to attend the meeting in luxembourg on account of an election campaign at home .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a spokeswoman for eu foreign policy chief javier solana -lrb- photo -rrb- said ahead of the talks that , while the eu still plans to lift the ban , the anti-secession law and other issues had " had an impact . "
" it could affect the time line " of when the ban is lifted , she said .
china-japan tension the eu also insists it will put in beef up its own code of conduct on arms sales , while also pushing for china to make a gesture on human right in exchange for lifting the ban .
but on top of the anti-secession law , tensions between china and japan have flared up recently in disputes over their shared wartime past and tokyo 's decision to allow drilling for gas and oil in disputed waters .

" with our policy towards china , we should pursue a long-term relationship with china in all areas , including security policy , " he argued .
" sanctions are designed to isolate and punish .
the german government wants to develop cooperation , which can bring about change . "
an unpopular view but there was plenty of resistance to the chancellor 's proposal .
conservative opposition leader angela merkel said she doubted that ending the embargo would speed up democratization in china , while the spd 's junior coalition partner , the greens , were equally reserved .
" at this point in time , -lrb- we -rrb- do not support lifting the weapons ' embargo against china , " said the greens ' foreign policy spokesman fritz kuhn said .
no common voice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green foreign minister joschka fischer , meanwhile , said he was obliged by eu policy to work towards a consensus on the issue .
but he said china also had to do more .
" i 'm appealing here to the chinese government and the people 's congress to ratify the human rights treaties , " he said .
" that would send out a positive signal . "
the arms embargo is one issue on which the chancellor and his foreign minister have yet to find a common voice .
france and germany have led the push to lift the " outdated " eu arms embargo , rejecting criticism that they are ignoring serious concerns to curry favour with the emerging chinese economic giant .
but wolfgang schäuble , vice chairman of the christian democratic union , stressed that lifting the ban needed to be discussed with the us .
and washington is still firmly opposed to the move .
for now , at the urging of the united states , the european union looks set to agree to keeping the embargo .
luxembourg talks but questions over the 25-member bloc 's plans to end the china arms ban , in place since the 1989 tiananmen square massacre , seem certain to fuel intense debate at the meeting of eu foreign ministers in luxembourg friday .
despite fierce opposition notably from the us and japan , eu leaders last december asked their foreign ministers to work towards lifting the ban by this june , when luxembourg hands over the eu presidency to britain .
the balance of power but the issue has been complicated by china 's adoption last month of an anti-secession law which authorizes the use of force against taiwan if the island moves towards full independence .
washington has warned that an end to the eu ban would upset the balance of power between beijing and taipei .
if an eu decision is not taken by june - an increasingly likely scenario - the issue could be left in limbo until 2006 after the end of britain 's six-month presidency of the eu starting on july 1 .
no decisions are expected from the luxembourg meeting , not least because of the absence of british foreign secretary jack straw , who is unable to attend the meeting in luxembourg on account of an election campaign at home .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a spokeswoman for eu foreign policy chief javier solana -lrb- photo -rrb- said ahead of the talks that , while the eu still plans to lift the ban , the anti-secession law and other issues had " had an impact . "
" it could affect the time line " of when the ban is lifted , she said .
china-japan tension the eu also insists it will put in beef up its own code of conduct on arms sales , while also pushing for china to make a gesture on human right in exchange for lifting the ban .
but on top of the anti-secession law , tensions between china and japan have flared up recently in disputes over their shared wartime past and tokyo 's decision to allow drilling for gas and oil in disputed waters .
" the situation now between china and japan is not contributing " to efforts to make a decision on lifting the embargo , an eu diplomat said . afp / dw-staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu facing damaging split over china while france and germany lead a group of eu countries intent on ending the arms embargo on china , some are becoming nervous due to chinese moves against taiwan and increasing us pressure .

but wolfgang schäuble , vice chairman of the christian democratic union , stressed that lifting the ban needed to be discussed with the us .
and washington is still firmly opposed to the move .
for now , at the urging of the united states , the european union looks set to agree to keeping the embargo .
luxembourg talks but questions over the 25-member bloc 's plans to end the china arms ban , in place since the 1989 tiananmen square massacre , seem certain to fuel intense debate at the meeting of eu foreign ministers in luxembourg friday .
despite fierce opposition notably from the us and japan , eu leaders last december asked their foreign ministers to work towards lifting the ban by this june , when luxembourg hands over the eu presidency to britain .
the balance of power but the issue has been complicated by china 's adoption last month of an anti-secession law which authorizes the use of force against taiwan if the island moves towards full independence .
washington has warned that an end to the eu ban would upset the balance of power between beijing and taipei .
if an eu decision is not taken by june - an increasingly likely scenario - the issue could be left in limbo until 2006 after the end of britain 's six-month presidency of the eu starting on july 1 .
no decisions are expected from the luxembourg meeting , not least because of the absence of british foreign secretary jack straw , who is unable to attend the meeting in luxembourg on account of an election campaign at home .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a spokeswoman for eu foreign policy chief javier solana -lrb- photo -rrb- said ahead of the talks that , while the eu still plans to lift the ban , the anti-secession law and other issues had " had an impact . "
" it could affect the time line " of when the ban is lifted , she said .
china-japan tension the eu also insists it will put in beef up its own code of conduct on arms sales , while also pushing for china to make a gesture on human right in exchange for lifting the ban .
but on top of the anti-secession law , tensions between china and japan have flared up recently in disputes over their shared wartime past and tokyo 's decision to allow drilling for gas and oil in disputed waters .

" with our policy towards china , we should pursue a long-term relationship with china in all areas , including security policy , " he argued .
" sanctions are designed to isolate and punish .
the german government wants to develop cooperation , which can bring about change . "
an unpopular view but there was plenty of resistance to the chancellor 's proposal .
conservative opposition leader angela merkel said she doubted that ending the embargo would speed up democratization in china , while the spd 's junior coalition partner , the greens , were equally reserved .
" at this point in time , -lrb- we -rrb- do not support lifting the weapons ' embargo against china , " said the greens ' foreign policy spokesman fritz kuhn said .
no common voice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green foreign minister joschka fischer , meanwhile , said he was obliged by eu policy to work towards a consensus on the issue .
but he said china also had to do more .
" i 'm appealing here to the chinese government and the people 's congress to ratify the human rights treaties , " he said .
" that would send out a positive signal . "

" " we believe and i believe that the stability and growth pact has served europe well , " he told a news conference on the eve of a meeting of finance ministers from the powerful group of seven nations .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : work on creating jobs , imf leader says the reformed pact " should guarantee that all countries are treated in the same way and in a transparent way , " rato added , echoing criticism of the way in which the pact 's key deficit stricture was suspended for france and germany . endorsing reforms to weaken pact at summit talks last month , eu leaders endorsed reforms to the 1997 pact , which enshrines the rules underpinning europe 's single currency . eurozone heavyweights france and germany fought hardest to push the changes through , having struggled for years to meet its headline limit requiring budget deficits be kept below 3.0 percent of output . the european central bank , the guardian of the euro , expressed " serious concern " about the planned reforms , fearful they will encourage fiscal profligacy . rato said that in the new-look pact , euro zone governments should make reduction of their national debts a priority to get their healthcare and pension systems in shape for a rapidly ageing population .

" european governments should face the facts that are needed to make that growth potential bigger . " he welcomed commitments to reform such as shake-ups to the pensions system in france and to the labour market in germany .
but much more needs to be done , he said .

" france would cease to exist " " today , our political power alone , within europe , allows us to defend our interests .
if tomorrow we were to vote no , we would no longer have any power , " chirac told a group of 80 young adults picked by the sofres polling institute . " the reality is that you would have 24 countries that voted yes and then the black sheep that blocked everything " , he said . " france would be considerably weakened , " he warned , adding that within europe , " france would cease to exist politically . " chirac also cautioned that " european construction would stop , " adding : " the argument that we could renegotiate -lrb- the treaty -rrb- is not a serious one . " " let 's not be afraid , " he urged the audience . treaty in jeopardy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu symbol over european convention logo and draft treaty on constitution for europe , partial graphic the constitution , which aims to streamline decision-making in the expanded 25-member european union , must be ratified by all member states .
a rejection in france , one of the eu 's largest countries , would effectively kill the treaty . since mid-march , more than a dozen opinion polls have indicated that french voters will reject the constitution in may .
the most recent survey , published thursday , put support for the ' no ' camp at 55 percent . chirac argued that the constitution was necessary to create a " strong and organized " eu which could act as a counterweight to established powers like the united states and emerging states like china , india and russia . " you need rules to be organized .
these rules are in the constitution , " he said . a tool of protest ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french president also implored voters not to turn the referendum into a protest vote against the center-right government 's gradual economic reforms , stubborn unemployment and decreasing purchasing power . " domestic policy has its own rules , rhythms and demands , " he said .
" at the moment when we are about to make a fundamental decision for the future of our country , for the future of europe ...
i do n't want that to be mixed up with the day-to-day politics of a european country , " chirac said . on the issue of turkey 's bid to join the eu , cited in some opinion polls as a reason for french opposition to the constitution , chirac said the two ideas should not be mixed up , as turkey 's possible entry was " 10 , 15 , 20 years " off . " wanting to confuse this issue with the constitution is absolutely either in bad faith or due to rather lightweight reasoning , " the french leader added , while encouraging turkey to pursue democratic reforms . preferential treatment for ' yes ' campaign meanwhile , organizers said some 6000 people attended a ' no ' rally at a central paris theater , taking aim at chirac and other supporters of the european constitution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french anti-globalization activist jose bove criticized chirac 's television appearance as a " media-friendly show with tv presenters , without any real debate . " those in the ' no ' camp had also complained that chirac did not face a political adversary on thursday 's broadcast , claiming the ' yes ' campaign was getting preferential treatment in prime-time viewing hours . chirac 's union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- supports the constitution , as does its ally in government , the union for french democracy -lrb- udf -rrb- . the opposition socialists are officially campaigning for the treaty but riven by an internal split on the issue .

britney 's got hundreds , cher 's got her share .
in fact , any celeb from minor on up has an internet fan site .
so does the grand inquisitor for mother rome , cardinal joseph ratzinger , known as " ratzy " to internet friends . some call him god 's rottweiler ; some say he could be the next pope ; others just sigh and smile , and maybe cross themselves , when talking about their " ratzy . "
members of this latter group have set up a fan club on the internet for their fave man in red , cardinal joseph ratzinger , formerly archbishop of munich , but for the past two decades , he was pope john paul ii 's right-hand man . the cardinal ratzinger fan club web site has nothing but praise for the 78-year-old german who heads the catholic church 's congregation for the doctrine of the faith , which , according to the site , keeps him busy " correcting theological error , silencing dissenting theologians , and stomping down heresy wherever it may rear its ugly head . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ratzinger 's supporters appear to share the same conservative , and often controversial , views as their hero .
ratzinger once wrote a letter of advice to us bishops on denying communion to politicians who support abortion rights .
in another epistle to bishops worldwide , he decried a sort of feminism that makes women ' ' adversaries " of men .
he once called homosexuality a tendency toward " intrinsic moral evil . " no matter to his adherents , who pooh-pooh any criticism , saying he " has received somewhat of a notorious reputation among the liberal media and ' enlightened ' intelligentsia of pseudo-catholic universities . " web site visitors can read a glowing biography of the man once known as the " vice-pope , " read collections of stories in the media about him , or learn what books they should be reading that reflect his own brand of muscular , some would say unforgiving , catholicism . if showing your devotion to the man in the virtual world is n't enough , fans can let their love be known out in the real world , too .
the site features a ratzinger shop , offering t-shirts , bumper stickers , coffee mugs and even a black-and-white baseball cap that lets the world know where you stand .

" elbe , an experineced diplomat who had served as ambassador to switzerland since july 2003 and had previously served in poland , japan and india , found out on thursday that such comments would not be tolerated by hsi boss .
elbe was recalled from switzerland and removed from his post . the issue against which elbe rebelled arose after it became known that a 2003 posthumous tribute had been paid to franz nüsslein , a convicted war criminal . nüsslein was a former nazi prosecutor in german-occupied czechoslovakia where he was involved in numerous death sentences handed down to the enemies of nazi germany .
after the war , a court in prague sentenced him to 20 years in prison for war crimes , but he was released after serving only seven years . retired ministry employee marga henseler recalled that nüsslein joined the foreign service shortly thereafter and after internal protests , he was shipped off to franco 's spain .

ministry sources say fischer is now planning an internal reshuffle of posts in what appears to be an effort to finally purge the foreign ministry of the last remnants of nazism .

after the war , a court in prague sentenced him to 20 years in prison for war crimes , but he was released after serving only seven years . retired ministry employee marga henseler recalled that nüsslein joined the foreign service shortly thereafter and after internal protests , he was shipped off to franco 's spain .
it was henseler who complained to fischer after seeing his obituary , urging him " not to tolerate this . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a long overdue investigation issue long ignored historians have long said that two-thirds of german diplomats were former nazis .
efforts are now underway to open up the ministry 's recent past to public scrutiny , according to klaus scharioth , undersecretary in the foreign ministry . " we need to look into the history of the foreign office under the nazis in a systematic manner , " he said recently .
" foreign minister joschka fischer is currently thinking of establishing an independent panel of historians who would carry out this task . " determined to battle on earlier this year , joschka fischer also refused to pay full tribute to franz krapf , a former ss and nazi party member who later became germany 's ambassador to nato .
fischer 's actions provoked a revolt by some 70 diplomats who publicly accused the foreign minister of applying double standards in a reference to his own past as a leftist militant . although weakened by a different scandal over lax visa regulations , fischer appears determined to battle on in this dispute , which historians say should have reached the public domain long ago .
ministry sources say fischer is now planning an internal reshuffle of posts in what appears to be an effort to finally purge the foreign ministry of the last remnants of nazism .

" with our policy towards china , we should pursue a long-term relationship with china in all areas , including security policy , " he argued .
" sanctions are designed to isolate and punish .
the german government wants to develop cooperation , which can bring about change . "
an unpopular view but there was plenty of resistance to the chancellor 's proposal .
conservative opposition leader angela merkel said she doubted that ending the embargo would speed up democratization in china , while the spd 's junior coalition partner , the greens , were equally reserved .
" at this point in time , -lrb- we -rrb- do not support lifting the weapons ' embargo against china , " said the greens ' foreign policy spokesman fritz kuhn said .

the arms embargo is one issue on which the chancellor and his foreign minister have yet to find a common voice .
france and germany have led the push to lift the " outdated " eu arms embargo , rejecting criticism that they are ignoring serious concerns to curry favour with the emerging chinese economic giant .

luxembourg talks but questions over the 25-member bloc 's plans to end the china arms ban , in place since the 1989 tiananmen square massacre , seem certain to fuel intense debate at the meeting of eu foreign ministers in luxembourg friday .
despite fierce opposition notably from the us and japan , eu leaders last december asked their foreign ministers to work towards lifting the ban by this june , when luxembourg hands over the eu presidency to britain .
the balance of power but the issue has been complicated by china 's adoption last month of an anti-secession law which authorizes the use of force against taiwan if the island moves towards full independence .
washington has warned that an end to the eu ban would upset the balance of power between beijing and taipei .
if an eu decision is not taken by june - an increasingly likely scenario - the issue could be left in limbo until 2006 after the end of britain 's six-month presidency of the eu starting on july 1 .
no decisions are expected from the luxembourg meeting , not least because of the absence of british foreign secretary jack straw , who is unable to attend the meeting in luxembourg on account of an election campaign at home .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a spokeswoman for eu foreign policy chief javier solana -lrb- photo -rrb- said ahead of the talks that , while the eu still plans to lift the ban , the anti-secession law and other issues had " had an impact . "
" it could affect the time line " of when the ban is lifted , she said .
china-japan tension the eu also insists it will put in beef up its own code of conduct on arms sales , while also pushing for china to make a gesture on human right in exchange for lifting the ban .
but on top of the anti-secession law , tensions between china and japan have flared up recently in disputes over their shared wartime past and tokyo 's decision to allow drilling for gas and oil in disputed waters .

france and germany have led the push to lift the " outdated " eu arms embargo , rejecting criticism that they are ignoring serious concerns to curry favour with the emerging chinese economic giant .
but wolfgang schäuble , vice chairman of the christian democratic union , stressed that lifting the ban needed to be discussed with the us .
and washington is still firmly opposed to the move .
for now , at the urging of the united states , the european union looks set to agree to keeping the embargo .
luxembourg talks but questions over the 25-member bloc 's plans to end the china arms ban , in place since the 1989 tiananmen square massacre , seem certain to fuel intense debate at the meeting of eu foreign ministers in luxembourg friday .
despite fierce opposition notably from the us and japan , eu leaders last december asked their foreign ministers to work towards lifting the ban by this june , when luxembourg hands over the eu presidency to britain .
the balance of power but the issue has been complicated by china 's adoption last month of an anti-secession law which authorizes the use of force against taiwan if the island moves towards full independence .
washington has warned that an end to the eu ban would upset the balance of power between beijing and taipei .
if an eu decision is not taken by june - an increasingly likely scenario - the issue could be left in limbo until 2006 after the end of britain 's six-month presidency of the eu starting on july 1 .
no decisions are expected from the luxembourg meeting , not least because of the absence of british foreign secretary jack straw , who is unable to attend the meeting in luxembourg on account of an election campaign at home .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a spokeswoman for eu foreign policy chief javier solana -lrb- photo -rrb- said ahead of the talks that , while the eu still plans to lift the ban , the anti-secession law and other issues had " had an impact . "
" it could affect the time line " of when the ban is lifted , she said .
china-japan tension the eu also insists it will put in beef up its own code of conduct on arms sales , while also pushing for china to make a gesture on human right in exchange for lifting the ban .
but on top of the anti-secession law , tensions between china and japan have flared up recently in disputes over their shared wartime past and tokyo 's decision to allow drilling for gas and oil in disputed waters .
" the situation now between china and japan is not contributing " to efforts to make a decision on lifting the embargo , an eu diplomat said . afp / dw-staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu facing damaging split over china while france and germany lead a group of eu countries intent on ending the arms embargo on china , some are becoming nervous due to chinese moves against taiwan and increasing us pressure .
-lrb- march 21 , 2005 -rrb- us , eu on collision course over china two senior members of the united states congress warned the european union this week that the lifting of the 15-year arms embargo on china could result in a halt of us sales in military technology to the eu .

however , eu leaders held out the prospect of ending the ban perhaps next year , despite opposition from the us .

" " we believe and i believe that the stability and growth pact has served europe well , " he told a news conference on the eve of a meeting of finance ministers from the powerful group of seven nations .
" in a very difficult moment of very low growth in many countries , the pact has been able to make a contribution ... to avoid an undesirable increase in public deficits in europe . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : work on creating jobs , imf leader says the reformed pact " should guarantee that all countries are treated in the same way and in a transparent way , " rato added , echoing criticism of the way in which the pact 's key deficit stricture was suspended for france and germany . endorsing reforms to weaken pact at summit talks last month , eu leaders endorsed reforms to the 1997 pact , which enshrines the rules underpinning europe 's single currency . eurozone heavyweights france and germany fought hardest to push the changes through , having struggled for years to meet its headline limit requiring budget deficits be kept below 3.0 percent of output . the european central bank , the guardian of the euro , expressed " serious concern " about the planned reforms , fearful they will encourage fiscal profligacy . rato said that in the new-look pact , euro zone governments should make reduction of their national debts a priority to get their healthcare and pension systems in shape for a rapidly ageing population . " that should be the aim of any agreement between the european governments , " he said .
" one thing is clear : europe needs to have better conditions for work with more people working , and working longer .
the impediments to people finding work , and to working longer , should be removed . " slashing growth forecasts in its twice-yearly world economic outlook released wednesday , the imf slashed its 2005 growth forecast for the 12-nation euro zone to 1.6 percent owing to the impact of high oil prices and global economic uncertainty . the report renewed calls for eu nations to revitalise their economies through long-term reforms in key areas such as labour markets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chronic violators imf chief economist raghuram rajan said the euro zone 's potential growth rate was now down to just 2.0 percent a year .
" at those rates , europe can not afford its welfare state , " he said .
" european governments should face the facts that are needed to make that growth potential bigger . " he welcomed commitments to reform such as shake-ups to the pensions system in france and to the labour market in germany .
but much more needs to be done , he said . " what europe needs as a whole is more competition ... as part of the strategy of europe to be a more dynamic player in the global market , " he said . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu to loosen stability pact rules eu finance ministers clinched a last-minute deal sunday that eases much-flouted budget rules to assist germany , the prime architect of the regulations and one of its main transgressors .

" with our policy towards china , we should pursue a long-term relationship with china in all areas , including security policy , " he argued .
" sanctions are designed to isolate and punish .
the german government wants to develop cooperation , which can bring about change . "
an unpopular view but there was plenty of resistance to the chancellor 's proposal .
conservative opposition leader angela merkel said she doubted that ending the embargo would speed up democratization in china , while the spd 's junior coalition partner , the greens , were equally reserved .
" at this point in time , -lrb- we -rrb- do not support lifting the weapons ' embargo against china , " said the greens ' foreign policy spokesman fritz kuhn said .
no common voice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green foreign minister joschka fischer , meanwhile , said he was obliged by eu policy to work towards a consensus on the issue .
but he said china also had to do more .
" i 'm appealing here to the chinese government and the people 's congress to ratify the human rights treaties , " he said .
" that would send out a positive signal . "
the arms embargo is one issue on which the chancellor and his foreign minister have yet to find a common voice .
france and germany have led the push to lift the " outdated " eu arms embargo , rejecting criticism that they are ignoring serious concerns to curry favour with the emerging chinese economic giant .
but wolfgang schäuble , vice chairman of the christian democratic union , stressed that lifting the ban needed to be discussed with the us .
and washington is still firmly opposed to the move .
for now , at the urging of the united states , the european union looks set to agree to keeping the embargo .
luxembourg talks but questions over the 25-member bloc 's plans to end the china arms ban , in place since the 1989 tiananmen square massacre , seem certain to fuel intense debate at the meeting of eu foreign ministers in luxembourg friday .
despite fierce opposition notably from the us and japan , eu leaders last december asked their foreign ministers to work towards lifting the ban by this june , when luxembourg hands over the eu presidency to britain .
the balance of power but the issue has been complicated by china 's adoption last month of an anti-secession law which authorizes the use of force against taiwan if the island moves towards full independence .
washington has warned that an end to the eu ban would upset the balance of power between beijing and taipei .
if an eu decision is not taken by june - an increasingly likely scenario - the issue could be left in limbo until 2006 after the end of britain 's six-month presidency of the eu starting on july 1 .
no decisions are expected from the luxembourg meeting , not least because of the absence of british foreign secretary jack straw , who is unable to attend the meeting in luxembourg on account of an election campaign at home .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a spokeswoman for eu foreign policy chief javier solana -lrb- photo -rrb- said ahead of the talks that , while the eu still plans to lift the ban , the anti-secession law and other issues had " had an impact . "
" it could affect the time line " of when the ban is lifted , she said .
china-japan tension the eu also insists it will put in beef up its own code of conduct on arms sales , while also pushing for china to make a gesture on human right in exchange for lifting the ban .
but on top of the anti-secession law , tensions between china and japan have flared up recently in disputes over their shared wartime past and tokyo 's decision to allow drilling for gas and oil in disputed waters .

" with our policy towards china , we should pursue a long-term relationship with china in all areas , including security policy , " he argued .
" sanctions are designed to isolate and punish .
the german government wants to develop cooperation , which can bring about change . "
an unpopular view but there was plenty of resistance to the chancellor 's proposal .
conservative opposition leader angela merkel said she doubted that ending the embargo would speed up democratization in china , while the spd 's junior coalition partner , the greens , were equally reserved .
" at this point in time , -lrb- we -rrb- do not support lifting the weapons ' embargo against china , " said the greens ' foreign policy spokesman fritz kuhn said .
no common voice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green foreign minister joschka fischer , meanwhile , said he was obliged by eu policy to work towards a consensus on the issue .
but he said china also had to do more .
" i 'm appealing here to the chinese government and the people 's congress to ratify the human rights treaties , " he said .
" that would send out a positive signal . "
the arms embargo is one issue on which the chancellor and his foreign minister have yet to find a common voice .
france and germany have led the push to lift the " outdated " eu arms embargo , rejecting criticism that they are ignoring serious concerns to curry favour with the emerging chinese economic giant .
but wolfgang schäuble , vice chairman of the christian democratic union , stressed that lifting the ban needed to be discussed with the us .
and washington is still firmly opposed to the move .
for now , at the urging of the united states , the european union looks set to agree to keeping the embargo .
luxembourg talks but questions over the 25-member bloc 's plans to end the china arms ban , in place since the 1989 tiananmen square massacre , seem certain to fuel intense debate at the meeting of eu foreign ministers in luxembourg friday .
despite fierce opposition notably from the us and japan , eu leaders last december asked their foreign ministers to work towards lifting the ban by this june , when luxembourg hands over the eu presidency to britain .
the balance of power but the issue has been complicated by china 's adoption last month of an anti-secession law which authorizes the use of force against taiwan if the island moves towards full independence .
washington has warned that an end to the eu ban would upset the balance of power between beijing and taipei .
if an eu decision is not taken by june - an increasingly likely scenario - the issue could be left in limbo until 2006 after the end of britain 's six-month presidency of the eu starting on july 1 .
no decisions are expected from the luxembourg meeting , not least because of the absence of british foreign secretary jack straw , who is unable to attend the meeting in luxembourg on account of an election campaign at home .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a spokeswoman for eu foreign policy chief javier solana -lrb- photo -rrb- said ahead of the talks that , while the eu still plans to lift the ban , the anti-secession law and other issues had " had an impact . "
" it could affect the time line " of when the ban is lifted , she said .
china-japan tension the eu also insists it will put in beef up its own code of conduct on arms sales , while also pushing for china to make a gesture on human right in exchange for lifting the ban .
but on top of the anti-secession law , tensions between china and japan have flared up recently in disputes over their shared wartime past and tokyo 's decision to allow drilling for gas and oil in disputed waters .
" the situation now between china and japan is not contributing " to efforts to make a decision on lifting the embargo , an eu diplomat said . afp / dw-staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu facing damaging split over china while france and germany lead a group of eu countries intent on ending the arms embargo on china , some are becoming nervous due to chinese moves against taiwan and increasing us pressure .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 15.04.2005 imf chief blasts weak eu budget rules großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the imf 's rodrigo rato is calling for tougher rules in the euro zone when france and germany , chronic violators of eu budget requirements , pushed for a weakening of those rules , they hardly expected to attract imf attention . international monetary fund chief rodrigo rato attacked reforms of the euro zone 's enfeebled budget rules thursday ; reforms rammed through by france and germany to help them avoid punishment for violating regulations . rato , who in his previous job as spain 's finance minister was a staunch defender of the european union 's stability and growth pact , said the imf would look at the reforms " with great interest . " " we believe and i believe that the stability and growth pact has served europe well , " he told a news conference on the eve of a meeting of finance ministers from the powerful group of seven nations .
" in a very difficult moment of very low growth in many countries , the pact has been able to make a contribution ... to avoid an undesirable increase in public deficits in europe . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : work on creating jobs , imf leader says the reformed pact " should guarantee that all countries are treated in the same way and in a transparent way , " rato added , echoing criticism of the way in which the pact 's key deficit stricture was suspended for france and germany . endorsing reforms to weaken pact at summit talks last month , eu leaders endorsed reforms to the 1997 pact , which enshrines the rules underpinning europe 's single currency . eurozone heavyweights france and germany fought hardest to push the changes through , having struggled for years to meet its headline limit requiring budget deficits be kept below 3.0 percent of output . the european central bank , the guardian of the euro , expressed " serious concern " about the planned reforms , fearful they will encourage fiscal profligacy . rato said that in the new-look pact , euro zone governments should make reduction of their national debts a priority to get their healthcare and pension systems in shape for a rapidly ageing population . " that should be the aim of any agreement between the european governments , " he said .

on april 25 , television history will be made in germany when the parliamentary committee investigating the visa affair lets the cameras in on its grilling of foreign minister joschka fischer . when joschka fischer appears before the committee to answer questions about his role in the recent high-profile visa scandal , he 'll be making history . his evidence will be watched by millions of television viewers assessing his every gesture and expression . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : * * jahresrueckblick * * santa barbara county sheriff 's deputy freddy cortez electronically searches michael jackson as he arrives at the santa maria , calif . , courthouse on jan .
16 , 2004 , for his arraignment on child molestation charges .
jackson is charged with seven counts of performing lewd or lascivious acts on a child under 14 and two counts of administering an intoxicating agent .
-lrb- ap photo / kevork djansezian -rrb- but unlike in the us , where televised inquiries and trials have become part of the fabric of popular culture , no cameras or recording equipment have ever been permitted in german parliamentary committee proceedings before . improved transparency the inquiry will look into whether lax visa procedures introduced by the foreign ministry led to massive immigration abuses .
fischer himself has been accused of indirectly allowing thousands of clandestine immigrants from the former soviet bloc - ukraine in particular - to enter germany between 2000 and 2003 after the tourist visa criteria were relaxed . a leading member of the christian democratic union , eckart von klaeden from the visa enquiry committee says he hopes the landmark decision to broadcast fischer 's testimony will ensure greater political transparency . " we want the public to get as authentic an impression of the case as possible , " he explained . is it all just spin ? critics of the plan , however , have said the move marks a further step towards the " americanization " of german politics . " as soon as the cameras are switched on , communication within the committee will transform enormously , " lamented political scientist ulrich sarcinelli in an interview with ap news agency .
" the politicians will know that millions are watching , and will start trying to score brownie points .
the whole process will be overshadowed by their calculated media strategy . " banking on charisma he may have a point .
fischer , long the government 's ace-in-the-hole , has fallen badly out of favor with the voters as of late .
but personal charm has always been his strong point , so what could suit him better than a chance to hog the limelight on prime-time tv ? it was the red-green coalition government itself that requested the live broadcast .
one month ahead of the key state elections in north rhine-westphalia , berlin is hoping that its charismatic foreign minister 's much-touted media finesse will help win over the voters - after recent months saw his seemingly unassailable popularity plummet dramatically . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the details of the revolutionary broadcast will be fleshed out by a government working group over the next few days .
will the cameras be allowed to show the beads of sweat on joschka 's brow , or will they be obliged to maintain a discreet distance ? tune in and find out when fischer tv airs on april 25 . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de an end to superstar fischer ?
foreign minister joschka fischer has long been one of germany 's most popular politicians .
but a scandal involving the abuse of tourist visas has dented his reputation and is threatening to unravel his political future .
-lrb- march 3 , 2005 -rrb- former diplomats turn against fischer several ex-diplomats in germany have struck out against their former boss joschka fischer for his role in the visa scandal .
the attacks may mean another nail in the foreign minister 's political coffin .

jackson is charged with seven counts of performing lewd or lascivious acts on a child under 14 and two counts of administering an intoxicating agent .
-lrb- ap photo / kevork djansezian -rrb- but unlike in the us , where televised inquiries and trials have become part of the fabric of popular culture , no cameras or recording equipment have ever been permitted in german parliamentary committee proceedings before . improved transparency the inquiry will look into whether lax visa procedures introduced by the foreign ministry led to massive immigration abuses .
fischer himself has been accused of indirectly allowing thousands of clandestine immigrants from the former soviet bloc - ukraine in particular - to enter germany between 2000 and 2003 after the tourist visa criteria were relaxed . a leading member of the christian democratic union , eckart von klaeden from the visa enquiry committee says he hopes the landmark decision to broadcast fischer 's testimony will ensure greater political transparency . " we want the public to get as authentic an impression of the case as possible , " he explained . is it all just spin ? critics of the plan , however , have said the move marks a further step towards the " americanization " of german politics . " as soon as the cameras are switched on , communication within the committee will transform enormously , " lamented political scientist ulrich sarcinelli in an interview with ap news agency .
" the politicians will know that millions are watching , and will start trying to score brownie points .
the whole process will be overshadowed by their calculated media strategy . " banking on charisma he may have a point .
fischer , long the government 's ace-in-the-hole , has fallen badly out of favor with the voters as of late .
but personal charm has always been his strong point , so what could suit him better than a chance to hog the limelight on prime-time tv ? it was the red-green coalition government itself that requested the live broadcast .
one month ahead of the key state elections in north rhine-westphalia , berlin is hoping that its charismatic foreign minister 's much-touted media finesse will help win over the voters - after recent months saw his seemingly unassailable popularity plummet dramatically . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the details of the revolutionary broadcast will be fleshed out by a government working group over the next few days .
will the cameras be allowed to show the beads of sweat on joschka 's brow , or will they be obliged to maintain a discreet distance ? tune in and find out when fischer tv airs on april 25 . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de an end to superstar fischer ?
foreign minister joschka fischer has long been one of germany 's most popular politicians .
but a scandal involving the abuse of tourist visas has dented his reputation and is threatening to unravel his political future .
-lrb- march 3 , 2005 -rrb- former diplomats turn against fischer several ex-diplomats in germany have struck out against their former boss joschka fischer for his role in the visa scandal .
the attacks may mean another nail in the foreign minister 's political coffin .
-lrb- march 30 , 2005 -rrb- fischer fires dissenting diplomat attempts to avoid embarrassing tributes to diplomats who served under the nazis have led to the removal of one long-time diplomat critical of the foreign minister 's handling of the matter .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 15.04.2005 fischer fires dissenting diplomat großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer is being drawn further into the " obit-gate " row attempts to avoid embarrassing tributes to diplomats who served under the nazis have led to the removal of one long-time diplomat critical of the foreign minister 's handling of the matter . german foreign minister joschka fischer last month introduced a rule reducing obituaries of deceased diplomats in a foreign ministry magazine to only the barest information in order to avoid mentioning the nazi pasts of some of those in his charge . the move angered many staffers including frank elbe , the ambassador to switzerland , who wrote a letter published in bild newspaper in march complaining that the issue was managed " poorly . " elbe , an experineced diplomat who had served as ambassador to switzerland since july 2003 and had previously served in poland , japan and india , found out on thursday that such comments would not be tolerated by hsi boss .
elbe was recalled from switzerland and removed from his post . the issue against which elbe rebelled arose after it became known that a 2003 posthumous tribute had been paid to franz nüsslein , a convicted war criminal . nüsslein was a former nazi prosecutor in german-occupied czechoslovakia where he was involved in numerous death sentences handed down to the enemies of nazi germany .
after the war , a court in prague sentenced him to 20 years in prison for war crimes , but he was released after serving only seven years . retired ministry employee marga henseler recalled that nüsslein joined the foreign service shortly thereafter and after internal protests , he was shipped off to franco 's spain .
it was henseler who complained to fischer after seeing his obituary , urging him " not to tolerate this . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a long overdue investigation issue long ignored historians have long said that two-thirds of german diplomats were former nazis .
efforts are now underway to open up the ministry 's recent past to public scrutiny , according to klaus scharioth , undersecretary in the foreign ministry . " we need to look into the history of the foreign office under the nazis in a systematic manner , " he said recently .
" foreign minister joschka fischer is currently thinking of establishing an independent panel of historians who would carry out this task . " determined to battle on earlier this year , joschka fischer also refused to pay full tribute to franz krapf , a former ss and nazi party member who later became germany 's ambassador to nato .

" elbe , an experineced diplomat who had served as ambassador to switzerland since july 2003 and had previously served in poland , japan and india , found out on thursday that such comments would not be tolerated by hsi boss .
elbe was recalled from switzerland and removed from his post . the issue against which elbe rebelled arose after it became known that a 2003 posthumous tribute had been paid to franz nüsslein , a convicted war criminal . nüsslein was a former nazi prosecutor in german-occupied czechoslovakia where he was involved in numerous death sentences handed down to the enemies of nazi germany .
after the war , a court in prague sentenced him to 20 years in prison for war crimes , but he was released after serving only seven years . retired ministry employee marga henseler recalled that nüsslein joined the foreign service shortly thereafter and after internal protests , he was shipped off to franco 's spain .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a long overdue investigation issue long ignored historians have long said that two-thirds of german diplomats were former nazis .
efforts are now underway to open up the ministry 's recent past to public scrutiny , according to klaus scharioth , undersecretary in the foreign ministry . " we need to look into the history of the foreign office under the nazis in a systematic manner , " he said recently .

after the war , a court in prague sentenced him to 20 years in prison for war crimes , but he was released after serving only seven years . retired ministry employee marga henseler recalled that nüsslein joined the foreign service shortly thereafter and after internal protests , he was shipped off to franco 's spain .
it was henseler who complained to fischer after seeing his obituary , urging him " not to tolerate this . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a long overdue investigation issue long ignored historians have long said that two-thirds of german diplomats were former nazis .
efforts are now underway to open up the ministry 's recent past to public scrutiny , according to klaus scharioth , undersecretary in the foreign ministry . " we need to look into the history of the foreign office under the nazis in a systematic manner , " he said recently .
" foreign minister joschka fischer is currently thinking of establishing an independent panel of historians who would carry out this task . " determined to battle on earlier this year , joschka fischer also refused to pay full tribute to franz krapf , a former ss and nazi party member who later became germany 's ambassador to nato .
fischer 's actions provoked a revolt by some 70 diplomats who publicly accused the foreign minister of applying double standards in a reference to his own past as a leftist militant . although weakened by a different scandal over lax visa regulations , fischer appears determined to battle on in this dispute , which historians say should have reached the public domain long ago .
ministry sources say fischer is now planning an internal reshuffle of posts in what appears to be an effort to finally purge the foreign ministry of the last remnants of nazism . " there is a problem in the ministry in confronting our own understanding of history that we must deal with , " he told tageszeitung , a berlin newspaper . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german diplomats fight over obituaries more than 70 german diplomats have signed a petition to protest foreign minister joschka fischer banning internal death notices that honor colleagues with nazi pasts , according to frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung weekly .

" elbe , an experineced diplomat who had served as ambassador to switzerland since july 2003 and had previously served in poland , japan and india , found out on thursday that such comments would not be tolerated by hsi boss .

" with our policy towards china , we should pursue a long-term relationship with china in all areas , including security policy , " he argued .
" sanctions are designed to isolate and punish .
the german government wants to develop cooperation , which can bring about change . "
an unpopular view but there was plenty of resistance to the chancellor 's proposal .
conservative opposition leader angela merkel said she doubted that ending the embargo would speed up democratization in china , while the spd 's junior coalition partner , the greens , were equally reserved .
" at this point in time , -lrb- we -rrb- do not support lifting the weapons ' embargo against china , " said the greens ' foreign policy spokesman fritz kuhn said .
no common voice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green foreign minister joschka fischer , meanwhile , said he was obliged by eu policy to work towards a consensus on the issue .
but he said china also had to do more .
" i 'm appealing here to the chinese government and the people 's congress to ratify the human rights treaties , " he said .
" that would send out a positive signal . "
the arms embargo is one issue on which the chancellor and his foreign minister have yet to find a common voice .
france and germany have led the push to lift the " outdated " eu arms embargo , rejecting criticism that they are ignoring serious concerns to curry favour with the emerging chinese economic giant .
but wolfgang schäuble , vice chairman of the christian democratic union , stressed that lifting the ban needed to be discussed with the us .
and washington is still firmly opposed to the move .
for now , at the urging of the united states , the european union looks set to agree to keeping the embargo .
luxembourg talks but questions over the 25-member bloc 's plans to end the china arms ban , in place since the 1989 tiananmen square massacre , seem certain to fuel intense debate at the meeting of eu foreign ministers in luxembourg friday .
despite fierce opposition notably from the us and japan , eu leaders last december asked their foreign ministers to work towards lifting the ban by this june , when luxembourg hands over the eu presidency to britain .
the balance of power but the issue has been complicated by china 's adoption last month of an anti-secession law which authorizes the use of force against taiwan if the island moves towards full independence .
washington has warned that an end to the eu ban would upset the balance of power between beijing and taipei .
if an eu decision is not taken by june - an increasingly likely scenario - the issue could be left in limbo until 2006 after the end of britain 's six-month presidency of the eu starting on july 1 .
no decisions are expected from the luxembourg meeting , not least because of the absence of british foreign secretary jack straw , who is unable to attend the meeting in luxembourg on account of an election campaign at home .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a spokeswoman for eu foreign policy chief javier solana -lrb- photo -rrb- said ahead of the talks that , while the eu still plans to lift the ban , the anti-secession law and other issues had " had an impact . "
" it could affect the time line " of when the ban is lifted , she said .
china-japan tension the eu also insists it will put in beef up its own code of conduct on arms sales , while also pushing for china to make a gesture on human right in exchange for lifting the ban .
but on top of the anti-secession law , tensions between china and japan have flared up recently in disputes over their shared wartime past and tokyo 's decision to allow drilling for gas and oil in disputed waters .
" the situation now between china and japan is not contributing " to efforts to make a decision on lifting the embargo , an eu diplomat said . afp / dw-staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu facing damaging split over china while france and germany lead a group of eu countries intent on ending the arms embargo on china , some are becoming nervous due to chinese moves against taiwan and increasing us pressure .

" with our policy towards china , we should pursue a long-term relationship with china in all areas , including security policy , " he argued .
" sanctions are designed to isolate and punish .
the german government wants to develop cooperation , which can bring about change . "
an unpopular view but there was plenty of resistance to the chancellor 's proposal .
conservative opposition leader angela merkel said she doubted that ending the embargo would speed up democratization in china , while the spd 's junior coalition partner , the greens , were equally reserved .
" at this point in time , -lrb- we -rrb- do not support lifting the weapons ' embargo against china , " said the greens ' foreign policy spokesman fritz kuhn said .
no common voice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green foreign minister joschka fischer , meanwhile , said he was obliged by eu policy to work towards a consensus on the issue .
but he said china also had to do more .
" i 'm appealing here to the chinese government and the people 's congress to ratify the human rights treaties , " he said .
" that would send out a positive signal . "
the arms embargo is one issue on which the chancellor and his foreign minister have yet to find a common voice .
france and germany have led the push to lift the " outdated " eu arms embargo , rejecting criticism that they are ignoring serious concerns to curry favour with the emerging chinese economic giant .
but wolfgang schäuble , vice chairman of the christian democratic union , stressed that lifting the ban needed to be discussed with the us .
and washington is still firmly opposed to the move .
for now , at the urging of the united states , the european union looks set to agree to keeping the embargo .
luxembourg talks but questions over the 25-member bloc 's plans to end the china arms ban , in place since the 1989 tiananmen square massacre , seem certain to fuel intense debate at the meeting of eu foreign ministers in luxembourg friday .
despite fierce opposition notably from the us and japan , eu leaders last december asked their foreign ministers to work towards lifting the ban by this june , when luxembourg hands over the eu presidency to britain .
the balance of power but the issue has been complicated by china 's adoption last month of an anti-secession law which authorizes the use of force against taiwan if the island moves towards full independence .
washington has warned that an end to the eu ban would upset the balance of power between beijing and taipei .
if an eu decision is not taken by june - an increasingly likely scenario - the issue could be left in limbo until 2006 after the end of britain 's six-month presidency of the eu starting on july 1 .
no decisions are expected from the luxembourg meeting , not least because of the absence of british foreign secretary jack straw , who is unable to attend the meeting in luxembourg on account of an election campaign at home .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a spokeswoman for eu foreign policy chief javier solana -lrb- photo -rrb- said ahead of the talks that , while the eu still plans to lift the ban , the anti-secession law and other issues had " had an impact . "
" it could affect the time line " of when the ban is lifted , she said .
china-japan tension the eu also insists it will put in beef up its own code of conduct on arms sales , while also pushing for china to make a gesture on human right in exchange for lifting the ban .
but on top of the anti-secession law , tensions between china and japan have flared up recently in disputes over their shared wartime past and tokyo 's decision to allow drilling for gas and oil in disputed waters .
" the situation now between china and japan is not contributing " to efforts to make a decision on lifting the embargo , an eu diplomat said . afp / dw-staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu facing damaging split over china while france and germany lead a group of eu countries intent on ending the arms embargo on china , some are becoming nervous due to chinese moves against taiwan and increasing us pressure .

" france would cease to exist " " today , our political power alone , within europe , allows us to defend our interests .
if tomorrow we were to vote no , we would no longer have any power , " chirac told a group of 80 young adults picked by the sofres polling institute . " the reality is that you would have 24 countries that voted yes and then the black sheep that blocked everything " , he said . " france would be considerably weakened , " he warned , adding that within europe , " france would cease to exist politically . " chirac also cautioned that " european construction would stop , " adding : " the argument that we could renegotiate -lrb- the treaty -rrb- is not a serious one . " " let 's not be afraid , " he urged the audience . treaty in jeopardy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu symbol over european convention logo and draft treaty on constitution for europe , partial graphic the constitution , which aims to streamline decision-making in the expanded 25-member european union , must be ratified by all member states .
a rejection in france , one of the eu 's largest countries , would effectively kill the treaty . since mid-march , more than a dozen opinion polls have indicated that french voters will reject the constitution in may .
the most recent survey , published thursday , put support for the ' no ' camp at 55 percent . chirac argued that the constitution was necessary to create a " strong and organized " eu which could act as a counterweight to established powers like the united states and emerging states like china , india and russia . " you need rules to be organized .
these rules are in the constitution , " he said . a tool of protest ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french president also implored voters not to turn the referendum into a protest vote against the center-right government 's gradual economic reforms , stubborn unemployment and decreasing purchasing power . " domestic policy has its own rules , rhythms and demands , " he said .
" at the moment when we are about to make a fundamental decision for the future of our country , for the future of europe ...
i do n't want that to be mixed up with the day-to-day politics of a european country , " chirac said . on the issue of turkey 's bid to join the eu , cited in some opinion polls as a reason for french opposition to the constitution , chirac said the two ideas should not be mixed up , as turkey 's possible entry was " 10 , 15 , 20 years " off . " wanting to confuse this issue with the constitution is absolutely either in bad faith or due to rather lightweight reasoning , " the french leader added , while encouraging turkey to pursue democratic reforms . preferential treatment for ' yes ' campaign meanwhile , organizers said some 6000 people attended a ' no ' rally at a central paris theater , taking aim at chirac and other supporters of the european constitution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french anti-globalization activist jose bove criticized chirac 's television appearance as a " media-friendly show with tv presenters , without any real debate . " those in the ' no ' camp had also complained that chirac did not face a political adversary on thursday 's broadcast , claiming the ' yes ' campaign was getting preferential treatment in prime-time viewing hours . chirac 's union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- supports the constitution , as does its ally in government , the union for french democracy -lrb- udf -rrb- . the opposition socialists are officially campaigning for the treaty but riven by an internal split on the issue .

officials for the organization that buries them say that reminding people of the wasted human lives is still relevant today . just half an hour south of berlin , an idyllic pine forest outside the town of halbe stands as a silent reminder of the nazi regime 's monstrosities : more than 23,000 german soldiers who died during the final days of world war ii are buried here .
some , such as alfred boroske , heinz borcherdt or hans-jürgen steltzner were killed before they turned 18 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while east germany 's communist government grudgingly agreed to set up the cemetery , crosses were banned until after reunification covering more than seven hectares -lrb- 17 acres -rrb- , halbe 's soldiers ' cemetery is the largest in germany and will likely keep growing .
some 20,000 men are still believed to lie in the sandy ground around halbe , their lives wasted because german generals refused to capitulate to the soviets , who had already completely surrounded them . construction workers , but also illegal treasure hunters looking for military memorabilia constantly find more skeletons .

officials for the organization that buries them say that reminding people of the wasted human lives is still relevant today . just half an hour south of berlin , an idyllic pine forest outside the town of halbe stands as a silent reminder of the nazi regime 's monstrosities : more than 23,000 german soldiers who died during the final days of world war ii are buried here .
some , such as alfred boroske , heinz borcherdt or hans-jürgen steltzner were killed before they turned 18 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while east germany 's communist government grudgingly agreed to set up the cemetery , crosses were banned until after reunification covering more than seven hectares -lrb- 17 acres -rrb- , halbe 's soldiers ' cemetery is the largest in germany and will likely keep growing .

" it clearly has an effect on them when they read on the grave stones that these were as old as they are now when they died . " reforming neo-nazis while neo-nazis still abuse halbe and other cemeteries as venues to stage demonstrations , führer said the graves can also help to instigate a thinking process .

officials for the organization that buries them say that reminding people of the wasted human lives is still relevant today . just half an hour south of berlin , an idyllic pine forest outside the town of halbe stands as a silent reminder of the nazi regime 's monstrosities : more than 23,000 german soldiers who died during the final days of world war ii are buried here .
some , such as alfred boroske , heinz borcherdt or hans-jürgen steltzner were killed before they turned 18 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while east germany 's communist government grudgingly agreed to set up the cemetery , crosses were banned until after reunification covering more than seven hectares -lrb- 17 acres -rrb- , halbe 's soldiers ' cemetery is the largest in germany and will likely keep growing .
some 20,000 men are still believed to lie in the sandy ground around halbe , their lives wasted because german generals refused to capitulate to the soviets , who had already completely surrounded them . construction workers , but also illegal treasure hunters looking for military memorabilia constantly find more skeletons .
the former alert members of germany 's volksbund deutsche kriegsgräberfürsorge , a humanitarian organization that cares for the graves of germany 's war dead , to exhume the bodies .
the latter simply drop off the bones at a shack behind the house of erdmute labes , the local pastor . a proper burial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sixty years after werner seidler 's death , his wife , karla -lrb- right -rrb- finally got a chance to attend his funeral on thursday " every person has a right to a proper burial , " labes said , adding that the funerals for soldiers who died six decades earlier are also important to give closure to relatives and help them find some peace . on thursday , labes and others gathered at halbe 's soldiers ' cemetery to lay to rest 38 recently found bodies , their remains encased in small , black coffins made out of cardboard , a white rose lying on each of them . " why ca n't people learn from this ?
why do n't they understand ? " asked labes as she stood before the open mass grave .
" we can not remind people enough of what happened . " educating the young bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some coffins contain the remains of more than one soldier that 's more important today than ever as the generation that lived through the war is dying out , volksbund officials said . " we show young people what war means , " said reinhard führer , the organization 's president , adding that thousands of teenagers participate in youth camps organized by the volksbund each year .
" it clearly has an effect on them when they read on the grave stones that these were as old as they are now when they died . " reforming neo-nazis while neo-nazis still abuse halbe and other cemeteries as venues to stage demonstrations , führer said the graves can also help to instigate a thinking process . " halbe is the best example of the nazi regime 's inhumanity , " he said , adding that he supports plans to include the cemetery in a list of sites where neo-nazi gatherings are prohibited .
" these people were wasted in april 1945 , when the germans had already lost the war . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " 4 unkown war dead , " reads the plate the graves might convince some right-extremist teenagers to rethink their political views .
but visiting cemeteries does n't necessarily turn young germans into active supporters of the organization - something the volksbund badly needs . financial troubles ahead ? it 's losing many of its 220,000 members due to old age , with few new ones signing up to replace them .
officials are starting to worry about how they 'll manage to bring in enough donations to cover annual expenses of 40 million euros -lrb- $ 51 million -rrb- they need to maintain more than 800 cemeteries worldwide .
the german government contributes 4 million euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers attended the ceremony , but will these young men support the volksbund financially ?
" it 's a serious problem , " said fritz kirchmeier , the volksbund 's spokesman .
" you ca n't get 25-year-olds interested in a group that 's focused on the past . " the volksbund 's image as a backwards-looking organization has also done its part in making it suspicious to young germans .
führer said for many years , his organization was criticized for honoring german soldiers as victims of the war . " people said , ' you 're just thinking about your own , " ' führer said .
" the horror caused by the germans naturally and rightly did n't make it easy for us to remember our own suffering . " a willingness to reconcile but that 's changed over the years as germans are beginning to feel more comfortable about mourning their own dead . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " 1 german soldier , " reads the plate " we 're no longer the fascist enemy , we 're partners , " he said , adding that while germans taking care of war cemeteries in western europe were still attacked 50 years ago , they 're now accepted as friends . the situation in eastern europe , where the volksbund became active after the collapse of the soviet union , is also improving .
führer said that plans to set up a cemetery for 80,000 german soldiers near st. petersburg have had a positive reception by and large . " this willingness to reconcile is something we as germans can only be grateful for , " he said . mathis winkler , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tracing soldiers ' fates the " wehrmacht " information office for lost soldiers and prisoners of war was founded in 1939 .

some , such as alfred boroske , heinz borcherdt or hans-jürgen steltzner were killed before they turned 18 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while east germany 's communist government grudgingly agreed to set up the cemetery , crosses were banned until after reunification covering more than seven hectares -lrb- 17 acres -rrb- , halbe 's soldiers ' cemetery is the largest in germany and will likely keep growing .
some 20,000 men are still believed to lie in the sandy ground around halbe , their lives wasted because german generals refused to capitulate to the soviets , who had already completely surrounded them . construction workers , but also illegal treasure hunters looking for military memorabilia constantly find more skeletons .
the former alert members of germany 's volksbund deutsche kriegsgräberfürsorge , a humanitarian organization that cares for the graves of germany 's war dead , to exhume the bodies .
the latter simply drop off the bones at a shack behind the house of erdmute labes , the local pastor . a proper burial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sixty years after werner seidler 's death , his wife , karla -lrb- right -rrb- finally got a chance to attend his funeral on thursday " every person has a right to a proper burial , " labes said , adding that the funerals for soldiers who died six decades earlier are also important to give closure to relatives and help them find some peace . on thursday , labes and others gathered at halbe 's soldiers ' cemetery to lay to rest 38 recently found bodies , their remains encased in small , black coffins made out of cardboard , a white rose lying on each of them . " why ca n't people learn from this ?
why do n't they understand ? " asked labes as she stood before the open mass grave .
" we can not remind people enough of what happened . " educating the young bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some coffins contain the remains of more than one soldier that 's more important today than ever as the generation that lived through the war is dying out , volksbund officials said . " we show young people what war means , " said reinhard führer , the organization 's president , adding that thousands of teenagers participate in youth camps organized by the volksbund each year .
" it clearly has an effect on them when they read on the grave stones that these were as old as they are now when they died . " reforming neo-nazis while neo-nazis still abuse halbe and other cemeteries as venues to stage demonstrations , führer said the graves can also help to instigate a thinking process . " halbe is the best example of the nazi regime 's inhumanity , " he said , adding that he supports plans to include the cemetery in a list of sites where neo-nazi gatherings are prohibited .
" these people were wasted in april 1945 , when the germans had already lost the war . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " 4 unkown war dead , " reads the plate the graves might convince some right-extremist teenagers to rethink their political views .
but visiting cemeteries does n't necessarily turn young germans into active supporters of the organization - something the volksbund badly needs . financial troubles ahead ? it 's losing many of its 220,000 members due to old age , with few new ones signing up to replace them .
officials are starting to worry about how they 'll manage to bring in enough donations to cover annual expenses of 40 million euros -lrb- $ 51 million -rrb- they need to maintain more than 800 cemeteries worldwide .
the german government contributes 4 million euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers attended the ceremony , but will these young men support the volksbund financially ?
" it 's a serious problem , " said fritz kirchmeier , the volksbund 's spokesman .
" you ca n't get 25-year-olds interested in a group that 's focused on the past . " the volksbund 's image as a backwards-looking organization has also done its part in making it suspicious to young germans .
führer said for many years , his organization was criticized for honoring german soldiers as victims of the war . " people said , ' you 're just thinking about your own , " ' führer said .
" the horror caused by the germans naturally and rightly did n't make it easy for us to remember our own suffering . " a willingness to reconcile but that 's changed over the years as germans are beginning to feel more comfortable about mourning their own dead . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " 1 german soldier , " reads the plate " we 're no longer the fascist enemy , we 're partners , " he said , adding that while germans taking care of war cemeteries in western europe were still attacked 50 years ago , they 're now accepted as friends . the situation in eastern europe , where the volksbund became active after the collapse of the soviet union , is also improving .
führer said that plans to set up a cemetery for 80,000 german soldiers near st. petersburg have had a positive reception by and large . " this willingness to reconcile is something we as germans can only be grateful for , " he said . mathis winkler , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tracing soldiers ' fates the " wehrmacht " information office for lost soldiers and prisoners of war was founded in 1939 .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : work on creating jobs , imf leader says the reformed pact " should guarantee that all countries are treated in the same way and in a transparent way , " rato added , echoing criticism of the way in which the pact 's key deficit stricture was suspended for france and germany . endorsing reforms to weaken pact at summit talks last month , eu leaders endorsed reforms to the 1997 pact , which enshrines the rules underpinning europe 's single currency . eurozone heavyweights france and germany fought hardest to push the changes through , having struggled for years to meet its headline limit requiring budget deficits be kept below 3.0 percent of output . the european central bank , the guardian of the euro , expressed " serious concern " about the planned reforms , fearful they will encourage fiscal profligacy . rato said that in the new-look pact , euro zone governments should make reduction of their national debts a priority to get their healthcare and pension systems in shape for a rapidly ageing population . " that should be the aim of any agreement between the european governments , " he said .
" one thing is clear : europe needs to have better conditions for work with more people working , and working longer .
the impediments to people finding work , and to working longer , should be removed . " slashing growth forecasts in its twice-yearly world economic outlook released wednesday , the imf slashed its 2005 growth forecast for the 12-nation euro zone to 1.6 percent owing to the impact of high oil prices and global economic uncertainty . the report renewed calls for eu nations to revitalise their economies through long-term reforms in key areas such as labour markets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chronic violators imf chief economist raghuram rajan said the euro zone 's potential growth rate was now down to just 2.0 percent a year .
" at those rates , europe can not afford its welfare state , " he said .
" european governments should face the facts that are needed to make that growth potential bigger . " he welcomed commitments to reform such as shake-ups to the pensions system in france and to the labour market in germany .
but much more needs to be done , he said . " what europe needs as a whole is more competition ... as part of the strategy of europe to be a more dynamic player in the global market , " he said . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu to loosen stability pact rules eu finance ministers clinched a last-minute deal sunday that eases much-flouted budget rules to assist germany , the prime architect of the regulations and one of its main transgressors .

" france would cease to exist " " today , our political power alone , within europe , allows us to defend our interests .
if tomorrow we were to vote no , we would no longer have any power , " chirac told a group of 80 young adults picked by the sofres polling institute . " the reality is that you would have 24 countries that voted yes and then the black sheep that blocked everything " , he said . " france would be considerably weakened , " he warned , adding that within europe , " france would cease to exist politically . " chirac also cautioned that " european construction would stop , " adding : " the argument that we could renegotiate -lrb- the treaty -rrb- is not a serious one . " " let 's not be afraid , " he urged the audience . treaty in jeopardy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu symbol over european convention logo and draft treaty on constitution for europe , partial graphic the constitution , which aims to streamline decision-making in the expanded 25-member european union , must be ratified by all member states .
a rejection in france , one of the eu 's largest countries , would effectively kill the treaty . since mid-march , more than a dozen opinion polls have indicated that french voters will reject the constitution in may .
the most recent survey , published thursday , put support for the ' no ' camp at 55 percent . chirac argued that the constitution was necessary to create a " strong and organized " eu which could act as a counterweight to established powers like the united states and emerging states like china , india and russia . " you need rules to be organized .
these rules are in the constitution , " he said . a tool of protest ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french president also implored voters not to turn the referendum into a protest vote against the center-right government 's gradual economic reforms , stubborn unemployment and decreasing purchasing power . " domestic policy has its own rules , rhythms and demands , " he said .
" at the moment when we are about to make a fundamental decision for the future of our country , for the future of europe ...
i do n't want that to be mixed up with the day-to-day politics of a european country , " chirac said . on the issue of turkey 's bid to join the eu , cited in some opinion polls as a reason for french opposition to the constitution , chirac said the two ideas should not be mixed up , as turkey 's possible entry was " 10 , 15 , 20 years " off . " wanting to confuse this issue with the constitution is absolutely either in bad faith or due to rather lightweight reasoning , " the french leader added , while encouraging turkey to pursue democratic reforms . preferential treatment for ' yes ' campaign meanwhile , organizers said some 6000 people attended a ' no ' rally at a central paris theater , taking aim at chirac and other supporters of the european constitution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french anti-globalization activist jose bove criticized chirac 's television appearance as a " media-friendly show with tv presenters , without any real debate . " those in the ' no ' camp had also complained that chirac did not face a political adversary on thursday 's broadcast , claiming the ' yes ' campaign was getting preferential treatment in prime-time viewing hours . chirac 's union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- supports the constitution , as does its ally in government , the union for french democracy -lrb- udf -rrb- . the opposition socialists are officially campaigning for the treaty but riven by an internal split on the issue .

britney 's got hundreds , cher 's got her share .
in fact , any celeb from minor on up has an internet fan site .
so does the grand inquisitor for mother rome , cardinal joseph ratzinger , known as " ratzy " to internet friends . some call him god 's rottweiler ; some say he could be the next pope ; others just sigh and smile , and maybe cross themselves , when talking about their " ratzy . "
members of this latter group have set up a fan club on the internet for their fave man in red , cardinal joseph ratzinger , formerly archbishop of munich , but for the past two decades , he was pope john paul ii 's right-hand man . the cardinal ratzinger fan club web site has nothing but praise for the 78-year-old german who heads the catholic church 's congregation for the doctrine of the faith , which , according to the site , keeps him busy " correcting theological error , silencing dissenting theologians , and stomping down heresy wherever it may rear its ugly head . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ratzinger 's supporters appear to share the same conservative , and often controversial , views as their hero .
ratzinger once wrote a letter of advice to us bishops on denying communion to politicians who support abortion rights .
in another epistle to bishops worldwide , he decried a sort of feminism that makes women ' ' adversaries " of men .
he once called homosexuality a tendency toward " intrinsic moral evil . " no matter to his adherents , who pooh-pooh any criticism , saying he " has received somewhat of a notorious reputation among the liberal media and ' enlightened ' intelligentsia of pseudo-catholic universities . " web site visitors can read a glowing biography of the man once known as the " vice-pope , " read collections of stories in the media about him , or learn what books they should be reading that reflect his own brand of muscular , some would say unforgiving , catholicism . if showing your devotion to the man in the virtual world is n't enough , fans can let their love be known out in the real world , too .
the site features a ratzinger shop , offering t-shirts , bumper stickers , coffee mugs and even a black-and-white baseball cap that lets the world know where you stand .

that 's how long the whole process is supposed to last this friday in frankfurt for the drawing in the first phase of sales for world cup tickets in germany .
the organizing committee is exceptionally pleased by the interest .
the only thing that is less than satisfactory is , of course , the fact that not everyone will receive a ticket in the first phase .
" even if the ticket supply were three times greater , we would n't be able to fulfil everybody 's wish , " said the committee 's senior vice president , horst schmidt .

another round will be held for so-called " team specific tickets . " the multiple drawings are supposed to take 24 hours to complete , and they will be observed by a notary public .
" an absolute equal chance for everyone is of absolute priority for us , " remarked schmidt .
there 's always hope when both the telephone lines and web site for tickets were opened in february , the grumbling amongst the fans was great .
hundreds of thousands of the 3.3 million tickets are earmarked for guests of honor , the media and sponsors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but everyone , particularly in germany , should not see just doom and gloom .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 15.04.2005 laying germany 's war dead to rest großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : honoring their predecessors sixty years after the end of world war ii , the remains of soldiers are still found in germany .
officials for the organization that buries them say that reminding people of the wasted human lives is still relevant today . just half an hour south of berlin , an idyllic pine forest outside the town of halbe stands as a silent reminder of the nazi regime 's monstrosities : more than 23,000 german soldiers who died during the final days of world war ii are buried here .
some , such as alfred boroske , heinz borcherdt or hans-jürgen steltzner were killed before they turned 18 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while east germany 's communist government grudgingly agreed to set up the cemetery , crosses were banned until after reunification covering more than seven hectares -lrb- 17 acres -rrb- , halbe 's soldiers ' cemetery is the largest in germany and will likely keep growing .
some 20,000 men are still believed to lie in the sandy ground around halbe , their lives wasted because german generals refused to capitulate to the soviets , who had already completely surrounded them . construction workers , but also illegal treasure hunters looking for military memorabilia constantly find more skeletons .
the former alert members of germany 's volksbund deutsche kriegsgräberfürsorge , a humanitarian organization that cares for the graves of germany 's war dead , to exhume the bodies .
the latter simply drop off the bones at a shack behind the house of erdmute labes , the local pastor . a proper burial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sixty years after werner seidler 's death , his wife , karla -lrb- right -rrb- finally got a chance to attend his funeral on thursday " every person has a right to a proper burial , " labes said , adding that the funerals for soldiers who died six decades earlier are also important to give closure to relatives and help them find some peace . on thursday , labes and others gathered at halbe 's soldiers ' cemetery to lay to rest 38 recently found bodies , their remains encased in small , black coffins made out of cardboard , a white rose lying on each of them . " why ca n't people learn from this ?
why do n't they understand ? " asked labes as she stood before the open mass grave .
" we can not remind people enough of what happened . " educating the young bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some coffins contain the remains of more than one soldier that 's more important today than ever as the generation that lived through the war is dying out , volksbund officials said . " we show young people what war means , " said reinhard führer , the organization 's president , adding that thousands of teenagers participate in youth camps organized by the volksbund each year .
" it clearly has an effect on them when they read on the grave stones that these were as old as they are now when they died . " reforming neo-nazis while neo-nazis still abuse halbe and other cemeteries as venues to stage demonstrations , führer said the graves can also help to instigate a thinking process . " halbe is the best example of the nazi regime 's inhumanity , " he said , adding that he supports plans to include the cemetery in a list of sites where neo-nazi gatherings are prohibited .
" these people were wasted in april 1945 , when the germans had already lost the war . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " 4 unkown war dead , " reads the plate the graves might convince some right-extremist teenagers to rethink their political views .
but visiting cemeteries does n't necessarily turn young germans into active supporters of the organization - something the volksbund badly needs . financial troubles ahead ? it 's losing many of its 220,000 members due to old age , with few new ones signing up to replace them .
officials are starting to worry about how they 'll manage to bring in enough donations to cover annual expenses of 40 million euros -lrb- $ 51 million -rrb- they need to maintain more than 800 cemeteries worldwide .
the german government contributes 4 million euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers attended the ceremony , but will these young men support the volksbund financially ?
" it 's a serious problem , " said fritz kirchmeier , the volksbund 's spokesman .
" you ca n't get 25-year-olds interested in a group that 's focused on the past . " the volksbund 's image as a backwards-looking organization has also done its part in making it suspicious to young germans .

officials for the organization that buries them say that reminding people of the wasted human lives is still relevant today . just half an hour south of berlin , an idyllic pine forest outside the town of halbe stands as a silent reminder of the nazi regime 's monstrosities : more than 23,000 german soldiers who died during the final days of world war ii are buried here .
some , such as alfred boroske , heinz borcherdt or hans-jürgen steltzner were killed before they turned 18 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while east germany 's communist government grudgingly agreed to set up the cemetery , crosses were banned until after reunification covering more than seven hectares -lrb- 17 acres -rrb- , halbe 's soldiers ' cemetery is the largest in germany and will likely keep growing .
some 20,000 men are still believed to lie in the sandy ground around halbe , their lives wasted because german generals refused to capitulate to the soviets , who had already completely surrounded them . construction workers , but also illegal treasure hunters looking for military memorabilia constantly find more skeletons .
the former alert members of germany 's volksbund deutsche kriegsgräberfürsorge , a humanitarian organization that cares for the graves of germany 's war dead , to exhume the bodies .
the latter simply drop off the bones at a shack behind the house of erdmute labes , the local pastor . a proper burial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sixty years after werner seidler 's death , his wife , karla -lrb- right -rrb- finally got a chance to attend his funeral on thursday " every person has a right to a proper burial , " labes said , adding that the funerals for soldiers who died six decades earlier are also important to give closure to relatives and help them find some peace . on thursday , labes and others gathered at halbe 's soldiers ' cemetery to lay to rest 38 recently found bodies , their remains encased in small , black coffins made out of cardboard , a white rose lying on each of them . " why ca n't people learn from this ?
why do n't they understand ? " asked labes as she stood before the open mass grave .
" we can not remind people enough of what happened . " educating the young bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some coffins contain the remains of more than one soldier that 's more important today than ever as the generation that lived through the war is dying out , volksbund officials said . " we show young people what war means , " said reinhard führer , the organization 's president , adding that thousands of teenagers participate in youth camps organized by the volksbund each year .
" it clearly has an effect on them when they read on the grave stones that these were as old as they are now when they died . " reforming neo-nazis while neo-nazis still abuse halbe and other cemeteries as venues to stage demonstrations , führer said the graves can also help to instigate a thinking process . " halbe is the best example of the nazi regime 's inhumanity , " he said , adding that he supports plans to include the cemetery in a list of sites where neo-nazi gatherings are prohibited .
" these people were wasted in april 1945 , when the germans had already lost the war . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " 4 unkown war dead , " reads the plate the graves might convince some right-extremist teenagers to rethink their political views .
but visiting cemeteries does n't necessarily turn young germans into active supporters of the organization - something the volksbund badly needs . financial troubles ahead ? it 's losing many of its 220,000 members due to old age , with few new ones signing up to replace them .
officials are starting to worry about how they 'll manage to bring in enough donations to cover annual expenses of 40 million euros -lrb- $ 51 million -rrb- they need to maintain more than 800 cemeteries worldwide .
the german government contributes 4 million euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers attended the ceremony , but will these young men support the volksbund financially ?
" it 's a serious problem , " said fritz kirchmeier , the volksbund 's spokesman .
" you ca n't get 25-year-olds interested in a group that 's focused on the past . " the volksbund 's image as a backwards-looking organization has also done its part in making it suspicious to young germans .
führer said for many years , his organization was criticized for honoring german soldiers as victims of the war . " people said , ' you 're just thinking about your own , " ' führer said .
" the horror caused by the germans naturally and rightly did n't make it easy for us to remember our own suffering . " a willingness to reconcile but that 's changed over the years as germans are beginning to feel more comfortable about mourning their own dead . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " 1 german soldier , " reads the plate " we 're no longer the fascist enemy , we 're partners , " he said , adding that while germans taking care of war cemeteries in western europe were still attacked 50 years ago , they 're now accepted as friends . the situation in eastern europe , where the volksbund became active after the collapse of the soviet union , is also improving .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 15.04.2005 monaco buries prince rainier großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rainier left his palace for the last time on friday residents of the tiny principality of monaco bid farewell friday to prince rainier iii , who ruled the state for 56 years .
rainier will rest beside his wife , grace kelly who died in a car accident in 1982 . in spring sunshine a crowd of several hundred watched uniformed members of the royal guard carry rainier 's bier through the black-draped palace gates and along the 200-meter route - across the palace square and down a narrow side street - to the cathedral of st. nicholas . a cannon fired from a fort overlooking the harbor , slow bells chimed and a band played a funeral match to the beat of muffled drums .
a line of penitents - members of a roman catholic order dressed in white and black robes - accompanied the coffin , which was covered with a monegasque banner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : princess stephanie of monaco , right , prince albert , center , and princess caroline of hanover leading the mourners were rainier 's three children by the us actress grace kelly : caroline , albert , who has succeeded him as prince , and stephanie .
caroline 's three elder children andrea , charlotte and pierre were also at the head of the procession . wreathes of flowers covered security barricades and were arranged over the steps of the white 19th century cathedral , which stands high on the edge of monaco 's old quarter with a stunning view over the mediterranean sea . a descendant of the 700-year-old grimaldi dynasty , rainier took power in 1949 and was europe 's longest-ruling monarch when he died on april 6 after a month in hospital battling heart , lung and kidney problems . security clampdown bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's king juan carlos , right , chats with french president jacques chirac , while his wife bernadette chirac looks on french president jacques chirac , king juan carlos of spain and britain 's prince andrew were among the dignitaries attending the funeral , which triggered an unprecedented security clampdown by monegasque and french authorities . hundreds of police lined roads into the principality and much of the rock - the promontory over the harbour where palace and cathedral both lie - was sealed off to non-residents .
airspace over the area was closed and waters off the coast declared off-limits . shops and businesses were closed across the tiny state - which is no bigger than new york 's central park - and red-and-white monegasque flags were at half mast or furled with black ribbon .
many shop-windows bore portraits of the late prince and his family . a fairy-tale prince over his long rule rainier is credited with turning monaco from a riviera backwater into a thriving center of tourism and banking .

elbe was recalled from switzerland and removed from his post . the issue against which elbe rebelled arose after it became known that a 2003 posthumous tribute had been paid to franz nüsslein , a convicted war criminal . nüsslein was a former nazi prosecutor in german-occupied czechoslovakia where he was involved in numerous death sentences handed down to the enemies of nazi germany .
after the war , a court in prague sentenced him to 20 years in prison for war crimes , but he was released after serving only seven years . retired ministry employee marga henseler recalled that nüsslein joined the foreign service shortly thereafter and after internal protests , he was shipped off to franco 's spain .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 15.04.2005 laying germany 's war dead to rest großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : honoring their predecessors sixty years after the end of world war ii , the remains of soldiers are still found in germany .
officials for the organization that buries them say that reminding people of the wasted human lives is still relevant today . just half an hour south of berlin , an idyllic pine forest outside the town of halbe stands as a silent reminder of the nazi regime 's monstrosities : more than 23,000 german soldiers who died during the final days of world war ii are buried here .
some , such as alfred boroske , heinz borcherdt or hans-jürgen steltzner were killed before they turned 18 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while east germany 's communist government grudgingly agreed to set up the cemetery , crosses were banned until after reunification covering more than seven hectares -lrb- 17 acres -rrb- , halbe 's soldiers ' cemetery is the largest in germany and will likely keep growing .
some 20,000 men are still believed to lie in the sandy ground around halbe , their lives wasted because german generals refused to capitulate to the soviets , who had already completely surrounded them . construction workers , but also illegal treasure hunters looking for military memorabilia constantly find more skeletons .
the former alert members of germany 's volksbund deutsche kriegsgräberfürsorge , a humanitarian organization that cares for the graves of germany 's war dead , to exhume the bodies .
the latter simply drop off the bones at a shack behind the house of erdmute labes , the local pastor . a proper burial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sixty years after werner seidler 's death , his wife , karla -lrb- right -rrb- finally got a chance to attend his funeral on thursday " every person has a right to a proper burial , " labes said , adding that the funerals for soldiers who died six decades earlier are also important to give closure to relatives and help them find some peace . on thursday , labes and others gathered at halbe 's soldiers ' cemetery to lay to rest 38 recently found bodies , their remains encased in small , black coffins made out of cardboard , a white rose lying on each of them . " why ca n't people learn from this ?
why do n't they understand ? " asked labes as she stood before the open mass grave .
" we can not remind people enough of what happened . " educating the young bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some coffins contain the remains of more than one soldier that 's more important today than ever as the generation that lived through the war is dying out , volksbund officials said . " we show young people what war means , " said reinhard führer , the organization 's president , adding that thousands of teenagers participate in youth camps organized by the volksbund each year .
" it clearly has an effect on them when they read on the grave stones that these were as old as they are now when they died . " reforming neo-nazis while neo-nazis still abuse halbe and other cemeteries as venues to stage demonstrations , führer said the graves can also help to instigate a thinking process . " halbe is the best example of the nazi regime 's inhumanity , " he said , adding that he supports plans to include the cemetery in a list of sites where neo-nazi gatherings are prohibited .
" these people were wasted in april 1945 , when the germans had already lost the war . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " 4 unkown war dead , " reads the plate the graves might convince some right-extremist teenagers to rethink their political views .
but visiting cemeteries does n't necessarily turn young germans into active supporters of the organization - something the volksbund badly needs . financial troubles ahead ? it 's losing many of its 220,000 members due to old age , with few new ones signing up to replace them .
officials are starting to worry about how they 'll manage to bring in enough donations to cover annual expenses of 40 million euros -lrb- $ 51 million -rrb- they need to maintain more than 800 cemeteries worldwide .
the german government contributes 4 million euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers attended the ceremony , but will these young men support the volksbund financially ?
" it 's a serious problem , " said fritz kirchmeier , the volksbund 's spokesman .
" you ca n't get 25-year-olds interested in a group that 's focused on the past . " the volksbund 's image as a backwards-looking organization has also done its part in making it suspicious to young germans .
führer said for many years , his organization was criticized for honoring german soldiers as victims of the war . " people said , ' you 're just thinking about your own , " ' führer said .
" the horror caused by the germans naturally and rightly did n't make it easy for us to remember our own suffering . " a willingness to reconcile but that 's changed over the years as germans are beginning to feel more comfortable about mourning their own dead . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " 1 german soldier , " reads the plate " we 're no longer the fascist enemy , we 're partners , " he said , adding that while germans taking care of war cemeteries in western europe were still attacked 50 years ago , they 're now accepted as friends . the situation in eastern europe , where the volksbund became active after the collapse of the soviet union , is also improving .
führer said that plans to set up a cemetery for 80,000 german soldiers near st. petersburg have had a positive reception by and large . " this willingness to reconcile is something we as germans can only be grateful for , " he said . mathis winkler , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tracing soldiers ' fates the " wehrmacht " information office for lost soldiers and prisoners of war was founded in 1939 .

officials for the organization that buries them say that reminding people of the wasted human lives is still relevant today . just half an hour south of berlin , an idyllic pine forest outside the town of halbe stands as a silent reminder of the nazi regime 's monstrosities : more than 23,000 german soldiers who died during the final days of world war ii are buried here .
some , such as alfred boroske , heinz borcherdt or hans-jürgen steltzner were killed before they turned 18 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while east germany 's communist government grudgingly agreed to set up the cemetery , crosses were banned until after reunification covering more than seven hectares -lrb- 17 acres -rrb- , halbe 's soldiers ' cemetery is the largest in germany and will likely keep growing .
some 20,000 men are still believed to lie in the sandy ground around halbe , their lives wasted because german generals refused to capitulate to the soviets , who had already completely surrounded them . construction workers , but also illegal treasure hunters looking for military memorabilia constantly find more skeletons .
the former alert members of germany 's volksbund deutsche kriegsgräberfürsorge , a humanitarian organization that cares for the graves of germany 's war dead , to exhume the bodies .
the latter simply drop off the bones at a shack behind the house of erdmute labes , the local pastor . a proper burial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sixty years after werner seidler 's death , his wife , karla -lrb- right -rrb- finally got a chance to attend his funeral on thursday " every person has a right to a proper burial , " labes said , adding that the funerals for soldiers who died six decades earlier are also important to give closure to relatives and help them find some peace . on thursday , labes and others gathered at halbe 's soldiers ' cemetery to lay to rest 38 recently found bodies , their remains encased in small , black coffins made out of cardboard , a white rose lying on each of them . " why ca n't people learn from this ?
why do n't they understand ? " asked labes as she stood before the open mass grave .
" we can not remind people enough of what happened . " educating the young bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some coffins contain the remains of more than one soldier that 's more important today than ever as the generation that lived through the war is dying out , volksbund officials said . " we show young people what war means , " said reinhard führer , the organization 's president , adding that thousands of teenagers participate in youth camps organized by the volksbund each year .
" it clearly has an effect on them when they read on the grave stones that these were as old as they are now when they died . " reforming neo-nazis while neo-nazis still abuse halbe and other cemeteries as venues to stage demonstrations , führer said the graves can also help to instigate a thinking process . " halbe is the best example of the nazi regime 's inhumanity , " he said , adding that he supports plans to include the cemetery in a list of sites where neo-nazi gatherings are prohibited .
" these people were wasted in april 1945 , when the germans had already lost the war . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " 4 unkown war dead , " reads the plate the graves might convince some right-extremist teenagers to rethink their political views .
but visiting cemeteries does n't necessarily turn young germans into active supporters of the organization - something the volksbund badly needs . financial troubles ahead ? it 's losing many of its 220,000 members due to old age , with few new ones signing up to replace them .
officials are starting to worry about how they 'll manage to bring in enough donations to cover annual expenses of 40 million euros -lrb- $ 51 million -rrb- they need to maintain more than 800 cemeteries worldwide .
the german government contributes 4 million euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers attended the ceremony , but will these young men support the volksbund financially ?
" it 's a serious problem , " said fritz kirchmeier , the volksbund 's spokesman .
" you ca n't get 25-year-olds interested in a group that 's focused on the past . " the volksbund 's image as a backwards-looking organization has also done its part in making it suspicious to young germans .
führer said for many years , his organization was criticized for honoring german soldiers as victims of the war . " people said , ' you 're just thinking about your own , " ' führer said .
" the horror caused by the germans naturally and rightly did n't make it easy for us to remember our own suffering . " a willingness to reconcile but that 's changed over the years as germans are beginning to feel more comfortable about mourning their own dead . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " 1 german soldier , " reads the plate " we 're no longer the fascist enemy , we 're partners , " he said , adding that while germans taking care of war cemeteries in western europe were still attacked 50 years ago , they 're now accepted as friends . the situation in eastern europe , where the volksbund became active after the collapse of the soviet union , is also improving .
führer said that plans to set up a cemetery for 80,000 german soldiers near st. petersburg have had a positive reception by and large . " this willingness to reconcile is something we as germans can only be grateful for , " he said . mathis winkler , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tracing soldiers ' fates the " wehrmacht " information office for lost soldiers and prisoners of war was founded in 1939 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 15.04.2005 schröder isolated in china stance großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder 's staunch support for china is slowly alienating supporters as eu foreign ministers meet friday to discuss the possibility of lifting a 16-year-old arms embargo on china by june , germany 's gerhard schröder finds himself out on a limb in his staunch defense of the plan . chancellor gerhard schröder was largely isolated in the bundestag thursday , when he once again came out in favor of ending the eu embargo , arguing that beijing has changed since the tiananman crackdown and that the sales would help boost trade ties with china , the second-biggest eu trading partner .
" with our policy towards china , we should pursue a long-term relationship with china in all areas , including security policy , " he argued .
" sanctions are designed to isolate and punish .
the german government wants to develop cooperation , which can bring about change . "
an unpopular view but there was plenty of resistance to the chancellor 's proposal .
conservative opposition leader angela merkel said she doubted that ending the embargo would speed up democratization in china , while the spd 's junior coalition partner , the greens , were equally reserved .
" at this point in time , -lrb- we -rrb- do not support lifting the weapons ' embargo against china , " said the greens ' foreign policy spokesman fritz kuhn said .
no common voice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green foreign minister joschka fischer , meanwhile , said he was obliged by eu policy to work towards a consensus on the issue .
but he said china also had to do more .
" i 'm appealing here to the chinese government and the people 's congress to ratify the human rights treaties , " he said .
" that would send out a positive signal . "
the arms embargo is one issue on which the chancellor and his foreign minister have yet to find a common voice .
france and germany have led the push to lift the " outdated " eu arms embargo , rejecting criticism that they are ignoring serious concerns to curry favour with the emerging chinese economic giant .
but wolfgang schäuble , vice chairman of the christian democratic union , stressed that lifting the ban needed to be discussed with the us .
and washington is still firmly opposed to the move .
for now , at the urging of the united states , the european union looks set to agree to keeping the embargo .
luxembourg talks but questions over the 25-member bloc 's plans to end the china arms ban , in place since the 1989 tiananmen square massacre , seem certain to fuel intense debate at the meeting of eu foreign ministers in luxembourg friday .
despite fierce opposition notably from the us and japan , eu leaders last december asked their foreign ministers to work towards lifting the ban by this june , when luxembourg hands over the eu presidency to britain .
the balance of power but the issue has been complicated by china 's adoption last month of an anti-secession law which authorizes the use of force against taiwan if the island moves towards full independence .
washington has warned that an end to the eu ban would upset the balance of power between beijing and taipei .
if an eu decision is not taken by june - an increasingly likely scenario - the issue could be left in limbo until 2006 after the end of britain 's six-month presidency of the eu starting on july 1 .
no decisions are expected from the luxembourg meeting , not least because of the absence of british foreign secretary jack straw , who is unable to attend the meeting in luxembourg on account of an election campaign at home .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a spokeswoman for eu foreign policy chief javier solana -lrb- photo -rrb- said ahead of the talks that , while the eu still plans to lift the ban , the anti-secession law and other issues had " had an impact . "
" it could affect the time line " of when the ban is lifted , she said .
china-japan tension the eu also insists it will put in beef up its own code of conduct on arms sales , while also pushing for china to make a gesture on human right in exchange for lifting the ban .
but on top of the anti-secession law , tensions between china and japan have flared up recently in disputes over their shared wartime past and tokyo 's decision to allow drilling for gas and oil in disputed waters .
" the situation now between china and japan is not contributing " to efforts to make a decision on lifting the embargo , an eu diplomat said . afp / dw-staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu facing damaging split over china while france and germany lead a group of eu countries intent on ending the arms embargo on china , some are becoming nervous due to chinese moves against taiwan and increasing us pressure .
-lrb- march 21 , 2005 -rrb- us , eu on collision course over china two senior members of the united states congress warned the european union this week that the lifting of the 15-year arms embargo on china could result in a halt of us sales in military technology to the eu .
-lrb- march 3 , 2005 -rrb- eu to work toward ending china arms ban at an eu-china summit on wednesday , the eu said now was not the time to lift its arms embargo on china .
however , eu leaders held out the prospect of ending the ban perhaps next year , despite opposition from the us .

" with our policy towards china , we should pursue a long-term relationship with china in all areas , including security policy , " he argued .
" sanctions are designed to isolate and punish .
the german government wants to develop cooperation , which can bring about change . "
an unpopular view but there was plenty of resistance to the chancellor 's proposal .
conservative opposition leader angela merkel said she doubted that ending the embargo would speed up democratization in china , while the spd 's junior coalition partner , the greens , were equally reserved .
" at this point in time , -lrb- we -rrb- do not support lifting the weapons ' embargo against china , " said the greens ' foreign policy spokesman fritz kuhn said .
no common voice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green foreign minister joschka fischer , meanwhile , said he was obliged by eu policy to work towards a consensus on the issue .
but he said china also had to do more .
" i 'm appealing here to the chinese government and the people 's congress to ratify the human rights treaties , " he said .
" that would send out a positive signal . "
the arms embargo is one issue on which the chancellor and his foreign minister have yet to find a common voice .
france and germany have led the push to lift the " outdated " eu arms embargo , rejecting criticism that they are ignoring serious concerns to curry favour with the emerging chinese economic giant .
but wolfgang schäuble , vice chairman of the christian democratic union , stressed that lifting the ban needed to be discussed with the us .
and washington is still firmly opposed to the move .
for now , at the urging of the united states , the european union looks set to agree to keeping the embargo .
luxembourg talks but questions over the 25-member bloc 's plans to end the china arms ban , in place since the 1989 tiananmen square massacre , seem certain to fuel intense debate at the meeting of eu foreign ministers in luxembourg friday .
despite fierce opposition notably from the us and japan , eu leaders last december asked their foreign ministers to work towards lifting the ban by this june , when luxembourg hands over the eu presidency to britain .
the balance of power but the issue has been complicated by china 's adoption last month of an anti-secession law which authorizes the use of force against taiwan if the island moves towards full independence .
washington has warned that an end to the eu ban would upset the balance of power between beijing and taipei .
if an eu decision is not taken by june - an increasingly likely scenario - the issue could be left in limbo until 2006 after the end of britain 's six-month presidency of the eu starting on july 1 .
no decisions are expected from the luxembourg meeting , not least because of the absence of british foreign secretary jack straw , who is unable to attend the meeting in luxembourg on account of an election campaign at home .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a spokeswoman for eu foreign policy chief javier solana -lrb- photo -rrb- said ahead of the talks that , while the eu still plans to lift the ban , the anti-secession law and other issues had " had an impact . "
" it could affect the time line " of when the ban is lifted , she said .
china-japan tension the eu also insists it will put in beef up its own code of conduct on arms sales , while also pushing for china to make a gesture on human right in exchange for lifting the ban .
but on top of the anti-secession law , tensions between china and japan have flared up recently in disputes over their shared wartime past and tokyo 's decision to allow drilling for gas and oil in disputed waters .

conservative opposition leader angela merkel said she doubted that ending the embargo would speed up democratization in china , while the spd 's junior coalition partner , the greens , were equally reserved .
" at this point in time , -lrb- we -rrb- do not support lifting the weapons ' embargo against china , " said the greens ' foreign policy spokesman fritz kuhn said .
no common voice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green foreign minister joschka fischer , meanwhile , said he was obliged by eu policy to work towards a consensus on the issue .
but he said china also had to do more .
" i 'm appealing here to the chinese government and the people 's congress to ratify the human rights treaties , " he said .
" that would send out a positive signal . "
the arms embargo is one issue on which the chancellor and his foreign minister have yet to find a common voice .
france and germany have led the push to lift the " outdated " eu arms embargo , rejecting criticism that they are ignoring serious concerns to curry favour with the emerging chinese economic giant .
but wolfgang schäuble , vice chairman of the christian democratic union , stressed that lifting the ban needed to be discussed with the us .
and washington is still firmly opposed to the move .
for now , at the urging of the united states , the european union looks set to agree to keeping the embargo .
luxembourg talks but questions over the 25-member bloc 's plans to end the china arms ban , in place since the 1989 tiananmen square massacre , seem certain to fuel intense debate at the meeting of eu foreign ministers in luxembourg friday .
despite fierce opposition notably from the us and japan , eu leaders last december asked their foreign ministers to work towards lifting the ban by this june , when luxembourg hands over the eu presidency to britain .
the balance of power but the issue has been complicated by china 's adoption last month of an anti-secession law which authorizes the use of force against taiwan if the island moves towards full independence .
washington has warned that an end to the eu ban would upset the balance of power between beijing and taipei .
if an eu decision is not taken by june - an increasingly likely scenario - the issue could be left in limbo until 2006 after the end of britain 's six-month presidency of the eu starting on july 1 .
no decisions are expected from the luxembourg meeting , not least because of the absence of british foreign secretary jack straw , who is unable to attend the meeting in luxembourg on account of an election campaign at home .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a spokeswoman for eu foreign policy chief javier solana -lrb- photo -rrb- said ahead of the talks that , while the eu still plans to lift the ban , the anti-secession law and other issues had " had an impact . "
" it could affect the time line " of when the ban is lifted , she said .
china-japan tension the eu also insists it will put in beef up its own code of conduct on arms sales , while also pushing for china to make a gesture on human right in exchange for lifting the ban .
but on top of the anti-secession law , tensions between china and japan have flared up recently in disputes over their shared wartime past and tokyo 's decision to allow drilling for gas and oil in disputed waters .
" the situation now between china and japan is not contributing " to efforts to make a decision on lifting the embargo , an eu diplomat said . afp / dw-staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu facing damaging split over china while france and germany lead a group of eu countries intent on ending the arms embargo on china , some are becoming nervous due to chinese moves against taiwan and increasing us pressure .
-lrb- march 21 , 2005 -rrb- us , eu on collision course over china two senior members of the united states congress warned the european union this week that the lifting of the 15-year arms embargo on china could result in a halt of us sales in military technology to the eu .
-lrb- march 3 , 2005 -rrb- eu to work toward ending china arms ban at an eu-china summit on wednesday , the eu said now was not the time to lift its arms embargo on china .
however , eu leaders held out the prospect of ending the ban perhaps next year , despite opposition from the us .

on april 25 , television history will be made in germany when the parliamentary committee investigating the visa affair lets the cameras in on its grilling of foreign minister joschka fischer . when joschka fischer appears before the committee to answer questions about his role in the recent high-profile visa scandal , he 'll be making history . his evidence will be watched by millions of television viewers assessing his every gesture and expression . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : * * jahresrueckblick * * santa barbara county sheriff 's deputy freddy cortez electronically searches michael jackson as he arrives at the santa maria , calif . , courthouse on jan .
16 , 2004 , for his arraignment on child molestation charges .
jackson is charged with seven counts of performing lewd or lascivious acts on a child under 14 and two counts of administering an intoxicating agent .
-lrb- ap photo / kevork djansezian -rrb- but unlike in the us , where televised inquiries and trials have become part of the fabric of popular culture , no cameras or recording equipment have ever been permitted in german parliamentary committee proceedings before . improved transparency the inquiry will look into whether lax visa procedures introduced by the foreign ministry led to massive immigration abuses .
fischer himself has been accused of indirectly allowing thousands of clandestine immigrants from the former soviet bloc - ukraine in particular - to enter germany between 2000 and 2003 after the tourist visa criteria were relaxed . a leading member of the christian democratic union , eckart von klaeden from the visa enquiry committee says he hopes the landmark decision to broadcast fischer 's testimony will ensure greater political transparency . " we want the public to get as authentic an impression of the case as possible , " he explained . is it all just spin ? critics of the plan , however , have said the move marks a further step towards the " americanization " of german politics . " as soon as the cameras are switched on , communication within the committee will transform enormously , " lamented political scientist ulrich sarcinelli in an interview with ap news agency .
" the politicians will know that millions are watching , and will start trying to score brownie points .
the whole process will be overshadowed by their calculated media strategy . " banking on charisma he may have a point .
fischer , long the government 's ace-in-the-hole , has fallen badly out of favor with the voters as of late .
but personal charm has always been his strong point , so what could suit him better than a chance to hog the limelight on prime-time tv ? it was the red-green coalition government itself that requested the live broadcast .
one month ahead of the key state elections in north rhine-westphalia , berlin is hoping that its charismatic foreign minister 's much-touted media finesse will help win over the voters - after recent months saw his seemingly unassailable popularity plummet dramatically . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the details of the revolutionary broadcast will be fleshed out by a government working group over the next few days .
will the cameras be allowed to show the beads of sweat on joschka 's brow , or will they be obliged to maintain a discreet distance ? tune in and find out when fischer tv airs on april 25 . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de an end to superstar fischer ?

" elbe , an experineced diplomat who had served as ambassador to switzerland since july 2003 and had previously served in poland , japan and india , found out on thursday that such comments would not be tolerated by hsi boss .
elbe was recalled from switzerland and removed from his post . the issue against which elbe rebelled arose after it became known that a 2003 posthumous tribute had been paid to franz nüsslein , a convicted war criminal . nüsslein was a former nazi prosecutor in german-occupied czechoslovakia where he was involved in numerous death sentences handed down to the enemies of nazi germany .
after the war , a court in prague sentenced him to 20 years in prison for war crimes , but he was released after serving only seven years . retired ministry employee marga henseler recalled that nüsslein joined the foreign service shortly thereafter and after internal protests , he was shipped off to franco 's spain .
it was henseler who complained to fischer after seeing his obituary , urging him " not to tolerate this . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a long overdue investigation issue long ignored historians have long said that two-thirds of german diplomats were former nazis .
efforts are now underway to open up the ministry 's recent past to public scrutiny , according to klaus scharioth , undersecretary in the foreign ministry . " we need to look into the history of the foreign office under the nazis in a systematic manner , " he said recently .
" foreign minister joschka fischer is currently thinking of establishing an independent panel of historians who would carry out this task . " determined to battle on earlier this year , joschka fischer also refused to pay full tribute to franz krapf , a former ss and nazi party member who later became germany 's ambassador to nato .
fischer 's actions provoked a revolt by some 70 diplomats who publicly accused the foreign minister of applying double standards in a reference to his own past as a leftist militant . although weakened by a different scandal over lax visa regulations , fischer appears determined to battle on in this dispute , which historians say should have reached the public domain long ago .
ministry sources say fischer is now planning an internal reshuffle of posts in what appears to be an effort to finally purge the foreign ministry of the last remnants of nazism . " there is a problem in the ministry in confronting our own understanding of history that we must deal with , " he told tageszeitung , a berlin newspaper . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german diplomats fight over obituaries more than 70 german diplomats have signed a petition to protest foreign minister joschka fischer banning internal death notices that honor colleagues with nazi pasts , according to frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung weekly .

" elbe , an experineced diplomat who had served as ambassador to switzerland since july 2003 and had previously served in poland , japan and india , found out on thursday that such comments would not be tolerated by hsi boss .
elbe was recalled from switzerland and removed from his post . the issue against which elbe rebelled arose after it became known that a 2003 posthumous tribute had been paid to franz nüsslein , a convicted war criminal . nüsslein was a former nazi prosecutor in german-occupied czechoslovakia where he was involved in numerous death sentences handed down to the enemies of nazi germany .
after the war , a court in prague sentenced him to 20 years in prison for war crimes , but he was released after serving only seven years . retired ministry employee marga henseler recalled that nüsslein joined the foreign service shortly thereafter and after internal protests , he was shipped off to franco 's spain .
it was henseler who complained to fischer after seeing his obituary , urging him " not to tolerate this . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a long overdue investigation issue long ignored historians have long said that two-thirds of german diplomats were former nazis .
efforts are now underway to open up the ministry 's recent past to public scrutiny , according to klaus scharioth , undersecretary in the foreign ministry . " we need to look into the history of the foreign office under the nazis in a systematic manner , " he said recently .
" foreign minister joschka fischer is currently thinking of establishing an independent panel of historians who would carry out this task . " determined to battle on earlier this year , joschka fischer also refused to pay full tribute to franz krapf , a former ss and nazi party member who later became germany 's ambassador to nato .
fischer 's actions provoked a revolt by some 70 diplomats who publicly accused the foreign minister of applying double standards in a reference to his own past as a leftist militant . although weakened by a different scandal over lax visa regulations , fischer appears determined to battle on in this dispute , which historians say should have reached the public domain long ago .
ministry sources say fischer is now planning an internal reshuffle of posts in what appears to be an effort to finally purge the foreign ministry of the last remnants of nazism . " there is a problem in the ministry in confronting our own understanding of history that we must deal with , " he told tageszeitung , a berlin newspaper . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german diplomats fight over obituaries more than 70 german diplomats have signed a petition to protest foreign minister joschka fischer banning internal death notices that honor colleagues with nazi pasts , according to frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung weekly .
-lrb- march 28 , 2005 -rrb- historians to probe ministry 's nazi past sixty years after the collapse of the nazi regime , the german foreign ministry plans to look into its controversial postwar history , including allegations that it employed nazi war criminals .

officials for the organization that buries them say that reminding people of the wasted human lives is still relevant today . just half an hour south of berlin , an idyllic pine forest outside the town of halbe stands as a silent reminder of the nazi regime 's monstrosities : more than 23,000 german soldiers who died during the final days of world war ii are buried here .
some , such as alfred boroske , heinz borcherdt or hans-jürgen steltzner were killed before they turned 18 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while east germany 's communist government grudgingly agreed to set up the cemetery , crosses were banned until after reunification covering more than seven hectares -lrb- 17 acres -rrb- , halbe 's soldiers ' cemetery is the largest in germany and will likely keep growing .

" why ca n't people learn from this ?

führer said for many years , his organization was criticized for honoring german soldiers as victims of the war . " people said , ' you 're just thinking about your own , " ' führer said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 15.04.2005 laying germany 's war dead to rest großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : honoring their predecessors sixty years after the end of world war ii , the remains of soldiers are still found in germany .
officials for the organization that buries them say that reminding people of the wasted human lives is still relevant today . just half an hour south of berlin , an idyllic pine forest outside the town of halbe stands as a silent reminder of the nazi regime 's monstrosities : more than 23,000 german soldiers who died during the final days of world war ii are buried here .
some , such as alfred boroske , heinz borcherdt or hans-jürgen steltzner were killed before they turned 18 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while east germany 's communist government grudgingly agreed to set up the cemetery , crosses were banned until after reunification covering more than seven hectares -lrb- 17 acres -rrb- , halbe 's soldiers ' cemetery is the largest in germany and will likely keep growing .
some 20,000 men are still believed to lie in the sandy ground around halbe , their lives wasted because german generals refused to capitulate to the soviets , who had already completely surrounded them . construction workers , but also illegal treasure hunters looking for military memorabilia constantly find more skeletons .
the former alert members of germany 's volksbund deutsche kriegsgräberfürsorge , a humanitarian organization that cares for the graves of germany 's war dead , to exhume the bodies .
the latter simply drop off the bones at a shack behind the house of erdmute labes , the local pastor . a proper burial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sixty years after werner seidler 's death , his wife , karla -lrb- right -rrb- finally got a chance to attend his funeral on thursday " every person has a right to a proper burial , " labes said , adding that the funerals for soldiers who died six decades earlier are also important to give closure to relatives and help them find some peace . on thursday , labes and others gathered at halbe 's soldiers ' cemetery to lay to rest 38 recently found bodies , their remains encased in small , black coffins made out of cardboard , a white rose lying on each of them . " why ca n't people learn from this ?
why do n't they understand ? " asked labes as she stood before the open mass grave .
" we can not remind people enough of what happened . " educating the young bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some coffins contain the remains of more than one soldier that 's more important today than ever as the generation that lived through the war is dying out , volksbund officials said . " we show young people what war means , " said reinhard führer , the organization 's president , adding that thousands of teenagers participate in youth camps organized by the volksbund each year .
" it clearly has an effect on them when they read on the grave stones that these were as old as they are now when they died . " reforming neo-nazis while neo-nazis still abuse halbe and other cemeteries as venues to stage demonstrations , führer said the graves can also help to instigate a thinking process . " halbe is the best example of the nazi regime 's inhumanity , " he said , adding that he supports plans to include the cemetery in a list of sites where neo-nazi gatherings are prohibited .
" these people were wasted in april 1945 , when the germans had already lost the war . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " 4 unkown war dead , " reads the plate the graves might convince some right-extremist teenagers to rethink their political views .
but visiting cemeteries does n't necessarily turn young germans into active supporters of the organization - something the volksbund badly needs . financial troubles ahead ? it 's losing many of its 220,000 members due to old age , with few new ones signing up to replace them .
officials are starting to worry about how they 'll manage to bring in enough donations to cover annual expenses of 40 million euros -lrb- $ 51 million -rrb- they need to maintain more than 800 cemeteries worldwide .
the german government contributes 4 million euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers attended the ceremony , but will these young men support the volksbund financially ?
" it 's a serious problem , " said fritz kirchmeier , the volksbund 's spokesman .
" you ca n't get 25-year-olds interested in a group that 's focused on the past . " the volksbund 's image as a backwards-looking organization has also done its part in making it suspicious to young germans .
führer said for many years , his organization was criticized for honoring german soldiers as victims of the war . " people said , ' you 're just thinking about your own , " ' führer said .
" the horror caused by the germans naturally and rightly did n't make it easy for us to remember our own suffering . " a willingness to reconcile but that 's changed over the years as germans are beginning to feel more comfortable about mourning their own dead . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " 1 german soldier , " reads the plate " we 're no longer the fascist enemy , we 're partners , " he said , adding that while germans taking care of war cemeteries in western europe were still attacked 50 years ago , they 're now accepted as friends . the situation in eastern europe , where the volksbund became active after the collapse of the soviet union , is also improving .
führer said that plans to set up a cemetery for 80,000 german soldiers near st. petersburg have had a positive reception by and large . " this willingness to reconcile is something we as germans can only be grateful for , " he said . mathis winkler , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tracing soldiers ' fates the " wehrmacht " information office for lost soldiers and prisoners of war was founded in 1939 .

on april 25 , television history will be made in germany when the parliamentary committee investigating the visa affair lets the cameras in on its grilling of foreign minister joschka fischer . when joschka fischer appears before the committee to answer questions about his role in the recent high-profile visa scandal , he 'll be making history . his evidence will be watched by millions of television viewers assessing his every gesture and expression . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : * * jahresrueckblick * * santa barbara county sheriff 's deputy freddy cortez electronically searches michael jackson as he arrives at the santa maria , calif . , courthouse on jan .
16 , 2004 , for his arraignment on child molestation charges .
jackson is charged with seven counts of performing lewd or lascivious acts on a child under 14 and two counts of administering an intoxicating agent .
-lrb- ap photo / kevork djansezian -rrb- but unlike in the us , where televised inquiries and trials have become part of the fabric of popular culture , no cameras or recording equipment have ever been permitted in german parliamentary committee proceedings before . improved transparency the inquiry will look into whether lax visa procedures introduced by the foreign ministry led to massive immigration abuses .
fischer himself has been accused of indirectly allowing thousands of clandestine immigrants from the former soviet bloc - ukraine in particular - to enter germany between 2000 and 2003 after the tourist visa criteria were relaxed . a leading member of the christian democratic union , eckart von klaeden from the visa enquiry committee says he hopes the landmark decision to broadcast fischer 's testimony will ensure greater political transparency . " we want the public to get as authentic an impression of the case as possible , " he explained . is it all just spin ? critics of the plan , however , have said the move marks a further step towards the " americanization " of german politics . " as soon as the cameras are switched on , communication within the committee will transform enormously , " lamented political scientist ulrich sarcinelli in an interview with ap news agency .
" the politicians will know that millions are watching , and will start trying to score brownie points .
the whole process will be overshadowed by their calculated media strategy . " banking on charisma he may have a point .
fischer , long the government 's ace-in-the-hole , has fallen badly out of favor with the voters as of late .
but personal charm has always been his strong point , so what could suit him better than a chance to hog the limelight on prime-time tv ? it was the red-green coalition government itself that requested the live broadcast .
one month ahead of the key state elections in north rhine-westphalia , berlin is hoping that its charismatic foreign minister 's much-touted media finesse will help win over the voters - after recent months saw his seemingly unassailable popularity plummet dramatically . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the details of the revolutionary broadcast will be fleshed out by a government working group over the next few days .
will the cameras be allowed to show the beads of sweat on joschka 's brow , or will they be obliged to maintain a discreet distance ? tune in and find out when fischer tv airs on april 25 . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de an end to superstar fischer ?
foreign minister joschka fischer has long been one of germany 's most popular politicians .
but a scandal involving the abuse of tourist visas has dented his reputation and is threatening to unravel his political future .
-lrb- march 3 , 2005 -rrb- former diplomats turn against fischer several ex-diplomats in germany have struck out against their former boss joschka fischer for his role in the visa scandal .
the attacks may mean another nail in the foreign minister 's political coffin .
-lrb- march 30 , 2005 -rrb- fischer fires dissenting diplomat attempts to avoid embarrassing tributes to diplomats who served under the nazis have led to the removal of one long-time diplomat critical of the foreign minister 's handling of the matter .

he is due to testify before a parliamentary commission investigating the scandal on april 25 . dw-world.de fischer fires dissenting diplomat attempts to avoid embarrassing tributes to diplomats who served under the nazis have led to the removal of one long-time diplomat critical of the foreign minister 's handling of the matter .

on april 25 , television history will be made in germany when the parliamentary committee investigating the visa affair lets the cameras in on its grilling of foreign minister joschka fischer . when joschka fischer appears before the committee to answer questions about his role in the recent high-profile visa scandal , he 'll be making history . his evidence will be watched by millions of television viewers assessing his every gesture and expression . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : * * jahresrueckblick * * santa barbara county sheriff 's deputy freddy cortez electronically searches michael jackson as he arrives at the santa maria , calif . , courthouse on jan .
16 , 2004 , for his arraignment on child molestation charges .
jackson is charged with seven counts of performing lewd or lascivious acts on a child under 14 and two counts of administering an intoxicating agent .
-lrb- ap photo / kevork djansezian -rrb- but unlike in the us , where televised inquiries and trials have become part of the fabric of popular culture , no cameras or recording equipment have ever been permitted in german parliamentary committee proceedings before . improved transparency the inquiry will look into whether lax visa procedures introduced by the foreign ministry led to massive immigration abuses .
fischer himself has been accused of indirectly allowing thousands of clandestine immigrants from the former soviet bloc - ukraine in particular - to enter germany between 2000 and 2003 after the tourist visa criteria were relaxed . a leading member of the christian democratic union , eckart von klaeden from the visa enquiry committee says he hopes the landmark decision to broadcast fischer 's testimony will ensure greater political transparency . " we want the public to get as authentic an impression of the case as possible , " he explained . is it all just spin ? critics of the plan , however , have said the move marks a further step towards the " americanization " of german politics . " as soon as the cameras are switched on , communication within the committee will transform enormously , " lamented political scientist ulrich sarcinelli in an interview with ap news agency .
" the politicians will know that millions are watching , and will start trying to score brownie points .
the whole process will be overshadowed by their calculated media strategy . " banking on charisma he may have a point .
fischer , long the government 's ace-in-the-hole , has fallen badly out of favor with the voters as of late .
but personal charm has always been his strong point , so what could suit him better than a chance to hog the limelight on prime-time tv ? it was the red-green coalition government itself that requested the live broadcast .
one month ahead of the key state elections in north rhine-westphalia , berlin is hoping that its charismatic foreign minister 's much-touted media finesse will help win over the voters - after recent months saw his seemingly unassailable popularity plummet dramatically . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the details of the revolutionary broadcast will be fleshed out by a government working group over the next few days .
will the cameras be allowed to show the beads of sweat on joschka 's brow , or will they be obliged to maintain a discreet distance ? tune in and find out when fischer tv airs on april 25 . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de an end to superstar fischer ?
foreign minister joschka fischer has long been one of germany 's most popular politicians .
but a scandal involving the abuse of tourist visas has dented his reputation and is threatening to unravel his political future .
-lrb- march 3 , 2005 -rrb- former diplomats turn against fischer several ex-diplomats in germany have struck out against their former boss joschka fischer for his role in the visa scandal .
the attacks may mean another nail in the foreign minister 's political coffin .

on april 25 , television history will be made in germany when the parliamentary committee investigating the visa affair lets the cameras in on its grilling of foreign minister joschka fischer . when joschka fischer appears before the committee to answer questions about his role in the recent high-profile visa scandal , he 'll be making history . his evidence will be watched by millions of television viewers assessing his every gesture and expression . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : * * jahresrueckblick * * santa barbara county sheriff 's deputy freddy cortez electronically searches michael jackson as he arrives at the santa maria , calif . , courthouse on jan .
16 , 2004 , for his arraignment on child molestation charges .
jackson is charged with seven counts of performing lewd or lascivious acts on a child under 14 and two counts of administering an intoxicating agent .
-lrb- ap photo / kevork djansezian -rrb- but unlike in the us , where televised inquiries and trials have become part of the fabric of popular culture , no cameras or recording equipment have ever been permitted in german parliamentary committee proceedings before . improved transparency the inquiry will look into whether lax visa procedures introduced by the foreign ministry led to massive immigration abuses .
fischer himself has been accused of indirectly allowing thousands of clandestine immigrants from the former soviet bloc - ukraine in particular - to enter germany between 2000 and 2003 after the tourist visa criteria were relaxed . a leading member of the christian democratic union , eckart von klaeden from the visa enquiry committee says he hopes the landmark decision to broadcast fischer 's testimony will ensure greater political transparency . " we want the public to get as authentic an impression of the case as possible , " he explained . is it all just spin ? critics of the plan , however , have said the move marks a further step towards the " americanization " of german politics . " as soon as the cameras are switched on , communication within the committee will transform enormously , " lamented political scientist ulrich sarcinelli in an interview with ap news agency .
" the politicians will know that millions are watching , and will start trying to score brownie points .
the whole process will be overshadowed by their calculated media strategy . " banking on charisma he may have a point .
fischer , long the government 's ace-in-the-hole , has fallen badly out of favor with the voters as of late .
but personal charm has always been his strong point , so what could suit him better than a chance to hog the limelight on prime-time tv ? it was the red-green coalition government itself that requested the live broadcast .
one month ahead of the key state elections in north rhine-westphalia , berlin is hoping that its charismatic foreign minister 's much-touted media finesse will help win over the voters - after recent months saw his seemingly unassailable popularity plummet dramatically . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the details of the revolutionary broadcast will be fleshed out by a government working group over the next few days .
will the cameras be allowed to show the beads of sweat on joschka 's brow , or will they be obliged to maintain a discreet distance ? tune in and find out when fischer tv airs on april 25 . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de an end to superstar fischer ?
foreign minister joschka fischer has long been one of germany 's most popular politicians .
but a scandal involving the abuse of tourist visas has dented his reputation and is threatening to unravel his political future .
-lrb- march 3 , 2005 -rrb- former diplomats turn against fischer several ex-diplomats in germany have struck out against their former boss joschka fischer for his role in the visa scandal .
the attacks may mean another nail in the foreign minister 's political coffin .
-lrb- march 30 , 2005 -rrb- fischer fires dissenting diplomat attempts to avoid embarrassing tributes to diplomats who served under the nazis have led to the removal of one long-time diplomat critical of the foreign minister 's handling of the matter .

" france would cease to exist " " today , our political power alone , within europe , allows us to defend our interests .
if tomorrow we were to vote no , we would no longer have any power , " chirac told a group of 80 young adults picked by the sofres polling institute . " the reality is that you would have 24 countries that voted yes and then the black sheep that blocked everything " , he said . " france would be considerably weakened , " he warned , adding that within europe , " france would cease to exist politically . " chirac also cautioned that " european construction would stop , " adding : " the argument that we could renegotiate -lrb- the treaty -rrb- is not a serious one . " " let 's not be afraid , " he urged the audience . treaty in jeopardy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu symbol over european convention logo and draft treaty on constitution for europe , partial graphic the constitution , which aims to streamline decision-making in the expanded 25-member european union , must be ratified by all member states .
a rejection in france , one of the eu 's largest countries , would effectively kill the treaty . since mid-march , more than a dozen opinion polls have indicated that french voters will reject the constitution in may .
the most recent survey , published thursday , put support for the ' no ' camp at 55 percent . chirac argued that the constitution was necessary to create a " strong and organized " eu which could act as a counterweight to established powers like the united states and emerging states like china , india and russia . " you need rules to be organized .
these rules are in the constitution , " he said . a tool of protest ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french president also implored voters not to turn the referendum into a protest vote against the center-right government 's gradual economic reforms , stubborn unemployment and decreasing purchasing power . " domestic policy has its own rules , rhythms and demands , " he said .
" at the moment when we are about to make a fundamental decision for the future of our country , for the future of europe ...
i do n't want that to be mixed up with the day-to-day politics of a european country , " chirac said . on the issue of turkey 's bid to join the eu , cited in some opinion polls as a reason for french opposition to the constitution , chirac said the two ideas should not be mixed up , as turkey 's possible entry was " 10 , 15 , 20 years " off . " wanting to confuse this issue with the constitution is absolutely either in bad faith or due to rather lightweight reasoning , " the french leader added , while encouraging turkey to pursue democratic reforms . preferential treatment for ' yes ' campaign meanwhile , organizers said some 6000 people attended a ' no ' rally at a central paris theater , taking aim at chirac and other supporters of the european constitution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french anti-globalization activist jose bove criticized chirac 's television appearance as a " media-friendly show with tv presenters , without any real debate . " those in the ' no ' camp had also complained that chirac did not face a political adversary on thursday 's broadcast , claiming the ' yes ' campaign was getting preferential treatment in prime-time viewing hours . chirac 's union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- supports the constitution , as does its ally in government , the union for french democracy -lrb- udf -rrb- . the opposition socialists are officially campaigning for the treaty but riven by an internal split on the issue .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 15.04.2005 joschka fischer gets ready for his close-up großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the cameras be kind ?
on april 25 , television history will be made in germany when the parliamentary committee investigating the visa affair lets the cameras in on its grilling of foreign minister joschka fischer . when joschka fischer appears before the committee to answer questions about his role in the recent high-profile visa scandal , he 'll be making history . his evidence will be watched by millions of television viewers assessing his every gesture and expression . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : * * jahresrueckblick * * santa barbara county sheriff 's deputy freddy cortez electronically searches michael jackson as he arrives at the santa maria , calif . , courthouse on jan .
16 , 2004 , for his arraignment on child molestation charges .
jackson is charged with seven counts of performing lewd or lascivious acts on a child under 14 and two counts of administering an intoxicating agent .
-lrb- ap photo / kevork djansezian -rrb- but unlike in the us , where televised inquiries and trials have become part of the fabric of popular culture , no cameras or recording equipment have ever been permitted in german parliamentary committee proceedings before . improved transparency the inquiry will look into whether lax visa procedures introduced by the foreign ministry led to massive immigration abuses .
fischer himself has been accused of indirectly allowing thousands of clandestine immigrants from the former soviet bloc - ukraine in particular - to enter germany between 2000 and 2003 after the tourist visa criteria were relaxed . a leading member of the christian democratic union , eckart von klaeden from the visa enquiry committee says he hopes the landmark decision to broadcast fischer 's testimony will ensure greater political transparency . " we want the public to get as authentic an impression of the case as possible , " he explained . is it all just spin ? critics of the plan , however , have said the move marks a further step towards the " americanization " of german politics . " as soon as the cameras are switched on , communication within the committee will transform enormously , " lamented political scientist ulrich sarcinelli in an interview with ap news agency .
" the politicians will know that millions are watching , and will start trying to score brownie points .
the whole process will be overshadowed by their calculated media strategy . " banking on charisma he may have a point .
fischer , long the government 's ace-in-the-hole , has fallen badly out of favor with the voters as of late .
but personal charm has always been his strong point , so what could suit him better than a chance to hog the limelight on prime-time tv ? it was the red-green coalition government itself that requested the live broadcast .
one month ahead of the key state elections in north rhine-westphalia , berlin is hoping that its charismatic foreign minister 's much-touted media finesse will help win over the voters - after recent months saw his seemingly unassailable popularity plummet dramatically . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the details of the revolutionary broadcast will be fleshed out by a government working group over the next few days .
will the cameras be allowed to show the beads of sweat on joschka 's brow , or will they be obliged to maintain a discreet distance ? tune in and find out when fischer tv airs on april 25 . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de an end to superstar fischer ?
foreign minister joschka fischer has long been one of germany 's most popular politicians .
but a scandal involving the abuse of tourist visas has dented his reputation and is threatening to unravel his political future .
-lrb- march 3 , 2005 -rrb- former diplomats turn against fischer several ex-diplomats in germany have struck out against their former boss joschka fischer for his role in the visa scandal .
the attacks may mean another nail in the foreign minister 's political coffin .
-lrb- march 30 , 2005 -rrb- fischer fires dissenting diplomat attempts to avoid embarrassing tributes to diplomats who served under the nazis have led to the removal of one long-time diplomat critical of the foreign minister 's handling of the matter .
-lrb- april 15 , 2005 -rrb- feedback do you think cameras should be allowed in government inquiries and trials ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 15.04.2005 monaco buries prince rainier großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rainier left his palace for the last time on friday residents of the tiny principality of monaco bid farewell friday to prince rainier iii , who ruled the state for 56 years .
rainier will rest beside his wife , grace kelly who died in a car accident in 1982 . in spring sunshine a crowd of several hundred watched uniformed members of the royal guard carry rainier 's bier through the black-draped palace gates and along the 200-meter route - across the palace square and down a narrow side street - to the cathedral of st. nicholas . a cannon fired from a fort overlooking the harbor , slow bells chimed and a band played a funeral match to the beat of muffled drums .
a line of penitents - members of a roman catholic order dressed in white and black robes - accompanied the coffin , which was covered with a monegasque banner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : princess stephanie of monaco , right , prince albert , center , and princess caroline of hanover leading the mourners were rainier 's three children by the us actress grace kelly : caroline , albert , who has succeeded him as prince , and stephanie .

on april 25 , television history will be made in germany when the parliamentary committee investigating the visa affair lets the cameras in on its grilling of foreign minister joschka fischer . when joschka fischer appears before the committee to answer questions about his role in the recent high-profile visa scandal , he 'll be making history . his evidence will be watched by millions of television viewers assessing his every gesture and expression . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : * * jahresrueckblick * * santa barbara county sheriff 's deputy freddy cortez electronically searches michael jackson as he arrives at the santa maria , calif . , courthouse on jan .
16 , 2004 , for his arraignment on child molestation charges .
jackson is charged with seven counts of performing lewd or lascivious acts on a child under 14 and two counts of administering an intoxicating agent .
-lrb- ap photo / kevork djansezian -rrb- but unlike in the us , where televised inquiries and trials have become part of the fabric of popular culture , no cameras or recording equipment have ever been permitted in german parliamentary committee proceedings before . improved transparency the inquiry will look into whether lax visa procedures introduced by the foreign ministry led to massive immigration abuses .
fischer himself has been accused of indirectly allowing thousands of clandestine immigrants from the former soviet bloc - ukraine in particular - to enter germany between 2000 and 2003 after the tourist visa criteria were relaxed . a leading member of the christian democratic union , eckart von klaeden from the visa enquiry committee says he hopes the landmark decision to broadcast fischer 's testimony will ensure greater political transparency . " we want the public to get as authentic an impression of the case as possible , " he explained . is it all just spin ? critics of the plan , however , have said the move marks a further step towards the " americanization " of german politics . " as soon as the cameras are switched on , communication within the committee will transform enormously , " lamented political scientist ulrich sarcinelli in an interview with ap news agency .
" the politicians will know that millions are watching , and will start trying to score brownie points .
the whole process will be overshadowed by their calculated media strategy . " banking on charisma he may have a point .
fischer , long the government 's ace-in-the-hole , has fallen badly out of favor with the voters as of late .
but personal charm has always been his strong point , so what could suit him better than a chance to hog the limelight on prime-time tv ? it was the red-green coalition government itself that requested the live broadcast .
one month ahead of the key state elections in north rhine-westphalia , berlin is hoping that its charismatic foreign minister 's much-touted media finesse will help win over the voters - after recent months saw his seemingly unassailable popularity plummet dramatically . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the details of the revolutionary broadcast will be fleshed out by a government working group over the next few days .
will the cameras be allowed to show the beads of sweat on joschka 's brow , or will they be obliged to maintain a discreet distance ? tune in and find out when fischer tv airs on april 25 . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de an end to superstar fischer ?
foreign minister joschka fischer has long been one of germany 's most popular politicians .
but a scandal involving the abuse of tourist visas has dented his reputation and is threatening to unravel his political future .

" elbe , an experineced diplomat who had served as ambassador to switzerland since july 2003 and had previously served in poland , japan and india , found out on thursday that such comments would not be tolerated by hsi boss .
elbe was recalled from switzerland and removed from his post . the issue against which elbe rebelled arose after it became known that a 2003 posthumous tribute had been paid to franz nüsslein , a convicted war criminal . nüsslein was a former nazi prosecutor in german-occupied czechoslovakia where he was involved in numerous death sentences handed down to the enemies of nazi germany .
after the war , a court in prague sentenced him to 20 years in prison for war crimes , but he was released after serving only seven years . retired ministry employee marga henseler recalled that nüsslein joined the foreign service shortly thereafter and after internal protests , he was shipped off to franco 's spain .
it was henseler who complained to fischer after seeing his obituary , urging him " not to tolerate this . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a long overdue investigation issue long ignored historians have long said that two-thirds of german diplomats were former nazis .
efforts are now underway to open up the ministry 's recent past to public scrutiny , according to klaus scharioth , undersecretary in the foreign ministry . " we need to look into the history of the foreign office under the nazis in a systematic manner , " he said recently .
" foreign minister joschka fischer is currently thinking of establishing an independent panel of historians who would carry out this task . " determined to battle on earlier this year , joschka fischer also refused to pay full tribute to franz krapf , a former ss and nazi party member who later became germany 's ambassador to nato .
fischer 's actions provoked a revolt by some 70 diplomats who publicly accused the foreign minister of applying double standards in a reference to his own past as a leftist militant . although weakened by a different scandal over lax visa regulations , fischer appears determined to battle on in this dispute , which historians say should have reached the public domain long ago .
ministry sources say fischer is now planning an internal reshuffle of posts in what appears to be an effort to finally purge the foreign ministry of the last remnants of nazism . " there is a problem in the ministry in confronting our own understanding of history that we must deal with , " he told tageszeitung , a berlin newspaper . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german diplomats fight over obituaries more than 70 german diplomats have signed a petition to protest foreign minister joschka fischer banning internal death notices that honor colleagues with nazi pasts , according to frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung weekly .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 15.04.2005 schröder isolated in china stance großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder 's staunch support for china is slowly alienating supporters as eu foreign ministers meet friday to discuss the possibility of lifting a 16-year-old arms embargo on china by june , germany 's gerhard schröder finds himself out on a limb in his staunch defense of the plan . chancellor gerhard schröder was largely isolated in the bundestag thursday , when he once again came out in favor of ending the eu embargo , arguing that beijing has changed since the tiananman crackdown and that the sales would help boost trade ties with china , the second-biggest eu trading partner .
" with our policy towards china , we should pursue a long-term relationship with china in all areas , including security policy , " he argued .
" sanctions are designed to isolate and punish .
the german government wants to develop cooperation , which can bring about change . "
an unpopular view but there was plenty of resistance to the chancellor 's proposal .
conservative opposition leader angela merkel said she doubted that ending the embargo would speed up democratization in china , while the spd 's junior coalition partner , the greens , were equally reserved .
" at this point in time , -lrb- we -rrb- do not support lifting the weapons ' embargo against china , " said the greens ' foreign policy spokesman fritz kuhn said .
no common voice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green foreign minister joschka fischer , meanwhile , said he was obliged by eu policy to work towards a consensus on the issue .
but he said china also had to do more .
" i 'm appealing here to the chinese government and the people 's congress to ratify the human rights treaties , " he said .
" that would send out a positive signal . "
the arms embargo is one issue on which the chancellor and his foreign minister have yet to find a common voice .
france and germany have led the push to lift the " outdated " eu arms embargo , rejecting criticism that they are ignoring serious concerns to curry favour with the emerging chinese economic giant .
but wolfgang schäuble , vice chairman of the christian democratic union , stressed that lifting the ban needed to be discussed with the us .
and washington is still firmly opposed to the move .
for now , at the urging of the united states , the european union looks set to agree to keeping the embargo .
luxembourg talks but questions over the 25-member bloc 's plans to end the china arms ban , in place since the 1989 tiananmen square massacre , seem certain to fuel intense debate at the meeting of eu foreign ministers in luxembourg friday .
despite fierce opposition notably from the us and japan , eu leaders last december asked their foreign ministers to work towards lifting the ban by this june , when luxembourg hands over the eu presidency to britain .
the balance of power but the issue has been complicated by china 's adoption last month of an anti-secession law which authorizes the use of force against taiwan if the island moves towards full independence .
washington has warned that an end to the eu ban would upset the balance of power between beijing and taipei .
if an eu decision is not taken by june - an increasingly likely scenario - the issue could be left in limbo until 2006 after the end of britain 's six-month presidency of the eu starting on july 1 .
no decisions are expected from the luxembourg meeting , not least because of the absence of british foreign secretary jack straw , who is unable to attend the meeting in luxembourg on account of an election campaign at home .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a spokeswoman for eu foreign policy chief javier solana -lrb- photo -rrb- said ahead of the talks that , while the eu still plans to lift the ban , the anti-secession law and other issues had " had an impact . "
" it could affect the time line " of when the ban is lifted , she said .
china-japan tension the eu also insists it will put in beef up its own code of conduct on arms sales , while also pushing for china to make a gesture on human right in exchange for lifting the ban .
but on top of the anti-secession law , tensions between china and japan have flared up recently in disputes over their shared wartime past and tokyo 's decision to allow drilling for gas and oil in disputed waters .
" the situation now between china and japan is not contributing " to efforts to make a decision on lifting the embargo , an eu diplomat said . afp / dw-staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu facing damaging split over china while france and germany lead a group of eu countries intent on ending the arms embargo on china , some are becoming nervous due to chinese moves against taiwan and increasing us pressure .
-lrb- march 21 , 2005 -rrb- us , eu on collision course over china two senior members of the united states congress warned the european union this week that the lifting of the 15-year arms embargo on china could result in a halt of us sales in military technology to the eu .
-lrb- march 3 , 2005 -rrb- eu to work toward ending china arms ban at an eu-china summit on wednesday , the eu said now was not the time to lift its arms embargo on china .
however , eu leaders held out the prospect of ending the ban perhaps next year , despite opposition from the us .

" with our policy towards china , we should pursue a long-term relationship with china in all areas , including security policy , " he argued .
" sanctions are designed to isolate and punish .
the german government wants to develop cooperation , which can bring about change . "
an unpopular view but there was plenty of resistance to the chancellor 's proposal .
conservative opposition leader angela merkel said she doubted that ending the embargo would speed up democratization in china , while the spd 's junior coalition partner , the greens , were equally reserved .
" at this point in time , -lrb- we -rrb- do not support lifting the weapons ' embargo against china , " said the greens ' foreign policy spokesman fritz kuhn said .
no common voice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green foreign minister joschka fischer , meanwhile , said he was obliged by eu policy to work towards a consensus on the issue .
but he said china also had to do more .
" i 'm appealing here to the chinese government and the people 's congress to ratify the human rights treaties , " he said .
" that would send out a positive signal . "
the arms embargo is one issue on which the chancellor and his foreign minister have yet to find a common voice .
france and germany have led the push to lift the " outdated " eu arms embargo , rejecting criticism that they are ignoring serious concerns to curry favour with the emerging chinese economic giant .
but wolfgang schäuble , vice chairman of the christian democratic union , stressed that lifting the ban needed to be discussed with the us .
and washington is still firmly opposed to the move .
for now , at the urging of the united states , the european union looks set to agree to keeping the embargo .
luxembourg talks but questions over the 25-member bloc 's plans to end the china arms ban , in place since the 1989 tiananmen square massacre , seem certain to fuel intense debate at the meeting of eu foreign ministers in luxembourg friday .
despite fierce opposition notably from the us and japan , eu leaders last december asked their foreign ministers to work towards lifting the ban by this june , when luxembourg hands over the eu presidency to britain .
the balance of power but the issue has been complicated by china 's adoption last month of an anti-secession law which authorizes the use of force against taiwan if the island moves towards full independence .
washington has warned that an end to the eu ban would upset the balance of power between beijing and taipei .
if an eu decision is not taken by june - an increasingly likely scenario - the issue could be left in limbo until 2006 after the end of britain 's six-month presidency of the eu starting on july 1 .
no decisions are expected from the luxembourg meeting , not least because of the absence of british foreign secretary jack straw , who is unable to attend the meeting in luxembourg on account of an election campaign at home .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a spokeswoman for eu foreign policy chief javier solana -lrb- photo -rrb- said ahead of the talks that , while the eu still plans to lift the ban , the anti-secession law and other issues had " had an impact . "
" it could affect the time line " of when the ban is lifted , she said .
china-japan tension the eu also insists it will put in beef up its own code of conduct on arms sales , while also pushing for china to make a gesture on human right in exchange for lifting the ban .
but on top of the anti-secession law , tensions between china and japan have flared up recently in disputes over their shared wartime past and tokyo 's decision to allow drilling for gas and oil in disputed waters .

but he said china also had to do more .
" i 'm appealing here to the chinese government and the people 's congress to ratify the human rights treaties , " he said .
" that would send out a positive signal . "
the arms embargo is one issue on which the chancellor and his foreign minister have yet to find a common voice .
france and germany have led the push to lift the " outdated " eu arms embargo , rejecting criticism that they are ignoring serious concerns to curry favour with the emerging chinese economic giant .
but wolfgang schäuble , vice chairman of the christian democratic union , stressed that lifting the ban needed to be discussed with the us .
and washington is still firmly opposed to the move .
for now , at the urging of the united states , the european union looks set to agree to keeping the embargo .
luxembourg talks but questions over the 25-member bloc 's plans to end the china arms ban , in place since the 1989 tiananmen square massacre , seem certain to fuel intense debate at the meeting of eu foreign ministers in luxembourg friday .
despite fierce opposition notably from the us and japan , eu leaders last december asked their foreign ministers to work towards lifting the ban by this june , when luxembourg hands over the eu presidency to britain .
the balance of power but the issue has been complicated by china 's adoption last month of an anti-secession law which authorizes the use of force against taiwan if the island moves towards full independence .
washington has warned that an end to the eu ban would upset the balance of power between beijing and taipei .
if an eu decision is not taken by june - an increasingly likely scenario - the issue could be left in limbo until 2006 after the end of britain 's six-month presidency of the eu starting on july 1 .
no decisions are expected from the luxembourg meeting , not least because of the absence of british foreign secretary jack straw , who is unable to attend the meeting in luxembourg on account of an election campaign at home .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a spokeswoman for eu foreign policy chief javier solana -lrb- photo -rrb- said ahead of the talks that , while the eu still plans to lift the ban , the anti-secession law and other issues had " had an impact . "
" it could affect the time line " of when the ban is lifted , she said .
china-japan tension the eu also insists it will put in beef up its own code of conduct on arms sales , while also pushing for china to make a gesture on human right in exchange for lifting the ban .
but on top of the anti-secession law , tensions between china and japan have flared up recently in disputes over their shared wartime past and tokyo 's decision to allow drilling for gas and oil in disputed waters .
" the situation now between china and japan is not contributing " to efforts to make a decision on lifting the embargo , an eu diplomat said . afp / dw-staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu facing damaging split over china while france and germany lead a group of eu countries intent on ending the arms embargo on china , some are becoming nervous due to chinese moves against taiwan and increasing us pressure .
-lrb- march 21 , 2005 -rrb- us , eu on collision course over china two senior members of the united states congress warned the european union this week that the lifting of the 15-year arms embargo on china could result in a halt of us sales in military technology to the eu .

however , eu leaders held out the prospect of ending the ban perhaps next year , despite opposition from the us .

" france would cease to exist " " today , our political power alone , within europe , allows us to defend our interests .
if tomorrow we were to vote no , we would no longer have any power , " chirac told a group of 80 young adults picked by the sofres polling institute . " the reality is that you would have 24 countries that voted yes and then the black sheep that blocked everything " , he said . " france would be considerably weakened , " he warned , adding that within europe , " france would cease to exist politically . " chirac also cautioned that " european construction would stop , " adding : " the argument that we could renegotiate -lrb- the treaty -rrb- is not a serious one . " " let 's not be afraid , " he urged the audience . treaty in jeopardy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu symbol over european convention logo and draft treaty on constitution for europe , partial graphic the constitution , which aims to streamline decision-making in the expanded 25-member european union , must be ratified by all member states .
a rejection in france , one of the eu 's largest countries , would effectively kill the treaty . since mid-march , more than a dozen opinion polls have indicated that french voters will reject the constitution in may .
the most recent survey , published thursday , put support for the ' no ' camp at 55 percent . chirac argued that the constitution was necessary to create a " strong and organized " eu which could act as a counterweight to established powers like the united states and emerging states like china , india and russia . " you need rules to be organized .
these rules are in the constitution , " he said . a tool of protest ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french president also implored voters not to turn the referendum into a protest vote against the center-right government 's gradual economic reforms , stubborn unemployment and decreasing purchasing power . " domestic policy has its own rules , rhythms and demands , " he said .
" at the moment when we are about to make a fundamental decision for the future of our country , for the future of europe ...
i do n't want that to be mixed up with the day-to-day politics of a european country , " chirac said . on the issue of turkey 's bid to join the eu , cited in some opinion polls as a reason for french opposition to the constitution , chirac said the two ideas should not be mixed up , as turkey 's possible entry was " 10 , 15 , 20 years " off . " wanting to confuse this issue with the constitution is absolutely either in bad faith or due to rather lightweight reasoning , " the french leader added , while encouraging turkey to pursue democratic reforms . preferential treatment for ' yes ' campaign meanwhile , organizers said some 6000 people attended a ' no ' rally at a central paris theater , taking aim at chirac and other supporters of the european constitution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french anti-globalization activist jose bove criticized chirac 's television appearance as a " media-friendly show with tv presenters , without any real debate . " those in the ' no ' camp had also complained that chirac did not face a political adversary on thursday 's broadcast , claiming the ' yes ' campaign was getting preferential treatment in prime-time viewing hours . chirac 's union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- supports the constitution , as does its ally in government , the union for french democracy -lrb- udf -rrb- . the opposition socialists are officially campaigning for the treaty but riven by an internal split on the issue .

us sports tycoon malcolm glazer 's new plan includes a commitment to provide a £ 20m transfer fund for new players .
he also backs the club 's plans to expand its old trafford stadium .
the manchester united board is expected to spend at least a week looking at the proposals before deciding whether to recommend them to shareholders .
mr glazer and his family currently hold a 28.1 % stake in the club .
he has proposed to pay £ 3 per share , which , at the close of trading on thursday , were trading at £ 2.75 apiece .
once he bought man utd , it would be regarded as an asset just like his caravan parks in florida independent mu supporters ' association see man utd share price the club 's largest shareholders are irish horseracing tycoons john magnier and jp mcmanus , who together hold 28.9 % of the club .
they have maintained that they do not intend launching a takeover attempt of their own and have been thought likely to be tempted by a cash offer for their shares at about £ 3 each if it comes with no strings attached .
manchester united chief executive david gill has previously said £ 3 a share is a fair price for the business .
however , correspondents say the club 's response to mr glazer 's offer will depend on details relating to the financing of the bid , such as how much debt the club might be left with afterwards .
the board will have to decide whether their commitment is just to shareholders or to wider ' stakeholders ' , including supporters weighing man utd 's next move fans ' groups have been strongly opposed to a glazer takeover .
" this talk of a £ 20m sweetener is a total con , " said independent manchester united supporters ' association spokesman mark longden .
" he is borrowing the money anyway , so it is the supporters who will have to pay that back .
" and as for more of the debt being in his name , once he bought manchester united , it would be regarded as an asset just like his caravan parks in florida .
" if he could n't pay back the money he owed , the club would be sold off just like everything else . "

the governing bodies association said admission based on parental choice was " unwelcome , unwise and unworkable . "
the gba 's sir kenneth bloomfield said it would not extend parental choice .
" they will not make it more likely that children and young people will be matched to schools which suit their educational needs , " he said .
consultation on the what will replace the transfer test continues until 30 june .
sir kenneth said the gba did not want a return to an 11-plus system and was not " driven by a desire to protect the interests of grammar schools at the expense of others " .
he said the best way forward was " through a robust and well-informed pupil profile that is shared with potential receiving schools and used to enable the best possible match " .
" it will make these points to the department of education and urge parents and all those interested in the future of education in northern ireland to respond to the consultation process and make their dissatisfaction and dismay with what has been proposed very clear , " he said .
after 2008 , grammar schools will no longer be able to choose pupils on the basis of their academic performance with the end of the transfer test .
the department wants " informed parental and pupil choice " to underpin the new admissions arrangements using a pupil profile .
teachers in 14 primary and four post-primary schools are helping develop pupil profiles which will be easily compiled by schools .
the profiles will track a pupil 's achievements and interests though the whole school career , and they will be ready for use in 2007 .
in january , the department of education published a list of options for what should happen when the 11-plus transfer test ends .
the department said the intelligence of a pupil would not be permitted as a factor .
the decision to abolish the 11-plus transfer test and academic selection in northern ireland was announced in january 2004 .
the announcement was made following consideration of the costello group 's report , a government-appointed working body , set up to suggest alternatives to the transfer tests .

a total of eight viruses , both new strains and variants , emerged and one malicious program , called cabir , was found in a 17th country .
the trend continued in the first two weeks of april with the discovery of the mabir , fontal and hobbes viruses .
but industry experts are playing down the threat from the malicious programs saying that users have to do a lot of things wrong to fall victim to them .
growing threat most of the mobile viruses , worms and trojans are aimed at symbian 's operating system , particularly its series 60 version , largely because it is used on a majority of smartphones .
" the more handsets we see with a common open operating system , the more skill the virus developers have and the more damage they can do , " said tiago alves , spokesman for mobile chip designer arm .
symbian viruses lasco skulls cabir commwarrior drever locknut dampig mabir fontal hobbes some of the viruses will stop a phone working if they are installed , others try to spread from one phone to another via the bluetooth short-range radio service .
getting infected with any of them could mean that users lose phone numbers and contact information that they do not store in any other place than their handset .
" most people do not take back-ups of the data and software they have on their phones , " said marit doving , spokeswoman for symbian .
ms doving said that symbian had been expecting viruses written to attack its software for some time .
she said the company had been working on ways to combat the malicious programs for years so that the phone industry did not suffer the same problems viruses have caused the pc industry .
doving : users need to be responsible with handsets many computer anti-virus firms now produce software that can run on handsets .
educating users to be responsible was a key part of this , she said .
" what 's important now is to make the normal consumer more aware of how he and she can use their telephone in a way that they do not get these problems , " she said .
becoming infected by a mobile virus was still quite difficult , said ms doving .
for instance , to fall victim to the cabir worm users must agree twice to install it and ignore at least one warning message .
although cabir can only spread very slowly via bluetooth it has now been found in 17 countries .
newspaper reports say that mobile phones used by some cab drivers in sydney are infected with it .
ms doving said users needed to be careful about what they installed on their handset .
" it 's a little bit like someone ringing your doorbell , " she said .
" you would n't let that person across the door step without identification . "
hardware-based systems to protect phones are on the way the same caution should be exercised with the add-ons people put on their phones .
clever chips mr alves said the desire to put security software on phones was not going to be driven solely by the growing number of mobile viruses .
but , he said , the growing use of phones to play music and movies which needed to be protected with digital certificates and rights management systems and the growing use of phones as payment mechanisms was kindling interest in security software for handsets .
to this end he said arm had been working on a hardware-based system called trustzone that acts as an overseer for everything that software is doing on a phone .
mr alves said trustzone only lets certain privileged programs make big changes to a phone .
software arriving via bluetooth would be severely restricted in what it could do to a phone , said mr alves , which should help tackle virus problems .
" it 'll help protect the really sensitive user data from a virus , " said mr alves .
the trustzone technology has already been included in arm processor designs and is expected to start appearing in handsets in the next few years .

a total of eight viruses , both new strains and variants , emerged and one malicious program , called cabir , was found in a 17th country .
the trend continued in the first two weeks of april with the discovery of the mabir , fontal and hobbes viruses .
but industry experts are playing down the threat from the malicious programs saying that users have to do a lot of things wrong to fall victim to them .
growing threat most of the mobile viruses , worms and trojans are aimed at symbian 's operating system , particularly its series 60 version , largely because it is used on a majority of smartphones .
" the more handsets we see with a common open operating system , the more skill the virus developers have and the more damage they can do , " said tiago alves , spokesman for mobile chip designer arm .
symbian viruses lasco skulls cabir commwarrior drever locknut dampig mabir fontal hobbes some of the viruses will stop a phone working if they are installed , others try to spread from one phone to another via the bluetooth short-range radio service .
getting infected with any of them could mean that users lose phone numbers and contact information that they do not store in any other place than their handset .
" most people do not take back-ups of the data and software they have on their phones , " said marit doving , spokeswoman for symbian .
ms doving said that symbian had been expecting viruses written to attack its software for some time .
she said the company had been working on ways to combat the malicious programs for years so that the phone industry did not suffer the same problems viruses have caused the pc industry .
doving : users need to be responsible with handsets many computer anti-virus firms now produce software that can run on handsets .
educating users to be responsible was a key part of this , she said .
" what 's important now is to make the normal consumer more aware of how he and she can use their telephone in a way that they do not get these problems , " she said .
becoming infected by a mobile virus was still quite difficult , said ms doving .
for instance , to fall victim to the cabir worm users must agree twice to install it and ignore at least one warning message .
although cabir can only spread very slowly via bluetooth it has now been found in 17 countries .
newspaper reports say that mobile phones used by some cab drivers in sydney are infected with it .
ms doving said users needed to be careful about what they installed on their handset .
" it 's a little bit like someone ringing your doorbell , " she said .
" you would n't let that person across the door step without identification . "
hardware-based systems to protect phones are on the way the same caution should be exercised with the add-ons people put on their phones .
clever chips mr alves said the desire to put security software on phones was not going to be driven solely by the growing number of mobile viruses .
but , he said , the growing use of phones to play music and movies which needed to be protected with digital certificates and rights management systems and the growing use of phones as payment mechanisms was kindling interest in security software for handsets .
to this end he said arm had been working on a hardware-based system called trustzone that acts as an overseer for everything that software is doing on a phone .
mr alves said trustzone only lets certain privileged programs make big changes to a phone .

a total of eight viruses , both new strains and variants , emerged and one malicious program , called cabir , was found in a 17th country .
the trend continued in the first two weeks of april with the discovery of the mabir , fontal and hobbes viruses .
but industry experts are playing down the threat from the malicious programs saying that users have to do a lot of things wrong to fall victim to them .
growing threat most of the mobile viruses , worms and trojans are aimed at symbian 's operating system , particularly its series 60 version , largely because it is used on a majority of smartphones .
" the more handsets we see with a common open operating system , the more skill the virus developers have and the more damage they can do , " said tiago alves , spokesman for mobile chip designer arm .
symbian viruses lasco skulls cabir commwarrior drever locknut dampig mabir fontal hobbes some of the viruses will stop a phone working if they are installed , others try to spread from one phone to another via the bluetooth short-range radio service .
getting infected with any of them could mean that users lose phone numbers and contact information that they do not store in any other place than their handset .
" most people do not take back-ups of the data and software they have on their phones , " said marit doving , spokeswoman for symbian .
ms doving said that symbian had been expecting viruses written to attack its software for some time .
she said the company had been working on ways to combat the malicious programs for years so that the phone industry did not suffer the same problems viruses have caused the pc industry .
doving : users need to be responsible with handsets many computer anti-virus firms now produce software that can run on handsets .
educating users to be responsible was a key part of this , she said .
" what 's important now is to make the normal consumer more aware of how he and she can use their telephone in a way that they do not get these problems , " she said .
becoming infected by a mobile virus was still quite difficult , said ms doving .
for instance , to fall victim to the cabir worm users must agree twice to install it and ignore at least one warning message .
although cabir can only spread very slowly via bluetooth it has now been found in 17 countries .
newspaper reports say that mobile phones used by some cab drivers in sydney are infected with it .
ms doving said users needed to be careful about what they installed on their handset .
" it 's a little bit like someone ringing your doorbell , " she said .
" you would n't let that person across the door step without identification . "
hardware-based systems to protect phones are on the way the same caution should be exercised with the add-ons people put on their phones .
clever chips mr alves said the desire to put security software on phones was not going to be driven solely by the growing number of mobile viruses .
but , he said , the growing use of phones to play music and movies which needed to be protected with digital certificates and rights management systems and the growing use of phones as payment mechanisms was kindling interest in security software for handsets .
to this end he said arm had been working on a hardware-based system called trustzone that acts as an overseer for everything that software is doing on a phone .
mr alves said trustzone only lets certain privileged programs make big changes to a phone .

strong based his portrayal of harry starks on real-life east end villains the 41-year-old londoner played the lead role in the acclaimed adaptation of jake arnott 's best-selling novel .
as harry starks , the gay east end gangster who dreams of entering high society , strong gave a performance dripping with menace that was also tinged with pathos .
but strong faces stiff competition in the best actor category from rhys ifans , michael sheen and newcomer benedict cumberbatch .
ifans is up for his role in not only but always , in which he played peter cook to aidan mcardle 's dudley moore , while sheen is up for dirty filthy love - about a man whose life is affected by obsessive compulsive disorder and tourette 's syndrome .
cumberbatch is nominated for his portrayal of professor stephen hawking in the bbc drama hawking , which charted the scientist 's early years as a phd student at cambridge university .
self-deprecating strong 's nomination - his first bafta nod - follows years of sterling work in such tv dramas as our friends in the north , prime suspect , henry viii and births , marriages and deaths .
ask him to rate his chances on sunday , however , and you get a modest and self-deprecating response .
strong -lrb- second right -rrb- was one of the stars of our friends in the north " i 'd be surprised if i win to tell you the truth , " he says .
" it 's nice that the show gets recognition more than anything else .
we 're all very proud of it . "
and he admits to being gratified by the reaction the drama received from audiences and critics alike .
" my peers have congratulated me while the critics have given it the nod , which i value very highly , " he says .
" and a lot of people who do n't know me very well think i 'm terrifying and probably not to be trusted .
" no-one 's told me they have n't liked it , at least not to my face , " he adds .
" i do n't know - maybe they were worried they 'd get a hot poker in the eye . "
strong refers to the torture method favoured by his long firm character starks , a man he describes as " in the gutter reaching for the stars " .
' repellent ' " a lot of gangster films show you what a gangster does , " he says .
" what was good about this programme was that it showed you what he wanted to become .
" it made a quite repellent character seem attractive and interesting . "
strong will star in roman polankski 's upcoming version of oliver twist the actor had made a good living recently out of repellent characters .
he plays bill sykes ' henchman in roman polanski 's upcoming version of oliver twist and a short-sighted assassin in guy ritchie 's new film , revolver .
strong will also be seen alongside george clooney and matt damon in syriana , a new thriller from the writer of oscar-winning drugs drama traffic .
" it 's a very brave film about america 's involvement in the middle east , " he says .
" i play one of clooney 's cia agents , a third-generation lebanese american who turns on him . "
right now , however , mark has other things on his mind .
" i 've taken some time off to be at home with my good lady and the baby -lrb- five-week-old gabriel -rrb- .
i 'm just being a proud dad at the moment . "
and if he is lucky enough to win a bafta on sunday , do not expect him to have a speech prepared .

" my peers have congratulated me while the critics have given it the nod , which i value very highly , " he says .
" and a lot of people who do n't know me very well think i 'm terrifying and probably not to be trusted .
" no-one 's told me they have n't liked it , at least not to my face , " he adds .
" i do n't know - maybe they were worried they 'd get a hot poker in the eye . "
strong refers to the torture method favoured by his long firm character starks , a man he describes as " in the gutter reaching for the stars " .
' repellent ' " a lot of gangster films show you what a gangster does , " he says .
" what was good about this programme was that it showed you what he wanted to become .
" it made a quite repellent character seem attractive and interesting . "
the actor had made a good living recently out of repellent characters .
he plays bill sykes ' henchman in roman polanski 's upcoming version of oliver twist and a short-sighted assassin in guy ritchie 's new film , revolver .
strong will also be seen alongside george clooney and matt damon in syriana , a new thriller from the writer of oscar-winning drugs drama traffic .
" it 's a very brave film about america 's involvement in the middle east , " he says .
" i play one of clooney 's cia agents , a third-generation lebanese american who turns on him . "
right now , however , mark has other things on his mind .
" i 've taken some time off to be at home with my good lady and the baby -lrb- five-week-old gabriel -rrb- .
i 'm just being a proud dad at the moment . "
and if he is lucky enough to win a bafta on sunday , do not expect him to have a speech prepared .
" i 'm just going to wing it on the evening , " he says .
" i 'm happy to be nominated .
if i were to win it would be the icing on the cake . "

back in 2002 , the anarchic home life of ageing heavy metal icon ozzy osbourne and his squabbling brood seemed a strange subject for a tv show .
but the osbournes proved an instant hit with viewers , reaching a peak audience of eight million and turning ozzy 's wife sharon and their unruly children , kelly and jack , into cult celebrities .
described as " a cross between the simpsons and this is spinal tap " by america 's tv guide magazine , the show derived much of its humour from ozzy 's drug-addled befuddlement at everyday complexities .
the tattooed , former wild man of rock showed an all-too-human side in his inability to deal with modern technology and his annoyance at his family 's menagerie of defecating pets .
and viewers warmed to the deep affection he showed to his formidable spouse , rebellious daughter and petulant son .
early episodes showed ozzy feuding with his neighbours , struggling to install a dvd player and incongruously warning his children off drink and drugs .
influential but subsequent seasons tackled darker material - sharon 's battle with colon cancer , ozzy 's recovery from his 2003 quad bike accident and their children 's substance addictions .
there were also plenty of eye-catching guest appearances from christina aguilera , courtney love and sir elton john , amongst others .
osbourne himself was at a loss to explain its popularity , saying : " i suppose americans get a kick out of watching a crazy brit family like us make complete fools of ourselves every week . "
indeed , america could not get enough of them .
kelly began a pop career , sharon landed her own talk show , and jack made cameo appearances in movies and tv shows .
ozzy , meanwhile , found himself feted by both president bush and the queen , who invited him to perform at her 2002 jubilee pop concert .
but the true influence of the show was felt in the number of imitations that followed in its wake . "
i doubt there 'll ever be anything as amazing as the osbournes " boyd hilton , heat magazine liza minnelli , model anna nicole smith and british boxer chris eubank were just some of the celebrities bitten by the fly-on-the-wall bug .
none enjoyed the same success , perhaps because their lives seemed mundane and rather dull in comparison .
however , another factor may have been their attempts to control and moderate how they were portrayed on screen .
not that the osbournes were blameless in this regard .
their so-called reality programme was often accused of staging events for the camera .
self-referential despite the show 's continued ratings success , there were signs it was nearing the end of its lifespan .
the fourth season opened with a television show about ozzy appearing on sharon 's television show - jarring even by the osbournes ' self-referential standards .
and with jack and kelly planning to move out of their parents ' beverly hills mansion , the producers are probably wise to call it a day .
" i think it 's the right time to go - the show has reached its natural conclusion , " says boyd hilton , tv editor of heat magazine .
" basically , they 're all sick of having cameras following them wherever they go . "
but mr hilton believes the show 's legacy is secure .
" i doubt there 'll ever be anything as amazing as the osbournes .
" it 's been an insight into one of the most bizarre and unusual families you could possibly imagine , who also happen to be very famous .
" it 's the rolls royce of the genre , and it 's set the benchmark for tv shows about famous people . "
your comments fantastic , i love it !
sharon osbourne is amazing !
anon , uk i really liked the osbournes and i am sad to see it go it is one of the funniest shows i have ever seen !
i also have a lot of respect for ozzie and sharon for putting up with having cameras follow them wherever they went .
i am just happy that the producers are ending it now rather than later .
tanner edwards , keenesburg , usa with so many touched by the family warmth of the osbournes , i wonder if family life will improve for those who were moved while viewing - or will it really just be seen as entertainment ?
pete , west mids it was nice to see the true ozzy .
people have always believed he was this devil worship person and now everyone sees he not like that at all .
i 'm glad sharon is finally getting the recognition she deserves for all these years of her hard work , between ozzy 's solo concerts and ozzfest .
coming from a family very similar to the osbournes , it was nice to see that others do wacky crap too .
i will miss my weekly osbourne fix .
denise , piscataway , nj - usa i will admit i have never heard ozzy 's music but what i will say is that the show should go on as i admire the family for allowing the cameras to follow them everywhere .
i think it was a very good show and i loved to watch it every chance i got .
good luck with the future and come back soon please .
pam allwood , liverpool its also good to see a happily married " celeb " couple - far too often tv programs highlight the failings of marriage - nice to see a sometimes rocky but healthy marriage .
it is possible !
rachel , southampton , uk ozzy is a pretty cool fella but really i do n't understand why anyone is interested in his family .
what is the nation 's fascination with sitting in the living room watching people sit in their living room .
get off the couch and do something with your life .
sean , hartlepool this series was a one-off .
a fabulously bonkers family , incredibly dysfunctional , but deeply loving .
in many ways , the osbournes are lovable because of their wealth - people living this way in a council house would soon be branded " neighbours from hell " , so it 's interesting to note that wealth changes people 's attitudes to behaviour .
still , a weird , bizarre , and hysterically funny look at a truly eccentric and often witty family where compassion trumps dysfunction -lrb- almost -rrb- every time .
and i 'm so with ozzy about the pets .
kaz , briton in nj , usa we 've enjoyed the show , but now it 's time to say no more .
it 's been a laugh , it 's been weird , it 's been very different .
good luck ozzy and the crew , we shall miss you all , and if you are ever in nz , call in and say hi .
now that would be a blast : - -rrb- tony weston , auckland , new zealand well , i 'm gutted .
i really enjoyed this show .
it made my day to see pipi the dog and the rest .
i only wish half the families in the uk are as honest as these guys .
we would be in a better place .
sharon parkin , durham , england absolute rubbish !
so pleased that the show has come to an end .
what a vulgar dysfunctional family .
elizabeth , sarnia , ontario going to miss those crazy brits .
love the show and the whole family .
california loves ozzy !
jeanne , santa barbara , california , usa i think that the reason the osbournes were so popular is because we could all see bits of our own family .
my dad swears and does n't " get " electronics , he also shows the same affection like ozzy and sharon .
i think that we 're a relatively normal family .
i think the same about the osbournes , though their " issues " were on a grander scale .
i 'll miss the show only because it showed ozzy in a different light .
jen , niagara , ontario , canada ozzie and sharon have shown folks how to be good parents .
not by trying to make themselves out to be flawless but by always being there for their kids and helping them .
i 'll miss you. br / > slurm mackenzie , scotland the osbournes are fantastic , the show was great and i enjoyed every minute of it .
nothing will come close to matching what they brought to mtv and the world .
uisdean , scotland , uk the loveliest thing about this show was seeing how loving ozzy and sharon were with their kids - watching ozzy 's tenderness almost bought a tear to my eye on a few occasions - that despite all his confusion and drug damage he still absolutely loved his family and was never ashamed to show it - a good role model for any father .
i also loved the way he ' became ' ozzy osbourne once he hit the stage - totally in control for that 90 minute performance just to go back to being befuddled and somewhat dazed once it was over .
mark tidmarsh , brighton , england thank god for that , the show died after the first series .
duffman beers , usa sunday will be the worst day of my life , the osbournes has been the best tv for the last few years , ozzy & sharon are great parents and no one can blame them for kelly & jack for the time they spent in rehab , these things happen but the love in the family is unreal .
here 's hoping the dvds are released soon , that should keep all the fans going for a while !
osbournes i love you and will miss you !
long live the osbournes !
anj , edinburgh , scotland i thought it was fantastic that so many viewers looked past the swearing and ' unconventional ' appearances of the family members and judged them instead on the true love , warmth and affection they regularly showed each other .
if i had a father who was involved in my life as half as much as ozzy was involved in kelly and jack 's , i 'd be chuffed to pieces .
jenny , london , uk all the greatest examples of entertainment seem to follow the old saying : ' quit whilst you 're ahead ' .
thankfully , the osbournes are doing this also .
if only more once-great entertainment ideas followed that code .
-lrb- i 'm thinking big brother and talent spotting shows here , in particular - bbc , you are not entirely without blame !
simon gibson , bradford , england ozzy is my hero and i see him every day on my living room wall !
i will miss the show because it was every real fan 's dream to see how their idol lives .
i admire the whole family especially o & s as they are great music and business role models .
perhaps now he has more time on his hands he will be able to do his own headline gigs .
catherine parr , glasgow , scotland people have a tendency to see situations in terms of them and us .
my sixth-formers often talk about the " revelation " that teachers are normal people with ordinary lives .
so too with the osbournes , its value is that it shows stars as normal human beings even if elements of their lifestyle are extraordinary .
it 's not bad for demonstrating the perils of major substance abuse either .
nick hersey , hitchin uk the osbournes was great tv and i will miss it , but i think the time was right to finish and go out on a high note .
a lot of it made me laugh out aloud but the more emotional moments made me remember about the connection that we all have to our loved ones and that we should look out for each other .
it was n't vulgar or distasteful , just very true to life and very good .
much respect to ozzy , sharon , kelly and jack chris hampton , horsham , west sussex , uk i do wonder how many american think all british families are like the osbournes - that is assuming they have n't claimed ozzy et al for themselves yet .
thomas steuart-feilding , bristol , uk in a world where we have the ' chavs ' ... it does n't surprise me one bit when we have a dysfunctional family like the osbournes as a role model family ?
alyson , london as i read somewhere : people now will see ozzy 's records on the stores and say " look the bloke on tv released a cd " .
respect to oz and family .
i will miss you .
stelios , london , uk despite what people who probably have n't even seen the show think , ozzy is a good role model for fathers .
my father does n't put his arm round me while he sits with me watching tv and i 'm sure that very few do , such is male bravado but ozzy has no qualms about putting his arm around his 19 year old son jack .
if only people hugged each other more often i 'm sure the world would be a much better place .
billy holmes , paisley , scotland i thought the show was vulgar and distasteful .
delroy mcfairlaine , auckland , new zealand you ca n't blame them for knocking it on the head , but i for one will miss them .
i think the success of the osbournes comes from the warmth that underpins the families lives , dysfunctions and all .
it 's there to see in every episode , and it 's what turns something rather silly into totally compelling television .
it 's also very british and very american at the same time , a blend only the osbournes have got right .
kelly 's new single is astonishingly good too .
marc burrows , loughborough , leicester the prince of darkness turns off the lights .

described as " a cross between the simpsons and this is spinal tap " by america 's tv guide magazine , the show derived much of its humour from ozzy 's drug-addled befuddlement at everyday complexities .
the tattooed , former wild man of rock showed an all-too-human side in his inability to deal with modern technology and his annoyance at his family 's menagerie of defecating pets .
and viewers warmed to the deep affection he showed to his formidable spouse , rebellious daughter and petulant son .
early episodes showed ozzy feuding with his neighbours , struggling to install a dvd player and incongruously warning his children off drink and drugs .
influential but subsequent seasons tackled darker material - sharon 's battle with colon cancer , ozzy 's recovery from his 2003 quad bike accident and their children 's substance addictions .
there were also plenty of eye-catching guest appearances from christina aguilera , courtney love and sir elton john , amongst others .
sharon and ozzy osbourne became pop culture celebrities osbourne himself was at a loss to explain its popularity , saying : " i suppose americans get a kick out of watching a crazy brit family like us make complete fools of ourselves every week . "
indeed , america could not get enough of them .
kelly began a pop career , sharon landed her own talk show , and jack made cameo appearances in movies and tv shows .
ozzy , meanwhile , found himself feted by both president bush and the queen , who invited him to perform at her 2002 jubilee pop concert .
but the true influence of the show was felt in the number of imitations that followed in its wake .
i doubt there 'll ever be anything as amazing as the osbournes boyd hilton , heat magazine liza minnelli , model anna nicole smith and british boxer chris eubank were just some of the celebrities bitten by the fly-on-the-wall bug .
none enjoyed the same success , perhaps because their lives seemed mundane and rather dull in comparison .
however , another factor may have been their attempts to control and moderate how they were portrayed on screen .
not that the osbournes were blameless in this regard .
their so-called reality programme was often accused of staging events for the camera .
self-referential despite the show 's continued ratings success , there were signs it was nearing the end of its lifespan .
the fourth season opened with a television show about ozzy appearing on sharon 's television show - jarring even by the osbournes ' self-referential standards .
and with jack and kelly planning to move out of their parents ' beverly hills mansion , the producers are probably wise to call it a day .
" i think it 's the right time to go - the show has reached its natural conclusion , " says boyd hilton , tv editor of heat magazine .
" basically , they 're all sick of having cameras following them wherever they go . "
but mr hilton believes the show 's legacy is secure .
" i doubt there 'll ever be anything as amazing as the osbournes .
" it 's been an insight into one of the most bizarre and unusual families you could possibly imagine , who also happen to be very famous .
" it 's the rolls royce of the genre , and it 's set the benchmark for tv shows about famous people . "
your comments fantastic , i love it !
sharon osbourne is amazing !
anon , uk i really liked the osbournes and i am sad to see it go it is one of the funniest shows i have ever seen !
i also have a lot of respect for ozzie and sharon for putting up with having cameras follow them wherever they went .
i am just happy that the producers are ending it now rather than later .
tanner edwards , keenesburg , usa with so many touched by the family warmth of the osbournes , i wonder if family life will improve for those who were moved while viewing - or will it really just be seen as entertainment ?
pete , west mids it was nice to see the true ozzy .
people have always believed he was this devil worship person and now everyone sees he not like that at all .
i 'm glad sharon is finally getting the recognition she deserves for all these years of her hard work , between ozzy 's solo concerts and ozzfest .
coming from a family very similar to the osbournes , it was nice to see that others do wacky crap too .
i will miss my weekly osbourne fix .
denise , piscataway , nj - usa i will admit i have never heard ozzy 's music but what i will say is that the show should go on as i admire the family for allowing the cameras to follow them everywhere .
i think it was a very good show and i loved to watch it every chance i got .
good luck with the future and come back soon please .
pam allwood , liverpool its also good to see a happily married " celeb " couple - far too often tv programs highlight the failings of marriage - nice to see a sometimes rocky but healthy marriage .
it is possible !
rachel , southampton , uk ozzy is a pretty cool fella but really i do n't understand why anyone is interested in his family .
what is the nation 's fascination with sitting in the living room watching people sit in their living room .
get off the couch and do something with your life .
sean , hartlepool this series was a one-off .
a fabulously bonkers family , incredibly dysfunctional , but deeply loving .
in many ways , the osbournes are lovable because of their wealth - people living this way in a council house would soon be branded " neighbours from hell " , so it 's interesting to note that wealth changes people 's attitudes to behaviour .
still , a weird , bizarre , and hysterically funny look at a truly eccentric and often witty family where compassion trumps dysfunction -lrb- almost -rrb- every time .
and i 'm so with ozzy about the pets .
kaz , briton in nj , usa we 've enjoyed the show , but now it 's time to say no more .
it 's been a laugh , it 's been weird , it 's been very different .
good luck ozzy and the crew , we shall miss you all , and if you are ever in nz , call in and say hi .
now that would be a blast : - -rrb- tony weston , auckland , new zealand well , i 'm gutted .
i really enjoyed this show .
it made my day to see pipi the dog and the rest .
i only wish half the families in the uk are as honest as these guys .
we would be in a better place .
sharon parkin , durham , england absolute rubbish !
so pleased that the show has come to an end .
what a vulgar dysfunctional family .
elizabeth , sarnia , ontario going to miss those crazy brits .
love the show and the whole family .
california loves ozzy !
jeanne , santa barbara , california , usa i think that the reason the osbournes were so popular is because we could all see bits of our own family .
my dad swears and does n't " get " electronics , he also shows the same affection like ozzy and sharon .
i think that we 're a relatively normal family .
i think the same about the osbournes , though their " issues " were on a grander scale .
i 'll miss the show only because it showed ozzy in a different light .
jen , niagara , ontario , canada ozzie and sharon have shown folks how to be good parents .
not by trying to make themselves out to be flawless but by always being there for their kids and helping them .
i 'll miss you. br / > slurm mackenzie , scotland the osbournes are fantastic , the show was great and i enjoyed every minute of it .
nothing will come close to matching what they brought to mtv and the world .
uisdean , scotland , uk the loveliest thing about this show was seeing how loving ozzy and sharon were with their kids - watching ozzy 's tenderness almost bought a tear to my eye on a few occasions - that despite all his confusion and drug damage he still absolutely loved his family and was never ashamed to show it - a good role model for any father .
i also loved the way he ' became ' ozzy osbourne once he hit the stage - totally in control for that 90 minute performance just to go back to being befuddled and somewhat dazed once it was over .
mark tidmarsh , brighton , england thank god for that , the show died after the first series .
duffman beers , usa sunday will be the worst day of my life , the osbournes has been the best tv for the last few years , ozzy & sharon are great parents and no one can blame them for kelly & jack for the time they spent in rehab , these things happen but the love in the family is unreal .
here 's hoping the dvds are released soon , that should keep all the fans going for a while !
osbournes i love you and will miss you !
long live the osbournes !
anj , edinburgh , scotland i thought it was fantastic that so many viewers looked past the swearing and ' unconventional ' appearances of the family members and judged them instead on the true love , warmth and affection they regularly showed each other .
if i had a father who was involved in my life as half as much as ozzy was involved in kelly and jack 's , i 'd be chuffed to pieces .
jenny , london , uk all the greatest examples of entertainment seem to follow the old saying : ' quit whilst you 're ahead ' .
thankfully , the osbournes are doing this also .
if only more once-great entertainment ideas followed that code .
-lrb- i 'm thinking big brother and talent spotting shows here , in particular - bbc , you are not entirely without blame !
simon gibson , bradford , england ozzy is my hero and i see him every day on my living room wall !
i will miss the show because it was every real fan 's dream to see how their idol lives .
i admire the whole family especially o & s as they are great music and business role models .
perhaps now he has more time on his hands he will be able to do his own headline gigs .
catherine parr , glasgow , scotland people have a tendency to see situations in terms of them and us .
my sixth-formers often talk about the " revelation " that teachers are normal people with ordinary lives .
so too with the osbournes , its value is that it shows stars as normal human beings even if elements of their lifestyle are extraordinary .
it 's not bad for demonstrating the perils of major substance abuse either .
nick hersey , hitchin uk the osbournes was great tv and i will miss it , but i think the time was right to finish and go out on a high note .
a lot of it made me laugh out aloud but the more emotional moments made me remember about the connection that we all have to our loved ones and that we should look out for each other .
it was n't vulgar or distasteful , just very true to life and very good .
much respect to ozzy , sharon , kelly and jack chris hampton , horsham , west sussex , uk i do wonder how many american think all british families are like the osbournes - that is assuming they have n't claimed ozzy et al for themselves yet .
thomas steuart-feilding , bristol , uk in a world where we have the ' chavs ' ... it does n't surprise me one bit when we have a dysfunctional family like the osbournes as a role model family ?
alyson , london as i read somewhere : people now will see ozzy 's records on the stores and say " look the bloke on tv released a cd " .
respect to oz and family .
i will miss you .
stelios , london , uk despite what people who probably have n't even seen the show think , ozzy is a good role model for fathers .
my father does n't put his arm round me while he sits with me watching tv and i 'm sure that very few do , such is male bravado but ozzy has no qualms about putting his arm around his 19 year old son jack .
if only people hugged each other more often i 'm sure the world would be a much better place .
billy holmes , paisley , scotland i thought the show was vulgar and distasteful .
delroy mcfairlaine , auckland , new zealand you ca n't blame them for knocking it on the head , but i for one will miss them .
i think the success of the osbournes comes from the warmth that underpins the families lives , dysfunctions and all .
it 's there to see in every episode , and it 's what turns something rather silly into totally compelling television .
it 's also very british and very american at the same time , a blend only the osbournes have got right .
kelly 's new single is astonishingly good too .

a fabulously bonkers family , incredibly dysfunctional , but deeply loving .
in many ways , the osbournes are lovable because of their wealth - people living this way in a council house would soon be branded " neighbours from hell " , so it 's interesting to note that wealth changes people 's attitudes to behaviour .

kaz , briton in nj , usa we 've enjoyed the show , but now it 's time to say no more .

uisdean , scotland , uk the loveliest thing about this show was seeing how loving ozzy and sharon were with their kids - watching ozzy 's tenderness almost bought a tear to my eye on a few occasions - that despite all his confusion and drug damage he still absolutely loved his family and was never ashamed to show it - a good role model for any father .
i also loved the way he ' became ' ozzy osbourne once he hit the stage - totally in control for that 90 minute performance just to go back to being befuddled and somewhat dazed once it was over .

eight million people watched the osbournes at its peak back in 2002 , the anarchic home life of ageing heavy metal icon ozzy osbourne and his squabbling brood seemed a strange subject for a tv show .
but the osbournes proved an instant hit with viewers , reaching a peak audience of eight million and turning ozzy 's wife sharon and their unruly children , kelly and jack , into cult celebrities .
described as " a cross between the simpsons and this is spinal tap " by america 's tv guide magazine , the show derived much of its humour from ozzy 's drug-addled befuddlement at everyday complexities .
the tattooed , former wild man of rock showed an all-too-human side in his inability to deal with modern technology and his annoyance at his family 's menagerie of defecating pets .
and viewers warmed to the deep affection he showed to his formidable spouse , rebellious daughter and petulant son .
early episodes showed ozzy feuding with his neighbours , struggling to install a dvd player and incongruously warning his children off drink and drugs .
influential but subsequent seasons tackled darker material - sharon 's battle with colon cancer , ozzy 's recovery from his 2003 quad bike accident and their children 's substance addictions .
there were also plenty of eye-catching guest appearances from christina aguilera , courtney love and sir elton john , amongst others .
sharon and ozzy osbourne became pop culture celebrities osbourne himself was at a loss to explain its popularity , saying : " i suppose americans get a kick out of watching a crazy brit family like us make complete fools of ourselves every week . "
indeed , america could not get enough of them .
kelly began a pop career , sharon landed her own talk show , and jack made cameo appearances in movies and tv shows .
ozzy , meanwhile , found himself feted by both president bush and the queen , who invited him to perform at her 2002 jubilee pop concert .
but the true influence of the show was felt in the number of imitations that followed in its wake .
i doubt there 'll ever be anything as amazing as the osbournes boyd hilton , heat magazine liza minnelli , model anna nicole smith and british boxer chris eubank were just some of the celebrities bitten by the fly-on-the-wall bug .
none enjoyed the same success , perhaps because their lives seemed mundane and rather dull in comparison .
however , another factor may have been their attempts to control and moderate how they were portrayed on screen .
not that the osbournes were blameless in this regard .
their so-called reality programme was often accused of staging events for the camera .
self-referential despite the show 's continued ratings success , there were signs it was nearing the end of its lifespan .
the fourth season opened with a television show about ozzy appearing on sharon 's television show - jarring even by the osbournes ' self-referential standards .
and with jack and kelly planning to move out of their parents ' beverly hills mansion , the producers are probably wise to call it a day .
" i think it 's the right time to go - the show has reached its natural conclusion , " says boyd hilton , tv editor of heat magazine .
" basically , they 're all sick of having cameras following them wherever they go . "
but mr hilton believes the show 's legacy is secure .
" i doubt there 'll ever be anything as amazing as the osbournes .
" it 's been an insight into one of the most bizarre and unusual families you could possibly imagine , who also happen to be very famous .
" it 's the rolls royce of the genre , and it 's set the benchmark for tv shows about famous people . "
your comments fantastic , i love it !
sharon osbourne is amazing !
anon , uk i really liked the osbournes and i am sad to see it go it is one of the funniest shows i have ever seen !
i also have a lot of respect for ozzie and sharon for putting up with having cameras follow them wherever they went .
i am just happy that the producers are ending it now rather than later .
tanner edwards , keenesburg , usa with so many touched by the family warmth of the osbournes , i wonder if family life will improve for those who were moved while viewing - or will it really just be seen as entertainment ?
pete , west mids it was nice to see the true ozzy .
people have always believed he was this devil worship person and now everyone sees he not like that at all .
i 'm glad sharon is finally getting the recognition she deserves for all these years of her hard work , between ozzy 's solo concerts and ozzfest .
coming from a family very similar to the osbournes , it was nice to see that others do wacky crap too .
i will miss my weekly osbourne fix .

a station spokesman told the bbc the channel , al-jazeera live , is the first of its kind in the arab world .

" i used to be excellent , " she said .
" but now i have a baby and i could n't tell you what day it is . "
the hollywood star also revealed that some of her male co-stars have been " a real pain in the ass " .
paltrow , who gave birth to daughter apple in may 2004 , was speaking to students at london 's central saint martins drama centre on thursday .
the actress discussed the differences between stage and film acting with the centre 's director vladimir mirodan .
" in the theatre you need a sense of security , but in film you do n't want it , " she said .
i do n't like to watch myself on screen - it makes me freak out gwyneth paltrow " film is all about capturing the moment .
you must have spontaneity ; otherwise you can see the wheels grinding . "
she also revealed the difficulties involved working with jude law on sky captain and the world of tomorrow , which used computerised imagery instead of sets .
" it 's a strange experience , " she said .
" you 're trying to make things as real as possible , so it 's daunting when it 's so glaringly obvious it 's all pretend . "
' insecurity ' selected clips from sliding doors , shakespeare in love and hook , one of her first films , were greeted with mock horror by the 32-year-old .
" i wish i did n't repulse myself so much , " she said .
" i do n't like to watch myself on screen - it makes me freak out . "
paltrow starred with jude law in sky captain and the world of tomorrow she also explained that her sensitive nature can make her vulnerable on set .
" i do n't know if it 's a blessing or a curse , " she said .
" if i walk into a room and somebody is in a bad mood or upset i can feel it .
" i end up taking it personally when it 's nothing to do with me .
maybe it 's just old-fashioned narcissism . "
and without naming names , she revealed that two of her male co-stars had been difficult to work with .
" it has to do with their insecurity , " she said .
" it 's about managing this other person and making them feel they 're okay and that you know your place .
" with one guy , managing him was my primary job , " she continued .
paltrow recently returned to work to star in running with scissors , in which she plays the daughter of a psychiatrist with mental problems .
