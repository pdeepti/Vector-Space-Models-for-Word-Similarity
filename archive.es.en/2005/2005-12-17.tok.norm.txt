" we are looking at -lrb- possible -rrb- measures at the level of the un , " thomas de maizieres , chief of staff of german chancellor angela merkel , told the welt am sonntag newspaper . iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has caused international outrage with a series of anti-israeli and anti-jewish remarks , in the course of which he has said israel - described as a tumor - should be wiped off the map , or moved to europe , and cast doubt on whether the mass extermination of jews in nazi germany ever happened . but , de maizieres said , germany would only take such a step if there was " clear " agreement from its european union partners .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 17.12.2005 merkel makes her mark as mediator in eu budget deal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has started making a name for herself in brussels german chancellor angela merkel appears to have been one of the chief reasons the eu managed to agree on a budget deal during two days of haggling at a brussels summit . the eu finally announced it had found a compromise on the bloc 's 2007 to 2013 budget in the early hours of saturday morning .
britain said it would cut 10.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 12.57 billion -rrb- off its jealously-guarded budget rebate , with funds being shifted towards the poorer mainly former communist countries that joined the eu last year .
france agreed to drop resistance to a spending review that could reduce its agricultural subsidies .
the 25 member states also decided to boost budget by nearly 862.4 billion euros .
" the long wait was worth it , " said germany 's merkel .
it was her first eu summit as chancellor and , many officials said she played a key mediating role .
" i am convinced ... we have concluded a good agreement for europe 's future , a signal of hope for european development , " she added .
" merkel played an extraordinarily important role behind the scenes , " said austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel .
" she has acted calm , sober and very professional . " romanian president traian basescu said : " she brokered the deal from start to finish .
she was the first to break the deadlock with a proposal . "
merkel has played a very constructive role , " a european diplomat told reuters .
" the absence of -lrb- former german chancellor gerhard -rrb- schröder and his unquestioning support of chirac has meant the french president has to be more careful . "
germany compromises , too but merkel gave way too , announcing germany would be prepared to do without 100 million euros which would instead come to the aid of poland 's poorest regions .
polish prime minister kazimierz marcinkiewicz described merkel 's actions as the " a wonderful gesture of solidarity " as he celebrated the deal .
" the taste of victory is as good as the finest french champagne , " he pronounced .
" every fifth euro will be spent on poland , " he told journalists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair 's tough stance on the british rebate was the main sticking point british prime minister tony blair , who was charged with brokering the deal in his role as eu president , also lauded the plans .
" this is an agreement that allows europe to move forward , " he said .
" if we believe in enlargement , we had to do this deal now .
if we 'd failed to reach an agreement at all , i think that europe would have been in a very severe crisis . " his comments were echoed by french president jacques chirac , his perennial summit sparring partner , who also said the deal was " a good accord for europe , which gives it the means necessary to fund its ambitions . " " once again , the crisis has been resolved , " chirac added , saying the deal had met french requirements .
" europe is now marching forward again , " he said .
barroso wanted more accord on the budget plans had been blocked chiefly by britain 's refusal to give more ground on the eu rebate which then-prime minister margaret thatcher famously secured in 1984 . the other main sticking point was france 's resistance to calls for a major reform of the eu 's long-disputed farm subsidy system , of which it is the main beneficiary . another apparent mediator , luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , said that unlike during his country 's turn at the presidency , which failed in june to get an accord , " this time all delegations attending the meeting were ready to take a decision . " european commission head jose manuel barroso admitted that the deal , which represents 1.045 percent of eu-wide gross national income , was not as big as the budget initially sought by his eu executive team .

ten years ago this week , the european court of justice handed down a ruling that revolutionized european soccer .

15 , 1995 , the european court of justice handed the reins of power from the clubs to the players by ruling that the belgian jean-marc bosman could move from club de liege to dunkerque - without his team 's permission . the ruling had vast consequences , and not just for liege . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the judges decreed that european soccer players were free to move about previously , clubs were allowed to sign only a limited number of foreign players , a regulation that was particularly harsh towards english teams who had to count scottish , welsh and northern irish players as " foreign " because they have their own independent soccer federations . the court struck down this clause , throwing the doors wide open for transfers within europe . the richer european clubs then started going shopping around the continent to stock up on players .
salaries rose dramatically as the number of teams competing for the top names in germany expanded beyond bayern munich and borussia dortmund . clubs with deep pockets like real madrid , ac milan and barcelona were bidding for players around the continent , forcing teams to be very careful of whom they signed . if a big signing got hurt , did n't fit in the club or just simply failed to perform during his contract , teams were stuck with huge financial burdens , such as was the case with dortmund after winning the 2001-02 title . small clubs lose important source of revenue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wanting to play at the top , borussia dortmund almost deflated itself into bankruptcy while the richer seemed only to get richer despite the occasional poor signing , the smaller clubs , who were originally feeders for their bigger brothers , lost a vital source of revenue .

if a promising player 's contract was set to expire at the end of the season , he would be snapped up by someone else , and the poorer club would walk away empty-handed . robbing talent naturally , potential stars hardly ever plan to remain with unremarkable clubs like sportfreunde siegen , unterhaching or energie cottbus throughout their whole careers ; the attraction of playing for bayern munich , schalke or stuttgart is simply too great . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will cologne 's lukas podolski -lrb- l -rrb- run to bayern munich ?
in a nasty twist , the superstar in a small market could be purchased by a team just to rob the smaller club of its best player .
there is no lack of speculation around the bundesliga that bayern would like german international lukas podolski from cologne for just this reason .
how much truth there is to such rumors is hard to judge concerning how poorly cologne are faring this season . where will ballack end up ? ballack will reap the benefits of bosman 's now monumental five-year court struggle to change clubs .
ballack and his agent michael becker have been fishing the european waters for the club that will give him that necessary push to become a player of enormous quality . bayern munich 's management may be cursing bosman but general manager uli hoeness knew this could happen .

bayern munich signed paraguayan midfielder julio dos santos this week to one day fill the shoes of ballack who looks to be on his way out .
but it 's no problem for ballack , whose contract expires in june 2006 . more than a decade ago , the club 's star would not have been able to leave his team so easily .
but on dec .
15 , 1995 , the european court of justice handed the reins of power from the clubs to the players by ruling that the belgian jean-marc bosman could move from club de liege to dunkerque - without his team 's permission . the ruling had vast consequences , and not just for liege . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the judges decreed that european soccer players were free to move about previously , clubs were allowed to sign only a limited number of foreign players , a regulation that was particularly harsh towards english teams who had to count scottish , welsh and northern irish players as " foreign " because they have their own independent soccer federations . the court struck down this clause , throwing the doors wide open for transfers within europe . the richer european clubs then started going shopping around the continent to stock up on players .
salaries rose dramatically as the number of teams competing for the top names in germany expanded beyond bayern munich and borussia dortmund . clubs with deep pockets like real madrid , ac milan and barcelona were bidding for players around the continent , forcing teams to be very careful of whom they signed . if a big signing got hurt , did n't fit in the club or just simply failed to perform during his contract , teams were stuck with huge financial burdens , such as was the case with dortmund after winning the 2001-02 title . small clubs lose important source of revenue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wanting to play at the top , borussia dortmund almost deflated itself into bankruptcy while the richer seemed only to get richer despite the occasional poor signing , the smaller clubs , who were originally feeders for their bigger brothers , lost a vital source of revenue .
earlier , teams like freiburg , duisburg and bielefeld could nurture younger players to fruition and then cash in on transfer fees at any point . post-bosman , they had to fear for their lives .
if a promising player 's contract was set to expire at the end of the season , he would be snapped up by someone else , and the poorer club would walk away empty-handed . robbing talent naturally , potential stars hardly ever plan to remain with unremarkable clubs like sportfreunde siegen , unterhaching or energie cottbus throughout their whole careers ; the attraction of playing for bayern munich , schalke or stuttgart is simply too great . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will cologne 's lukas podolski -lrb- l -rrb- run to bayern munich ?
in a nasty twist , the superstar in a small market could be purchased by a team just to rob the smaller club of its best player .
there is no lack of speculation around the bundesliga that bayern would like german international lukas podolski from cologne for just this reason .
how much truth there is to such rumors is hard to judge concerning how poorly cologne are faring this season . where will ballack end up ? ballack will reap the benefits of bosman 's now monumental five-year court struggle to change clubs .

britain said it would cut 10.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 12.57 billion -rrb- off its jealously-guarded budget rebate , with funds being shifted towards the poorer mainly former communist countries that joined the eu last year .
france agreed to drop resistance to a spending review that could reduce its agricultural subsidies .
the 25 member states also decided to boost budget by nearly 862.4 billion euros .
" the long wait was worth it , " said germany 's merkel .
it was her first eu summit as chancellor and , many officials said she played a key mediating role .
" i am convinced ... we have concluded a good agreement for europe 's future , a signal of hope for european development , " she added .
" merkel played an extraordinarily important role behind the scenes , " said austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel .
" she has acted calm , sober and very professional . " romanian president traian basescu said : " she brokered the deal from start to finish .
she was the first to break the deadlock with a proposal . "
merkel has played a very constructive role , " a european diplomat told reuters .
" the absence of -lrb- former german chancellor gerhard -rrb- schröder and his unquestioning support of chirac has meant the french president has to be more careful . "
germany compromises , too but merkel gave way too , announcing germany would be prepared to do without 100 million euros which would instead come to the aid of poland 's poorest regions .
polish prime minister kazimierz marcinkiewicz described merkel 's actions as the " a wonderful gesture of solidarity " as he celebrated the deal .
" the taste of victory is as good as the finest french champagne , " he pronounced .
" every fifth euro will be spent on poland , " he told journalists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair 's tough stance on the british rebate was the main sticking point british prime minister tony blair , who was charged with brokering the deal in his role as eu president , also lauded the plans .
" this is an agreement that allows europe to move forward , " he said .
" if we believe in enlargement , we had to do this deal now .
if we 'd failed to reach an agreement at all , i think that europe would have been in a very severe crisis . " his comments were echoed by french president jacques chirac , his perennial summit sparring partner , who also said the deal was " a good accord for europe , which gives it the means necessary to fund its ambitions . " " once again , the crisis has been resolved , " chirac added , saying the deal had met french requirements .
" europe is now marching forward again , " he said .
barroso wanted more accord on the budget plans had been blocked chiefly by britain 's refusal to give more ground on the eu rebate which then-prime minister margaret thatcher famously secured in 1984 . the other main sticking point was france 's resistance to calls for a major reform of the eu 's long-disputed farm subsidy system , of which it is the main beneficiary . another apparent mediator , luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , said that unlike during his country 's turn at the presidency , which failed in june to get an accord , " this time all delegations attending the meeting were ready to take a decision . " european commission head jose manuel barroso admitted that the deal , which represents 1.045 percent of eu-wide gross national income , was not as big as the budget initially sought by his eu executive team .

britain said it would cut 10.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 12.57 billion -rrb- off its jealously-guarded budget rebate , with funds being shifted towards the poorer mainly former communist countries that joined the eu last year .
france agreed to drop resistance to a spending review that could reduce its agricultural subsidies .
the 25 member states also decided to boost budget by nearly 862.4 billion euros .
" the long wait was worth it , " said germany 's merkel .
it was her first eu summit as chancellor and , many officials said she played a key mediating role .
" i am convinced ... we have concluded a good agreement for europe 's future , a signal of hope for european development , " she added .
" merkel played an extraordinarily important role behind the scenes , " said austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel .
" she has acted calm , sober and very professional . " romanian president traian basescu said : " she brokered the deal from start to finish .
she was the first to break the deadlock with a proposal . "
merkel has played a very constructive role , " a european diplomat told reuters .
" the absence of -lrb- former german chancellor gerhard -rrb- schröder and his unquestioning support of chirac has meant the french president has to be more careful . "
germany compromises , too but merkel gave way too , announcing germany would be prepared to do without 100 million euros which would instead come to the aid of poland 's poorest regions .
polish prime minister kazimierz marcinkiewicz described merkel 's actions as the " a wonderful gesture of solidarity " as he celebrated the deal .
" the taste of victory is as good as the finest french champagne , " he pronounced .
" every fifth euro will be spent on poland , " he told journalists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair 's tough stance on the british rebate was the main sticking point british prime minister tony blair , who was charged with brokering the deal in his role as eu president , also lauded the plans .
" this is an agreement that allows europe to move forward , " he said .
" if we believe in enlargement , we had to do this deal now .
if we 'd failed to reach an agreement at all , i think that europe would have been in a very severe crisis . " his comments were echoed by french president jacques chirac , his perennial summit sparring partner , who also said the deal was " a good accord for europe , which gives it the means necessary to fund its ambitions . " " once again , the crisis has been resolved , " chirac added , saying the deal had met french requirements .
" europe is now marching forward again , " he said .
barroso wanted more accord on the budget plans had been blocked chiefly by britain 's refusal to give more ground on the eu rebate which then-prime minister margaret thatcher famously secured in 1984 . the other main sticking point was france 's resistance to calls for a major reform of the eu 's long-disputed farm subsidy system , of which it is the main beneficiary . another apparent mediator , luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , said that unlike during his country 's turn at the presidency , which failed in june to get an accord , " this time all delegations attending the meeting were ready to take a decision . " european commission head jose manuel barroso admitted that the deal , which represents 1.045 percent of eu-wide gross national income , was not as big as the budget initially sought by his eu executive team .
but he too hailed the extra money for the new members .
" without solidarity there is no union , " he said . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu finances : how do they work ?
the eu manages to spend about 100 billion euros a year but is n't able to levy and direct taxes .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 17.12.2005 merkel makes her mark as mediator in eu budget deal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has started making a name for herself in brussels german chancellor angela merkel appears to have been one of the chief reasons the eu managed to agree on a budget deal during two days of haggling at a brussels summit . the eu finally announced it had found a compromise on the bloc 's 2007 to 2013 budget in the early hours of saturday morning .
britain said it would cut 10.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 12.57 billion -rrb- off its jealously-guarded budget rebate , with funds being shifted towards the poorer mainly former communist countries that joined the eu last year .
france agreed to drop resistance to a spending review that could reduce its agricultural subsidies .
the 25 member states also decided to boost budget by nearly 862.4 billion euros .
" the long wait was worth it , " said germany 's merkel .
it was her first eu summit as chancellor and , many officials said she played a key mediating role .
" i am convinced ... we have concluded a good agreement for europe 's future , a signal of hope for european development , " she added .
" merkel played an extraordinarily important role behind the scenes , " said austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel .
" she has acted calm , sober and very professional . " romanian president traian basescu said : " she brokered the deal from start to finish .
she was the first to break the deadlock with a proposal . "
merkel has played a very constructive role , " a european diplomat told reuters .
" the absence of -lrb- former german chancellor gerhard -rrb- schröder and his unquestioning support of chirac has meant the french president has to be more careful . "
germany compromises , too but merkel gave way too , announcing germany would be prepared to do without 100 million euros which would instead come to the aid of poland 's poorest regions .
polish prime minister kazimierz marcinkiewicz described merkel 's actions as the " a wonderful gesture of solidarity " as he celebrated the deal .
" the taste of victory is as good as the finest french champagne , " he pronounced .
" every fifth euro will be spent on poland , " he told journalists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair 's tough stance on the british rebate was the main sticking point british prime minister tony blair , who was charged with brokering the deal in his role as eu president , also lauded the plans .
" this is an agreement that allows europe to move forward , " he said .
" if we believe in enlargement , we had to do this deal now .
if we 'd failed to reach an agreement at all , i think that europe would have been in a very severe crisis . " his comments were echoed by french president jacques chirac , his perennial summit sparring partner , who also said the deal was " a good accord for europe , which gives it the means necessary to fund its ambitions . " " once again , the crisis has been resolved , " chirac added , saying the deal had met french requirements .
" europe is now marching forward again , " he said .
barroso wanted more accord on the budget plans had been blocked chiefly by britain 's refusal to give more ground on the eu rebate which then-prime minister margaret thatcher famously secured in 1984 . the other main sticking point was france 's resistance to calls for a major reform of the eu 's long-disputed farm subsidy system , of which it is the main beneficiary . another apparent mediator , luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , said that unlike during his country 's turn at the presidency , which failed in june to get an accord , " this time all delegations attending the meeting were ready to take a decision . " european commission head jose manuel barroso admitted that the deal , which represents 1.045 percent of eu-wide gross national income , was not as big as the budget initially sought by his eu executive team .
but he too hailed the extra money for the new members .
" without solidarity there is no union , " he said . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu finances : how do they work ?

" we are looking at -lrb- possible -rrb- measures at the level of the un , " thomas de maizieres , chief of staff of german chancellor angela merkel , told the welt am sonntag newspaper . iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has caused international outrage with a series of anti-israeli and anti-jewish remarks , in the course of which he has said israel - described as a tumor - should be wiped off the map , or moved to europe , and cast doubt on whether the mass extermination of jews in nazi germany ever happened . but , de maizieres said , germany would only take such a step if there was " clear " agreement from its european union partners .
he said he thought the proposal by green european parliament member daniel cohn-bendit and others that iran should be kicked out of the soccer world cup to be held in germany next year was " an interesting idea . " the sport 's governing body fifa rejected the suggestion thursday .
jeopardizes iran-eu talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier says the comments will make negotiations between europe and iran more difficult german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier writes in the sunday newspaper bild am sonntag that ahmadinejad 's remarks jeopardize talks between iran and the eu on nuclear issues . " after the comments by the iranian president , discussions on nuclear matters between europeans and iran are going to become difficult , " according to steinmeier .

britain said it would cut 10.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 12.57 billion -rrb- off its jealously-guarded budget rebate , with funds being shifted towards the poorer mainly former communist countries that joined the eu last year .
france agreed to drop resistance to a spending review that could reduce its agricultural subsidies .
the 25 member states also decided to boost budget by nearly 862.4 billion euros .
" the long wait was worth it , " said germany 's merkel .
it was her first eu summit as chancellor and , many officials said she played a key mediating role .
" i am convinced ... we have concluded a good agreement for europe 's future , a signal of hope for european development , " she added .
" merkel played an extraordinarily important role behind the scenes , " said austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel .
" she has acted calm , sober and very professional . " romanian president traian basescu said : " she brokered the deal from start to finish .
she was the first to break the deadlock with a proposal . "
merkel has played a very constructive role , " a european diplomat told reuters .
" the absence of -lrb- former german chancellor gerhard -rrb- schröder and his unquestioning support of chirac has meant the french president has to be more careful . "
germany compromises , too but merkel gave way too , announcing germany would be prepared to do without 100 million euros which would instead come to the aid of poland 's poorest regions .
polish prime minister kazimierz marcinkiewicz described merkel 's actions as the " a wonderful gesture of solidarity " as he celebrated the deal .
" the taste of victory is as good as the finest french champagne , " he pronounced .
" every fifth euro will be spent on poland , " he told journalists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair 's tough stance on the british rebate was the main sticking point british prime minister tony blair , who was charged with brokering the deal in his role as eu president , also lauded the plans .
" this is an agreement that allows europe to move forward , " he said .
" if we believe in enlargement , we had to do this deal now .
if we 'd failed to reach an agreement at all , i think that europe would have been in a very severe crisis . " his comments were echoed by french president jacques chirac , his perennial summit sparring partner , who also said the deal was " a good accord for europe , which gives it the means necessary to fund its ambitions . " " once again , the crisis has been resolved , " chirac added , saying the deal had met french requirements .
" europe is now marching forward again , " he said .
barroso wanted more accord on the budget plans had been blocked chiefly by britain 's refusal to give more ground on the eu rebate which then-prime minister margaret thatcher famously secured in 1984 . the other main sticking point was france 's resistance to calls for a major reform of the eu 's long-disputed farm subsidy system , of which it is the main beneficiary . another apparent mediator , luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , said that unlike during his country 's turn at the presidency , which failed in june to get an accord , " this time all delegations attending the meeting were ready to take a decision . " european commission head jose manuel barroso admitted that the deal , which represents 1.045 percent of eu-wide gross national income , was not as big as the budget initially sought by his eu executive team .
but he too hailed the extra money for the new members .
" without solidarity there is no union , " he said . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu finances : how do they work ?

kucukovic had only been on the pitch 60 seconds after replacing benjamin lauth but picked up a pass from japan forward naohiro takahara to level the scores . the salvaged point leaves hamburg six points behind bayern heading into the six-week winter break and the reigning champions will be delighted with the result as bremen are now eight points adrift .
on saturday , with a 2-1 victory against a young borussia dortmund , bayern munich accumulated their 44th point in the first leg , setting a new bundesliga record . but it was a difficult task in front of 81,000 hostile spectators at signal iduna park . " we have played successfully all season .
we held back in the first half , " commented manager felix magath . in fact , all the goals fell in the second half .
iranian midfielder ali karimi put the guests ahead in the 53rd minute .
claudio pizarro doubled the lead in the 73rd minute .

the south germans reached the next round of the uefa cup also , and again find themselves - for the time being - in a uefa spot , resting in fifth place . " we showed that we were physically and mentally fit .
that 's a good sign for next year , " was trapattoni 's assessment . the italian was only weeks ago sitting on a very hot manager 's seat .
in the league , the coach 's carousel was in top gear this autumn .
duisburg , for one , released theirs .
after their 1-1 draw against mainz on saturday , the zebras announced that former german international jürgen kohler would take over the reins on the sidelines .

altintop , who had stormed the league 's goalscorer table with 10 strikes in the nine games , finally broke a two-month scoring drought to turn a 2-1 deficit into a 3-2 victory for a jubilant 23,000 strong crowd at fritz walter stadium . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gladbach 's ze antonio -lrb- l -rrb- fights for the ball with frankfurt 's ioannis amanatidis in mönchengladbach , around 48,000 supporters watched a wild game against frankfurt that ended 4-3 in favor of their club .

it came despite christian springer putting cologne up 1-0 after just 48 seconds .
bielefeld scored three times in the second half to turn the match around .
on sunday , rapolder lost his job , which he had n't even held onto for a whole season . in leverkusen , the 2002 champions league runners-up continued their slow drift downwards in the bundesliga .

ten years ago this week , the european court of justice handed down a ruling that revolutionized european soccer .
with the bosman decision , players could switch clubs freely - a blessing for only a few clubs . the writing is on the wall for michael ballack .
bayern munich signed paraguayan midfielder julio dos santos this week to one day fill the shoes of ballack who looks to be on his way out .
but it 's no problem for ballack , whose contract expires in june 2006 . more than a decade ago , the club 's star would not have been able to leave his team so easily .
but on dec .
15 , 1995 , the european court of justice handed the reins of power from the clubs to the players by ruling that the belgian jean-marc bosman could move from club de liege to dunkerque - without his team 's permission . the ruling had vast consequences , and not just for liege . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the judges decreed that european soccer players were free to move about previously , clubs were allowed to sign only a limited number of foreign players , a regulation that was particularly harsh towards english teams who had to count scottish , welsh and northern irish players as " foreign " because they have their own independent soccer federations . the court struck down this clause , throwing the doors wide open for transfers within europe . the richer european clubs then started going shopping around the continent to stock up on players .
salaries rose dramatically as the number of teams competing for the top names in germany expanded beyond bayern munich and borussia dortmund . clubs with deep pockets like real madrid , ac milan and barcelona were bidding for players around the continent , forcing teams to be very careful of whom they signed . if a big signing got hurt , did n't fit in the club or just simply failed to perform during his contract , teams were stuck with huge financial burdens , such as was the case with dortmund after winning the 2001-02 title . small clubs lose important source of revenue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wanting to play at the top , borussia dortmund almost deflated itself into bankruptcy while the richer seemed only to get richer despite the occasional poor signing , the smaller clubs , who were originally feeders for their bigger brothers , lost a vital source of revenue .
earlier , teams like freiburg , duisburg and bielefeld could nurture younger players to fruition and then cash in on transfer fees at any point . post-bosman , they had to fear for their lives .
if a promising player 's contract was set to expire at the end of the season , he would be snapped up by someone else , and the poorer club would walk away empty-handed . robbing talent naturally , potential stars hardly ever plan to remain with unremarkable clubs like sportfreunde siegen , unterhaching or energie cottbus throughout their whole careers ; the attraction of playing for bayern munich , schalke or stuttgart is simply too great . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will cologne 's lukas podolski -lrb- l -rrb- run to bayern munich ?
in a nasty twist , the superstar in a small market could be purchased by a team just to rob the smaller club of its best player .
there is no lack of speculation around the bundesliga that bayern would like german international lukas podolski from cologne for just this reason .
how much truth there is to such rumors is hard to judge concerning how poorly cologne are faring this season . where will ballack end up ? ballack will reap the benefits of bosman 's now monumental five-year court struggle to change clubs .
ballack and his agent michael becker have been fishing the european waters for the club that will give him that necessary push to become a player of enormous quality . bayern munich 's management may be cursing bosman but general manager uli hoeness knew this could happen .
bayern will also benefit from the bosman ruling in the dos santos signing .
although dos santos is from paraguay , he is eligible for a spanish passport , and hence will not count as a " foreign " player against the league 's quota . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayern and ballack in contract crunch time it was a marriage made in heaven : germany 's one true superstar and the bundesliga 's only real superpower .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 17.12.2005 merkel makes her mark as mediator in eu budget deal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has started making a name for herself in brussels german chancellor angela merkel appears to have been one of the chief reasons the eu managed to agree on a budget deal during two days of haggling at a brussels summit . the eu finally announced it had found a compromise on the bloc 's 2007 to 2013 budget in the early hours of saturday morning .
britain said it would cut 10.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 12.57 billion -rrb- off its jealously-guarded budget rebate , with funds being shifted towards the poorer mainly former communist countries that joined the eu last year .
france agreed to drop resistance to a spending review that could reduce its agricultural subsidies .
the 25 member states also decided to boost budget by nearly 862.4 billion euros .
" the long wait was worth it , " said germany 's merkel .
it was her first eu summit as chancellor and , many officials said she played a key mediating role .
" i am convinced ... we have concluded a good agreement for europe 's future , a signal of hope for european development , " she added .
" merkel played an extraordinarily important role behind the scenes , " said austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel .
" she has acted calm , sober and very professional . " romanian president traian basescu said : " she brokered the deal from start to finish .
she was the first to break the deadlock with a proposal . "
merkel has played a very constructive role , " a european diplomat told reuters .
" the absence of -lrb- former german chancellor gerhard -rrb- schröder and his unquestioning support of chirac has meant the french president has to be more careful . "
germany compromises , too but merkel gave way too , announcing germany would be prepared to do without 100 million euros which would instead come to the aid of poland 's poorest regions .
polish prime minister kazimierz marcinkiewicz described merkel 's actions as the " a wonderful gesture of solidarity " as he celebrated the deal .
" the taste of victory is as good as the finest french champagne , " he pronounced .
" every fifth euro will be spent on poland , " he told journalists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair 's tough stance on the british rebate was the main sticking point british prime minister tony blair , who was charged with brokering the deal in his role as eu president , also lauded the plans .
" this is an agreement that allows europe to move forward , " he said .
" if we believe in enlargement , we had to do this deal now .
if we 'd failed to reach an agreement at all , i think that europe would have been in a very severe crisis . " his comments were echoed by french president jacques chirac , his perennial summit sparring partner , who also said the deal was " a good accord for europe , which gives it the means necessary to fund its ambitions . " " once again , the crisis has been resolved , " chirac added , saying the deal had met french requirements .
" europe is now marching forward again , " he said .
barroso wanted more accord on the budget plans had been blocked chiefly by britain 's refusal to give more ground on the eu rebate which then-prime minister margaret thatcher famously secured in 1984 . the other main sticking point was france 's resistance to calls for a major reform of the eu 's long-disputed farm subsidy system , of which it is the main beneficiary . another apparent mediator , luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , said that unlike during his country 's turn at the presidency , which failed in june to get an accord , " this time all delegations attending the meeting were ready to take a decision . " european commission head jose manuel barroso admitted that the deal , which represents 1.045 percent of eu-wide gross national income , was not as big as the budget initially sought by his eu executive team .
but he too hailed the extra money for the new members .
" without solidarity there is no union , " he said . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu finances : how do they work ?
the eu manages to spend about 100 billion euros a year but is n't able to levy and direct taxes .

britain said it would cut 10.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 12.57 billion -rrb- off its jealously-guarded budget rebate , with funds being shifted towards the poorer mainly former communist countries that joined the eu last year .

the 25 member states also decided to boost budget by nearly 862.4 billion euros .

it was her first eu summit as chancellor and , many officials said she played a key mediating role .
" i am convinced ... we have concluded a good agreement for europe 's future , a signal of hope for european development , " she added .
" merkel played an extraordinarily important role behind the scenes , " said austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel .
" she has acted calm , sober and very professional . " romanian president traian basescu said : " she brokered the deal from start to finish .
she was the first to break the deadlock with a proposal . "
merkel has played a very constructive role , " a european diplomat told reuters .
" the absence of -lrb- former german chancellor gerhard -rrb- schröder and his unquestioning support of chirac has meant the french president has to be more careful . "
germany compromises , too but merkel gave way too , announcing germany would be prepared to do without 100 million euros which would instead come to the aid of poland 's poorest regions .
polish prime minister kazimierz marcinkiewicz described merkel 's actions as the " a wonderful gesture of solidarity " as he celebrated the deal .
" the taste of victory is as good as the finest french champagne , " he pronounced .
" every fifth euro will be spent on poland , " he told journalists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair 's tough stance on the british rebate was the main sticking point british prime minister tony blair , who was charged with brokering the deal in his role as eu president , also lauded the plans .
" this is an agreement that allows europe to move forward , " he said .
" if we believe in enlargement , we had to do this deal now .
if we 'd failed to reach an agreement at all , i think that europe would have been in a very severe crisis . " his comments were echoed by french president jacques chirac , his perennial summit sparring partner , who also said the deal was " a good accord for europe , which gives it the means necessary to fund its ambitions . " " once again , the crisis has been resolved , " chirac added , saying the deal had met french requirements .
" europe is now marching forward again , " he said .
barroso wanted more accord on the budget plans had been blocked chiefly by britain 's refusal to give more ground on the eu rebate which then-prime minister margaret thatcher famously secured in 1984 . the other main sticking point was france 's resistance to calls for a major reform of the eu 's long-disputed farm subsidy system , of which it is the main beneficiary . another apparent mediator , luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , said that unlike during his country 's turn at the presidency , which failed in june to get an accord , " this time all delegations attending the meeting were ready to take a decision . " european commission head jose manuel barroso admitted that the deal , which represents 1.045 percent of eu-wide gross national income , was not as big as the budget initially sought by his eu executive team .
but he too hailed the extra money for the new members .
" without solidarity there is no union , " he said . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu finances : how do they work ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 17.12.2005 the day european soccer began großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's michael ballack just may be saying : europe , here i come !
ten years ago this week , the european court of justice handed down a ruling that revolutionized european soccer .
with the bosman decision , players could switch clubs freely - a blessing for only a few clubs . the writing is on the wall for michael ballack .
bayern munich signed paraguayan midfielder julio dos santos this week to one day fill the shoes of ballack who looks to be on his way out .
but it 's no problem for ballack , whose contract expires in june 2006 . more than a decade ago , the club 's star would not have been able to leave his team so easily .
but on dec .
15 , 1995 , the european court of justice handed the reins of power from the clubs to the players by ruling that the belgian jean-marc bosman could move from club de liege to dunkerque - without his team 's permission . the ruling had vast consequences , and not just for liege . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the judges decreed that european soccer players were free to move about previously , clubs were allowed to sign only a limited number of foreign players , a regulation that was particularly harsh towards english teams who had to count scottish , welsh and northern irish players as " foreign " because they have their own independent soccer federations . the court struck down this clause , throwing the doors wide open for transfers within europe . the richer european clubs then started going shopping around the continent to stock up on players .
salaries rose dramatically as the number of teams competing for the top names in germany expanded beyond bayern munich and borussia dortmund . clubs with deep pockets like real madrid , ac milan and barcelona were bidding for players around the continent , forcing teams to be very careful of whom they signed . if a big signing got hurt , did n't fit in the club or just simply failed to perform during his contract , teams were stuck with huge financial burdens , such as was the case with dortmund after winning the 2001-02 title . small clubs lose important source of revenue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wanting to play at the top , borussia dortmund almost deflated itself into bankruptcy while the richer seemed only to get richer despite the occasional poor signing , the smaller clubs , who were originally feeders for their bigger brothers , lost a vital source of revenue .
earlier , teams like freiburg , duisburg and bielefeld could nurture younger players to fruition and then cash in on transfer fees at any point . post-bosman , they had to fear for their lives .
if a promising player 's contract was set to expire at the end of the season , he would be snapped up by someone else , and the poorer club would walk away empty-handed . robbing talent naturally , potential stars hardly ever plan to remain with unremarkable clubs like sportfreunde siegen , unterhaching or energie cottbus throughout their whole careers ; the attraction of playing for bayern munich , schalke or stuttgart is simply too great . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will cologne 's lukas podolski -lrb- l -rrb- run to bayern munich ?
in a nasty twist , the superstar in a small market could be purchased by a team just to rob the smaller club of its best player .
there is no lack of speculation around the bundesliga that bayern would like german international lukas podolski from cologne for just this reason .
how much truth there is to such rumors is hard to judge concerning how poorly cologne are faring this season . where will ballack end up ? ballack will reap the benefits of bosman 's now monumental five-year court struggle to change clubs .
ballack and his agent michael becker have been fishing the european waters for the club that will give him that necessary push to become a player of enormous quality . bayern munich 's management may be cursing bosman but general manager uli hoeness knew this could happen .
bayern will also benefit from the bosman ruling in the dos santos signing .
although dos santos is from paraguay , he is eligible for a spanish passport , and hence will not count as a " foreign " player against the league 's quota . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayern and ballack in contract crunch time it was a marriage made in heaven : germany 's one true superstar and the bundesliga 's only real superpower .

ten years ago this week , the european court of justice handed down a ruling that revolutionized european soccer .
with the bosman decision , players could switch clubs freely - a blessing for only a few clubs . the writing is on the wall for michael ballack .
bayern munich signed paraguayan midfielder julio dos santos this week to one day fill the shoes of ballack who looks to be on his way out .
but it 's no problem for ballack , whose contract expires in june 2006 . more than a decade ago , the club 's star would not have been able to leave his team so easily .
but on dec .
15 , 1995 , the european court of justice handed the reins of power from the clubs to the players by ruling that the belgian jean-marc bosman could move from club de liege to dunkerque - without his team 's permission . the ruling had vast consequences , and not just for liege . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the judges decreed that european soccer players were free to move about previously , clubs were allowed to sign only a limited number of foreign players , a regulation that was particularly harsh towards english teams who had to count scottish , welsh and northern irish players as " foreign " because they have their own independent soccer federations . the court struck down this clause , throwing the doors wide open for transfers within europe . the richer european clubs then started going shopping around the continent to stock up on players .
salaries rose dramatically as the number of teams competing for the top names in germany expanded beyond bayern munich and borussia dortmund . clubs with deep pockets like real madrid , ac milan and barcelona were bidding for players around the continent , forcing teams to be very careful of whom they signed . if a big signing got hurt , did n't fit in the club or just simply failed to perform during his contract , teams were stuck with huge financial burdens , such as was the case with dortmund after winning the 2001-02 title . small clubs lose important source of revenue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wanting to play at the top , borussia dortmund almost deflated itself into bankruptcy while the richer seemed only to get richer despite the occasional poor signing , the smaller clubs , who were originally feeders for their bigger brothers , lost a vital source of revenue .
earlier , teams like freiburg , duisburg and bielefeld could nurture younger players to fruition and then cash in on transfer fees at any point . post-bosman , they had to fear for their lives .
if a promising player 's contract was set to expire at the end of the season , he would be snapped up by someone else , and the poorer club would walk away empty-handed . robbing talent naturally , potential stars hardly ever plan to remain with unremarkable clubs like sportfreunde siegen , unterhaching or energie cottbus throughout their whole careers ; the attraction of playing for bayern munich , schalke or stuttgart is simply too great . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will cologne 's lukas podolski -lrb- l -rrb- run to bayern munich ?
in a nasty twist , the superstar in a small market could be purchased by a team just to rob the smaller club of its best player .
there is no lack of speculation around the bundesliga that bayern would like german international lukas podolski from cologne for just this reason .
how much truth there is to such rumors is hard to judge concerning how poorly cologne are faring this season . where will ballack end up ? ballack will reap the benefits of bosman 's now monumental five-year court struggle to change clubs .
ballack and his agent michael becker have been fishing the european waters for the club that will give him that necessary push to become a player of enormous quality . bayern munich 's management may be cursing bosman but general manager uli hoeness knew this could happen .
bayern will also benefit from the bosman ruling in the dos santos signing .

britain said it would cut 10.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 12.57 billion -rrb- off its jealously-guarded budget rebate , with funds being shifted towards the poorer mainly former communist countries that joined the eu last year .
france agreed to drop resistance to a spending review that could reduce its agricultural subsidies .
the 25 member states also decided to boost budget by nearly 862.4 billion euros .
" the long wait was worth it , " said germany 's merkel .
it was her first eu summit as chancellor and , many officials said she played a key mediating role .
" i am convinced ... we have concluded a good agreement for europe 's future , a signal of hope for european development , " she added .
" merkel played an extraordinarily important role behind the scenes , " said austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel .
" she has acted calm , sober and very professional . " romanian president traian basescu said : " she brokered the deal from start to finish .
she was the first to break the deadlock with a proposal . "
merkel has played a very constructive role , " a european diplomat told reuters .
" the absence of -lrb- former german chancellor gerhard -rrb- schröder and his unquestioning support of chirac has meant the french president has to be more careful . "
germany compromises , too but merkel gave way too , announcing germany would be prepared to do without 100 million euros which would instead come to the aid of poland 's poorest regions .
polish prime minister kazimierz marcinkiewicz described merkel 's actions as the " a wonderful gesture of solidarity " as he celebrated the deal .
" the taste of victory is as good as the finest french champagne , " he pronounced .
" every fifth euro will be spent on poland , " he told journalists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair 's tough stance on the british rebate was the main sticking point british prime minister tony blair , who was charged with brokering the deal in his role as eu president , also lauded the plans .
" this is an agreement that allows europe to move forward , " he said .
" if we believe in enlargement , we had to do this deal now .
if we 'd failed to reach an agreement at all , i think that europe would have been in a very severe crisis . " his comments were echoed by french president jacques chirac , his perennial summit sparring partner , who also said the deal was " a good accord for europe , which gives it the means necessary to fund its ambitions .

britain said it would cut 10.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 12.57 billion -rrb- off its jealously-guarded budget rebate , with funds being shifted towards the poorer mainly former communist countries that joined the eu last year .
france agreed to drop resistance to a spending review that could reduce its agricultural subsidies .
the 25 member states also decided to boost budget by nearly 862.4 billion euros .
" the long wait was worth it , " said germany 's merkel .
it was her first eu summit as chancellor and , many officials said she played a key mediating role .
" i am convinced ... we have concluded a good agreement for europe 's future , a signal of hope for european development , " she added .
" merkel played an extraordinarily important role behind the scenes , " said austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel .
" she has acted calm , sober and very professional . " romanian president traian basescu said : " she brokered the deal from start to finish .
she was the first to break the deadlock with a proposal . "
merkel has played a very constructive role , " a european diplomat told reuters .

germany compromises , too but merkel gave way too , announcing germany would be prepared to do without 100 million euros which would instead come to the aid of poland 's poorest regions .
polish prime minister kazimierz marcinkiewicz described merkel 's actions as the " a wonderful gesture of solidarity " as he celebrated the deal .

" we are looking at -lrb- possible -rrb- measures at the level of the un , " thomas de maizieres , chief of staff of german chancellor angela merkel , told the welt am sonntag newspaper . iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has caused international outrage with a series of anti-israeli and anti-jewish remarks , in the course of which he has said israel - described as a tumor - should be wiped off the map , or moved to europe , and cast doubt on whether the mass extermination of jews in nazi germany ever happened . but , de maizieres said , germany would only take such a step if there was " clear " agreement from its european union partners .

ten years ago this week , the european court of justice handed down a ruling that revolutionized european soccer .
with the bosman decision , players could switch clubs freely - a blessing for only a few clubs . the writing is on the wall for michael ballack .
bayern munich signed paraguayan midfielder julio dos santos this week to one day fill the shoes of ballack who looks to be on his way out .

15 , 1995 , the european court of justice handed the reins of power from the clubs to the players by ruling that the belgian jean-marc bosman could move from club de liege to dunkerque - without his team 's permission . the ruling had vast consequences , and not just for liege . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the judges decreed that european soccer players were free to move about previously , clubs were allowed to sign only a limited number of foreign players , a regulation that was particularly harsh towards english teams who had to count scottish , welsh and northern irish players as " foreign " because they have their own independent soccer federations . the court struck down this clause , throwing the doors wide open for transfers within europe . the richer european clubs then started going shopping around the continent to stock up on players .
salaries rose dramatically as the number of teams competing for the top names in germany expanded beyond bayern munich and borussia dortmund . clubs with deep pockets like real madrid , ac milan and barcelona were bidding for players around the continent , forcing teams to be very careful of whom they signed . if a big signing got hurt , did n't fit in the club or just simply failed to perform during his contract , teams were stuck with huge financial burdens , such as was the case with dortmund after winning the 2001-02 title . small clubs lose important source of revenue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wanting to play at the top , borussia dortmund almost deflated itself into bankruptcy while the richer seemed only to get richer despite the occasional poor signing , the smaller clubs , who were originally feeders for their bigger brothers , lost a vital source of revenue .
earlier , teams like freiburg , duisburg and bielefeld could nurture younger players to fruition and then cash in on transfer fees at any point . post-bosman , they had to fear for their lives .
if a promising player 's contract was set to expire at the end of the season , he would be snapped up by someone else , and the poorer club would walk away empty-handed . robbing talent naturally , potential stars hardly ever plan to remain with unremarkable clubs like sportfreunde siegen , unterhaching or energie cottbus throughout their whole careers ; the attraction of playing for bayern munich , schalke or stuttgart is simply too great . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will cologne 's lukas podolski -lrb- l -rrb- run to bayern munich ?
in a nasty twist , the superstar in a small market could be purchased by a team just to rob the smaller club of its best player .
there is no lack of speculation around the bundesliga that bayern would like german international lukas podolski from cologne for just this reason .
how much truth there is to such rumors is hard to judge concerning how poorly cologne are faring this season . where will ballack end up ? ballack will reap the benefits of bosman 's now monumental five-year court struggle to change clubs .
ballack and his agent michael becker have been fishing the european waters for the club that will give him that necessary push to become a player of enormous quality . bayern munich 's management may be cursing bosman but general manager uli hoeness knew this could happen .

ten years ago this week , the european court of justice handed down a ruling that revolutionized european soccer .
with the bosman decision , players could switch clubs freely - a blessing for only a few clubs . the writing is on the wall for michael ballack .
bayern munich signed paraguayan midfielder julio dos santos this week to one day fill the shoes of ballack who looks to be on his way out .
but it 's no problem for ballack , whose contract expires in june 2006 . more than a decade ago , the club 's star would not have been able to leave his team so easily .
but on dec .
15 , 1995 , the european court of justice handed the reins of power from the clubs to the players by ruling that the belgian jean-marc bosman could move from club de liege to dunkerque - without his team 's permission . the ruling had vast consequences , and not just for liege . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the judges decreed that european soccer players were free to move about previously , clubs were allowed to sign only a limited number of foreign players , a regulation that was particularly harsh towards english teams who had to count scottish , welsh and northern irish players as " foreign " because they have their own independent soccer federations . the court struck down this clause , throwing the doors wide open for transfers within europe . the richer european clubs then started going shopping around the continent to stock up on players .
salaries rose dramatically as the number of teams competing for the top names in germany expanded beyond bayern munich and borussia dortmund . clubs with deep pockets like real madrid , ac milan and barcelona were bidding for players around the continent , forcing teams to be very careful of whom they signed . if a big signing got hurt , did n't fit in the club or just simply failed to perform during his contract , teams were stuck with huge financial burdens , such as was the case with dortmund after winning the 2001-02 title . small clubs lose important source of revenue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wanting to play at the top , borussia dortmund almost deflated itself into bankruptcy while the richer seemed only to get richer despite the occasional poor signing , the smaller clubs , who were originally feeders for their bigger brothers , lost a vital source of revenue .
earlier , teams like freiburg , duisburg and bielefeld could nurture younger players to fruition and then cash in on transfer fees at any point . post-bosman , they had to fear for their lives .
if a promising player 's contract was set to expire at the end of the season , he would be snapped up by someone else , and the poorer club would walk away empty-handed . robbing talent naturally , potential stars hardly ever plan to remain with unremarkable clubs like sportfreunde siegen , unterhaching or energie cottbus throughout their whole careers ; the attraction of playing for bayern munich , schalke or stuttgart is simply too great . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will cologne 's lukas podolski -lrb- l -rrb- run to bayern munich ?
in a nasty twist , the superstar in a small market could be purchased by a team just to rob the smaller club of its best player .
there is no lack of speculation around the bundesliga that bayern would like german international lukas podolski from cologne for just this reason .
how much truth there is to such rumors is hard to judge concerning how poorly cologne are faring this season . where will ballack end up ? ballack will reap the benefits of bosman 's now monumental five-year court struggle to change clubs .
ballack and his agent michael becker have been fishing the european waters for the club that will give him that necessary push to become a player of enormous quality . bayern munich 's management may be cursing bosman but general manager uli hoeness knew this could happen .
bayern will also benefit from the bosman ruling in the dos santos signing .

ten years ago this week , the european court of justice handed down a ruling that revolutionized european soccer .
with the bosman decision , players could switch clubs freely - a blessing for only a few clubs . the writing is on the wall for michael ballack .
bayern munich signed paraguayan midfielder julio dos santos this week to one day fill the shoes of ballack who looks to be on his way out .
but it 's no problem for ballack , whose contract expires in june 2006 . more than a decade ago , the club 's star would not have been able to leave his team so easily .
but on dec .
15 , 1995 , the european court of justice handed the reins of power from the clubs to the players by ruling that the belgian jean-marc bosman could move from club de liege to dunkerque - without his team 's permission . the ruling had vast consequences , and not just for liege . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the judges decreed that european soccer players were free to move about previously , clubs were allowed to sign only a limited number of foreign players , a regulation that was particularly harsh towards english teams who had to count scottish , welsh and northern irish players as " foreign " because they have their own independent soccer federations . the court struck down this clause , throwing the doors wide open for transfers within europe . the richer european clubs then started going shopping around the continent to stock up on players .
salaries rose dramatically as the number of teams competing for the top names in germany expanded beyond bayern munich and borussia dortmund . clubs with deep pockets like real madrid , ac milan and barcelona were bidding for players around the continent , forcing teams to be very careful of whom they signed . if a big signing got hurt , did n't fit in the club or just simply failed to perform during his contract , teams were stuck with huge financial burdens , such as was the case with dortmund after winning the 2001-02 title . small clubs lose important source of revenue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wanting to play at the top , borussia dortmund almost deflated itself into bankruptcy while the richer seemed only to get richer despite the occasional poor signing , the smaller clubs , who were originally feeders for their bigger brothers , lost a vital source of revenue .
earlier , teams like freiburg , duisburg and bielefeld could nurture younger players to fruition and then cash in on transfer fees at any point . post-bosman , they had to fear for their lives .
if a promising player 's contract was set to expire at the end of the season , he would be snapped up by someone else , and the poorer club would walk away empty-handed . robbing talent naturally , potential stars hardly ever plan to remain with unremarkable clubs like sportfreunde siegen , unterhaching or energie cottbus throughout their whole careers ; the attraction of playing for bayern munich , schalke or stuttgart is simply too great . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will cologne 's lukas podolski -lrb- l -rrb- run to bayern munich ?
in a nasty twist , the superstar in a small market could be purchased by a team just to rob the smaller club of its best player .
there is no lack of speculation around the bundesliga that bayern would like german international lukas podolski from cologne for just this reason .
how much truth there is to such rumors is hard to judge concerning how poorly cologne are faring this season . where will ballack end up ? ballack will reap the benefits of bosman 's now monumental five-year court struggle to change clubs .
ballack and his agent michael becker have been fishing the european waters for the club that will give him that necessary push to become a player of enormous quality . bayern munich 's management may be cursing bosman but general manager uli hoeness knew this could happen .
bayern will also benefit from the bosman ruling in the dos santos signing .
although dos santos is from paraguay , he is eligible for a spanish passport , and hence will not count as a " foreign " player against the league 's quota . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayern and ballack in contract crunch time it was a marriage made in heaven : germany 's one true superstar and the bundesliga 's only real superpower .
but has the union of michael ballack and bayern munich run its course ?
-lrb- oct .
19 , 2005 -rrb- borussia on the brink borussia dortmund , germany 's only publically listed soccer club , said thursday it was teetering on the edge of financial collapse .
the state of north rhine-westphalia rejected suggestions it bail out the bundesliga team .
-lrb- feb .
17 , 2005 -rrb- dortmund may need to sell star players are the vultures already circling troubled german soccer club borussia dortmund ?
speculation is growing that the once top-flight team is preparing to sell some of its best players to come up with some cash .

britain said it would cut 10.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 12.57 billion -rrb- off its jealously-guarded budget rebate , with funds being shifted towards the poorer mainly former communist countries that joined the eu last year .
france agreed to drop resistance to a spending review that could reduce its agricultural subsidies .
the 25 member states also decided to boost budget by nearly 862.4 billion euros .
" the long wait was worth it , " said germany 's merkel .
it was her first eu summit as chancellor and , many officials said she played a key mediating role .
" i am convinced ... we have concluded a good agreement for europe 's future , a signal of hope for european development , " she added .
" merkel played an extraordinarily important role behind the scenes , " said austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel .
" she has acted calm , sober and very professional . " romanian president traian basescu said : " she brokered the deal from start to finish .
she was the first to break the deadlock with a proposal . "
merkel has played a very constructive role , " a european diplomat told reuters .
" the absence of -lrb- former german chancellor gerhard -rrb- schröder and his unquestioning support of chirac has meant the french president has to be more careful . "
germany compromises , too but merkel gave way too , announcing germany would be prepared to do without 100 million euros which would instead come to the aid of poland 's poorest regions .
polish prime minister kazimierz marcinkiewicz described merkel 's actions as the " a wonderful gesture of solidarity " as he celebrated the deal .
" the taste of victory is as good as the finest french champagne , " he pronounced .
" every fifth euro will be spent on poland , " he told journalists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair 's tough stance on the british rebate was the main sticking point british prime minister tony blair , who was charged with brokering the deal in his role as eu president , also lauded the plans .
" this is an agreement that allows europe to move forward , " he said .
" if we believe in enlargement , we had to do this deal now .
if we 'd failed to reach an agreement at all , i think that europe would have been in a very severe crisis . " his comments were echoed by french president jacques chirac , his perennial summit sparring partner , who also said the deal was " a good accord for europe , which gives it the means necessary to fund its ambitions . " " once again , the crisis has been resolved , " chirac added , saying the deal had met french requirements .
" europe is now marching forward again , " he said .
barroso wanted more accord on the budget plans had been blocked chiefly by britain 's refusal to give more ground on the eu rebate which then-prime minister margaret thatcher famously secured in 1984 . the other main sticking point was france 's resistance to calls for a major reform of the eu 's long-disputed farm subsidy system , of which it is the main beneficiary . another apparent mediator , luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , said that unlike during his country 's turn at the presidency , which failed in june to get an accord , " this time all delegations attending the meeting were ready to take a decision . " european commission head jose manuel barroso admitted that the deal , which represents 1.045 percent of eu-wide gross national income , was not as big as the budget initially sought by his eu executive team .
but he too hailed the extra money for the new members .

britain said it would cut 10.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 12.57 billion -rrb- off its jealously-guarded budget rebate , with funds being shifted towards the poorer mainly former communist countries that joined the eu last year .
france agreed to drop resistance to a spending review that could reduce its agricultural subsidies .
the 25 member states also decided to boost budget by nearly 862.4 billion euros .
" the long wait was worth it , " said germany 's merkel .
it was her first eu summit as chancellor and , many officials said she played a key mediating role .
" i am convinced ... we have concluded a good agreement for europe 's future , a signal of hope for european development , " she added .
" merkel played an extraordinarily important role behind the scenes , " said austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel .
" she has acted calm , sober and very professional . " romanian president traian basescu said : " she brokered the deal from start to finish .
she was the first to break the deadlock with a proposal . "
merkel has played a very constructive role , " a european diplomat told reuters .
" the absence of -lrb- former german chancellor gerhard -rrb- schröder and his unquestioning support of chirac has meant the french president has to be more careful . "
germany compromises , too but merkel gave way too , announcing germany would be prepared to do without 100 million euros which would instead come to the aid of poland 's poorest regions .
polish prime minister kazimierz marcinkiewicz described merkel 's actions as the " a wonderful gesture of solidarity " as he celebrated the deal .
" the taste of victory is as good as the finest french champagne , " he pronounced .
" every fifth euro will be spent on poland , " he told journalists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair 's tough stance on the british rebate was the main sticking point british prime minister tony blair , who was charged with brokering the deal in his role as eu president , also lauded the plans .
" this is an agreement that allows europe to move forward , " he said .
" if we believe in enlargement , we had to do this deal now .
if we 'd failed to reach an agreement at all , i think that europe would have been in a very severe crisis . " his comments were echoed by french president jacques chirac , his perennial summit sparring partner , who also said the deal was " a good accord for europe , which gives it the means necessary to fund its ambitions . " " once again , the crisis has been resolved , " chirac added , saying the deal had met french requirements .
" europe is now marching forward again , " he said .
barroso wanted more accord on the budget plans had been blocked chiefly by britain 's refusal to give more ground on the eu rebate which then-prime minister margaret thatcher famously secured in 1984 . the other main sticking point was france 's resistance to calls for a major reform of the eu 's long-disputed farm subsidy system , of which it is the main beneficiary . another apparent mediator , luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , said that unlike during his country 's turn at the presidency , which failed in june to get an accord , " this time all delegations attending the meeting were ready to take a decision . " european commission head jose manuel barroso admitted that the deal , which represents 1.045 percent of eu-wide gross national income , was not as big as the budget initially sought by his eu executive team .
but he too hailed the extra money for the new members .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 17.12.2005 the day european soccer began großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's michael ballack just may be saying : europe , here i come !
ten years ago this week , the european court of justice handed down a ruling that revolutionized european soccer .
with the bosman decision , players could switch clubs freely - a blessing for only a few clubs . the writing is on the wall for michael ballack .
bayern munich signed paraguayan midfielder julio dos santos this week to one day fill the shoes of ballack who looks to be on his way out .
but it 's no problem for ballack , whose contract expires in june 2006 . more than a decade ago , the club 's star would not have been able to leave his team so easily .
but on dec .
15 , 1995 , the european court of justice handed the reins of power from the clubs to the players by ruling that the belgian jean-marc bosman could move from club de liege to dunkerque - without his team 's permission . the ruling had vast consequences , and not just for liege . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the judges decreed that european soccer players were free to move about previously , clubs were allowed to sign only a limited number of foreign players , a regulation that was particularly harsh towards english teams who had to count scottish , welsh and northern irish players as " foreign " because they have their own independent soccer federations . the court struck down this clause , throwing the doors wide open for transfers within europe . the richer european clubs then started going shopping around the continent to stock up on players .
salaries rose dramatically as the number of teams competing for the top names in germany expanded beyond bayern munich and borussia dortmund . clubs with deep pockets like real madrid , ac milan and barcelona were bidding for players around the continent , forcing teams to be very careful of whom they signed . if a big signing got hurt , did n't fit in the club or just simply failed to perform during his contract , teams were stuck with huge financial burdens , such as was the case with dortmund after winning the 2001-02 title . small clubs lose important source of revenue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wanting to play at the top , borussia dortmund almost deflated itself into bankruptcy while the richer seemed only to get richer despite the occasional poor signing , the smaller clubs , who were originally feeders for their bigger brothers , lost a vital source of revenue .
earlier , teams like freiburg , duisburg and bielefeld could nurture younger players to fruition and then cash in on transfer fees at any point . post-bosman , they had to fear for their lives .
if a promising player 's contract was set to expire at the end of the season , he would be snapped up by someone else , and the poorer club would walk away empty-handed . robbing talent naturally , potential stars hardly ever plan to remain with unremarkable clubs like sportfreunde siegen , unterhaching or energie cottbus throughout their whole careers ; the attraction of playing for bayern munich , schalke or stuttgart is simply too great . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will cologne 's lukas podolski -lrb- l -rrb- run to bayern munich ?
in a nasty twist , the superstar in a small market could be purchased by a team just to rob the smaller club of its best player .
there is no lack of speculation around the bundesliga that bayern would like german international lukas podolski from cologne for just this reason .
how much truth there is to such rumors is hard to judge concerning how poorly cologne are faring this season . where will ballack end up ? ballack will reap the benefits of bosman 's now monumental five-year court struggle to change clubs .
ballack and his agent michael becker have been fishing the european waters for the club that will give him that necessary push to become a player of enormous quality . bayern munich 's management may be cursing bosman but general manager uli hoeness knew this could happen .
bayern will also benefit from the bosman ruling in the dos santos signing .
although dos santos is from paraguay , he is eligible for a spanish passport , and hence will not count as a " foreign " player against the league 's quota . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayern and ballack in contract crunch time it was a marriage made in heaven : germany 's one true superstar and the bundesliga 's only real superpower .

kucukovic had only been on the pitch 60 seconds after replacing benjamin lauth but picked up a pass from japan forward naohiro takahara to level the scores . the salvaged point leaves hamburg six points behind bayern heading into the six-week winter break and the reigning champions will be delighted with the result as bremen are now eight points adrift .
on saturday , with a 2-1 victory against a young borussia dortmund , bayern munich accumulated their 44th point in the first leg , setting a new bundesliga record . but it was a difficult task in front of 81,000 hostile spectators at signal iduna park . " we have played successfully all season .
we held back in the first half , " commented manager felix magath . in fact , all the goals fell in the second half .

the south germans reached the next round of the uefa cup also , and again find themselves - for the time being - in a uefa spot , resting in fifth place . " we showed that we were physically and mentally fit .
that 's a good sign for next year , " was trapattoni 's assessment . the italian was only weeks ago sitting on a very hot manager 's seat .

ten years ago this week , the european court of justice handed down a ruling that revolutionized european soccer .
with the bosman decision , players could switch clubs freely - a blessing for only a few clubs . the writing is on the wall for michael ballack .
bayern munich signed paraguayan midfielder julio dos santos this week to one day fill the shoes of ballack who looks to be on his way out .
but it 's no problem for ballack , whose contract expires in june 2006 . more than a decade ago , the club 's star would not have been able to leave his team so easily .
but on dec .
15 , 1995 , the european court of justice handed the reins of power from the clubs to the players by ruling that the belgian jean-marc bosman could move from club de liege to dunkerque - without his team 's permission . the ruling had vast consequences , and not just for liege . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the judges decreed that european soccer players were free to move about previously , clubs were allowed to sign only a limited number of foreign players , a regulation that was particularly harsh towards english teams who had to count scottish , welsh and northern irish players as " foreign " because they have their own independent soccer federations . the court struck down this clause , throwing the doors wide open for transfers within europe . the richer european clubs then started going shopping around the continent to stock up on players .
salaries rose dramatically as the number of teams competing for the top names in germany expanded beyond bayern munich and borussia dortmund . clubs with deep pockets like real madrid , ac milan and barcelona were bidding for players around the continent , forcing teams to be very careful of whom they signed . if a big signing got hurt , did n't fit in the club or just simply failed to perform during his contract , teams were stuck with huge financial burdens , such as was the case with dortmund after winning the 2001-02 title . small clubs lose important source of revenue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wanting to play at the top , borussia dortmund almost deflated itself into bankruptcy while the richer seemed only to get richer despite the occasional poor signing , the smaller clubs , who were originally feeders for their bigger brothers , lost a vital source of revenue .
earlier , teams like freiburg , duisburg and bielefeld could nurture younger players to fruition and then cash in on transfer fees at any point . post-bosman , they had to fear for their lives .
if a promising player 's contract was set to expire at the end of the season , he would be snapped up by someone else , and the poorer club would walk away empty-handed . robbing talent naturally , potential stars hardly ever plan to remain with unremarkable clubs like sportfreunde siegen , unterhaching or energie cottbus throughout their whole careers ; the attraction of playing for bayern munich , schalke or stuttgart is simply too great . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will cologne 's lukas podolski -lrb- l -rrb- run to bayern munich ?
in a nasty twist , the superstar in a small market could be purchased by a team just to rob the smaller club of its best player .
there is no lack of speculation around the bundesliga that bayern would like german international lukas podolski from cologne for just this reason .
how much truth there is to such rumors is hard to judge concerning how poorly cologne are faring this season . where will ballack end up ? ballack will reap the benefits of bosman 's now monumental five-year court struggle to change clubs .
ballack and his agent michael becker have been fishing the european waters for the club that will give him that necessary push to become a player of enormous quality . bayern munich 's management may be cursing bosman but general manager uli hoeness knew this could happen .
bayern will also benefit from the bosman ruling in the dos santos signing .
although dos santos is from paraguay , he is eligible for a spanish passport , and hence will not count as a " foreign " player against the league 's quota . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayern and ballack in contract crunch time it was a marriage made in heaven : germany 's one true superstar and the bundesliga 's only real superpower .

britain said it would cut 10.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 12.57 billion -rrb- off its jealously-guarded budget rebate , with funds being shifted towards the poorer mainly former communist countries that joined the eu last year .
france agreed to drop resistance to a spending review that could reduce its agricultural subsidies .
the 25 member states also decided to boost budget by nearly 862.4 billion euros .
" the long wait was worth it , " said germany 's merkel .
it was her first eu summit as chancellor and , many officials said she played a key mediating role .
" i am convinced ... we have concluded a good agreement for europe 's future , a signal of hope for european development , " she added .
" merkel played an extraordinarily important role behind the scenes , " said austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel .
" she has acted calm , sober and very professional . " romanian president traian basescu said : " she brokered the deal from start to finish .
she was the first to break the deadlock with a proposal . "
merkel has played a very constructive role , " a european diplomat told reuters .
" the absence of -lrb- former german chancellor gerhard -rrb- schröder and his unquestioning support of chirac has meant the french president has to be more careful . "
germany compromises , too but merkel gave way too , announcing germany would be prepared to do without 100 million euros which would instead come to the aid of poland 's poorest regions .
polish prime minister kazimierz marcinkiewicz described merkel 's actions as the " a wonderful gesture of solidarity " as he celebrated the deal .
" the taste of victory is as good as the finest french champagne , " he pronounced .
" every fifth euro will be spent on poland , " he told journalists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair 's tough stance on the british rebate was the main sticking point british prime minister tony blair , who was charged with brokering the deal in his role as eu president , also lauded the plans .
" this is an agreement that allows europe to move forward , " he said .
" if we believe in enlargement , we had to do this deal now .
if we 'd failed to reach an agreement at all , i think that europe would have been in a very severe crisis . " his comments were echoed by french president jacques chirac , his perennial summit sparring partner , who also said the deal was " a good accord for europe , which gives it the means necessary to fund its ambitions . " " once again , the crisis has been resolved , " chirac added , saying the deal had met french requirements .
" europe is now marching forward again , " he said .
barroso wanted more accord on the budget plans had been blocked chiefly by britain 's refusal to give more ground on the eu rebate which then-prime minister margaret thatcher famously secured in 1984 . the other main sticking point was france 's resistance to calls for a major reform of the eu 's long-disputed farm subsidy system , of which it is the main beneficiary . another apparent mediator , luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , said that unlike during his country 's turn at the presidency , which failed in june to get an accord , " this time all delegations attending the meeting were ready to take a decision . " european commission head jose manuel barroso admitted that the deal , which represents 1.045 percent of eu-wide gross national income , was not as big as the budget initially sought by his eu executive team .
but he too hailed the extra money for the new members .

" " once again , the crisis has been resolved , " chirac added , saying the deal had met french requirements .
" europe is now marching forward again , " he said .
barroso wanted more accord on the budget plans had been blocked chiefly by britain 's refusal to give more ground on the eu rebate which then-prime minister margaret thatcher famously secured in 1984 . the other main sticking point was france 's resistance to calls for a major reform of the eu 's long-disputed farm subsidy system , of which it is the main beneficiary . another apparent mediator , luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , said that unlike during his country 's turn at the presidency , which failed in june to get an accord , " this time all delegations attending the meeting were ready to take a decision . " european commission head jose manuel barroso admitted that the deal , which represents 1.045 percent of eu-wide gross national income , was not as big as the budget initially sought by his eu executive team .
but he too hailed the extra money for the new members .

15 , 1995 , the european court of justice handed the reins of power from the clubs to the players by ruling that the belgian jean-marc bosman could move from club de liege to dunkerque - without his team 's permission . the ruling had vast consequences , and not just for liege . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the judges decreed that european soccer players were free to move about previously , clubs were allowed to sign only a limited number of foreign players , a regulation that was particularly harsh towards english teams who had to count scottish , welsh and northern irish players as " foreign " because they have their own independent soccer federations . the court struck down this clause , throwing the doors wide open for transfers within europe . the richer european clubs then started going shopping around the continent to stock up on players .
salaries rose dramatically as the number of teams competing for the top names in germany expanded beyond bayern munich and borussia dortmund . clubs with deep pockets like real madrid , ac milan and barcelona were bidding for players around the continent , forcing teams to be very careful of whom they signed . if a big signing got hurt , did n't fit in the club or just simply failed to perform during his contract , teams were stuck with huge financial burdens , such as was the case with dortmund after winning the 2001-02 title . small clubs lose important source of revenue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wanting to play at the top , borussia dortmund almost deflated itself into bankruptcy while the richer seemed only to get richer despite the occasional poor signing , the smaller clubs , who were originally feeders for their bigger brothers , lost a vital source of revenue .
earlier , teams like freiburg , duisburg and bielefeld could nurture younger players to fruition and then cash in on transfer fees at any point . post-bosman , they had to fear for their lives .
if a promising player 's contract was set to expire at the end of the season , he would be snapped up by someone else , and the poorer club would walk away empty-handed . robbing talent naturally , potential stars hardly ever plan to remain with unremarkable clubs like sportfreunde siegen , unterhaching or energie cottbus throughout their whole careers ; the attraction of playing for bayern munich , schalke or stuttgart is simply too great . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will cologne 's lukas podolski -lrb- l -rrb- run to bayern munich ?
in a nasty twist , the superstar in a small market could be purchased by a team just to rob the smaller club of its best player .
there is no lack of speculation around the bundesliga that bayern would like german international lukas podolski from cologne for just this reason .
how much truth there is to such rumors is hard to judge concerning how poorly cologne are faring this season . where will ballack end up ? ballack will reap the benefits of bosman 's now monumental five-year court struggle to change clubs .
ballack and his agent michael becker have been fishing the european waters for the club that will give him that necessary push to become a player of enormous quality . bayern munich 's management may be cursing bosman but general manager uli hoeness knew this could happen .

britain said it would cut 10.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 12.57 billion -rrb- off its jealously-guarded budget rebate , with funds being shifted towards the poorer mainly former communist countries that joined the eu last year .
france agreed to drop resistance to a spending review that could reduce its agricultural subsidies .
the 25 member states also decided to boost budget by nearly 862.4 billion euros .
" the long wait was worth it , " said germany 's merkel .
it was her first eu summit as chancellor and , many officials said she played a key mediating role .
" i am convinced ... we have concluded a good agreement for europe 's future , a signal of hope for european development , " she added .
" merkel played an extraordinarily important role behind the scenes , " said austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel .
" she has acted calm , sober and very professional . " romanian president traian basescu said : " she brokered the deal from start to finish .
she was the first to break the deadlock with a proposal . "
merkel has played a very constructive role , " a european diplomat told reuters .
" the absence of -lrb- former german chancellor gerhard -rrb- schröder and his unquestioning support of chirac has meant the french president has to be more careful . "
germany compromises , too but merkel gave way too , announcing germany would be prepared to do without 100 million euros which would instead come to the aid of poland 's poorest regions .
polish prime minister kazimierz marcinkiewicz described merkel 's actions as the " a wonderful gesture of solidarity " as he celebrated the deal .
" the taste of victory is as good as the finest french champagne , " he pronounced .
" every fifth euro will be spent on poland , " he told journalists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair 's tough stance on the british rebate was the main sticking point british prime minister tony blair , who was charged with brokering the deal in his role as eu president , also lauded the plans .

" " once again , the crisis has been resolved , " chirac added , saying the deal had met french requirements .
" europe is now marching forward again , " he said .
barroso wanted more accord on the budget plans had been blocked chiefly by britain 's refusal to give more ground on the eu rebate which then-prime minister margaret thatcher famously secured in 1984 . the other main sticking point was france 's resistance to calls for a major reform of the eu 's long-disputed farm subsidy system , of which it is the main beneficiary . another apparent mediator , luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , said that unlike during his country 's turn at the presidency , which failed in june to get an accord , " this time all delegations attending the meeting were ready to take a decision . " european commission head jose manuel barroso admitted that the deal , which represents 1.045 percent of eu-wide gross national income , was not as big as the budget initially sought by his eu executive team .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 17.12.2005 the day european soccer began großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's michael ballack just may be saying : europe , here i come !
ten years ago this week , the european court of justice handed down a ruling that revolutionized european soccer .
with the bosman decision , players could switch clubs freely - a blessing for only a few clubs . the writing is on the wall for michael ballack .
bayern munich signed paraguayan midfielder julio dos santos this week to one day fill the shoes of ballack who looks to be on his way out .
but it 's no problem for ballack , whose contract expires in june 2006 . more than a decade ago , the club 's star would not have been able to leave his team so easily .
but on dec .
15 , 1995 , the european court of justice handed the reins of power from the clubs to the players by ruling that the belgian jean-marc bosman could move from club de liege to dunkerque - without his team 's permission . the ruling had vast consequences , and not just for liege . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the judges decreed that european soccer players were free to move about previously , clubs were allowed to sign only a limited number of foreign players , a regulation that was particularly harsh towards english teams who had to count scottish , welsh and northern irish players as " foreign " because they have their own independent soccer federations . the court struck down this clause , throwing the doors wide open for transfers within europe . the richer european clubs then started going shopping around the continent to stock up on players .
salaries rose dramatically as the number of teams competing for the top names in germany expanded beyond bayern munich and borussia dortmund . clubs with deep pockets like real madrid , ac milan and barcelona were bidding for players around the continent , forcing teams to be very careful of whom they signed . if a big signing got hurt , did n't fit in the club or just simply failed to perform during his contract , teams were stuck with huge financial burdens , such as was the case with dortmund after winning the 2001-02 title . small clubs lose important source of revenue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wanting to play at the top , borussia dortmund almost deflated itself into bankruptcy while the richer seemed only to get richer despite the occasional poor signing , the smaller clubs , who were originally feeders for their bigger brothers , lost a vital source of revenue .
earlier , teams like freiburg , duisburg and bielefeld could nurture younger players to fruition and then cash in on transfer fees at any point . post-bosman , they had to fear for their lives .
if a promising player 's contract was set to expire at the end of the season , he would be snapped up by someone else , and the poorer club would walk away empty-handed . robbing talent naturally , potential stars hardly ever plan to remain with unremarkable clubs like sportfreunde siegen , unterhaching or energie cottbus throughout their whole careers ; the attraction of playing for bayern munich , schalke or stuttgart is simply too great . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will cologne 's lukas podolski -lrb- l -rrb- run to bayern munich ?
in a nasty twist , the superstar in a small market could be purchased by a team just to rob the smaller club of its best player .
there is no lack of speculation around the bundesliga that bayern would like german international lukas podolski from cologne for just this reason .
how much truth there is to such rumors is hard to judge concerning how poorly cologne are faring this season . where will ballack end up ? ballack will reap the benefits of bosman 's now monumental five-year court struggle to change clubs .
ballack and his agent michael becker have been fishing the european waters for the club that will give him that necessary push to become a player of enormous quality . bayern munich 's management may be cursing bosman but general manager uli hoeness knew this could happen .
bayern will also benefit from the bosman ruling in the dos santos signing .
although dos santos is from paraguay , he is eligible for a spanish passport , and hence will not count as a " foreign " player against the league 's quota . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayern and ballack in contract crunch time it was a marriage made in heaven : germany 's one true superstar and the bundesliga 's only real superpower .

" i have not received money from anyone and i have promised nobody i would keep quiet about what happened to me , " khaled el-masri told german television .
" i am outraged and very disappointed anyone should level such accusations . "

23 , 2004 for questioning about his supposed links to islamists .
he was freed at the end of may last year in albania after the us authorities realized they had confused him with someone else , he says .
masri , who is suing the cia , says he was beaten and humiliated .
german interior minister wolfgang schäuble told a parliamentary committee wednesday that the united states had apologized to masri and paid him damages .
he quoted a statement to that effect from the former us ambassador to berlin , daniel coats , to his predecessor at the interior ministry , otto schily , in may 2004 after being told of the masri case . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schäuble : facts obtained through torture should be used german interior minister wolfgang schäuble wants information which may have been extracted from suspected terrorists through torture to be used in court as he searches for greater powers in germany ’ s own " war on terror .

britain said it would cut 10.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 12.57 billion -rrb- off its jealously-guarded budget rebate , with funds being shifted towards the poorer mainly former communist countries that joined the eu last year .
france agreed to drop resistance to a spending review that could reduce its agricultural subsidies .
the 25 member states also decided to boost budget by nearly 862.4 billion euros .
" the long wait was worth it , " said germany 's merkel .
it was her first eu summit as chancellor and , many officials said she played a key mediating role .
" i am convinced ... we have concluded a good agreement for europe 's future , a signal of hope for european development , " she added .
" merkel played an extraordinarily important role behind the scenes , " said austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel .
" she has acted calm , sober and very professional . " romanian president traian basescu said : " she brokered the deal from start to finish .
she was the first to break the deadlock with a proposal . "
merkel has played a very constructive role , " a european diplomat told reuters .
" the absence of -lrb- former german chancellor gerhard -rrb- schröder and his unquestioning support of chirac has meant the french president has to be more careful . "
germany compromises , too but merkel gave way too , announcing germany would be prepared to do without 100 million euros which would instead come to the aid of poland 's poorest regions .
polish prime minister kazimierz marcinkiewicz described merkel 's actions as the " a wonderful gesture of solidarity " as he celebrated the deal .
" the taste of victory is as good as the finest french champagne , " he pronounced .
" every fifth euro will be spent on poland , " he told journalists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair 's tough stance on the british rebate was the main sticking point british prime minister tony blair , who was charged with brokering the deal in his role as eu president , also lauded the plans .
" this is an agreement that allows europe to move forward , " he said .
" if we believe in enlargement , we had to do this deal now .
if we 'd failed to reach an agreement at all , i think that europe would have been in a very severe crisis . " his comments were echoed by french president jacques chirac , his perennial summit sparring partner , who also said the deal was " a good accord for europe , which gives it the means necessary to fund its ambitions . " " once again , the crisis has been resolved , " chirac added , saying the deal had met french requirements .
" europe is now marching forward again , " he said .
barroso wanted more accord on the budget plans had been blocked chiefly by britain 's refusal to give more ground on the eu rebate which then-prime minister margaret thatcher famously secured in 1984 . the other main sticking point was france 's resistance to calls for a major reform of the eu 's long-disputed farm subsidy system , of which it is the main beneficiary . another apparent mediator , luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , said that unlike during his country 's turn at the presidency , which failed in june to get an accord , " this time all delegations attending the meeting were ready to take a decision . " european commission head jose manuel barroso admitted that the deal , which represents 1.045 percent of eu-wide gross national income , was not as big as the budget initially sought by his eu executive team .
but he too hailed the extra money for the new members .
" without solidarity there is no union , " he said . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu finances : how do they work ?

ten years ago this week , the european court of justice handed down a ruling that revolutionized european soccer .
with the bosman decision , players could switch clubs freely - a blessing for only a few clubs . the writing is on the wall for michael ballack .
bayern munich signed paraguayan midfielder julio dos santos this week to one day fill the shoes of ballack who looks to be on his way out .
but it 's no problem for ballack , whose contract expires in june 2006 . more than a decade ago , the club 's star would not have been able to leave his team so easily .
but on dec .
15 , 1995 , the european court of justice handed the reins of power from the clubs to the players by ruling that the belgian jean-marc bosman could move from club de liege to dunkerque - without his team 's permission . the ruling had vast consequences , and not just for liege . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the judges decreed that european soccer players were free to move about previously , clubs were allowed to sign only a limited number of foreign players , a regulation that was particularly harsh towards english teams who had to count scottish , welsh and northern irish players as " foreign " because they have their own independent soccer federations . the court struck down this clause , throwing the doors wide open for transfers within europe . the richer european clubs then started going shopping around the continent to stock up on players .
salaries rose dramatically as the number of teams competing for the top names in germany expanded beyond bayern munich and borussia dortmund . clubs with deep pockets like real madrid , ac milan and barcelona were bidding for players around the continent , forcing teams to be very careful of whom they signed . if a big signing got hurt , did n't fit in the club or just simply failed to perform during his contract , teams were stuck with huge financial burdens , such as was the case with dortmund after winning the 2001-02 title . small clubs lose important source of revenue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wanting to play at the top , borussia dortmund almost deflated itself into bankruptcy while the richer seemed only to get richer despite the occasional poor signing , the smaller clubs , who were originally feeders for their bigger brothers , lost a vital source of revenue .
earlier , teams like freiburg , duisburg and bielefeld could nurture younger players to fruition and then cash in on transfer fees at any point . post-bosman , they had to fear for their lives .
if a promising player 's contract was set to expire at the end of the season , he would be snapped up by someone else , and the poorer club would walk away empty-handed . robbing talent naturally , potential stars hardly ever plan to remain with unremarkable clubs like sportfreunde siegen , unterhaching or energie cottbus throughout their whole careers ; the attraction of playing for bayern munich , schalke or stuttgart is simply too great . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will cologne 's lukas podolski -lrb- l -rrb- run to bayern munich ?
in a nasty twist , the superstar in a small market could be purchased by a team just to rob the smaller club of its best player .
there is no lack of speculation around the bundesliga that bayern would like german international lukas podolski from cologne for just this reason .
how much truth there is to such rumors is hard to judge concerning how poorly cologne are faring this season . where will ballack end up ? ballack will reap the benefits of bosman 's now monumental five-year court struggle to change clubs .
ballack and his agent michael becker have been fishing the european waters for the club that will give him that necessary push to become a player of enormous quality . bayern munich 's management may be cursing bosman but general manager uli hoeness knew this could happen .
bayern will also benefit from the bosman ruling in the dos santos signing .
although dos santos is from paraguay , he is eligible for a spanish passport , and hence will not count as a " foreign " player against the league 's quota . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayern and ballack in contract crunch time it was a marriage made in heaven : germany 's one true superstar and the bundesliga 's only real superpower .

britain said it would cut 10.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 12.57 billion -rrb- off its jealously-guarded budget rebate , with funds being shifted towards the poorer mainly former communist countries that joined the eu last year .
france agreed to drop resistance to a spending review that could reduce its agricultural subsidies .
the 25 member states also decided to boost budget by nearly 862.4 billion euros .
" the long wait was worth it , " said germany 's merkel .
it was her first eu summit as chancellor and , many officials said she played a key mediating role .
" i am convinced ... we have concluded a good agreement for europe 's future , a signal of hope for european development , " she added .
" merkel played an extraordinarily important role behind the scenes , " said austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel .
" she has acted calm , sober and very professional . " romanian president traian basescu said : " she brokered the deal from start to finish .
she was the first to break the deadlock with a proposal . "
merkel has played a very constructive role , " a european diplomat told reuters .
" the absence of -lrb- former german chancellor gerhard -rrb- schröder and his unquestioning support of chirac has meant the french president has to be more careful . "
germany compromises , too but merkel gave way too , announcing germany would be prepared to do without 100 million euros which would instead come to the aid of poland 's poorest regions .
polish prime minister kazimierz marcinkiewicz described merkel 's actions as the " a wonderful gesture of solidarity " as he celebrated the deal .
" the taste of victory is as good as the finest french champagne , " he pronounced .
" every fifth euro will be spent on poland , " he told journalists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair 's tough stance on the british rebate was the main sticking point british prime minister tony blair , who was charged with brokering the deal in his role as eu president , also lauded the plans .
" this is an agreement that allows europe to move forward , " he said .
" if we believe in enlargement , we had to do this deal now .
if we 'd failed to reach an agreement at all , i think that europe would have been in a very severe crisis . " his comments were echoed by french president jacques chirac , his perennial summit sparring partner , who also said the deal was " a good accord for europe , which gives it the means necessary to fund its ambitions . " " once again , the crisis has been resolved , " chirac added , saying the deal had met french requirements .
" europe is now marching forward again , " he said .
barroso wanted more accord on the budget plans had been blocked chiefly by britain 's refusal to give more ground on the eu rebate which then-prime minister margaret thatcher famously secured in 1984 . the other main sticking point was france 's resistance to calls for a major reform of the eu 's long-disputed farm subsidy system , of which it is the main beneficiary . another apparent mediator , luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , said that unlike during his country 's turn at the presidency , which failed in june to get an accord , " this time all delegations attending the meeting were ready to take a decision . " european commission head jose manuel barroso admitted that the deal , which represents 1.045 percent of eu-wide gross national income , was not as big as the budget initially sought by his eu executive team .

britain said it would cut 10.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 12.57 billion -rrb- off its jealously-guarded budget rebate , with funds being shifted towards the poorer mainly former communist countries that joined the eu last year .
france agreed to drop resistance to a spending review that could reduce its agricultural subsidies .
the 25 member states also decided to boost budget by nearly 862.4 billion euros .
" the long wait was worth it , " said germany 's merkel .
it was her first eu summit as chancellor and , many officials said she played a key mediating role .
" i am convinced ... we have concluded a good agreement for europe 's future , a signal of hope for european development , " she added .
" merkel played an extraordinarily important role behind the scenes , " said austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel .
" she has acted calm , sober and very professional . " romanian president traian basescu said : " she brokered the deal from start to finish .
she was the first to break the deadlock with a proposal . "
merkel has played a very constructive role , " a european diplomat told reuters .
" the absence of -lrb- former german chancellor gerhard -rrb- schröder and his unquestioning support of chirac has meant the french president has to be more careful . "
germany compromises , too but merkel gave way too , announcing germany would be prepared to do without 100 million euros which would instead come to the aid of poland 's poorest regions .
polish prime minister kazimierz marcinkiewicz described merkel 's actions as the " a wonderful gesture of solidarity " as he celebrated the deal .
" the taste of victory is as good as the finest french champagne , " he pronounced .
" every fifth euro will be spent on poland , " he told journalists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair 's tough stance on the british rebate was the main sticking point british prime minister tony blair , who was charged with brokering the deal in his role as eu president , also lauded the plans .
" this is an agreement that allows europe to move forward , " he said .
" if we believe in enlargement , we had to do this deal now .
if we 'd failed to reach an agreement at all , i think that europe would have been in a very severe crisis . " his comments were echoed by french president jacques chirac , his perennial summit sparring partner , who also said the deal was " a good accord for europe , which gives it the means necessary to fund its ambitions . " " once again , the crisis has been resolved , " chirac added , saying the deal had met french requirements .
" europe is now marching forward again , " he said .
barroso wanted more accord on the budget plans had been blocked chiefly by britain 's refusal to give more ground on the eu rebate which then-prime minister margaret thatcher famously secured in 1984 . the other main sticking point was france 's resistance to calls for a major reform of the eu 's long-disputed farm subsidy system , of which it is the main beneficiary . another apparent mediator , luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , said that unlike during his country 's turn at the presidency , which failed in june to get an accord , " this time all delegations attending the meeting were ready to take a decision . " european commission head jose manuel barroso admitted that the deal , which represents 1.045 percent of eu-wide gross national income , was not as big as the budget initially sought by his eu executive team .

bbc news -pipe- europe -pipe- in quotes : eu leaders on budget deal bbc news / europe graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- saturday , 17 december 2005 , 10:03 gmt in quotes : eu leaders on budget deal european leaders have agreed the next seven-year eu budget after two days of talks .
britain has offered to cut its rebate to help fund the development of the eu 's 10 new members , while the european leaders have committed themselves to review all eu spending , including the common agricultural policy .
reaction to the deal has been generally positive .
uk prime minister tony blair at some point , you 've got to come up with a deal and the important thing is this : if we believe in enlargement , we had to do this deal now .
if we did n't , we were n't going to do it in the next year .
we would then move to annual budgets .
it would make it impossible for these new european countries to plan ahead and we would do real damage , not just to their cause , but to the cause of enlargement more generally .
so i do n't doubt that i 'll get a certain amount of criticism from people who say i 've gone too far , people who say i 've not gone far enough - but , in the end , this is about getting an agreement that allows europe to move forward .
french president jacques chirac everyone realised it took a lot of courage from mr blair ... in a political situation that was not easy .
i wanted to pay homage to him as we all sat around the table and that 's what i did .
this negotiation shows that franco-german co-operation was constant at all times and perfect .
experience shows that when france and germany have flawless agreement , the construction of europe goes ahead normally .
european commission president jose manuel barroso it was a great result for the british presidency ...
what would be the signal to public opinion if we ca n't agree on a budget ?
this is indeed a very important political signal for europe .
europe is on the move .
polish prime minister kazimierz marcinkiewicz i consider myself a young man and i feel young now and all i can say to this is " yes , yes , yes !
we will make use of this money .
we will use it to catch up with the rich countries .
the idea of solidarity is what was important for this budget .
the idea of solidarity was born in poland 25 years ago and today it is uniting the european union .
german chancellor angela merkel the big cloud has been lifted from europe .
this deal is in the european interest .
it shows europe is capable of acting .
it is a good sign for the people in europe .
i think that we clearly played an important role but that is always the case as we are a big country .
austrian chancellor wolfgang schuessel i have the impression that we are moving , gradually , maybe slowly ... in the right direction .
what we need now is a united europe , not a divided europe .
hungarian prime minister ferenc gyurcsany hungary managed to defend its interests in those tough negotiations .
we fought hard and we welcome the deal .
swedish prime minister goran persson it is very wise that it was the british who got to handle the budget decision .
it was good for the union .
it would have been impossible for luxembourg to get this far ... and it would have been impossible for austria .
irish prime minister bertie ahern we have reached agreement on the future of europe ... the british presidency ... has finished on a high .
the future of -lsb- common agriculture policy -rsb- was central to these negotiations and we are happy with that area .
danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen there is reason to be happy that we got a deal at all , because that is politically very , very important for the eu .
we can now again get momentum after a year which has been a bit difficult .
the new german chancellor angela merkel has played an immensely positive role in the negotiations - in part by contributing in relations to both france and poland , and in part by , at a key moment , showing flexibility when it came to the overall expenditure ceiling .
luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker the fact that we were able to conclude the deal has to be applauded because it would have been a total drama , in fact , if we would n't have come to a good conclusion .
i would have wished a more ambitious budget , but i have to say that , taking into account all the political aspects and domestic aspects , people have to bear in mind that the deal is not the worst one we could have concluded .

britain has offered to cut its rebate to help fund the development of the eu 's 10 new members , while the european leaders have committed themselves to review all eu spending , including the common agricultural policy .
reaction to the deal has been generally positive .
uk prime minister tony blair at some point , you 've got to come up with a deal and the important thing is this : if we believe in enlargement , we had to do this deal now .
if we did n't , we were n't going to do it in the next year .
we would then move to annual budgets .
it would make it impossible for these new european countries to plan ahead and we would do real damage , not just to their cause , but to the cause of enlargement more generally .
so i do n't doubt that i 'll get a certain amount of criticism from people who say i 've gone too far , people who say i 've not gone far enough - but , in the end , this is about getting an agreement that allows europe to move forward .
french president jacques chirac everyone realised it took a lot of courage from mr blair ... in a political situation that was not easy .
i wanted to pay homage to him as we all sat around the table and that 's what i did .
this negotiation shows that franco-german co-operation was constant at all times and perfect .
experience shows that when france and germany have flawless agreement , the construction of europe goes ahead normally .
european commission president jose manuel barroso it was a great result for the british presidency ...
what would be the signal to public opinion if we ca n't agree on a budget ?
this is indeed a very important political signal for europe .
europe is on the move .
polish prime minister kazimierz marcinkiewicz i consider myself a young man and i feel young now and all i can say to this is " yes , yes , yes !
we will make use of this money .
we will use it to catch up with the rich countries .
the idea of solidarity is what was important for this budget .
the idea of solidarity was born in poland 25 years ago and today it is uniting the european union .
german chancellor angela merkel the big cloud has been lifted from europe .
this deal is in the european interest .
it shows europe is capable of acting .
it is a good sign for the people in europe .
i think that we clearly played an important role but that is always the case as we are a big country .
austrian chancellor wolfgang schuessel i have the impression that we are moving , gradually , maybe slowly ... in the right direction .
what we need now is a united europe , not a divided europe .
hungarian prime minister ferenc gyurcsany hungary managed to defend its interests in those tough negotiations .
we fought hard and we welcome the deal .
swedish prime minister goran persson it is very wise that it was the british who got to handle the budget decision .
it was good for the union .
it would have been impossible for luxembourg to get this far ... and it would have been impossible for austria .
irish prime minister bertie ahern we have reached agreement on the future of europe ... the british presidency ... has finished on a high .
