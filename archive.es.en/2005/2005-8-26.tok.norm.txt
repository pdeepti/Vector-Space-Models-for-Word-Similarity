but the battle for votes has also caught up with the times , and gone online . less than a month before likely federal elections in germany , there is a plethora of web sites poking fun at the various candidates .
internet surfers can watch a photomontage of the christian democrats ' angela merkel breakdancing or a boxing match between merkel and sitting chancellor gerhard schröder . while there is a lot of satire and silliness surrounding the parties and their candidates out there on the web , the targets of all the online barbs are taking cyberspace very seriously these days .
the internet is playing big during this campaign season . strategists at the social democrats ' campaign headquarters are helping chancellor schröder defend his title .
like the opposition , the spd has an entire department dedicated to looking after its web presence - around the clock .
the internet could play a decisive role , according to sebastian reichel of the spd 's campaign team , especially during such a short election campaign . " any party which does n't conduct its campaigning on the internet or sees it as just a sideline is missing a great opportunity not only to mobilize voters , but also to educate and bring them over to your side , " he said . besides explaining their party 's platform and presenting candidates , the social democrats ' site tells supporters how they can get involved , listen to podcasts , and donate to the party . the conservative opposition christian democrats are no less savvy when it comes to going after the digital generation .
they have their own podcast - called ikauder , after general secretary volker kauder - news ticker and links to sites that heap vitriol on the sitting government . bloggers away ! no other medium allows the campaigners to react as quickly to a political opponent 's slip-up and the financial costs are much lower than for more traditional forms of campaign advertising . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hottest trend in this year 's election is the weblog , or blog , a form of online diary in which politicians share their thoughts with voters . social democratic candidate niels annen from hamburg has publicized his day-to-day schedule for the last three weeks on his web site .
aside from his party 's platforms , readers can learn more - if not all - about niels annen himself . " i would n't include certain things about my private life , things i do n't believe belong in the public realm , " he said .
" but it 's more about personal impressions , or perhaps things that i 've felt at various times .
i do include them . " every day annen says he receives around a dozen responses to his blog .
sometimes the remarks are offensive , but annen says he is pleased with most of the comments and writes personal replies . " some who wrote once said : ' you 're too left-leaning for me , but keep it up .
it 's obvious you write things yourself , as opposed to many of your colleagues . '
that 's encouraging and is why i keep going . " crucial element surfing the internet is a matter of course for germany 's young people .
even if many are n't aware of the campaigning taking place online , media experts say internet ads are no longer just a campaign gimmick . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : build your own chancellor - a satirical web site soon , making appearances in tabloid-style programs on television , which chancellor schröder once called his most important campaign aid , wo n't be enough . " at the moment , election campaigns are changing .
traditional media , like tv , radio , and print still play a big role , " said jo groebel , director of the european institute for the media .
" that also has to do with the fact that most leading politicians are of a certain age and not necessarily used to employing online media in such a big way . " but that is changing .
one of the few prominent politicians who - in spite of his advanced years - has recognized the signs of the times is the liberals ' hermann otto solms , who is a candidate for the bundestag .
a few days ago he started writing his own blog .
it 's taking some getting used to , but solms is not about to give it up . " through the internet we have the opportunity to contact thousands of people simultaneously , " he said .
" there 's no better medium available .
and via the internet i meet ordinary people on a much broader scale .
that 's why it 's pushing aside traditional campaign appearances to such an extent . " dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de virtual battle between serbs and croats hackers in the former yugoslavia have been going at it .

" the chinese side expressed its concern over the textile products blocked at customs in eu countries , " a chinese commerce ministry spokeswoman told afp in describing thursday 's negotiations . european union negotiators said the backlog of products was " not in the interests of eu traders and consumers , " she said . according to the french trade ministry earlier this week , 48 million sweaters , 17 million pairs of trousers , some 500,000 blouses , 1.6 million t-shirts , 3.4 million bras and 1,470 tons of flax yarn are being held up . resolution of stand-off in interest of both parties " the atmosphere of the discussions with our chinese colleagues is , as could be expected , constructive and friendly , given that of course it 's in the interest of the two sides to resolve this problem as quickly as possible , " eu commission spokeswoman amelia torres told journalists in brussels thursday . eu officials in beijing refused to comment on the talks other than to say that negotiations had resumed in earnest friday . lu jianhua , director of the ministry of commerce 's foreign trade administration department , headed up the chinese side , while fritz-harald wenig , a trade director with the european commission , represented the eu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's textile exports to europe surged to 2.1 billion dollars in june , up 85 percent over the same month last year , as rush orders for chinese goods soared while negotiators hammered out the new quotas , china 's trade ministry said . a senior chinese trade official said part of the problem was that the eu and china agreed that the period between june 11 and july 20 was needed to set up mechanisms to monitor the textile trade and the implementation of the agreement . mass influx of chinese products " during this period , 10 categories of chinese products could be freely imported to eu without any application for licenses , and traders in both china and eu rushed -lrb- orders -rrb- in order to avoid the quantity controls , " the unnamed official said in a comment posted on the commerce ministry website .

tehran says it does not fear un sanctions . the un atomic watchdog agency , iaea , got its first taste of the iranian government under its new president mahmoud ahmadinejad .
on friday , iaea chief mohamed elbaradei met iran 's new nuclear program director and negotiator ali larijani in vienna to renew talks surrounding iran 's nuclear energy program that the west says is weapons-related .
iran has defied the international community by resuming work on making power reactor fuel that could also be used to make nuclear weapons but insists that it wants to continue talks with the european union on guaranteeing its atomic program is peaceful .
elbaradei and larijani will be discussing " issues related to international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- safeguards inspections and the current state of play , " spokeswoman melissa fleming said in confirming friday 's meeting .
eu 's role brought into question bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu-3 's negotiations with iran not to open the isfahan facility were for nought .
earlier this month activity was restarted despite claims that they will continue negotiations with the eu-3 - britain , france and germany - tehran has sent signals to the contrary as late as thursday .
larijani had challenged the role of the eu-3 as the leaders of diplomatic efforts over the iran 's nuclear program .
" based on what logic and agreement with the international atomic energy agency have the negotiations been limited and dependent on the three european countries ? "
larijani asked on iranian state television .
larijani signaled that iran may look towards widening involvement in the talks , saying that non-aligned countries had asked iran to explain why the negotiations have only been with the eu-3 .
the us viewed the suggestion with a large dose of skepticism , saying that the ploy was just an attempt by tehran to avoid talks over the issue .
" this is a typical tactic for the iranian government .
they will come up with proposals like this to try and change the subject , " said state department spokesman sean mccormack .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : past attempts by germany and the west to hinder iranian nuclear activities have been fruitless .
here , secretary of iran 's supreme national security council , hasan rowhani -lrb- l -rrb- and german foreign minister , joschka fischer at a 2003 press conference iran has accused the three european states of damaging the diplomatic effort by demanding iran abandon its work on the nuclear fuel cycle - the focus of fears iran could acquire the bomb - even though fuel work is technically permitted by the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- .
the eu-3 countered tehran 's claims , saying iran is to blame for the breakdown in the talks due to its decision earlier this month to resume uranium ore conversion work - the first step in the ultra-sensitive enrichment process which had been suspended .
the iaea board , which is to receive a report on iran on september 3 from elbaradei , also called on tehran to reinstate the suspension .
iran has refused , and could face referral to the un security council , which could impose international economic sanctions .
us and eu to make no early move bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin is currently opposed to economic sanctions against tehran economic sanctions in the near term are improbable however .
while waiting for the september 3 report and whether iran adheres to that day 's deadline , the united states and the european union have decided not to seek an iaea emergency meeting , diplomats said thursday .
an emergency session of the international atomic energy agency on september 6 , which the united states was seeking and which could lead to the referral of iran to the un security council for possible sanctions , is " not going to take place , " a senior eu diplomat told afp in vienna where the iaea is based .
the reason is clear .
russia , which has a large contract to build iran 's first nuclear reactor , had objected to holding such a special meeting ahead of a summit at united nations headquarters in new york from september 14-16 .
iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad and russian president vladimir putin are to attend the summit and russia " wanted to give room for what could happen in new york and not to miss an opportunity " for diplomacy , an eu diplomat said .
the diplomat was speaking about efforts to get iran to resume both the fuel suspension and talks with the eu that focus on winning guarantees that tehran will not make nuclear weapons . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu calls for emergency un meeting on iran mahmoud ahmadinejad faces the possibility of being brought before the un 's nuclear watchdog in his first week as iran 's president after the eu called for emergency talks on the islamic republic 's atomic program .

tehran says it does not fear un sanctions . the un atomic watchdog agency , iaea , got its first taste of the iranian government under its new president mahmoud ahmadinejad .
on friday , iaea chief mohamed elbaradei met iran 's new nuclear program director and negotiator ali larijani in vienna to renew talks surrounding iran 's nuclear energy program that the west says is weapons-related .
iran has defied the international community by resuming work on making power reactor fuel that could also be used to make nuclear weapons but insists that it wants to continue talks with the european union on guaranteeing its atomic program is peaceful .
elbaradei and larijani will be discussing " issues related to international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- safeguards inspections and the current state of play , " spokeswoman melissa fleming said in confirming friday 's meeting .
eu 's role brought into question bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu-3 's negotiations with iran not to open the isfahan facility were for nought .
earlier this month activity was restarted despite claims that they will continue negotiations with the eu-3 - britain , france and germany - tehran has sent signals to the contrary as late as thursday .
larijani had challenged the role of the eu-3 as the leaders of diplomatic efforts over the iran 's nuclear program .
" based on what logic and agreement with the international atomic energy agency have the negotiations been limited and dependent on the three european countries ? "
larijani asked on iranian state television .
larijani signaled that iran may look towards widening involvement in the talks , saying that non-aligned countries had asked iran to explain why the negotiations have only been with the eu-3 .
the us viewed the suggestion with a large dose of skepticism , saying that the ploy was just an attempt by tehran to avoid talks over the issue .
" this is a typical tactic for the iranian government .
they will come up with proposals like this to try and change the subject , " said state department spokesman sean mccormack .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : past attempts by germany and the west to hinder iranian nuclear activities have been fruitless .
here , secretary of iran 's supreme national security council , hasan rowhani -lrb- l -rrb- and german foreign minister , joschka fischer at a 2003 press conference iran has accused the three european states of damaging the diplomatic effort by demanding iran abandon its work on the nuclear fuel cycle - the focus of fears iran could acquire the bomb - even though fuel work is technically permitted by the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- .
the eu-3 countered tehran 's claims , saying iran is to blame for the breakdown in the talks due to its decision earlier this month to resume uranium ore conversion work - the first step in the ultra-sensitive enrichment process which had been suspended .
the iaea board , which is to receive a report on iran on september 3 from elbaradei , also called on tehran to reinstate the suspension .
iran has refused , and could face referral to the un security council , which could impose international economic sanctions .
us and eu to make no early move bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin is currently opposed to economic sanctions against tehran economic sanctions in the near term are improbable however .
while waiting for the september 3 report and whether iran adheres to that day 's deadline , the united states and the european union have decided not to seek an iaea emergency meeting , diplomats said thursday .
an emergency session of the international atomic energy agency on september 6 , which the united states was seeking and which could lead to the referral of iran to the un security council for possible sanctions , is " not going to take place , " a senior eu diplomat told afp in vienna where the iaea is based .
the reason is clear .
russia , which has a large contract to build iran 's first nuclear reactor , had objected to holding such a special meeting ahead of a summit at united nations headquarters in new york from september 14-16 .
iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad and russian president vladimir putin are to attend the summit and russia " wanted to give room for what could happen in new york and not to miss an opportunity " for diplomacy , an eu diplomat said .
the diplomat was speaking about efforts to get iran to resume both the fuel suspension and talks with the eu that focus on winning guarantees that tehran will not make nuclear weapons . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu calls for emergency un meeting on iran mahmoud ahmadinejad faces the possibility of being brought before the un 's nuclear watchdog in his first week as iran 's president after the eu called for emergency talks on the islamic republic 's atomic program .

bernhard glocksin is encouraging members of the audience to smoke joints while taking in performances of " la princesse jaune -lrb- the oriental princess -rrb- " , the one-act druggy opera by camille saint-saens . the opera tells the story of kornélis , a man in love with a portrait of a japanese princess .
under the sway of a hallucinogenic potion which he believes will unite him with the object of his infatuation , he confuses the portrait with his own fiancée . his increasingly long trips into a psychedelic version of japan within his own imagination eventually prevent kornélis from distinguishing between fantasy and reality as he slips further away from his real life love . artistic license in an attempt to create that far-out feeling , the actors themselves will also smoke pot onstage while the audience mellow out in the stalls . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glocksin maintains that the opera experience will be " improved with a few joints " while the opera house asserts that artistic license will protect it from drug laws . " it ’ s a test to see just what we can get away with , " glocksin said . according to german drug laws , however , the opera may be taking a step too far in blurring the lines between art and life .
legal hurdles drug laws concerning cannabis in germany vary from state to state and a fine or referral for prosecution can be administered for personal possession of anything from six to 30 grams .
in berlin , anything up to 10 grams is considered to be " for personal use " and will often be overlooked .
smoking dope in public places , however , can be interpreted by law as an offense against the german constitution and is therefore a punishable act .
as germany does not carry laws like those in neighboring holland which permit establishments with special licenses to sell and allow cannabis to be used on the premises , a location allowing drug consumption on-site would be breaking the law .
enforcement of these laws on opening night may make the first performance of " la princesse jaune " even more surreal .
" la princesse jaune -lrb- the oriental princess -rrb- " by camille saint-saens opens at the neuköllner oper on sept .

tehran says it does not fear un sanctions . the un atomic watchdog agency , iaea , got its first taste of the iranian government under its new president mahmoud ahmadinejad .
on friday , iaea chief mohamed elbaradei met iran 's new nuclear program director and negotiator ali larijani in vienna to renew talks surrounding iran 's nuclear energy program that the west says is weapons-related .
iran has defied the international community by resuming work on making power reactor fuel that could also be used to make nuclear weapons but insists that it wants to continue talks with the european union on guaranteeing its atomic program is peaceful .
elbaradei and larijani will be discussing " issues related to international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- safeguards inspections and the current state of play , " spokeswoman melissa fleming said in confirming friday 's meeting .
eu 's role brought into question bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu-3 's negotiations with iran not to open the isfahan facility were for nought .
earlier this month activity was restarted despite claims that they will continue negotiations with the eu-3 - britain , france and germany - tehran has sent signals to the contrary as late as thursday .
larijani had challenged the role of the eu-3 as the leaders of diplomatic efforts over the iran 's nuclear program .
" based on what logic and agreement with the international atomic energy agency have the negotiations been limited and dependent on the three european countries ? "
larijani asked on iranian state television .
larijani signaled that iran may look towards widening involvement in the talks , saying that non-aligned countries had asked iran to explain why the negotiations have only been with the eu-3 .
the us viewed the suggestion with a large dose of skepticism , saying that the ploy was just an attempt by tehran to avoid talks over the issue .
" this is a typical tactic for the iranian government .
they will come up with proposals like this to try and change the subject , " said state department spokesman sean mccormack .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : past attempts by germany and the west to hinder iranian nuclear activities have been fruitless .
here , secretary of iran 's supreme national security council , hasan rowhani -lrb- l -rrb- and german foreign minister , joschka fischer at a 2003 press conference iran has accused the three european states of damaging the diplomatic effort by demanding iran abandon its work on the nuclear fuel cycle - the focus of fears iran could acquire the bomb - even though fuel work is technically permitted by the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- .
the eu-3 countered tehran 's claims , saying iran is to blame for the breakdown in the talks due to its decision earlier this month to resume uranium ore conversion work - the first step in the ultra-sensitive enrichment process which had been suspended .
the iaea board , which is to receive a report on iran on september 3 from elbaradei , also called on tehran to reinstate the suspension .

tehran says it does not fear un sanctions . the un atomic watchdog agency , iaea , got its first taste of the iranian government under its new president mahmoud ahmadinejad .
on friday , iaea chief mohamed elbaradei met iran 's new nuclear program director and negotiator ali larijani in vienna to renew talks surrounding iran 's nuclear energy program that the west says is weapons-related .
iran has defied the international community by resuming work on making power reactor fuel that could also be used to make nuclear weapons but insists that it wants to continue talks with the european union on guaranteeing its atomic program is peaceful .
elbaradei and larijani will be discussing " issues related to international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- safeguards inspections and the current state of play , " spokeswoman melissa fleming said in confirming friday 's meeting .
eu 's role brought into question bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu-3 's negotiations with iran not to open the isfahan facility were for nought .
earlier this month activity was restarted despite claims that they will continue negotiations with the eu-3 - britain , france and germany - tehran has sent signals to the contrary as late as thursday .
larijani had challenged the role of the eu-3 as the leaders of diplomatic efforts over the iran 's nuclear program .
" based on what logic and agreement with the international atomic energy agency have the negotiations been limited and dependent on the three european countries ? "
larijani asked on iranian state television .
larijani signaled that iran may look towards widening involvement in the talks , saying that non-aligned countries had asked iran to explain why the negotiations have only been with the eu-3 .
the us viewed the suggestion with a large dose of skepticism , saying that the ploy was just an attempt by tehran to avoid talks over the issue .
" this is a typical tactic for the iranian government .
they will come up with proposals like this to try and change the subject , " said state department spokesman sean mccormack .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : past attempts by germany and the west to hinder iranian nuclear activities have been fruitless .
here , secretary of iran 's supreme national security council , hasan rowhani -lrb- l -rrb- and german foreign minister , joschka fischer at a 2003 press conference iran has accused the three european states of damaging the diplomatic effort by demanding iran abandon its work on the nuclear fuel cycle - the focus of fears iran could acquire the bomb - even though fuel work is technically permitted by the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- .
the eu-3 countered tehran 's claims , saying iran is to blame for the breakdown in the talks due to its decision earlier this month to resume uranium ore conversion work - the first step in the ultra-sensitive enrichment process which had been suspended .
the iaea board , which is to receive a report on iran on september 3 from elbaradei , also called on tehran to reinstate the suspension .
iran has refused , and could face referral to the un security council , which could impose international economic sanctions .

1 summit , chancellor candidate angela merkel has renewed her call for the eu to offer turkey a " privileged partnership " instead of full membership . merkel penned the letter along with christian social union leader edmund stoiber , timing it to hit the desk of center-right leaders just before an informal meeting on thursday of eu foreign ministers , where eu accession negotiations with turkey will be discussed . turkey is expected to open membership negotiations with the eu on oct .
3 . " we are fully convinced that accepting turkey would overburden the eu politically , economically and socially and would endanger the european integration process , " the letter , addressed to 11 european leaders , said . the letter cited " the continuing refusal of turkey to recognize the republic of cyprus , a member state , under international law " as an obstacle to turkish membership , and also noted " still-significant problems in upholding and imposing human rights . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and edmund stoiber merkel and stoiber underlined that the eu was interested in a close connection between turkey and the european union , but " we ask you to make clear that the framework of the negotiations also includes the perspective of a privileged partnership with turkey . " a copy of the letter also went to the current eu president , british prime minister tony blair , and eu commission president jose barroso . the response from joschka fischer , german foreign minister , was heated . " the attitude of ms. merkel and mr. stoiber is dangerously blind considering the promises that have been made by german governments over the past 43 years , from adenauer to kohl , " fischer told the dpa news agency . wo n't " overplay " turkey on monday this week , german conservatives said they would not let the turkey issue hijack the campaign in front of the country 's general election , scheduled for sept .
18 .
but the interior minister of the state of bavaria , günther beckstein , said turkey had become an election issue and " should not be neglected . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günther beckstein " turkey would now be the second most important country in a european union and in a few years … turkey would be the leading nation , more than france , italy or austria , the netherlands , portugal and greece together , " he said . beckstein said the rejections by france and the netherlands of a new eu constitution earlier this year showed that eu citizens were not ready for another significant expansion of the union . wolfgang schäuble , foreign affairs adviser in merkel 's pre-election team , echoed those sentiments in an interview with the international herald tribune .
he also raised questions about turkey 's identity . " a part of turkey is europe , just like russia , " he said in the interview .
" but a far bigger part of both turkey and russia is definitely not in europe .
that is why russia could never really integrate into the eu . " the position puts a possible merkel government at odds with the current eu position as well as with that of the united states , with which merkel has said she wants a closer relationship . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang schäuble the us considers turkey of great strategic importance and would like to see the country taken into the european fold .
during a trip last month to washington , schäuble said he explained his party 's position to us secretary of state condoleezza rice . " i think condoleezza rice was satisfied with my arguments , " he said . repeat performance it is not the first time merkel has pushed for an eu relationship with turkey which falls short of full membership .
she brought the topic up a year ago , just three weeks before the eu commission released a report on turkey and a few days before regional elections in two eastern german states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel in istanbul then there was disagreement over the proposal even within her own party .
fellow christian democrat and former defense minister volker rühe reminded merkel that the conservative government of helmut kohl had in 1997 signed an agreement laying out turkey 's official eu candidate status .
he said closing the door would destabilize the country and could strengthen anti-european sentiment there . in brussels , merkel 's approach met with astonishment .

1 summit , chancellor candidate angela merkel has renewed her call for the eu to offer turkey a " privileged partnership " instead of full membership . merkel penned the letter along with christian social union leader edmund stoiber , timing it to hit the desk of center-right leaders just before an informal meeting on thursday of eu foreign ministers , where eu accession negotiations with turkey will be discussed . turkey is expected to open membership negotiations with the eu on oct .
3 . " we are fully convinced that accepting turkey would overburden the eu politically , economically and socially and would endanger the european integration process , " the letter , addressed to 11 european leaders , said . the letter cited " the continuing refusal of turkey to recognize the republic of cyprus , a member state , under international law " as an obstacle to turkish membership , and also noted " still-significant problems in upholding and imposing human rights . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and edmund stoiber merkel and stoiber underlined that the eu was interested in a close connection between turkey and the european union , but " we ask you to make clear that the framework of the negotiations also includes the perspective of a privileged partnership with turkey . " a copy of the letter also went to the current eu president , british prime minister tony blair , and eu commission president jose barroso . the response from joschka fischer , german foreign minister , was heated . " the attitude of ms. merkel and mr. stoiber is dangerously blind considering the promises that have been made by german governments over the past 43 years , from adenauer to kohl , " fischer told the dpa news agency . wo n't " overplay " turkey on monday this week , german conservatives said they would not let the turkey issue hijack the campaign in front of the country 's general election , scheduled for sept .
18 .
but the interior minister of the state of bavaria , günther beckstein , said turkey had become an election issue and " should not be neglected . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günther beckstein " turkey would now be the second most important country in a european union and in a few years … turkey would be the leading nation , more than france , italy or austria , the netherlands , portugal and greece together , " he said . beckstein said the rejections by france and the netherlands of a new eu constitution earlier this year showed that eu citizens were not ready for another significant expansion of the union . wolfgang schäuble , foreign affairs adviser in merkel 's pre-election team , echoed those sentiments in an interview with the international herald tribune .
he also raised questions about turkey 's identity . " a part of turkey is europe , just like russia , " he said in the interview .
" but a far bigger part of both turkey and russia is definitely not in europe .
that is why russia could never really integrate into the eu . " the position puts a possible merkel government at odds with the current eu position as well as with that of the united states , with which merkel has said she wants a closer relationship . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang schäuble the us considers turkey of great strategic importance and would like to see the country taken into the european fold .
during a trip last month to washington , schäuble said he explained his party 's position to us secretary of state condoleezza rice . " i think condoleezza rice was satisfied with my arguments , " he said . repeat performance it is not the first time merkel has pushed for an eu relationship with turkey which falls short of full membership .
she brought the topic up a year ago , just three weeks before the eu commission released a report on turkey and a few days before regional elections in two eastern german states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel in istanbul then there was disagreement over the proposal even within her own party .
fellow christian democrat and former defense minister volker rühe reminded merkel that the conservative government of helmut kohl had in 1997 signed an agreement laying out turkey 's official eu candidate status .
he said closing the door would destabilize the country and could strengthen anti-european sentiment there . in brussels , merkel 's approach met with astonishment .
jean-claude juncker , prime minister of luxembourg and then-eu president , distanced himself , saying turkey had enjoyed " candidate status " for years and it was too late to offer it a privileged partnership . cdu foreign affairs expert schäuble said despite the position of his party , a merkel government would not stop the beginning of accession negotiations between the eu and turkey .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 26.08.2005 looking back on 25 years of solidarity großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solidarnosc today is but a shadow of its former self solidarnosc , the workers ' union that played an important role in the fall of communism in poland , was founded 25 years ago .
what began as a group of dissident intellectuals became an unstoppable force for change . the poland that begat solidarnosc , or solidarity , a quarter century ago is hardly recognizable today .
then , poland was a totalitarian , satellite state of the soviet union , under moscow 's firm hand .
today , poland is a democratic country and a member of the european union as well as nato .
much of that development is due to the influence of the trade union that got its start in the gdansk shipyards in 1980 . the origins of solidarity go back even further , to 1976 , when a " worker 's defense committee " was founded by a group of dissident intellectuals after several thousand workers who had been on strike were attacked and jailed by authorities in various cities .
in 1979 , the committee published a charter of worker 's rights . in 1980 , a new wave of strikes again broke out , this time sparked by a seemingly insignificant event .
the communist government had raised the price of meat in the cafeteria of the lenin shipyards in the northern industrial city of gdansk .
a female worker had complained about the price hike and was fired . that led 17,000 workers to put down their tools and barricade themselves inside the plant under the leadership of lech walesa , an electrician at the shipyard . by mid-august , strikes had spread throughout the country and millions of polish white and blue-collar workers took to the streets demanding better working conditions , even though only 10 years earlier , similar strikes had ended in bloodshed with dozens of people killed by machine gun fire and over 1,000 injured . bildunterschrift : august 30 , 1980 , one day before signing the agreement with the government , jubilant solidarity members carry their leader lech walesa on their shoulders but on august 31 , 1980 , after weeks of the strike action , the workers in the shipyard reached their goal .
the strike movement , which would soon be formally known as solidarity , was accepted as an independent trade union . " finally we have an independent union under our own administration , " said lech walesa .
" we now have the right to strike and we are going to demand more rights soon . " brief period of freedom organizers were anything but sure of their victory , though , even when , at the end of that august , the government signed the " gdansk treaty " with its 21 demands , including freedom of expression , a free trade union and the right to strike . " getting the right to have an independent trade union was a breakthrough , " said bogdan lis , one of the founders of solidarity .
" it was so unbelievable that we could only wonder then how long it would last . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : general wojciech jaruzelski , poland 's last communist-era leader in warsaw , poland , may 23 , 2005 .
the unionists got their answer 500 days later , when the former defense minister , general wojciech jaruzelski , who took over the reins of government in february 1981 , took away the new-found freedoms . " i hereby proclaim martial law in all of poland , " he announced on television as a shocked nation watched . martial law lasted two years after that and the communist leaders did what they could to cripple the solidarity movement .
government critics and union adherents were put in internment camps , including the leadership circle around walesa .
the party tried to rid the country of what it considered a trade union disease . dogged drive for freedom while forced underground , the drive for freedom was not easily stopped , according to wladyslaw bartoszewski , one-time chair of the polish writers association and polish foreign minister in the 1990s . " the breakup of the trade unions was a step that can not be without consequences , " he said after his release from an internment camp in october 1982 .
" many have been released from prison , but many are still behind bars , even renowned writers and professors .
there are many who are still being arrested and sentenced , many women among them .
we catholics in poland are very upset and worried . " lech walesa himself was arrested and stayed under house arrest until the end of 1982 .
but the movement he led , although officially dissolved by parliament in 1982 and driven underground , remained active .
the unrest in the country could no longer be quieted by draconian measures from on high . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers at the gdansk shipyard in 1988 , a new wave of strikes and labor unrest spread across the country , and high on the list of strikers ' demands was government recognition of solidarity .
general jaruzelski announced he was ready to talk with the opposition and in april 1989 , the government agreed to legalize the trade union and allow it to participate in free elections to a bicameral polish parliament . in 1990 , solidarity experienced its perhaps sweetest triumph when walesa was elected president .
but at the same time , that marked the beginning of its long demise .
the movement began drifting apart with internal fighting over interests and the speed of reforms leading to its losing popularity and influence .
even walesa , a national hero , became a target for criticism with his high-handedness .
he narrowly lost a bid for re-election in 1995 to a former communist , aleksander kwasniewski , head of the democratic left alliance . shadow of its former self today solidarnosc has little influence in polish politics and has returned to its roots as a trade union .
but with just under a million members , it even has little sway in company policy .
at its height , it counted ten million members in its ranks , in a country of just under 40 million . walesa announced he was leaving the union on its 25th anniversary , saying its goals today were very different than the ones from its early days .
solidarity 's golden days , and its great achievements , were behind it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lech walesa in 2004 " with it there would have been no german reunification , no triumph over communism , " he said , adding that there are two very different parts to the solidarity story and they should not be confused .

" i hereby proclaim martial law in all of poland , " he announced on television as a shocked nation watched . martial law lasted two years after that and the communist leaders did what they could to cripple the solidarity movement .
government critics and union adherents were put in internment camps , including the leadership circle around walesa .
the party tried to rid the country of what it considered a trade union disease . dogged drive for freedom while forced underground , the drive for freedom was not easily stopped , according to wladyslaw bartoszewski , one-time chair of the polish writers association and polish foreign minister in the 1990s . " the breakup of the trade unions was a step that can not be without consequences , " he said after his release from an internment camp in october 1982 .
" many have been released from prison , but many are still behind bars , even renowned writers and professors .
there are many who are still being arrested and sentenced , many women among them .
we catholics in poland are very upset and worried . " lech walesa himself was arrested and stayed under house arrest until the end of 1982 .
but the movement he led , although officially dissolved by parliament in 1982 and driven underground , remained active .
the unrest in the country could no longer be quieted by draconian measures from on high . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers at the gdansk shipyard in 1988 , a new wave of strikes and labor unrest spread across the country , and high on the list of strikers ' demands was government recognition of solidarity .
general jaruzelski announced he was ready to talk with the opposition and in april 1989 , the government agreed to legalize the trade union and allow it to participate in free elections to a bicameral polish parliament . in 1990 , solidarity experienced its perhaps sweetest triumph when walesa was elected president .
but at the same time , that marked the beginning of its long demise .
the movement began drifting apart with internal fighting over interests and the speed of reforms leading to its losing popularity and influence .
even walesa , a national hero , became a target for criticism with his high-handedness .
he narrowly lost a bid for re-election in 1995 to a former communist , aleksander kwasniewski , head of the democratic left alliance . shadow of its former self today solidarnosc has little influence in polish politics and has returned to its roots as a trade union .
but with just under a million members , it even has little sway in company policy .
at its height , it counted ten million members in its ranks , in a country of just under 40 million . walesa announced he was leaving the union on its 25th anniversary , saying its goals today were very different than the ones from its early days .
solidarity 's golden days , and its great achievements , were behind it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lech walesa in 2004 " with it there would have been no german reunification , no triumph over communism , " he said , adding that there are two very different parts to the solidarity story and they should not be confused .

what began as a group of dissident intellectuals became an unstoppable force for change . the poland that begat solidarnosc , or solidarity , a quarter century ago is hardly recognizable today .
then , poland was a totalitarian , satellite state of the soviet union , under moscow 's firm hand .
today , poland is a democratic country and a member of the european union as well as nato .
much of that development is due to the influence of the trade union that got its start in the gdansk shipyards in 1980 . the origins of solidarity go back even further , to 1976 , when a " worker 's defense committee " was founded by a group of dissident intellectuals after several thousand workers who had been on strike were attacked and jailed by authorities in various cities .
in 1979 , the committee published a charter of worker 's rights . in 1980 , a new wave of strikes again broke out , this time sparked by a seemingly insignificant event .
the communist government had raised the price of meat in the cafeteria of the lenin shipyards in the northern industrial city of gdansk .
a female worker had complained about the price hike and was fired . that led 17,000 workers to put down their tools and barricade themselves inside the plant under the leadership of lech walesa , an electrician at the shipyard . by mid-august , strikes had spread throughout the country and millions of polish white and blue-collar workers took to the streets demanding better working conditions , even though only 10 years earlier , similar strikes had ended in bloodshed with dozens of people killed by machine gun fire and over 1,000 injured . bildunterschrift : august 30 , 1980 , one day before signing the agreement with the government , jubilant solidarity members carry their leader lech walesa on their shoulders but on august 31 , 1980 , after weeks of the strike action , the workers in the shipyard reached their goal .
the strike movement , which would soon be formally known as solidarity , was accepted as an independent trade union . " finally we have an independent union under our own administration , " said lech walesa .
" we now have the right to strike and we are going to demand more rights soon . " brief period of freedom organizers were anything but sure of their victory , though , even when , at the end of that august , the government signed the " gdansk treaty " with its 21 demands , including freedom of expression , a free trade union and the right to strike .

tehran says it does not fear un sanctions . the un atomic watchdog agency , iaea , got its first taste of the iranian government under its new president mahmoud ahmadinejad .
on friday , iaea chief mohamed elbaradei met iran 's new nuclear program director and negotiator ali larijani in vienna to renew talks surrounding iran 's nuclear energy program that the west says is weapons-related .
iran has defied the international community by resuming work on making power reactor fuel that could also be used to make nuclear weapons but insists that it wants to continue talks with the european union on guaranteeing its atomic program is peaceful .
elbaradei and larijani will be discussing " issues related to international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- safeguards inspections and the current state of play , " spokeswoman melissa fleming said in confirming friday 's meeting .
eu 's role brought into question bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu-3 's negotiations with iran not to open the isfahan facility were for nought .
earlier this month activity was restarted despite claims that they will continue negotiations with the eu-3 - britain , france and germany - tehran has sent signals to the contrary as late as thursday .
larijani had challenged the role of the eu-3 as the leaders of diplomatic efforts over the iran 's nuclear program .
" based on what logic and agreement with the international atomic energy agency have the negotiations been limited and dependent on the three european countries ? "
larijani asked on iranian state television .
larijani signaled that iran may look towards widening involvement in the talks , saying that non-aligned countries had asked iran to explain why the negotiations have only been with the eu-3 .
the us viewed the suggestion with a large dose of skepticism , saying that the ploy was just an attempt by tehran to avoid talks over the issue .
" this is a typical tactic for the iranian government .
they will come up with proposals like this to try and change the subject , " said state department spokesman sean mccormack .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : past attempts by germany and the west to hinder iranian nuclear activities have been fruitless .
here , secretary of iran 's supreme national security council , hasan rowhani -lrb- l -rrb- and german foreign minister , joschka fischer at a 2003 press conference iran has accused the three european states of damaging the diplomatic effort by demanding iran abandon its work on the nuclear fuel cycle - the focus of fears iran could acquire the bomb - even though fuel work is technically permitted by the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- .
the eu-3 countered tehran 's claims , saying iran is to blame for the breakdown in the talks due to its decision earlier this month to resume uranium ore conversion work - the first step in the ultra-sensitive enrichment process which had been suspended .
the iaea board , which is to receive a report on iran on september 3 from elbaradei , also called on tehran to reinstate the suspension .
iran has refused , and could face referral to the un security council , which could impose international economic sanctions .
us and eu to make no early move bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin is currently opposed to economic sanctions against tehran economic sanctions in the near term are improbable however .
while waiting for the september 3 report and whether iran adheres to that day 's deadline , the united states and the european union have decided not to seek an iaea emergency meeting , diplomats said thursday .
an emergency session of the international atomic energy agency on september 6 , which the united states was seeking and which could lead to the referral of iran to the un security council for possible sanctions , is " not going to take place , " a senior eu diplomat told afp in vienna where the iaea is based .
the reason is clear .
russia , which has a large contract to build iran 's first nuclear reactor , had objected to holding such a special meeting ahead of a summit at united nations headquarters in new york from september 14-16 .
iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad and russian president vladimir putin are to attend the summit and russia " wanted to give room for what could happen in new york and not to miss an opportunity " for diplomacy , an eu diplomat said .
the diplomat was speaking about efforts to get iran to resume both the fuel suspension and talks with the eu that focus on winning guarantees that tehran will not make nuclear weapons . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu calls for emergency un meeting on iran mahmoud ahmadinejad faces the possibility of being brought before the un 's nuclear watchdog in his first week as iran 's president after the eu called for emergency talks on the islamic republic 's atomic program .

bernhard glocksin is encouraging members of the audience to smoke joints while taking in performances of " la princesse jaune -lrb- the oriental princess -rrb- " , the one-act druggy opera by camille saint-saens . the opera tells the story of kornélis , a man in love with a portrait of a japanese princess .
under the sway of a hallucinogenic potion which he believes will unite him with the object of his infatuation , he confuses the portrait with his own fiancée . his increasingly long trips into a psychedelic version of japan within his own imagination eventually prevent kornélis from distinguishing between fantasy and reality as he slips further away from his real life love . artistic license in an attempt to create that far-out feeling , the actors themselves will also smoke pot onstage while the audience mellow out in the stalls . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glocksin maintains that the opera experience will be " improved with a few joints " while the opera house asserts that artistic license will protect it from drug laws . " it ’ s a test to see just what we can get away with , " glocksin said . according to german drug laws , however , the opera may be taking a step too far in blurring the lines between art and life .
legal hurdles drug laws concerning cannabis in germany vary from state to state and a fine or referral for prosecution can be administered for personal possession of anything from six to 30 grams .
in berlin , anything up to 10 grams is considered to be " for personal use " and will often be overlooked .
smoking dope in public places , however , can be interpreted by law as an offense against the german constitution and is therefore a punishable act .
as germany does not carry laws like those in neighboring holland which permit establishments with special licenses to sell and allow cannabis to be used on the premises , a location allowing drug consumption on-site would be breaking the law .
enforcement of these laws on opening night may make the first performance of " la princesse jaune " even more surreal .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 26.08.2005 study : homeopathy no better than placebo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the lancet " says this medicine is no more effective than sugar water homeopathic treatment is no more effective than a placebo , the dummy substance used in medical trials , according to a study appearing in the british medical weekly , " the lancet . " the renowned medical journal said in a hard-hitting editorial called " the end of homeopathy " that the time for more studies is over and doctors should be honest with patients about homeopathy 's " lack of benefit . " the author of the article , dr. matthias egger from the university of berne , said he and associates in britain and switzerland searched 19 electronic databases covering the period from 1995 to 2003 . they compared 110 trials of homeopathic remedies against a placebo with 110 trials of conventional medicines , which were also tested against a placebo . the ailments being treated in these trials included respiratory-tract infections , pollen allergies and asthma , gynecological and obstetric problems , muscle and joint ache and intestinal upsets . the researchers found that , in small trials which they deemed to be of poor quality , both homeopathic and conventional medicines appeared to fare better against placebos .
but in larger trials that were of high quality , they found no convincing evidence that homeopathy worked better than placebos . like with like homeopathy is based on the principle of treating like with like , also called the law of similary . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the homeopathic practitioner generally looks at the totality of symptoms of a given case , then chooses a remedy that has been reported to produce a similar set of symptoms in healthy subjects .
this remedy is usually given in extremely low concentrations . for example , a person with an allergy would be given an ultra-diluted dose of an agent that would cause the same symptoms . saxon founder the theory of homeopathy was developed by samuel hahnemann , a physician from saxony , who first published it in 1796 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : samuel hahnemann came up with the theory behind homeopathy homeopathy went into decline in the 20th century with the rise of antibiotics and other modern medicines , but in the past decade has staged a comeback , igniting controversy at the same time . over the past two decades , there has been a boom in both the use of homeopathic remedies and visits to homeopathic practitioners .
analysts say there are several reasons for this .
homeopathic treatment is reported by many to be effective . others are disaffected with the traditional medical establishment , which they consider cold and uncaring .
homeopathic practitioners often spend much more time dealing with their patients than do conventional practitioners .
homeopathic preparations also have few if any side effects and are generally much cheaper than conventional medications . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics , however , consider homeopathy to be unscientific and lacking any plausible mechanism .
they often view homeopathy as a pseudoscientific remnant from the age of alchemy , when the behavior of chemical and biological phenomena were poorly understood . in 2002 , the american illusionist and skeptic james randi offered $ 1 million to anyone able to prove , under observed conditions in a laboratory , that homeopathic remedies can really cure people .
thus far , no one has passed the preliminary tests . popular in germany even so , homeopathy has a fervent vocal lobby of supporters , and health insurance schemes in europe are under increasing pressure to include it in their coverage . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , where homeopathy is very popular , there are about 6,000 physicians specializing in the field .
in 1978 , it was recognized as " special form of therapy , " meaning the medication was freed from the usual requirements of proven efficacy .
but since the beginning of 2004 , homeopathic medications , with a few exceptions , are no longer covered by public health insurance .
many private health insurers continue to cover homeopathy . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de homeopathy seeks more acknowledgement while meeting with practitioners of homeopathy from over 40 countries at a congress in berlin , the german association of homeopathic doctors demanded wider recognition for the 200-year-old alternative medical science .

1 summit , chancellor candidate angela merkel has renewed her call for the eu to offer turkey a " privileged partnership " instead of full membership . merkel penned the letter along with christian social union leader edmund stoiber , timing it to hit the desk of center-right leaders just before an informal meeting on thursday of eu foreign ministers , where eu accession negotiations with turkey will be discussed . turkey is expected to open membership negotiations with the eu on oct .
3 . " we are fully convinced that accepting turkey would overburden the eu politically , economically and socially and would endanger the european integration process , " the letter , addressed to 11 european leaders , said . the letter cited " the continuing refusal of turkey to recognize the republic of cyprus , a member state , under international law " as an obstacle to turkish membership , and also noted " still-significant problems in upholding and imposing human rights . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and edmund stoiber merkel and stoiber underlined that the eu was interested in a close connection between turkey and the european union , but " we ask you to make clear that the framework of the negotiations also includes the perspective of a privileged partnership with turkey . " a copy of the letter also went to the current eu president , british prime minister tony blair , and eu commission president jose barroso . the response from joschka fischer , german foreign minister , was heated . " the attitude of ms. merkel and mr. stoiber is dangerously blind considering the promises that have been made by german governments over the past 43 years , from adenauer to kohl , " fischer told the dpa news agency . wo n't " overplay " turkey on monday this week , german conservatives said they would not let the turkey issue hijack the campaign in front of the country 's general election , scheduled for sept .
18 .
but the interior minister of the state of bavaria , günther beckstein , said turkey had become an election issue and " should not be neglected . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günther beckstein " turkey would now be the second most important country in a european union and in a few years … turkey would be the leading nation , more than france , italy or austria , the netherlands , portugal and greece together , " he said . beckstein said the rejections by france and the netherlands of a new eu constitution earlier this year showed that eu citizens were not ready for another significant expansion of the union . wolfgang schäuble , foreign affairs adviser in merkel 's pre-election team , echoed those sentiments in an interview with the international herald tribune .
he also raised questions about turkey 's identity . " a part of turkey is europe , just like russia , " he said in the interview .
" but a far bigger part of both turkey and russia is definitely not in europe .
that is why russia could never really integrate into the eu . " the position puts a possible merkel government at odds with the current eu position as well as with that of the united states , with which merkel has said she wants a closer relationship . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang schäuble the us considers turkey of great strategic importance and would like to see the country taken into the european fold .
during a trip last month to washington , schäuble said he explained his party 's position to us secretary of state condoleezza rice . " i think condoleezza rice was satisfied with my arguments , " he said . repeat performance it is not the first time merkel has pushed for an eu relationship with turkey which falls short of full membership .
she brought the topic up a year ago , just three weeks before the eu commission released a report on turkey and a few days before regional elections in two eastern german states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel in istanbul then there was disagreement over the proposal even within her own party .
fellow christian democrat and former defense minister volker rühe reminded merkel that the conservative government of helmut kohl had in 1997 signed an agreement laying out turkey 's official eu candidate status .
he said closing the door would destabilize the country and could strengthen anti-european sentiment there . in brussels , merkel 's approach met with astonishment .
jean-claude juncker , prime minister of luxembourg and then-eu president , distanced himself , saying turkey had enjoyed " candidate status " for years and it was too late to offer it a privileged partnership . cdu foreign affairs expert schäuble said despite the position of his party , a merkel government would not stop the beginning of accession negotiations between the eu and turkey .
he said germany would stand by the european council 's decision that the results of negotiations should be kept open . " the negotiations could last for at least 10 years , " he said .
" things could be very different in 10 years ' time .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 26.08.2005 looking back on 25 years of solidarity großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solidarnosc today is but a shadow of its former self solidarnosc , the workers ' union that played an important role in the fall of communism in poland , was founded 25 years ago .
what began as a group of dissident intellectuals became an unstoppable force for change . the poland that begat solidarnosc , or solidarity , a quarter century ago is hardly recognizable today .
then , poland was a totalitarian , satellite state of the soviet union , under moscow 's firm hand .
today , poland is a democratic country and a member of the european union as well as nato .
much of that development is due to the influence of the trade union that got its start in the gdansk shipyards in 1980 . the origins of solidarity go back even further , to 1976 , when a " worker 's defense committee " was founded by a group of dissident intellectuals after several thousand workers who had been on strike were attacked and jailed by authorities in various cities .
in 1979 , the committee published a charter of worker 's rights . in 1980 , a new wave of strikes again broke out , this time sparked by a seemingly insignificant event .
the communist government had raised the price of meat in the cafeteria of the lenin shipyards in the northern industrial city of gdansk .
a female worker had complained about the price hike and was fired . that led 17,000 workers to put down their tools and barricade themselves inside the plant under the leadership of lech walesa , an electrician at the shipyard . by mid-august , strikes had spread throughout the country and millions of polish white and blue-collar workers took to the streets demanding better working conditions , even though only 10 years earlier , similar strikes had ended in bloodshed with dozens of people killed by machine gun fire and over 1,000 injured . bildunterschrift : august 30 , 1980 , one day before signing the agreement with the government , jubilant solidarity members carry their leader lech walesa on their shoulders but on august 31 , 1980 , after weeks of the strike action , the workers in the shipyard reached their goal .
the strike movement , which would soon be formally known as solidarity , was accepted as an independent trade union . " finally we have an independent union under our own administration , " said lech walesa .
" we now have the right to strike and we are going to demand more rights soon . " brief period of freedom organizers were anything but sure of their victory , though , even when , at the end of that august , the government signed the " gdansk treaty " with its 21 demands , including freedom of expression , a free trade union and the right to strike . " getting the right to have an independent trade union was a breakthrough , " said bogdan lis , one of the founders of solidarity .
" it was so unbelievable that we could only wonder then how long it would last . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : general wojciech jaruzelski , poland 's last communist-era leader in warsaw , poland , may 23 , 2005 .
the unionists got their answer 500 days later , when the former defense minister , general wojciech jaruzelski , who took over the reins of government in february 1981 , took away the new-found freedoms . " i hereby proclaim martial law in all of poland , " he announced on television as a shocked nation watched . martial law lasted two years after that and the communist leaders did what they could to cripple the solidarity movement .
government critics and union adherents were put in internment camps , including the leadership circle around walesa .
the party tried to rid the country of what it considered a trade union disease . dogged drive for freedom while forced underground , the drive for freedom was not easily stopped , according to wladyslaw bartoszewski , one-time chair of the polish writers association and polish foreign minister in the 1990s . " the breakup of the trade unions was a step that can not be without consequences , " he said after his release from an internment camp in october 1982 .
" many have been released from prison , but many are still behind bars , even renowned writers and professors .
there are many who are still being arrested and sentenced , many women among them .
we catholics in poland are very upset and worried . " lech walesa himself was arrested and stayed under house arrest until the end of 1982 .
but the movement he led , although officially dissolved by parliament in 1982 and driven underground , remained active .
the unrest in the country could no longer be quieted by draconian measures from on high . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers at the gdansk shipyard in 1988 , a new wave of strikes and labor unrest spread across the country , and high on the list of strikers ' demands was government recognition of solidarity .
general jaruzelski announced he was ready to talk with the opposition and in april 1989 , the government agreed to legalize the trade union and allow it to participate in free elections to a bicameral polish parliament . in 1990 , solidarity experienced its perhaps sweetest triumph when walesa was elected president .
but at the same time , that marked the beginning of its long demise .
the movement began drifting apart with internal fighting over interests and the speed of reforms leading to its losing popularity and influence .
even walesa , a national hero , became a target for criticism with his high-handedness .
he narrowly lost a bid for re-election in 1995 to a former communist , aleksander kwasniewski , head of the democratic left alliance . shadow of its former self today solidarnosc has little influence in polish politics and has returned to its roots as a trade union .
but with just under a million members , it even has little sway in company policy .
at its height , it counted ten million members in its ranks , in a country of just under 40 million . walesa announced he was leaving the union on its 25th anniversary , saying its goals today were very different than the ones from its early days .
solidarity 's golden days , and its great achievements , were behind it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lech walesa in 2004 " with it there would have been no german reunification , no triumph over communism , " he said , adding that there are two very different parts to the solidarity story and they should not be confused . " on the one side there is our great victory , and on the other there is our weak performance in making use of that victory .

" the chinese side expressed its concern over the textile products blocked at customs in eu countries , " a chinese commerce ministry spokeswoman told afp in describing thursday 's negotiations . european union negotiators said the backlog of products was " not in the interests of eu traders and consumers , " she said . according to the french trade ministry earlier this week , 48 million sweaters , 17 million pairs of trousers , some 500,000 blouses , 1.6 million t-shirts , 3.4 million bras and 1,470 tons of flax yarn are being held up . resolution of stand-off in interest of both parties " the atmosphere of the discussions with our chinese colleagues is , as could be expected , constructive and friendly , given that of course it 's in the interest of the two sides to resolve this problem as quickly as possible , " eu commission spokeswoman amelia torres told journalists in brussels thursday . eu officials in beijing refused to comment on the talks other than to say that negotiations had resumed in earnest friday . lu jianhua , director of the ministry of commerce 's foreign trade administration department , headed up the chinese side , while fritz-harald wenig , a trade director with the european commission , represented the eu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's textile exports to europe surged to 2.1 billion dollars in june , up 85 percent over the same month last year , as rush orders for chinese goods soared while negotiators hammered out the new quotas , china 's trade ministry said . a senior chinese trade official said part of the problem was that the eu and china agreed that the period between june 11 and july 20 was needed to set up mechanisms to monitor the textile trade and the implementation of the agreement . mass influx of chinese products " during this period , 10 categories of chinese products could be freely imported to eu without any application for licenses , and traders in both china and eu rushed -lrb- orders -rrb- in order to avoid the quantity controls , " the unnamed official said in a comment posted on the commerce ministry website .
" the irrational activities of enterprises in china and eu brought on the furious increase of the ... products . " in accordance with normal trade practices , credit guarantees would have already been issued by buyers before the shipping . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clothes not authorized for import are costing retailers and manufacturers dearly european retailers could thus be facing hundreds of millions of dollars in losses not only for the goods , but additional shipping and storage costs , industry sources said . china has protested the re-implementation of us and eu textiles quotas following the end the long-standing global quota system as a move counter to free trade and ongoing world trade organization trade liberalization talks . the united states has invoked wto " safeguards " that limit chinese textile imports in at least six categories to 7.5 percent annual growth and is currently negotiating with china to implement similar limits on nearly 20 categories . us negotiators are expected in beijing next week to restart talks on the issue . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de china wants eu to increase textile quotas beijing and brussels were set to begin trade negotiations over booming chinese textile exports with china expecting the eu to capitulate and increase import quotas , according to chinese sources on wednesday .

bernhard glocksin is encouraging members of the audience to smoke joints while taking in performances of " la princesse jaune -lrb- the oriental princess -rrb- " , the one-act druggy opera by camille saint-saens . the opera tells the story of kornélis , a man in love with a portrait of a japanese princess .
under the sway of a hallucinogenic potion which he believes will unite him with the object of his infatuation , he confuses the portrait with his own fiancée . his increasingly long trips into a psychedelic version of japan within his own imagination eventually prevent kornélis from distinguishing between fantasy and reality as he slips further away from his real life love . artistic license in an attempt to create that far-out feeling , the actors themselves will also smoke pot onstage while the audience mellow out in the stalls . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glocksin maintains that the opera experience will be " improved with a few joints " while the opera house asserts that artistic license will protect it from drug laws . " it ’ s a test to see just what we can get away with , " glocksin said . according to german drug laws , however , the opera may be taking a step too far in blurring the lines between art and life .
legal hurdles drug laws concerning cannabis in germany vary from state to state and a fine or referral for prosecution can be administered for personal possession of anything from six to 30 grams .
in berlin , anything up to 10 grams is considered to be " for personal use " and will often be overlooked .
smoking dope in public places , however , can be interpreted by law as an offense against the german constitution and is therefore a punishable act .
as germany does not carry laws like those in neighboring holland which permit establishments with special licenses to sell and allow cannabis to be used on the premises , a location allowing drug consumption on-site would be breaking the law .
enforcement of these laws on opening night may make the first performance of " la princesse jaune " even more surreal .
" la princesse jaune -lrb- the oriental princess -rrb- " by camille saint-saens opens at the neuköllner oper on sept .

but the battle for votes has also caught up with the times , and gone online . less than a month before likely federal elections in germany , there is a plethora of web sites poking fun at the various candidates .
internet surfers can watch a photomontage of the christian democrats ' angela merkel breakdancing or a boxing match between merkel and sitting chancellor gerhard schröder . while there is a lot of satire and silliness surrounding the parties and their candidates out there on the web , the targets of all the online barbs are taking cyberspace very seriously these days .
the internet is playing big during this campaign season . strategists at the social democrats ' campaign headquarters are helping chancellor schröder defend his title .
like the opposition , the spd has an entire department dedicated to looking after its web presence - around the clock .
the internet could play a decisive role , according to sebastian reichel of the spd 's campaign team , especially during such a short election campaign . " any party which does n't conduct its campaigning on the internet or sees it as just a sideline is missing a great opportunity not only to mobilize voters , but also to educate and bring them over to your side , " he said . besides explaining their party 's platform and presenting candidates , the social democrats ' site tells supporters how they can get involved , listen to podcasts , and donate to the party . the conservative opposition christian democrats are no less savvy when it comes to going after the digital generation .
they have their own podcast - called ikauder , after general secretary volker kauder - news ticker and links to sites that heap vitriol on the sitting government . bloggers away ! no other medium allows the campaigners to react as quickly to a political opponent 's slip-up and the financial costs are much lower than for more traditional forms of campaign advertising . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hottest trend in this year 's election is the weblog , or blog , a form of online diary in which politicians share their thoughts with voters . social democratic candidate niels annen from hamburg has publicized his day-to-day schedule for the last three weeks on his web site .
aside from his party 's platforms , readers can learn more - if not all - about niels annen himself . " i would n't include certain things about my private life , things i do n't believe belong in the public realm , " he said .
" but it 's more about personal impressions , or perhaps things that i 've felt at various times .
i do include them . " every day annen says he receives around a dozen responses to his blog .
sometimes the remarks are offensive , but annen says he is pleased with most of the comments and writes personal replies . " some who wrote once said : ' you 're too left-leaning for me , but keep it up .
it 's obvious you write things yourself , as opposed to many of your colleagues . '
that 's encouraging and is why i keep going . " crucial element surfing the internet is a matter of course for germany 's young people .
even if many are n't aware of the campaigning taking place online , media experts say internet ads are no longer just a campaign gimmick . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : build your own chancellor - a satirical web site soon , making appearances in tabloid-style programs on television , which chancellor schröder once called his most important campaign aid , wo n't be enough . " at the moment , election campaigns are changing .
traditional media , like tv , radio , and print still play a big role , " said jo groebel , director of the european institute for the media .
" that also has to do with the fact that most leading politicians are of a certain age and not necessarily used to employing online media in such a big way . " but that is changing .
one of the few prominent politicians who - in spite of his advanced years - has recognized the signs of the times is the liberals ' hermann otto solms , who is a candidate for the bundestag .
a few days ago he started writing his own blog .
it 's taking some getting used to , but solms is not about to give it up . " through the internet we have the opportunity to contact thousands of people simultaneously , " he said .
" there 's no better medium available .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 26.08.2005 iran flouts europe and future negotiations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaea chief mohamed elbaradei has his hands full with iran un nuclear watchdog chief mohamed elbaradei met with iran 's new negotiator in vienna on friday as the islamic republic continues its brazen rhetoric .
tehran says it does not fear un sanctions . the un atomic watchdog agency , iaea , got its first taste of the iranian government under its new president mahmoud ahmadinejad .
on friday , iaea chief mohamed elbaradei met iran 's new nuclear program director and negotiator ali larijani in vienna to renew talks surrounding iran 's nuclear energy program that the west says is weapons-related .
iran has defied the international community by resuming work on making power reactor fuel that could also be used to make nuclear weapons but insists that it wants to continue talks with the european union on guaranteeing its atomic program is peaceful .
elbaradei and larijani will be discussing " issues related to international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- safeguards inspections and the current state of play , " spokeswoman melissa fleming said in confirming friday 's meeting .
eu 's role brought into question bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu-3 's negotiations with iran not to open the isfahan facility were for nought .
earlier this month activity was restarted despite claims that they will continue negotiations with the eu-3 - britain , france and germany - tehran has sent signals to the contrary as late as thursday .
larijani had challenged the role of the eu-3 as the leaders of diplomatic efforts over the iran 's nuclear program .
" based on what logic and agreement with the international atomic energy agency have the negotiations been limited and dependent on the three european countries ? "
larijani asked on iranian state television .
larijani signaled that iran may look towards widening involvement in the talks , saying that non-aligned countries had asked iran to explain why the negotiations have only been with the eu-3 .
the us viewed the suggestion with a large dose of skepticism , saying that the ploy was just an attempt by tehran to avoid talks over the issue .
" this is a typical tactic for the iranian government .
they will come up with proposals like this to try and change the subject , " said state department spokesman sean mccormack .

here , secretary of iran 's supreme national security council , hasan rowhani -lrb- l -rrb- and german foreign minister , joschka fischer at a 2003 press conference iran has accused the three european states of damaging the diplomatic effort by demanding iran abandon its work on the nuclear fuel cycle - the focus of fears iran could acquire the bomb - even though fuel work is technically permitted by the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- .
the eu-3 countered tehran 's claims , saying iran is to blame for the breakdown in the talks due to its decision earlier this month to resume uranium ore conversion work - the first step in the ultra-sensitive enrichment process which had been suspended .
the iaea board , which is to receive a report on iran on september 3 from elbaradei , also called on tehran to reinstate the suspension .
iran has refused , and could face referral to the un security council , which could impose international economic sanctions .

tehran says it does not fear un sanctions . the un atomic watchdog agency , iaea , got its first taste of the iranian government under its new president mahmoud ahmadinejad .
on friday , iaea chief mohamed elbaradei met iran 's new nuclear program director and negotiator ali larijani in vienna to renew talks surrounding iran 's nuclear energy program that the west says is weapons-related .
iran has defied the international community by resuming work on making power reactor fuel that could also be used to make nuclear weapons but insists that it wants to continue talks with the european union on guaranteeing its atomic program is peaceful .
elbaradei and larijani will be discussing " issues related to international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- safeguards inspections and the current state of play , " spokeswoman melissa fleming said in confirming friday 's meeting .
eu 's role brought into question bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu-3 's negotiations with iran not to open the isfahan facility were for nought .
earlier this month activity was restarted despite claims that they will continue negotiations with the eu-3 - britain , france and germany - tehran has sent signals to the contrary as late as thursday .
larijani had challenged the role of the eu-3 as the leaders of diplomatic efforts over the iran 's nuclear program .
" based on what logic and agreement with the international atomic energy agency have the negotiations been limited and dependent on the three european countries ? "
larijani asked on iranian state television .
larijani signaled that iran may look towards widening involvement in the talks , saying that non-aligned countries had asked iran to explain why the negotiations have only been with the eu-3 .
the us viewed the suggestion with a large dose of skepticism , saying that the ploy was just an attempt by tehran to avoid talks over the issue .
" this is a typical tactic for the iranian government .
they will come up with proposals like this to try and change the subject , " said state department spokesman sean mccormack .

what more can be done about the floods ?
climate change outpaces politics , say environmental experts . villages and towns enclosed by water , dramatic efforts to rescue people - the pictures from bavaria , austria and switzerland resemble those of what was previously dubbed " the floods of the century " in 1999 on the oder river or 2002 at the elbe and danube rivers .
politicians are flocking to the disaster area and their gestures of support and pledges of aid also resemble each other .
but according to environmental experts , nature 's warning signals are still not being taken seriously enough .
a n eed to act climate researchers are convinced the present situation is just a harbinger of much more severe floods that could be caused by climate change in the future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman pushes a man in a wheelchair as other persons wade through the flooded schweizerhof quay in lucerne on wednesday " flood protection remains an endless task , as long as nothing is being done to deal with the root causes of floods , " said georg rast of the world wildlife fund -lrb- wwf -rrb- .
" a long breath is needed beyond individual legislative periods and a finance policy based on what we already know about the problem .
unfortunately , the budget boosts provided by the federal states to deal with the problem follow the flood waves - except with a year 's delay . "
in the face of climate change , all flood protection concepts have to be reviewed , said regine günther , also of wwf .
on the political level pressure has to be increased to achieve a faster reduction of greenhouse gas emissions .
a failure to deliver ?
" the federal government and the states have so far not delivered on their promises they made during the 2002 floods to introduce adequate flood protection measures , " said gerhard timm , director for the german federation for the protection of the environment and nature -lrb- bund -rrb- .
through river regulation , dykes and dams rivers in germany are left with only a fifth of their original flooding areas .
but bavarian premier edmund stoiber said there is no reason for renewed action .
" we have done our homework , " he said , adding that bavaria has invested more than 670 million euros -lrb- $ 822 million -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in dresden , streets get regularly flooded , like in this picture taken in march according to the state 's ministry for the environment , the measures include improved prevention and warning systems as well as extended polder areas .
the natural environs of rivers , streams and floodplains have been returned to their original natural state .
the ministry also urges property owners to make available more land faster to be used for conversions into polder areas .
in germany , an area totalling some 150 soccer pitches is being sealed off every day as part of construction projects for streets and buildings .
these areas can no longer absorb rainfalls , according to the ministry .
floods harbi n ger of thi n gs to come spells of extreme weather such as the current heat wave in portugal or the heavy rains in bavaria are but a first sign of global warming already affecting everyday weather patterns , said mojib latif of the institute of oceanography at the university of kiel in northern germany .
the air above the mediterranean absorbs humidity and transports it northwards and past the alps on their eastern flank .
but because of global warming , more water evaporates above the mediterranean , leading to the air moving northwards being wetter , mojib said .

what more can be done about the floods ?
climate change outpaces politics , say environmental experts . villages and towns enclosed by water , dramatic efforts to rescue people - the pictures from bavaria , austria and switzerland resemble those of what was previously dubbed " the floods of the century " in 1999 on the oder river or 2002 at the elbe and danube rivers .
politicians are flocking to the disaster area and their gestures of support and pledges of aid also resemble each other .
but according to environmental experts , nature 's warning signals are still not being taken seriously enough .
a n eed to act climate researchers are convinced the present situation is just a harbinger of much more severe floods that could be caused by climate change in the future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman pushes a man in a wheelchair as other persons wade through the flooded schweizerhof quay in lucerne on wednesday " flood protection remains an endless task , as long as nothing is being done to deal with the root causes of floods , " said georg rast of the world wildlife fund -lrb- wwf -rrb- .
" a long breath is needed beyond individual legislative periods and a finance policy based on what we already know about the problem .
unfortunately , the budget boosts provided by the federal states to deal with the problem follow the flood waves - except with a year 's delay . "
in the face of climate change , all flood protection concepts have to be reviewed , said regine günther , also of wwf .
on the political level pressure has to be increased to achieve a faster reduction of greenhouse gas emissions .
a failure to deliver ?
" the federal government and the states have so far not delivered on their promises they made during the 2002 floods to introduce adequate flood protection measures , " said gerhard timm , director for the german federation for the protection of the environment and nature -lrb- bund -rrb- .
through river regulation , dykes and dams rivers in germany are left with only a fifth of their original flooding areas .
but bavarian premier edmund stoiber said there is no reason for renewed action .
" we have done our homework , " he said , adding that bavaria has invested more than 670 million euros -lrb- $ 822 million -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in dresden , streets get regularly flooded , like in this picture taken in march according to the state 's ministry for the environment , the measures include improved prevention and warning systems as well as extended polder areas .
the natural environs of rivers , streams and floodplains have been returned to their original natural state .
the ministry also urges property owners to make available more land faster to be used for conversions into polder areas .
in germany , an area totalling some 150 soccer pitches is being sealed off every day as part of construction projects for streets and buildings .
these areas can no longer absorb rainfalls , according to the ministry .
floods harbi n ger of thi n gs to come spells of extreme weather such as the current heat wave in portugal or the heavy rains in bavaria are but a first sign of global warming already affecting everyday weather patterns , said mojib latif of the institute of oceanography at the university of kiel in northern germany .
the air above the mediterranean absorbs humidity and transports it northwards and past the alps on their eastern flank .
but because of global warming , more water evaporates above the mediterranean , leading to the air moving northwards being wetter , mojib said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rescuers in a rubber dinghy evacuate residents from the flooded areas in downtown prague in august 2002 and once the clouds get stuck at the mountain tops of the alps , massive , torrential downpours are the result .

tehran says it does not fear un sanctions . the un atomic watchdog agency , iaea , got its first taste of the iranian government under its new president mahmoud ahmadinejad .
on friday , iaea chief mohamed elbaradei met iran 's new nuclear program director and negotiator ali larijani in vienna to renew talks surrounding iran 's nuclear energy program that the west says is weapons-related .
iran has defied the international community by resuming work on making power reactor fuel that could also be used to make nuclear weapons but insists that it wants to continue talks with the european union on guaranteeing its atomic program is peaceful .
elbaradei and larijani will be discussing " issues related to international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- safeguards inspections and the current state of play , " spokeswoman melissa fleming said in confirming friday 's meeting .
eu 's role brought into question bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu-3 's negotiations with iran not to open the isfahan facility were for nought .
earlier this month activity was restarted despite claims that they will continue negotiations with the eu-3 - britain , france and germany - tehran has sent signals to the contrary as late as thursday .
larijani had challenged the role of the eu-3 as the leaders of diplomatic efforts over the iran 's nuclear program .
" based on what logic and agreement with the international atomic energy agency have the negotiations been limited and dependent on the three european countries ? "
larijani asked on iranian state television .
larijani signaled that iran may look towards widening involvement in the talks , saying that non-aligned countries had asked iran to explain why the negotiations have only been with the eu-3 .
the us viewed the suggestion with a large dose of skepticism , saying that the ploy was just an attempt by tehran to avoid talks over the issue .
" this is a typical tactic for the iranian government .
they will come up with proposals like this to try and change the subject , " said state department spokesman sean mccormack .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : past attempts by germany and the west to hinder iranian nuclear activities have been fruitless .
here , secretary of iran 's supreme national security council , hasan rowhani -lrb- l -rrb- and german foreign minister , joschka fischer at a 2003 press conference iran has accused the three european states of damaging the diplomatic effort by demanding iran abandon its work on the nuclear fuel cycle - the focus of fears iran could acquire the bomb - even though fuel work is technically permitted by the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- .
the eu-3 countered tehran 's claims , saying iran is to blame for the breakdown in the talks due to its decision earlier this month to resume uranium ore conversion work - the first step in the ultra-sensitive enrichment process which had been suspended .
the iaea board , which is to receive a report on iran on september 3 from elbaradei , also called on tehran to reinstate the suspension .
iran has refused , and could face referral to the un security council , which could impose international economic sanctions .
us and eu to make no early move bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin is currently opposed to economic sanctions against tehran economic sanctions in the near term are improbable however .
while waiting for the september 3 report and whether iran adheres to that day 's deadline , the united states and the european union have decided not to seek an iaea emergency meeting , diplomats said thursday .
an emergency session of the international atomic energy agency on september 6 , which the united states was seeking and which could lead to the referral of iran to the un security council for possible sanctions , is " not going to take place , " a senior eu diplomat told afp in vienna where the iaea is based .
the reason is clear .
russia , which has a large contract to build iran 's first nuclear reactor , had objected to holding such a special meeting ahead of a summit at united nations headquarters in new york from september 14-16 .
iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad and russian president vladimir putin are to attend the summit and russia " wanted to give room for what could happen in new york and not to miss an opportunity " for diplomacy , an eu diplomat said .
the diplomat was speaking about efforts to get iran to resume both the fuel suspension and talks with the eu that focus on winning guarantees that tehran will not make nuclear weapons . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu calls for emergency un meeting on iran mahmoud ahmadinejad faces the possibility of being brought before the un 's nuclear watchdog in his first week as iran 's president after the eu called for emergency talks on the islamic republic 's atomic program .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 26.08.2005 looking back on 25 years of solidarity großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solidarnosc today is but a shadow of its former self solidarnosc , the workers ' union that played an important role in the fall of communism in poland , was founded 25 years ago .
what began as a group of dissident intellectuals became an unstoppable force for change . the poland that begat solidarnosc , or solidarity , a quarter century ago is hardly recognizable today .
then , poland was a totalitarian , satellite state of the soviet union , under moscow 's firm hand .
today , poland is a democratic country and a member of the european union as well as nato .
much of that development is due to the influence of the trade union that got its start in the gdansk shipyards in 1980 . the origins of solidarity go back even further , to 1976 , when a " worker 's defense committee " was founded by a group of dissident intellectuals after several thousand workers who had been on strike were attacked and jailed by authorities in various cities .
in 1979 , the committee published a charter of worker 's rights . in 1980 , a new wave of strikes again broke out , this time sparked by a seemingly insignificant event .
the communist government had raised the price of meat in the cafeteria of the lenin shipyards in the northern industrial city of gdansk .
a female worker had complained about the price hike and was fired . that led 17,000 workers to put down their tools and barricade themselves inside the plant under the leadership of lech walesa , an electrician at the shipyard . by mid-august , strikes had spread throughout the country and millions of polish white and blue-collar workers took to the streets demanding better working conditions , even though only 10 years earlier , similar strikes had ended in bloodshed with dozens of people killed by machine gun fire and over 1,000 injured . bildunterschrift : august 30 , 1980 , one day before signing the agreement with the government , jubilant solidarity members carry their leader lech walesa on their shoulders but on august 31 , 1980 , after weeks of the strike action , the workers in the shipyard reached their goal .
the strike movement , which would soon be formally known as solidarity , was accepted as an independent trade union . " finally we have an independent union under our own administration , " said lech walesa .
" we now have the right to strike and we are going to demand more rights soon . " brief period of freedom organizers were anything but sure of their victory , though , even when , at the end of that august , the government signed the " gdansk treaty " with its 21 demands , including freedom of expression , a free trade union and the right to strike . " getting the right to have an independent trade union was a breakthrough , " said bogdan lis , one of the founders of solidarity .
" it was so unbelievable that we could only wonder then how long it would last . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : general wojciech jaruzelski , poland 's last communist-era leader in warsaw , poland , may 23 , 2005 .
the unionists got their answer 500 days later , when the former defense minister , general wojciech jaruzelski , who took over the reins of government in february 1981 , took away the new-found freedoms . " i hereby proclaim martial law in all of poland , " he announced on television as a shocked nation watched . martial law lasted two years after that and the communist leaders did what they could to cripple the solidarity movement .
government critics and union adherents were put in internment camps , including the leadership circle around walesa .
the party tried to rid the country of what it considered a trade union disease . dogged drive for freedom while forced underground , the drive for freedom was not easily stopped , according to wladyslaw bartoszewski , one-time chair of the polish writers association and polish foreign minister in the 1990s . " the breakup of the trade unions was a step that can not be without consequences , " he said after his release from an internment camp in october 1982 .
" many have been released from prison , but many are still behind bars , even renowned writers and professors .
there are many who are still being arrested and sentenced , many women among them .
we catholics in poland are very upset and worried . " lech walesa himself was arrested and stayed under house arrest until the end of 1982 .
but the movement he led , although officially dissolved by parliament in 1982 and driven underground , remained active .
the unrest in the country could no longer be quieted by draconian measures from on high . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers at the gdansk shipyard in 1988 , a new wave of strikes and labor unrest spread across the country , and high on the list of strikers ' demands was government recognition of solidarity .
general jaruzelski announced he was ready to talk with the opposition and in april 1989 , the government agreed to legalize the trade union and allow it to participate in free elections to a bicameral polish parliament . in 1990 , solidarity experienced its perhaps sweetest triumph when walesa was elected president .
but at the same time , that marked the beginning of its long demise .
the movement began drifting apart with internal fighting over interests and the speed of reforms leading to its losing popularity and influence .
even walesa , a national hero , became a target for criticism with his high-handedness .
he narrowly lost a bid for re-election in 1995 to a former communist , aleksander kwasniewski , head of the democratic left alliance . shadow of its former self today solidarnosc has little influence in polish politics and has returned to its roots as a trade union .
but with just under a million members , it even has little sway in company policy .
at its height , it counted ten million members in its ranks , in a country of just under 40 million . walesa announced he was leaving the union on its 25th anniversary , saying its goals today were very different than the ones from its early days .
solidarity 's golden days , and its great achievements , were behind it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lech walesa in 2004 " with it there would have been no german reunification , no triumph over communism , " he said , adding that there are two very different parts to the solidarity story and they should not be confused . " on the one side there is our great victory , and on the other there is our weak performance in making use of that victory .

what began as a group of dissident intellectuals became an unstoppable force for change . the poland that begat solidarnosc , or solidarity , a quarter century ago is hardly recognizable today .
then , poland was a totalitarian , satellite state of the soviet union , under moscow 's firm hand .
today , poland is a democratic country and a member of the european union as well as nato .
much of that development is due to the influence of the trade union that got its start in the gdansk shipyards in 1980 . the origins of solidarity go back even further , to 1976 , when a " worker 's defense committee " was founded by a group of dissident intellectuals after several thousand workers who had been on strike were attacked and jailed by authorities in various cities .
in 1979 , the committee published a charter of worker 's rights . in 1980 , a new wave of strikes again broke out , this time sparked by a seemingly insignificant event .
the communist government had raised the price of meat in the cafeteria of the lenin shipyards in the northern industrial city of gdansk .
a female worker had complained about the price hike and was fired . that led 17,000 workers to put down their tools and barricade themselves inside the plant under the leadership of lech walesa , an electrician at the shipyard . by mid-august , strikes had spread throughout the country and millions of polish white and blue-collar workers took to the streets demanding better working conditions , even though only 10 years earlier , similar strikes had ended in bloodshed with dozens of people killed by machine gun fire and over 1,000 injured . bildunterschrift : august 30 , 1980 , one day before signing the agreement with the government , jubilant solidarity members carry their leader lech walesa on their shoulders but on august 31 , 1980 , after weeks of the strike action , the workers in the shipyard reached their goal .
the strike movement , which would soon be formally known as solidarity , was accepted as an independent trade union . " finally we have an independent union under our own administration , " said lech walesa .
" we now have the right to strike and we are going to demand more rights soon . " brief period of freedom organizers were anything but sure of their victory , though , even when , at the end of that august , the government signed the " gdansk treaty " with its 21 demands , including freedom of expression , a free trade union and the right to strike . " getting the right to have an independent trade union was a breakthrough , " said bogdan lis , one of the founders of solidarity .
" it was so unbelievable that we could only wonder then how long it would last . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : general wojciech jaruzelski , poland 's last communist-era leader in warsaw , poland , may 23 , 2005 .
the unionists got their answer 500 days later , when the former defense minister , general wojciech jaruzelski , who took over the reins of government in february 1981 , took away the new-found freedoms . " i hereby proclaim martial law in all of poland , " he announced on television as a shocked nation watched . martial law lasted two years after that and the communist leaders did what they could to cripple the solidarity movement .
government critics and union adherents were put in internment camps , including the leadership circle around walesa .
the party tried to rid the country of what it considered a trade union disease . dogged drive for freedom while forced underground , the drive for freedom was not easily stopped , according to wladyslaw bartoszewski , one-time chair of the polish writers association and polish foreign minister in the 1990s . " the breakup of the trade unions was a step that can not be without consequences , " he said after his release from an internment camp in october 1982 .
" many have been released from prison , but many are still behind bars , even renowned writers and professors .
there are many who are still being arrested and sentenced , many women among them .
we catholics in poland are very upset and worried . " lech walesa himself was arrested and stayed under house arrest until the end of 1982 .
but the movement he led , although officially dissolved by parliament in 1982 and driven underground , remained active .
the unrest in the country could no longer be quieted by draconian measures from on high . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers at the gdansk shipyard in 1988 , a new wave of strikes and labor unrest spread across the country , and high on the list of strikers ' demands was government recognition of solidarity .
general jaruzelski announced he was ready to talk with the opposition and in april 1989 , the government agreed to legalize the trade union and allow it to participate in free elections to a bicameral polish parliament . in 1990 , solidarity experienced its perhaps sweetest triumph when walesa was elected president .
but at the same time , that marked the beginning of its long demise .
the movement began drifting apart with internal fighting over interests and the speed of reforms leading to its losing popularity and influence .
even walesa , a national hero , became a target for criticism with his high-handedness .
he narrowly lost a bid for re-election in 1995 to a former communist , aleksander kwasniewski , head of the democratic left alliance . shadow of its former self today solidarnosc has little influence in polish politics and has returned to its roots as a trade union .
but with just under a million members , it even has little sway in company policy .
at its height , it counted ten million members in its ranks , in a country of just under 40 million . walesa announced he was leaving the union on its 25th anniversary , saying its goals today were very different than the ones from its early days .
solidarity 's golden days , and its great achievements , were behind it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lech walesa in 2004 " with it there would have been no german reunification , no triumph over communism , " he said , adding that there are two very different parts to the solidarity story and they should not be confused .

" the renowned medical journal said in a hard-hitting editorial called " the end of homeopathy " that the time for more studies is over and doctors should be honest with patients about homeopathy 's " lack of benefit . " the author of the article , dr. matthias egger from the university of berne , said he and associates in britain and switzerland searched 19 electronic databases covering the period from 1995 to 2003 . they compared 110 trials of homeopathic remedies against a placebo with 110 trials of conventional medicines , which were also tested against a placebo . the ailments being treated in these trials included respiratory-tract infections , pollen allergies and asthma , gynecological and obstetric problems , muscle and joint ache and intestinal upsets . the researchers found that , in small trials which they deemed to be of poor quality , both homeopathic and conventional medicines appeared to fare better against placebos .
but in larger trials that were of high quality , they found no convincing evidence that homeopathy worked better than placebos . like with like homeopathy is based on the principle of treating like with like , also called the law of similary . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the homeopathic practitioner generally looks at the totality of symptoms of a given case , then chooses a remedy that has been reported to produce a similar set of symptoms in healthy subjects .
this remedy is usually given in extremely low concentrations . for example , a person with an allergy would be given an ultra-diluted dose of an agent that would cause the same symptoms . saxon founder the theory of homeopathy was developed by samuel hahnemann , a physician from saxony , who first published it in 1796 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : samuel hahnemann came up with the theory behind homeopathy homeopathy went into decline in the 20th century with the rise of antibiotics and other modern medicines , but in the past decade has staged a comeback , igniting controversy at the same time . over the past two decades , there has been a boom in both the use of homeopathic remedies and visits to homeopathic practitioners .
analysts say there are several reasons for this .
homeopathic treatment is reported by many to be effective . others are disaffected with the traditional medical establishment , which they consider cold and uncaring .
homeopathic practitioners often spend much more time dealing with their patients than do conventional practitioners .
homeopathic preparations also have few if any side effects and are generally much cheaper than conventional medications . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics , however , consider homeopathy to be unscientific and lacking any plausible mechanism .

1 summit , chancellor candidate angela merkel has renewed her call for the eu to offer turkey a " privileged partnership " instead of full membership . merkel penned the letter along with christian social union leader edmund stoiber , timing it to hit the desk of center-right leaders just before an informal meeting on thursday of eu foreign ministers , where eu accession negotiations with turkey will be discussed . turkey is expected to open membership negotiations with the eu on oct .

but the battle for votes has also caught up with the times , and gone online . less than a month before likely federal elections in germany , there is a plethora of web sites poking fun at the various candidates .
internet surfers can watch a photomontage of the christian democrats ' angela merkel breakdancing or a boxing match between merkel and sitting chancellor gerhard schröder . while there is a lot of satire and silliness surrounding the parties and their candidates out there on the web , the targets of all the online barbs are taking cyberspace very seriously these days .
the internet is playing big during this campaign season . strategists at the social democrats ' campaign headquarters are helping chancellor schröder defend his title .
like the opposition , the spd has an entire department dedicated to looking after its web presence - around the clock .
the internet could play a decisive role , according to sebastian reichel of the spd 's campaign team , especially during such a short election campaign . " any party which does n't conduct its campaigning on the internet or sees it as just a sideline is missing a great opportunity not only to mobilize voters , but also to educate and bring them over to your side , " he said . besides explaining their party 's platform and presenting candidates , the social democrats ' site tells supporters how they can get involved , listen to podcasts , and donate to the party . the conservative opposition christian democrats are no less savvy when it comes to going after the digital generation .
they have their own podcast - called ikauder , after general secretary volker kauder - news ticker and links to sites that heap vitriol on the sitting government . bloggers away ! no other medium allows the campaigners to react as quickly to a political opponent 's slip-up and the financial costs are much lower than for more traditional forms of campaign advertising . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hottest trend in this year 's election is the weblog , or blog , a form of online diary in which politicians share their thoughts with voters . social democratic candidate niels annen from hamburg has publicized his day-to-day schedule for the last three weeks on his web site .
aside from his party 's platforms , readers can learn more - if not all - about niels annen himself . " i would n't include certain things about my private life , things i do n't believe belong in the public realm , " he said .
" but it 's more about personal impressions , or perhaps things that i 've felt at various times .
i do include them . " every day annen says he receives around a dozen responses to his blog .
sometimes the remarks are offensive , but annen says he is pleased with most of the comments and writes personal replies . " some who wrote once said : ' you 're too left-leaning for me , but keep it up .
it 's obvious you write things yourself , as opposed to many of your colleagues . '
that 's encouraging and is why i keep going . " crucial element surfing the internet is a matter of course for germany 's young people .
even if many are n't aware of the campaigning taking place online , media experts say internet ads are no longer just a campaign gimmick . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : build your own chancellor - a satirical web site soon , making appearances in tabloid-style programs on television , which chancellor schröder once called his most important campaign aid , wo n't be enough . " at the moment , election campaigns are changing .
traditional media , like tv , radio , and print still play a big role , " said jo groebel , director of the european institute for the media .
" that also has to do with the fact that most leading politicians are of a certain age and not necessarily used to employing online media in such a big way . " but that is changing .

1 summit , chancellor candidate angela merkel has renewed her call for the eu to offer turkey a " privileged partnership " instead of full membership . merkel penned the letter along with christian social union leader edmund stoiber , timing it to hit the desk of center-right leaders just before an informal meeting on thursday of eu foreign ministers , where eu accession negotiations with turkey will be discussed . turkey is expected to open membership negotiations with the eu on oct .
3 . " we are fully convinced that accepting turkey would overburden the eu politically , economically and socially and would endanger the european integration process , " the letter , addressed to 11 european leaders , said . the letter cited " the continuing refusal of turkey to recognize the republic of cyprus , a member state , under international law " as an obstacle to turkish membership , and also noted " still-significant problems in upholding and imposing human rights . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and edmund stoiber merkel and stoiber underlined that the eu was interested in a close connection between turkey and the european union , but " we ask you to make clear that the framework of the negotiations also includes the perspective of a privileged partnership with turkey . " a copy of the letter also went to the current eu president , british prime minister tony blair , and eu commission president jose barroso . the response from joschka fischer , german foreign minister , was heated . " the attitude of ms. merkel and mr. stoiber is dangerously blind considering the promises that have been made by german governments over the past 43 years , from adenauer to kohl , " fischer told the dpa news agency . wo n't " overplay " turkey on monday this week , german conservatives said they would not let the turkey issue hijack the campaign in front of the country 's general election , scheduled for sept .
18 .
but the interior minister of the state of bavaria , günther beckstein , said turkey had become an election issue and " should not be neglected . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günther beckstein " turkey would now be the second most important country in a european union and in a few years … turkey would be the leading nation , more than france , italy or austria , the netherlands , portugal and greece together , " he said . beckstein said the rejections by france and the netherlands of a new eu constitution earlier this year showed that eu citizens were not ready for another significant expansion of the union . wolfgang schäuble , foreign affairs adviser in merkel 's pre-election team , echoed those sentiments in an interview with the international herald tribune .
he also raised questions about turkey 's identity . " a part of turkey is europe , just like russia , " he said in the interview .
" but a far bigger part of both turkey and russia is definitely not in europe .
that is why russia could never really integrate into the eu . " the position puts a possible merkel government at odds with the current eu position as well as with that of the united states , with which merkel has said she wants a closer relationship . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang schäuble the us considers turkey of great strategic importance and would like to see the country taken into the european fold .
during a trip last month to washington , schäuble said he explained his party 's position to us secretary of state condoleezza rice . " i think condoleezza rice was satisfied with my arguments , " he said . repeat performance it is not the first time merkel has pushed for an eu relationship with turkey which falls short of full membership .
she brought the topic up a year ago , just three weeks before the eu commission released a report on turkey and a few days before regional elections in two eastern german states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel in istanbul then there was disagreement over the proposal even within her own party .
fellow christian democrat and former defense minister volker rühe reminded merkel that the conservative government of helmut kohl had in 1997 signed an agreement laying out turkey 's official eu candidate status .
he said closing the door would destabilize the country and could strengthen anti-european sentiment there . in brussels , merkel 's approach met with astonishment .
jean-claude juncker , prime minister of luxembourg and then-eu president , distanced himself , saying turkey had enjoyed " candidate status " for years and it was too late to offer it a privileged partnership . cdu foreign affairs expert schäuble said despite the position of his party , a merkel government would not stop the beginning of accession negotiations between the eu and turkey .
he said germany would stand by the european council 's decision that the results of negotiations should be kept open . " the negotiations could last for at least 10 years , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 26.08.2005 renewed call for protection after floods großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a village in bavaria engulfed by the floods after the recent floods , cleaning-up operations are under way in bavaria and other alpine regions .
what more can be done about the floods ?
climate change outpaces politics , say environmental experts . villages and towns enclosed by water , dramatic efforts to rescue people - the pictures from bavaria , austria and switzerland resemble those of what was previously dubbed " the floods of the century " in 1999 on the oder river or 2002 at the elbe and danube rivers .
politicians are flocking to the disaster area and their gestures of support and pledges of aid also resemble each other .
but according to environmental experts , nature 's warning signals are still not being taken seriously enough .
a n eed to act climate researchers are convinced the present situation is just a harbinger of much more severe floods that could be caused by climate change in the future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman pushes a man in a wheelchair as other persons wade through the flooded schweizerhof quay in lucerne on wednesday " flood protection remains an endless task , as long as nothing is being done to deal with the root causes of floods , " said georg rast of the world wildlife fund -lrb- wwf -rrb- .
" a long breath is needed beyond individual legislative periods and a finance policy based on what we already know about the problem .
unfortunately , the budget boosts provided by the federal states to deal with the problem follow the flood waves - except with a year 's delay . "
in the face of climate change , all flood protection concepts have to be reviewed , said regine günther , also of wwf .
on the political level pressure has to be increased to achieve a faster reduction of greenhouse gas emissions .
a failure to deliver ?
" the federal government and the states have so far not delivered on their promises they made during the 2002 floods to introduce adequate flood protection measures , " said gerhard timm , director for the german federation for the protection of the environment and nature -lrb- bund -rrb- .
through river regulation , dykes and dams rivers in germany are left with only a fifth of their original flooding areas .
but bavarian premier edmund stoiber said there is no reason for renewed action .
" we have done our homework , " he said , adding that bavaria has invested more than 670 million euros -lrb- $ 822 million -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in dresden , streets get regularly flooded , like in this picture taken in march according to the state 's ministry for the environment , the measures include improved prevention and warning systems as well as extended polder areas .
the natural environs of rivers , streams and floodplains have been returned to their original natural state .
the ministry also urges property owners to make available more land faster to be used for conversions into polder areas .
in germany , an area totalling some 150 soccer pitches is being sealed off every day as part of construction projects for streets and buildings .
these areas can no longer absorb rainfalls , according to the ministry .
floods harbi n ger of thi n gs to come spells of extreme weather such as the current heat wave in portugal or the heavy rains in bavaria are but a first sign of global warming already affecting everyday weather patterns , said mojib latif of the institute of oceanography at the university of kiel in northern germany .
the air above the mediterranean absorbs humidity and transports it northwards and past the alps on their eastern flank .
but because of global warming , more water evaporates above the mediterranean , leading to the air moving northwards being wetter , mojib said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rescuers in a rubber dinghy evacuate residents from the flooded areas in downtown prague in august 2002 and once the clouds get stuck at the mountain tops of the alps , massive , torrential downpours are the result .
poland , the czech republic as well as the eastern and southern parts of germany will have to expect more of these heavy rains and floods in the future , latif said . dw staff -lrb- rri -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de politicians flock to flood zone floods in bavaria have caused chaos and destruction and galvanized politicians , in the thick of an election campaign , into action .

24 , 2005 -rrb- flood waters causing havoc in bavaria parts of the german state of bavaria were declared danger zones after floodwaters on alpine rivers caused chaos and destruction , cutting off access to several towns , including the resort of garmisch-partenkirchen .

bernhard glocksin is encouraging members of the audience to smoke joints while taking in performances of " la princesse jaune -lrb- the oriental princess -rrb- " , the one-act druggy opera by camille saint-saens . the opera tells the story of kornélis , a man in love with a portrait of a japanese princess .
under the sway of a hallucinogenic potion which he believes will unite him with the object of his infatuation , he confuses the portrait with his own fiancée . his increasingly long trips into a psychedelic version of japan within his own imagination eventually prevent kornélis from distinguishing between fantasy and reality as he slips further away from his real life love . artistic license in an attempt to create that far-out feeling , the actors themselves will also smoke pot onstage while the audience mellow out in the stalls . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glocksin maintains that the opera experience will be " improved with a few joints " while the opera house asserts that artistic license will protect it from drug laws . " it ’ s a test to see just what we can get away with , " glocksin said . according to german drug laws , however , the opera may be taking a step too far in blurring the lines between art and life .
legal hurdles drug laws concerning cannabis in germany vary from state to state and a fine or referral for prosecution can be administered for personal possession of anything from six to 30 grams .
in berlin , anything up to 10 grams is considered to be " for personal use " and will often be overlooked .
smoking dope in public places , however , can be interpreted by law as an offense against the german constitution and is therefore a punishable act .
as germany does not carry laws like those in neighboring holland which permit establishments with special licenses to sell and allow cannabis to be used on the premises , a location allowing drug consumption on-site would be breaking the law .
enforcement of these laws on opening night may make the first performance of " la princesse jaune " even more surreal .
" la princesse jaune -lrb- the oriental princess -rrb- " by camille saint-saens opens at the neuköllner oper on sept .

1 summit , chancellor candidate angela merkel has renewed her call for the eu to offer turkey a " privileged partnership " instead of full membership . merkel penned the letter along with christian social union leader edmund stoiber , timing it to hit the desk of center-right leaders just before an informal meeting on thursday of eu foreign ministers , where eu accession negotiations with turkey will be discussed . turkey is expected to open membership negotiations with the eu on oct .

" we are fully convinced that accepting turkey would overburden the eu politically , economically and socially and would endanger the european integration process , " the letter , addressed to 11 european leaders , said . the letter cited " the continuing refusal of turkey to recognize the republic of cyprus , a member state , under international law " as an obstacle to turkish membership , and also noted " still-significant problems in upholding and imposing human rights .

he also raised questions about turkey 's identity . " a part of turkey is europe , just like russia , " he said in the interview .
" but a far bigger part of both turkey and russia is definitely not in europe .
that is why russia could never really integrate into the eu . " the position puts a possible merkel government at odds with the current eu position as well as with that of the united states , with which merkel has said she wants a closer relationship . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang schäuble the us considers turkey of great strategic importance and would like to see the country taken into the european fold .

fellow christian democrat and former defense minister volker rühe reminded merkel that the conservative government of helmut kohl had in 1997 signed an agreement laying out turkey 's official eu candidate status .
he said closing the door would destabilize the country and could strengthen anti-european sentiment there . in brussels , merkel 's approach met with astonishment .
jean-claude juncker , prime minister of luxembourg and then-eu president , distanced himself , saying turkey had enjoyed " candidate status " for years and it was too late to offer it a privileged partnership . cdu foreign affairs expert schäuble said despite the position of his party , a merkel government would not stop the beginning of accession negotiations between the eu and turkey .
he said germany would stand by the european council 's decision that the results of negotiations should be kept open . " the negotiations could last for at least 10 years , " he said .

1 summit , chancellor candidate angela merkel has renewed her call for the eu to offer turkey a " privileged partnership " instead of full membership . merkel penned the letter along with christian social union leader edmund stoiber , timing it to hit the desk of center-right leaders just before an informal meeting on thursday of eu foreign ministers , where eu accession negotiations with turkey will be discussed . turkey is expected to open membership negotiations with the eu on oct .
3 . " we are fully convinced that accepting turkey would overburden the eu politically , economically and socially and would endanger the european integration process , " the letter , addressed to 11 european leaders , said . the letter cited " the continuing refusal of turkey to recognize the republic of cyprus , a member state , under international law " as an obstacle to turkish membership , and also noted " still-significant problems in upholding and imposing human rights . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and edmund stoiber merkel and stoiber underlined that the eu was interested in a close connection between turkey and the european union , but " we ask you to make clear that the framework of the negotiations also includes the perspective of a privileged partnership with turkey . " a copy of the letter also went to the current eu president , british prime minister tony blair , and eu commission president jose barroso . the response from joschka fischer , german foreign minister , was heated . " the attitude of ms. merkel and mr. stoiber is dangerously blind considering the promises that have been made by german governments over the past 43 years , from adenauer to kohl , " fischer told the dpa news agency . wo n't " overplay " turkey on monday this week , german conservatives said they would not let the turkey issue hijack the campaign in front of the country 's general election , scheduled for sept .
18 .
but the interior minister of the state of bavaria , günther beckstein , said turkey had become an election issue and " should not be neglected . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günther beckstein " turkey would now be the second most important country in a european union and in a few years … turkey would be the leading nation , more than france , italy or austria , the netherlands , portugal and greece together , " he said . beckstein said the rejections by france and the netherlands of a new eu constitution earlier this year showed that eu citizens were not ready for another significant expansion of the union . wolfgang schäuble , foreign affairs adviser in merkel 's pre-election team , echoed those sentiments in an interview with the international herald tribune .
he also raised questions about turkey 's identity . " a part of turkey is europe , just like russia , " he said in the interview .
" but a far bigger part of both turkey and russia is definitely not in europe .
that is why russia could never really integrate into the eu . " the position puts a possible merkel government at odds with the current eu position as well as with that of the united states , with which merkel has said she wants a closer relationship . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang schäuble the us considers turkey of great strategic importance and would like to see the country taken into the european fold .
during a trip last month to washington , schäuble said he explained his party 's position to us secretary of state condoleezza rice . " i think condoleezza rice was satisfied with my arguments , " he said . repeat performance it is not the first time merkel has pushed for an eu relationship with turkey which falls short of full membership .
she brought the topic up a year ago , just three weeks before the eu commission released a report on turkey and a few days before regional elections in two eastern german states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel in istanbul then there was disagreement over the proposal even within her own party .
fellow christian democrat and former defense minister volker rühe reminded merkel that the conservative government of helmut kohl had in 1997 signed an agreement laying out turkey 's official eu candidate status .
he said closing the door would destabilize the country and could strengthen anti-european sentiment there . in brussels , merkel 's approach met with astonishment .
jean-claude juncker , prime minister of luxembourg and then-eu president , distanced himself , saying turkey had enjoyed " candidate status " for years and it was too late to offer it a privileged partnership . cdu foreign affairs expert schäuble said despite the position of his party , a merkel government would not stop the beginning of accession negotiations between the eu and turkey .
he said germany would stand by the european council 's decision that the results of negotiations should be kept open . " the negotiations could last for at least 10 years , " he said .
" things could be very different in 10 years ' time .

under the sway of a hallucinogenic potion which he believes will unite him with the object of his infatuation , he confuses the portrait with his own fiancée . his increasingly long trips into a psychedelic version of japan within his own imagination eventually prevent kornélis from distinguishing between fantasy and reality as he slips further away from his real life love . artistic license in an attempt to create that far-out feeling , the actors themselves will also smoke pot onstage while the audience mellow out in the stalls . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glocksin maintains that the opera experience will be " improved with a few joints " while the opera house asserts that artistic license will protect it from drug laws .

legal hurdles drug laws concerning cannabis in germany vary from state to state and a fine or referral for prosecution can be administered for personal possession of anything from six to 30 grams .

smoking dope in public places , however , can be interpreted by law as an offense against the german constitution and is therefore a punishable act .
as germany does not carry laws like those in neighboring holland which permit establishments with special licenses to sell and allow cannabis to be used on the premises , a location allowing drug consumption on-site would be breaking the law .

what began as a group of dissident intellectuals became an unstoppable force for change . the poland that begat solidarnosc , or solidarity , a quarter century ago is hardly recognizable today .
then , poland was a totalitarian , satellite state of the soviet union , under moscow 's firm hand .
today , poland is a democratic country and a member of the european union as well as nato .
much of that development is due to the influence of the trade union that got its start in the gdansk shipyards in 1980 . the origins of solidarity go back even further , to 1976 , when a " worker 's defense committee " was founded by a group of dissident intellectuals after several thousand workers who had been on strike were attacked and jailed by authorities in various cities .
in 1979 , the committee published a charter of worker 's rights . in 1980 , a new wave of strikes again broke out , this time sparked by a seemingly insignificant event .
the communist government had raised the price of meat in the cafeteria of the lenin shipyards in the northern industrial city of gdansk .
a female worker had complained about the price hike and was fired . that led 17,000 workers to put down their tools and barricade themselves inside the plant under the leadership of lech walesa , an electrician at the shipyard . by mid-august , strikes had spread throughout the country and millions of polish white and blue-collar workers took to the streets demanding better working conditions , even though only 10 years earlier , similar strikes had ended in bloodshed with dozens of people killed by machine gun fire and over 1,000 injured . bildunterschrift : august 30 , 1980 , one day before signing the agreement with the government , jubilant solidarity members carry their leader lech walesa on their shoulders but on august 31 , 1980 , after weeks of the strike action , the workers in the shipyard reached their goal .
the strike movement , which would soon be formally known as solidarity , was accepted as an independent trade union . " finally we have an independent union under our own administration , " said lech walesa .
" we now have the right to strike and we are going to demand more rights soon . " brief period of freedom organizers were anything but sure of their victory , though , even when , at the end of that august , the government signed the " gdansk treaty " with its 21 demands , including freedom of expression , a free trade union and the right to strike . " getting the right to have an independent trade union was a breakthrough , " said bogdan lis , one of the founders of solidarity .
" it was so unbelievable that we could only wonder then how long it would last . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : general wojciech jaruzelski , poland 's last communist-era leader in warsaw , poland , may 23 , 2005 .
the unionists got their answer 500 days later , when the former defense minister , general wojciech jaruzelski , who took over the reins of government in february 1981 , took away the new-found freedoms . " i hereby proclaim martial law in all of poland , " he announced on television as a shocked nation watched . martial law lasted two years after that and the communist leaders did what they could to cripple the solidarity movement .
government critics and union adherents were put in internment camps , including the leadership circle around walesa .
the party tried to rid the country of what it considered a trade union disease . dogged drive for freedom while forced underground , the drive for freedom was not easily stopped , according to wladyslaw bartoszewski , one-time chair of the polish writers association and polish foreign minister in the 1990s . " the breakup of the trade unions was a step that can not be without consequences , " he said after his release from an internment camp in october 1982 .
" many have been released from prison , but many are still behind bars , even renowned writers and professors .
there are many who are still being arrested and sentenced , many women among them .
we catholics in poland are very upset and worried . " lech walesa himself was arrested and stayed under house arrest until the end of 1982 .
but the movement he led , although officially dissolved by parliament in 1982 and driven underground , remained active .
the unrest in the country could no longer be quieted by draconian measures from on high . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers at the gdansk shipyard in 1988 , a new wave of strikes and labor unrest spread across the country , and high on the list of strikers ' demands was government recognition of solidarity .
general jaruzelski announced he was ready to talk with the opposition and in april 1989 , the government agreed to legalize the trade union and allow it to participate in free elections to a bicameral polish parliament . in 1990 , solidarity experienced its perhaps sweetest triumph when walesa was elected president .
but at the same time , that marked the beginning of its long demise .
the movement began drifting apart with internal fighting over interests and the speed of reforms leading to its losing popularity and influence .
even walesa , a national hero , became a target for criticism with his high-handedness .
he narrowly lost a bid for re-election in 1995 to a former communist , aleksander kwasniewski , head of the democratic left alliance . shadow of its former self today solidarnosc has little influence in polish politics and has returned to its roots as a trade union .
but with just under a million members , it even has little sway in company policy .
at its height , it counted ten million members in its ranks , in a country of just under 40 million . walesa announced he was leaving the union on its 25th anniversary , saying its goals today were very different than the ones from its early days .
solidarity 's golden days , and its great achievements , were behind it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lech walesa in 2004 " with it there would have been no german reunification , no triumph over communism , " he said , adding that there are two very different parts to the solidarity story and they should not be confused .

what more can be done about the floods ?
climate change outpaces politics , say environmental experts . villages and towns enclosed by water , dramatic efforts to rescue people - the pictures from bavaria , austria and switzerland resemble those of what was previously dubbed " the floods of the century " in 1999 on the oder river or 2002 at the elbe and danube rivers .

what began as a group of dissident intellectuals became an unstoppable force for change . the poland that begat solidarnosc , or solidarity , a quarter century ago is hardly recognizable today .
then , poland was a totalitarian , satellite state of the soviet union , under moscow 's firm hand .
today , poland is a democratic country and a member of the european union as well as nato .
much of that development is due to the influence of the trade union that got its start in the gdansk shipyards in 1980 . the origins of solidarity go back even further , to 1976 , when a " worker 's defense committee " was founded by a group of dissident intellectuals after several thousand workers who had been on strike were attacked and jailed by authorities in various cities .
in 1979 , the committee published a charter of worker 's rights . in 1980 , a new wave of strikes again broke out , this time sparked by a seemingly insignificant event .
the communist government had raised the price of meat in the cafeteria of the lenin shipyards in the northern industrial city of gdansk .
a female worker had complained about the price hike and was fired . that led 17,000 workers to put down their tools and barricade themselves inside the plant under the leadership of lech walesa , an electrician at the shipyard . by mid-august , strikes had spread throughout the country and millions of polish white and blue-collar workers took to the streets demanding better working conditions , even though only 10 years earlier , similar strikes had ended in bloodshed with dozens of people killed by machine gun fire and over 1,000 injured . bildunterschrift : august 30 , 1980 , one day before signing the agreement with the government , jubilant solidarity members carry their leader lech walesa on their shoulders but on august 31 , 1980 , after weeks of the strike action , the workers in the shipyard reached their goal .
the strike movement , which would soon be formally known as solidarity , was accepted as an independent trade union . " finally we have an independent union under our own administration , " said lech walesa .
" we now have the right to strike and we are going to demand more rights soon . " brief period of freedom organizers were anything but sure of their victory , though , even when , at the end of that august , the government signed the " gdansk treaty " with its 21 demands , including freedom of expression , a free trade union and the right to strike . " getting the right to have an independent trade union was a breakthrough , " said bogdan lis , one of the founders of solidarity .
" it was so unbelievable that we could only wonder then how long it would last . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : general wojciech jaruzelski , poland 's last communist-era leader in warsaw , poland , may 23 , 2005 .
the unionists got their answer 500 days later , when the former defense minister , general wojciech jaruzelski , who took over the reins of government in february 1981 , took away the new-found freedoms . " i hereby proclaim martial law in all of poland , " he announced on television as a shocked nation watched . martial law lasted two years after that and the communist leaders did what they could to cripple the solidarity movement .
government critics and union adherents were put in internment camps , including the leadership circle around walesa .
the party tried to rid the country of what it considered a trade union disease . dogged drive for freedom while forced underground , the drive for freedom was not easily stopped , according to wladyslaw bartoszewski , one-time chair of the polish writers association and polish foreign minister in the 1990s . " the breakup of the trade unions was a step that can not be without consequences , " he said after his release from an internment camp in october 1982 .
" many have been released from prison , but many are still behind bars , even renowned writers and professors .
there are many who are still being arrested and sentenced , many women among them .
we catholics in poland are very upset and worried . " lech walesa himself was arrested and stayed under house arrest until the end of 1982 .
but the movement he led , although officially dissolved by parliament in 1982 and driven underground , remained active .
the unrest in the country could no longer be quieted by draconian measures from on high . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers at the gdansk shipyard in 1988 , a new wave of strikes and labor unrest spread across the country , and high on the list of strikers ' demands was government recognition of solidarity .
general jaruzelski announced he was ready to talk with the opposition and in april 1989 , the government agreed to legalize the trade union and allow it to participate in free elections to a bicameral polish parliament . in 1990 , solidarity experienced its perhaps sweetest triumph when walesa was elected president .
but at the same time , that marked the beginning of its long demise .
the movement began drifting apart with internal fighting over interests and the speed of reforms leading to its losing popularity and influence .
even walesa , a national hero , became a target for criticism with his high-handedness .
he narrowly lost a bid for re-election in 1995 to a former communist , aleksander kwasniewski , head of the democratic left alliance . shadow of its former self today solidarnosc has little influence in polish politics and has returned to its roots as a trade union .
but with just under a million members , it even has little sway in company policy .
at its height , it counted ten million members in its ranks , in a country of just under 40 million . walesa announced he was leaving the union on its 25th anniversary , saying its goals today were very different than the ones from its early days .
solidarity 's golden days , and its great achievements , were behind it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lech walesa in 2004 " with it there would have been no german reunification , no triumph over communism , " he said , adding that there are two very different parts to the solidarity story and they should not be confused .

tehran says it does not fear un sanctions . the un atomic watchdog agency , iaea , got its first taste of the iranian government under its new president mahmoud ahmadinejad .
on friday , iaea chief mohamed elbaradei met iran 's new nuclear program director and negotiator ali larijani in vienna to renew talks surrounding iran 's nuclear energy program that the west says is weapons-related .
iran has defied the international community by resuming work on making power reactor fuel that could also be used to make nuclear weapons but insists that it wants to continue talks with the european union on guaranteeing its atomic program is peaceful .
elbaradei and larijani will be discussing " issues related to international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- safeguards inspections and the current state of play , " spokeswoman melissa fleming said in confirming friday 's meeting .
eu 's role brought into question bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu-3 's negotiations with iran not to open the isfahan facility were for nought .
earlier this month activity was restarted despite claims that they will continue negotiations with the eu-3 - britain , france and germany - tehran has sent signals to the contrary as late as thursday .
larijani had challenged the role of the eu-3 as the leaders of diplomatic efforts over the iran 's nuclear program .
" based on what logic and agreement with the international atomic energy agency have the negotiations been limited and dependent on the three european countries ? "
larijani asked on iranian state television .
larijani signaled that iran may look towards widening involvement in the talks , saying that non-aligned countries had asked iran to explain why the negotiations have only been with the eu-3 .
the us viewed the suggestion with a large dose of skepticism , saying that the ploy was just an attempt by tehran to avoid talks over the issue .
" this is a typical tactic for the iranian government .
they will come up with proposals like this to try and change the subject , " said state department spokesman sean mccormack .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : past attempts by germany and the west to hinder iranian nuclear activities have been fruitless .
here , secretary of iran 's supreme national security council , hasan rowhani -lrb- l -rrb- and german foreign minister , joschka fischer at a 2003 press conference iran has accused the three european states of damaging the diplomatic effort by demanding iran abandon its work on the nuclear fuel cycle - the focus of fears iran could acquire the bomb - even though fuel work is technically permitted by the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- .
the eu-3 countered tehran 's claims , saying iran is to blame for the breakdown in the talks due to its decision earlier this month to resume uranium ore conversion work - the first step in the ultra-sensitive enrichment process which had been suspended .
the iaea board , which is to receive a report on iran on september 3 from elbaradei , also called on tehran to reinstate the suspension .
iran has refused , and could face referral to the un security council , which could impose international economic sanctions .
us and eu to make no early move bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin is currently opposed to economic sanctions against tehran economic sanctions in the near term are improbable however .
while waiting for the september 3 report and whether iran adheres to that day 's deadline , the united states and the european union have decided not to seek an iaea emergency meeting , diplomats said thursday .
an emergency session of the international atomic energy agency on september 6 , which the united states was seeking and which could lead to the referral of iran to the un security council for possible sanctions , is " not going to take place , " a senior eu diplomat told afp in vienna where the iaea is based .
the reason is clear .
russia , which has a large contract to build iran 's first nuclear reactor , had objected to holding such a special meeting ahead of a summit at united nations headquarters in new york from september 14-16 .
iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad and russian president vladimir putin are to attend the summit and russia " wanted to give room for what could happen in new york and not to miss an opportunity " for diplomacy , an eu diplomat said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 26.08.2005 study : homeopathy no better than placebo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the lancet " says this medicine is no more effective than sugar water homeopathic treatment is no more effective than a placebo , the dummy substance used in medical trials , according to a study appearing in the british medical weekly , " the lancet . " the renowned medical journal said in a hard-hitting editorial called " the end of homeopathy " that the time for more studies is over and doctors should be honest with patients about homeopathy 's " lack of benefit . " the author of the article , dr. matthias egger from the university of berne , said he and associates in britain and switzerland searched 19 electronic databases covering the period from 1995 to 2003 . they compared 110 trials of homeopathic remedies against a placebo with 110 trials of conventional medicines , which were also tested against a placebo . the ailments being treated in these trials included respiratory-tract infections , pollen allergies and asthma , gynecological and obstetric problems , muscle and joint ache and intestinal upsets . the researchers found that , in small trials which they deemed to be of poor quality , both homeopathic and conventional medicines appeared to fare better against placebos .
but in larger trials that were of high quality , they found no convincing evidence that homeopathy worked better than placebos . like with like homeopathy is based on the principle of treating like with like , also called the law of similary . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the homeopathic practitioner generally looks at the totality of symptoms of a given case , then chooses a remedy that has been reported to produce a similar set of symptoms in healthy subjects .
this remedy is usually given in extremely low concentrations . for example , a person with an allergy would be given an ultra-diluted dose of an agent that would cause the same symptoms . saxon founder the theory of homeopathy was developed by samuel hahnemann , a physician from saxony , who first published it in 1796 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : samuel hahnemann came up with the theory behind homeopathy homeopathy went into decline in the 20th century with the rise of antibiotics and other modern medicines , but in the past decade has staged a comeback , igniting controversy at the same time . over the past two decades , there has been a boom in both the use of homeopathic remedies and visits to homeopathic practitioners .
analysts say there are several reasons for this .
homeopathic treatment is reported by many to be effective . others are disaffected with the traditional medical establishment , which they consider cold and uncaring .
homeopathic practitioners often spend much more time dealing with their patients than do conventional practitioners .
homeopathic preparations also have few if any side effects and are generally much cheaper than conventional medications . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics , however , consider homeopathy to be unscientific and lacking any plausible mechanism .
they often view homeopathy as a pseudoscientific remnant from the age of alchemy , when the behavior of chemical and biological phenomena were poorly understood . in 2002 , the american illusionist and skeptic james randi offered $ 1 million to anyone able to prove , under observed conditions in a laboratory , that homeopathic remedies can really cure people .
thus far , no one has passed the preliminary tests . popular in germany even so , homeopathy has a fervent vocal lobby of supporters , and health insurance schemes in europe are under increasing pressure to include it in their coverage . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , where homeopathy is very popular , there are about 6,000 physicians specializing in the field .
in 1978 , it was recognized as " special form of therapy , " meaning the medication was freed from the usual requirements of proven efficacy .
but since the beginning of 2004 , homeopathic medications , with a few exceptions , are no longer covered by public health insurance .
many private health insurers continue to cover homeopathy . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de homeopathy seeks more acknowledgement while meeting with practitioners of homeopathy from over 40 countries at a congress in berlin , the german association of homeopathic doctors demanded wider recognition for the 200-year-old alternative medical science .

tehran says it does not fear un sanctions . the un atomic watchdog agency , iaea , got its first taste of the iranian government under its new president mahmoud ahmadinejad .
on friday , iaea chief mohamed elbaradei met iran 's new nuclear program director and negotiator ali larijani in vienna to renew talks surrounding iran 's nuclear energy program that the west says is weapons-related .
iran has defied the international community by resuming work on making power reactor fuel that could also be used to make nuclear weapons but insists that it wants to continue talks with the european union on guaranteeing its atomic program is peaceful .
elbaradei and larijani will be discussing " issues related to international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- safeguards inspections and the current state of play , " spokeswoman melissa fleming said in confirming friday 's meeting .
eu 's role brought into question bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu-3 's negotiations with iran not to open the isfahan facility were for nought .
earlier this month activity was restarted despite claims that they will continue negotiations with the eu-3 - britain , france and germany - tehran has sent signals to the contrary as late as thursday .
larijani had challenged the role of the eu-3 as the leaders of diplomatic efforts over the iran 's nuclear program .
" based on what logic and agreement with the international atomic energy agency have the negotiations been limited and dependent on the three european countries ? "
larijani asked on iranian state television .
larijani signaled that iran may look towards widening involvement in the talks , saying that non-aligned countries had asked iran to explain why the negotiations have only been with the eu-3 .
the us viewed the suggestion with a large dose of skepticism , saying that the ploy was just an attempt by tehran to avoid talks over the issue .
" this is a typical tactic for the iranian government .
they will come up with proposals like this to try and change the subject , " said state department spokesman sean mccormack .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : past attempts by germany and the west to hinder iranian nuclear activities have been fruitless .
here , secretary of iran 's supreme national security council , hasan rowhani -lrb- l -rrb- and german foreign minister , joschka fischer at a 2003 press conference iran has accused the three european states of damaging the diplomatic effort by demanding iran abandon its work on the nuclear fuel cycle - the focus of fears iran could acquire the bomb - even though fuel work is technically permitted by the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- .
the eu-3 countered tehran 's claims , saying iran is to blame for the breakdown in the talks due to its decision earlier this month to resume uranium ore conversion work - the first step in the ultra-sensitive enrichment process which had been suspended .
the iaea board , which is to receive a report on iran on september 3 from elbaradei , also called on tehran to reinstate the suspension .
iran has refused , and could face referral to the un security council , which could impose international economic sanctions .
us and eu to make no early move bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin is currently opposed to economic sanctions against tehran economic sanctions in the near term are improbable however .
while waiting for the september 3 report and whether iran adheres to that day 's deadline , the united states and the european union have decided not to seek an iaea emergency meeting , diplomats said thursday .
an emergency session of the international atomic energy agency on september 6 , which the united states was seeking and which could lead to the referral of iran to the un security council for possible sanctions , is " not going to take place , " a senior eu diplomat told afp in vienna where the iaea is based .
the reason is clear .
russia , which has a large contract to build iran 's first nuclear reactor , had objected to holding such a special meeting ahead of a summit at united nations headquarters in new york from september 14-16 .
iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad and russian president vladimir putin are to attend the summit and russia " wanted to give room for what could happen in new york and not to miss an opportunity " for diplomacy , an eu diplomat said .
the diplomat was speaking about efforts to get iran to resume both the fuel suspension and talks with the eu that focus on winning guarantees that tehran will not make nuclear weapons . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu calls for emergency un meeting on iran mahmoud ahmadinejad faces the possibility of being brought before the un 's nuclear watchdog in his first week as iran 's president after the eu called for emergency talks on the islamic republic 's atomic program .

" the renowned medical journal said in a hard-hitting editorial called " the end of homeopathy " that the time for more studies is over and doctors should be honest with patients about homeopathy 's " lack of benefit . " the author of the article , dr. matthias egger from the university of berne , said he and associates in britain and switzerland searched 19 electronic databases covering the period from 1995 to 2003 . they compared 110 trials of homeopathic remedies against a placebo with 110 trials of conventional medicines , which were also tested against a placebo . the ailments being treated in these trials included respiratory-tract infections , pollen allergies and asthma , gynecological and obstetric problems , muscle and joint ache and intestinal upsets . the researchers found that , in small trials which they deemed to be of poor quality , both homeopathic and conventional medicines appeared to fare better against placebos .
but in larger trials that were of high quality , they found no convincing evidence that homeopathy worked better than placebos . like with like homeopathy is based on the principle of treating like with like , also called the law of similary . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the homeopathic practitioner generally looks at the totality of symptoms of a given case , then chooses a remedy that has been reported to produce a similar set of symptoms in healthy subjects .
this remedy is usually given in extremely low concentrations . for example , a person with an allergy would be given an ultra-diluted dose of an agent that would cause the same symptoms . saxon founder the theory of homeopathy was developed by samuel hahnemann , a physician from saxony , who first published it in 1796 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : samuel hahnemann came up with the theory behind homeopathy homeopathy went into decline in the 20th century with the rise of antibiotics and other modern medicines , but in the past decade has staged a comeback , igniting controversy at the same time . over the past two decades , there has been a boom in both the use of homeopathic remedies and visits to homeopathic practitioners .
analysts say there are several reasons for this .
homeopathic treatment is reported by many to be effective . others are disaffected with the traditional medical establishment , which they consider cold and uncaring .
homeopathic practitioners often spend much more time dealing with their patients than do conventional practitioners .
homeopathic preparations also have few if any side effects and are generally much cheaper than conventional medications . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics , however , consider homeopathy to be unscientific and lacking any plausible mechanism .
they often view homeopathy as a pseudoscientific remnant from the age of alchemy , when the behavior of chemical and biological phenomena were poorly understood . in 2002 , the american illusionist and skeptic james randi offered $ 1 million to anyone able to prove , under observed conditions in a laboratory , that homeopathic remedies can really cure people .
thus far , no one has passed the preliminary tests . popular in germany even so , homeopathy has a fervent vocal lobby of supporters , and health insurance schemes in europe are under increasing pressure to include it in their coverage . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , where homeopathy is very popular , there are about 6,000 physicians specializing in the field .
in 1978 , it was recognized as " special form of therapy , " meaning the medication was freed from the usual requirements of proven efficacy .
but since the beginning of 2004 , homeopathic medications , with a few exceptions , are no longer covered by public health insurance .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 26.08.2005 looking back on 25 years of solidarity großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solidarnosc today is but a shadow of its former self solidarnosc , the workers ' union that played an important role in the fall of communism in poland , was founded 25 years ago .
what began as a group of dissident intellectuals became an unstoppable force for change . the poland that begat solidarnosc , or solidarity , a quarter century ago is hardly recognizable today .
then , poland was a totalitarian , satellite state of the soviet union , under moscow 's firm hand .
today , poland is a democratic country and a member of the european union as well as nato .
much of that development is due to the influence of the trade union that got its start in the gdansk shipyards in 1980 . the origins of solidarity go back even further , to 1976 , when a " worker 's defense committee " was founded by a group of dissident intellectuals after several thousand workers who had been on strike were attacked and jailed by authorities in various cities .
in 1979 , the committee published a charter of worker 's rights . in 1980 , a new wave of strikes again broke out , this time sparked by a seemingly insignificant event .
the communist government had raised the price of meat in the cafeteria of the lenin shipyards in the northern industrial city of gdansk .
a female worker had complained about the price hike and was fired . that led 17,000 workers to put down their tools and barricade themselves inside the plant under the leadership of lech walesa , an electrician at the shipyard . by mid-august , strikes had spread throughout the country and millions of polish white and blue-collar workers took to the streets demanding better working conditions , even though only 10 years earlier , similar strikes had ended in bloodshed with dozens of people killed by machine gun fire and over 1,000 injured . bildunterschrift : august 30 , 1980 , one day before signing the agreement with the government , jubilant solidarity members carry their leader lech walesa on their shoulders but on august 31 , 1980 , after weeks of the strike action , the workers in the shipyard reached their goal .
the strike movement , which would soon be formally known as solidarity , was accepted as an independent trade union . " finally we have an independent union under our own administration , " said lech walesa .
" we now have the right to strike and we are going to demand more rights soon . " brief period of freedom organizers were anything but sure of their victory , though , even when , at the end of that august , the government signed the " gdansk treaty " with its 21 demands , including freedom of expression , a free trade union and the right to strike . " getting the right to have an independent trade union was a breakthrough , " said bogdan lis , one of the founders of solidarity .
" it was so unbelievable that we could only wonder then how long it would last . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : general wojciech jaruzelski , poland 's last communist-era leader in warsaw , poland , may 23 , 2005 .
the unionists got their answer 500 days later , when the former defense minister , general wojciech jaruzelski , who took over the reins of government in february 1981 , took away the new-found freedoms . " i hereby proclaim martial law in all of poland , " he announced on television as a shocked nation watched . martial law lasted two years after that and the communist leaders did what they could to cripple the solidarity movement .
government critics and union adherents were put in internment camps , including the leadership circle around walesa .
the party tried to rid the country of what it considered a trade union disease . dogged drive for freedom while forced underground , the drive for freedom was not easily stopped , according to wladyslaw bartoszewski , one-time chair of the polish writers association and polish foreign minister in the 1990s . " the breakup of the trade unions was a step that can not be without consequences , " he said after his release from an internment camp in october 1982 .
" many have been released from prison , but many are still behind bars , even renowned writers and professors .
there are many who are still being arrested and sentenced , many women among them .
we catholics in poland are very upset and worried . " lech walesa himself was arrested and stayed under house arrest until the end of 1982 .
but the movement he led , although officially dissolved by parliament in 1982 and driven underground , remained active .
the unrest in the country could no longer be quieted by draconian measures from on high . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers at the gdansk shipyard in 1988 , a new wave of strikes and labor unrest spread across the country , and high on the list of strikers ' demands was government recognition of solidarity .
general jaruzelski announced he was ready to talk with the opposition and in april 1989 , the government agreed to legalize the trade union and allow it to participate in free elections to a bicameral polish parliament . in 1990 , solidarity experienced its perhaps sweetest triumph when walesa was elected president .
but at the same time , that marked the beginning of its long demise .
the movement began drifting apart with internal fighting over interests and the speed of reforms leading to its losing popularity and influence .
even walesa , a national hero , became a target for criticism with his high-handedness .
he narrowly lost a bid for re-election in 1995 to a former communist , aleksander kwasniewski , head of the democratic left alliance . shadow of its former self today solidarnosc has little influence in polish politics and has returned to its roots as a trade union .
but with just under a million members , it even has little sway in company policy .
at its height , it counted ten million members in its ranks , in a country of just under 40 million . walesa announced he was leaving the union on its 25th anniversary , saying its goals today were very different than the ones from its early days .
solidarity 's golden days , and its great achievements , were behind it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lech walesa in 2004 " with it there would have been no german reunification , no triumph over communism , " he said , adding that there are two very different parts to the solidarity story and they should not be confused . " on the one side there is our great victory , and on the other there is our weak performance in making use of that victory .

unfortunately , the budget boosts provided by the federal states to deal with the problem follow the flood waves - except with a year 's delay . "
in the face of climate change , all flood protection concepts have to be reviewed , said regine günther , also of wwf .
on the political level pressure has to be increased to achieve a faster reduction of greenhouse gas emissions .
a failure to deliver ?
" the federal government and the states have so far not delivered on their promises they made during the 2002 floods to introduce adequate flood protection measures , " said gerhard timm , director for the german federation for the protection of the environment and nature -lrb- bund -rrb- .
through river regulation , dykes and dams rivers in germany are left with only a fifth of their original flooding areas .
but bavarian premier edmund stoiber said there is no reason for renewed action .
" we have done our homework , " he said , adding that bavaria has invested more than 670 million euros -lrb- $ 822 million -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in dresden , streets get regularly flooded , like in this picture taken in march according to the state 's ministry for the environment , the measures include improved prevention and warning systems as well as extended polder areas .
the natural environs of rivers , streams and floodplains have been returned to their original natural state .
the ministry also urges property owners to make available more land faster to be used for conversions into polder areas .
in germany , an area totalling some 150 soccer pitches is being sealed off every day as part of construction projects for streets and buildings .
these areas can no longer absorb rainfalls , according to the ministry .
floods harbi n ger of thi n gs to come spells of extreme weather such as the current heat wave in portugal or the heavy rains in bavaria are but a first sign of global warming already affecting everyday weather patterns , said mojib latif of the institute of oceanography at the university of kiel in northern germany .
the air above the mediterranean absorbs humidity and transports it northwards and past the alps on their eastern flank .
but because of global warming , more water evaporates above the mediterranean , leading to the air moving northwards being wetter , mojib said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rescuers in a rubber dinghy evacuate residents from the flooded areas in downtown prague in august 2002 and once the clouds get stuck at the mountain tops of the alps , massive , torrential downpours are the result .

" the chinese side expressed its concern over the textile products blocked at customs in eu countries , " a chinese commerce ministry spokeswoman told afp in describing thursday 's negotiations . european union negotiators said the backlog of products was " not in the interests of eu traders and consumers , " she said . according to the french trade ministry earlier this week , 48 million sweaters , 17 million pairs of trousers , some 500,000 blouses , 1.6 million t-shirts , 3.4 million bras and 1,470 tons of flax yarn are being held up . resolution of stand-off in interest of both parties " the atmosphere of the discussions with our chinese colleagues is , as could be expected , constructive and friendly , given that of course it 's in the interest of the two sides to resolve this problem as quickly as possible , " eu commission spokeswoman amelia torres told journalists in brussels thursday . eu officials in beijing refused to comment on the talks other than to say that negotiations had resumed in earnest friday . lu jianhua , director of the ministry of commerce 's foreign trade administration department , headed up the chinese side , while fritz-harald wenig , a trade director with the european commission , represented the eu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's textile exports to europe surged to 2.1 billion dollars in june , up 85 percent over the same month last year , as rush orders for chinese goods soared while negotiators hammered out the new quotas , china 's trade ministry said . a senior chinese trade official said part of the problem was that the eu and china agreed that the period between june 11 and july 20 was needed to set up mechanisms to monitor the textile trade and the implementation of the agreement . mass influx of chinese products " during this period , 10 categories of chinese products could be freely imported to eu without any application for licenses , and traders in both china and eu rushed -lrb- orders -rrb- in order to avoid the quantity controls , " the unnamed official said in a comment posted on the commerce ministry website .

what began as a group of dissident intellectuals became an unstoppable force for change . the poland that begat solidarnosc , or solidarity , a quarter century ago is hardly recognizable today .
then , poland was a totalitarian , satellite state of the soviet union , under moscow 's firm hand .
today , poland is a democratic country and a member of the european union as well as nato .
much of that development is due to the influence of the trade union that got its start in the gdansk shipyards in 1980 . the origins of solidarity go back even further , to 1976 , when a " worker 's defense committee " was founded by a group of dissident intellectuals after several thousand workers who had been on strike were attacked and jailed by authorities in various cities .
in 1979 , the committee published a charter of worker 's rights . in 1980 , a new wave of strikes again broke out , this time sparked by a seemingly insignificant event .
the communist government had raised the price of meat in the cafeteria of the lenin shipyards in the northern industrial city of gdansk .
a female worker had complained about the price hike and was fired . that led 17,000 workers to put down their tools and barricade themselves inside the plant under the leadership of lech walesa , an electrician at the shipyard . by mid-august , strikes had spread throughout the country and millions of polish white and blue-collar workers took to the streets demanding better working conditions , even though only 10 years earlier , similar strikes had ended in bloodshed with dozens of people killed by machine gun fire and over 1,000 injured . bildunterschrift : august 30 , 1980 , one day before signing the agreement with the government , jubilant solidarity members carry their leader lech walesa on their shoulders but on august 31 , 1980 , after weeks of the strike action , the workers in the shipyard reached their goal .
the strike movement , which would soon be formally known as solidarity , was accepted as an independent trade union . " finally we have an independent union under our own administration , " said lech walesa .
" we now have the right to strike and we are going to demand more rights soon . " brief period of freedom organizers were anything but sure of their victory , though , even when , at the end of that august , the government signed the " gdansk treaty " with its 21 demands , including freedom of expression , a free trade union and the right to strike . " getting the right to have an independent trade union was a breakthrough , " said bogdan lis , one of the founders of solidarity .
" it was so unbelievable that we could only wonder then how long it would last . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : general wojciech jaruzelski , poland 's last communist-era leader in warsaw , poland , may 23 , 2005 .
the unionists got their answer 500 days later , when the former defense minister , general wojciech jaruzelski , who took over the reins of government in february 1981 , took away the new-found freedoms . " i hereby proclaim martial law in all of poland , " he announced on television as a shocked nation watched . martial law lasted two years after that and the communist leaders did what they could to cripple the solidarity movement .
government critics and union adherents were put in internment camps , including the leadership circle around walesa .
the party tried to rid the country of what it considered a trade union disease . dogged drive for freedom while forced underground , the drive for freedom was not easily stopped , according to wladyslaw bartoszewski , one-time chair of the polish writers association and polish foreign minister in the 1990s . " the breakup of the trade unions was a step that can not be without consequences , " he said after his release from an internment camp in october 1982 .
" many have been released from prison , but many are still behind bars , even renowned writers and professors .
there are many who are still being arrested and sentenced , many women among them .
we catholics in poland are very upset and worried . " lech walesa himself was arrested and stayed under house arrest until the end of 1982 .
but the movement he led , although officially dissolved by parliament in 1982 and driven underground , remained active .
the unrest in the country could no longer be quieted by draconian measures from on high . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers at the gdansk shipyard in 1988 , a new wave of strikes and labor unrest spread across the country , and high on the list of strikers ' demands was government recognition of solidarity .
general jaruzelski announced he was ready to talk with the opposition and in april 1989 , the government agreed to legalize the trade union and allow it to participate in free elections to a bicameral polish parliament . in 1990 , solidarity experienced its perhaps sweetest triumph when walesa was elected president .
but at the same time , that marked the beginning of its long demise .
the movement began drifting apart with internal fighting over interests and the speed of reforms leading to its losing popularity and influence .
even walesa , a national hero , became a target for criticism with his high-handedness .
he narrowly lost a bid for re-election in 1995 to a former communist , aleksander kwasniewski , head of the democratic left alliance . shadow of its former self today solidarnosc has little influence in polish politics and has returned to its roots as a trade union .
but with just under a million members , it even has little sway in company policy .
at its height , it counted ten million members in its ranks , in a country of just under 40 million . walesa announced he was leaving the union on its 25th anniversary , saying its goals today were very different than the ones from its early days .
solidarity 's golden days , and its great achievements , were behind it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lech walesa in 2004 " with it there would have been no german reunification , no triumph over communism , " he said , adding that there are two very different parts to the solidarity story and they should not be confused .

" the chinese side expressed its concern over the textile products blocked at customs in eu countries , " a chinese commerce ministry spokeswoman told afp in describing thursday 's negotiations . european union negotiators said the backlog of products was " not in the interests of eu traders and consumers , " she said . according to the french trade ministry earlier this week , 48 million sweaters , 17 million pairs of trousers , some 500,000 blouses , 1.6 million t-shirts , 3.4 million bras and 1,470 tons of flax yarn are being held up . resolution of stand-off in interest of both parties " the atmosphere of the discussions with our chinese colleagues is , as could be expected , constructive and friendly , given that of course it 's in the interest of the two sides to resolve this problem as quickly as possible , " eu commission spokeswoman amelia torres told journalists in brussels thursday . eu officials in beijing refused to comment on the talks other than to say that negotiations had resumed in earnest friday . lu jianhua , director of the ministry of commerce 's foreign trade administration department , headed up the chinese side , while fritz-harald wenig , a trade director with the european commission , represented the eu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's textile exports to europe surged to 2.1 billion dollars in june , up 85 percent over the same month last year , as rush orders for chinese goods soared while negotiators hammered out the new quotas , china 's trade ministry said . a senior chinese trade official said part of the problem was that the eu and china agreed that the period between june 11 and july 20 was needed to set up mechanisms to monitor the textile trade and the implementation of the agreement . mass influx of chinese products " during this period , 10 categories of chinese products could be freely imported to eu without any application for licenses , and traders in both china and eu rushed -lrb- orders -rrb- in order to avoid the quantity controls , " the unnamed official said in a comment posted on the commerce ministry website .
" the irrational activities of enterprises in china and eu brought on the furious increase of the ... products . " in accordance with normal trade practices , credit guarantees would have already been issued by buyers before the shipping . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clothes not authorized for import are costing retailers and manufacturers dearly european retailers could thus be facing hundreds of millions of dollars in losses not only for the goods , but additional shipping and storage costs , industry sources said . china has protested the re-implementation of us and eu textiles quotas following the end the long-standing global quota system as a move counter to free trade and ongoing world trade organization trade liberalization talks . the united states has invoked wto " safeguards " that limit chinese textile imports in at least six categories to 7.5 percent annual growth and is currently negotiating with china to implement similar limits on nearly 20 categories . us negotiators are expected in beijing next week to restart talks on the issue . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de china wants eu to increase textile quotas beijing and brussels were set to begin trade negotiations over booming chinese textile exports with china expecting the eu to capitulate and increase import quotas , according to chinese sources on wednesday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 26.08.2005 looking back on 25 years of solidarity großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solidarnosc today is but a shadow of its former self solidarnosc , the workers ' union that played an important role in the fall of communism in poland , was founded 25 years ago .
what began as a group of dissident intellectuals became an unstoppable force for change . the poland that begat solidarnosc , or solidarity , a quarter century ago is hardly recognizable today .
then , poland was a totalitarian , satellite state of the soviet union , under moscow 's firm hand .
today , poland is a democratic country and a member of the european union as well as nato .
much of that development is due to the influence of the trade union that got its start in the gdansk shipyards in 1980 . the origins of solidarity go back even further , to 1976 , when a " worker 's defense committee " was founded by a group of dissident intellectuals after several thousand workers who had been on strike were attacked and jailed by authorities in various cities .
in 1979 , the committee published a charter of worker 's rights . in 1980 , a new wave of strikes again broke out , this time sparked by a seemingly insignificant event .
the communist government had raised the price of meat in the cafeteria of the lenin shipyards in the northern industrial city of gdansk .
a female worker had complained about the price hike and was fired . that led 17,000 workers to put down their tools and barricade themselves inside the plant under the leadership of lech walesa , an electrician at the shipyard . by mid-august , strikes had spread throughout the country and millions of polish white and blue-collar workers took to the streets demanding better working conditions , even though only 10 years earlier , similar strikes had ended in bloodshed with dozens of people killed by machine gun fire and over 1,000 injured . bildunterschrift : august 30 , 1980 , one day before signing the agreement with the government , jubilant solidarity members carry their leader lech walesa on their shoulders but on august 31 , 1980 , after weeks of the strike action , the workers in the shipyard reached their goal .
the strike movement , which would soon be formally known as solidarity , was accepted as an independent trade union . " finally we have an independent union under our own administration , " said lech walesa .
" we now have the right to strike and we are going to demand more rights soon . " brief period of freedom organizers were anything but sure of their victory , though , even when , at the end of that august , the government signed the " gdansk treaty " with its 21 demands , including freedom of expression , a free trade union and the right to strike . " getting the right to have an independent trade union was a breakthrough , " said bogdan lis , one of the founders of solidarity .
" it was so unbelievable that we could only wonder then how long it would last . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : general wojciech jaruzelski , poland 's last communist-era leader in warsaw , poland , may 23 , 2005 .
the unionists got their answer 500 days later , when the former defense minister , general wojciech jaruzelski , who took over the reins of government in february 1981 , took away the new-found freedoms . " i hereby proclaim martial law in all of poland , " he announced on television as a shocked nation watched . martial law lasted two years after that and the communist leaders did what they could to cripple the solidarity movement .
government critics and union adherents were put in internment camps , including the leadership circle around walesa .
the party tried to rid the country of what it considered a trade union disease . dogged drive for freedom while forced underground , the drive for freedom was not easily stopped , according to wladyslaw bartoszewski , one-time chair of the polish writers association and polish foreign minister in the 1990s . " the breakup of the trade unions was a step that can not be without consequences , " he said after his release from an internment camp in october 1982 .
" many have been released from prison , but many are still behind bars , even renowned writers and professors .
there are many who are still being arrested and sentenced , many women among them .
we catholics in poland are very upset and worried . " lech walesa himself was arrested and stayed under house arrest until the end of 1982 .
but the movement he led , although officially dissolved by parliament in 1982 and driven underground , remained active .
the unrest in the country could no longer be quieted by draconian measures from on high . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers at the gdansk shipyard in 1988 , a new wave of strikes and labor unrest spread across the country , and high on the list of strikers ' demands was government recognition of solidarity .
general jaruzelski announced he was ready to talk with the opposition and in april 1989 , the government agreed to legalize the trade union and allow it to participate in free elections to a bicameral polish parliament . in 1990 , solidarity experienced its perhaps sweetest triumph when walesa was elected president .
but at the same time , that marked the beginning of its long demise .
the movement began drifting apart with internal fighting over interests and the speed of reforms leading to its losing popularity and influence .
even walesa , a national hero , became a target for criticism with his high-handedness .
he narrowly lost a bid for re-election in 1995 to a former communist , aleksander kwasniewski , head of the democratic left alliance . shadow of its former self today solidarnosc has little influence in polish politics and has returned to its roots as a trade union .
but with just under a million members , it even has little sway in company policy .
at its height , it counted ten million members in its ranks , in a country of just under 40 million . walesa announced he was leaving the union on its 25th anniversary , saying its goals today were very different than the ones from its early days .
solidarity 's golden days , and its great achievements , were behind it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lech walesa in 2004 " with it there would have been no german reunification , no triumph over communism , " he said , adding that there are two very different parts to the solidarity story and they should not be confused . " on the one side there is our great victory , and on the other there is our weak performance in making use of that victory .

what began as a group of dissident intellectuals became an unstoppable force for change . the poland that begat solidarnosc , or solidarity , a quarter century ago is hardly recognizable today .
then , poland was a totalitarian , satellite state of the soviet union , under moscow 's firm hand .
today , poland is a democratic country and a member of the european union as well as nato .
much of that development is due to the influence of the trade union that got its start in the gdansk shipyards in 1980 . the origins of solidarity go back even further , to 1976 , when a " worker 's defense committee " was founded by a group of dissident intellectuals after several thousand workers who had been on strike were attacked and jailed by authorities in various cities .
in 1979 , the committee published a charter of worker 's rights . in 1980 , a new wave of strikes again broke out , this time sparked by a seemingly insignificant event .
the communist government had raised the price of meat in the cafeteria of the lenin shipyards in the northern industrial city of gdansk .
a female worker had complained about the price hike and was fired . that led 17,000 workers to put down their tools and barricade themselves inside the plant under the leadership of lech walesa , an electrician at the shipyard . by mid-august , strikes had spread throughout the country and millions of polish white and blue-collar workers took to the streets demanding better working conditions , even though only 10 years earlier , similar strikes had ended in bloodshed with dozens of people killed by machine gun fire and over 1,000 injured . bildunterschrift : august 30 , 1980 , one day before signing the agreement with the government , jubilant solidarity members carry their leader lech walesa on their shoulders but on august 31 , 1980 , after weeks of the strike action , the workers in the shipyard reached their goal .
the strike movement , which would soon be formally known as solidarity , was accepted as an independent trade union . " finally we have an independent union under our own administration , " said lech walesa .
" we now have the right to strike and we are going to demand more rights soon . " brief period of freedom organizers were anything but sure of their victory , though , even when , at the end of that august , the government signed the " gdansk treaty " with its 21 demands , including freedom of expression , a free trade union and the right to strike . " getting the right to have an independent trade union was a breakthrough , " said bogdan lis , one of the founders of solidarity .
" it was so unbelievable that we could only wonder then how long it would last . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : general wojciech jaruzelski , poland 's last communist-era leader in warsaw , poland , may 23 , 2005 .
the unionists got their answer 500 days later , when the former defense minister , general wojciech jaruzelski , who took over the reins of government in february 1981 , took away the new-found freedoms . " i hereby proclaim martial law in all of poland , " he announced on television as a shocked nation watched . martial law lasted two years after that and the communist leaders did what they could to cripple the solidarity movement .
government critics and union adherents were put in internment camps , including the leadership circle around walesa .
the party tried to rid the country of what it considered a trade union disease . dogged drive for freedom while forced underground , the drive for freedom was not easily stopped , according to wladyslaw bartoszewski , one-time chair of the polish writers association and polish foreign minister in the 1990s . " the breakup of the trade unions was a step that can not be without consequences , " he said after his release from an internment camp in october 1982 .
" many have been released from prison , but many are still behind bars , even renowned writers and professors .
there are many who are still being arrested and sentenced , many women among them .
we catholics in poland are very upset and worried . " lech walesa himself was arrested and stayed under house arrest until the end of 1982 .
but the movement he led , although officially dissolved by parliament in 1982 and driven underground , remained active .
the unrest in the country could no longer be quieted by draconian measures from on high . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers at the gdansk shipyard in 1988 , a new wave of strikes and labor unrest spread across the country , and high on the list of strikers ' demands was government recognition of solidarity .
general jaruzelski announced he was ready to talk with the opposition and in april 1989 , the government agreed to legalize the trade union and allow it to participate in free elections to a bicameral polish parliament . in 1990 , solidarity experienced its perhaps sweetest triumph when walesa was elected president .
but at the same time , that marked the beginning of its long demise .
the movement began drifting apart with internal fighting over interests and the speed of reforms leading to its losing popularity and influence .
even walesa , a national hero , became a target for criticism with his high-handedness .
he narrowly lost a bid for re-election in 1995 to a former communist , aleksander kwasniewski , head of the democratic left alliance . shadow of its former self today solidarnosc has little influence in polish politics and has returned to its roots as a trade union .
but with just under a million members , it even has little sway in company policy .
at its height , it counted ten million members in its ranks , in a country of just under 40 million . walesa announced he was leaving the union on its 25th anniversary , saying its goals today were very different than the ones from its early days .
solidarity 's golden days , and its great achievements , were behind it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lech walesa in 2004 " with it there would have been no german reunification , no triumph over communism , " he said , adding that there are two very different parts to the solidarity story and they should not be confused . " on the one side there is our great victory , and on the other there is our weak performance in making use of that victory .

what more can be done about the floods ?
climate change outpaces politics , say environmental experts . villages and towns enclosed by water , dramatic efforts to rescue people - the pictures from bavaria , austria and switzerland resemble those of what was previously dubbed " the floods of the century " in 1999 on the oder river or 2002 at the elbe and danube rivers .

what more can be done about the floods ?
climate change outpaces politics , say environmental experts . villages and towns enclosed by water , dramatic efforts to rescue people - the pictures from bavaria , austria and switzerland resemble those of what was previously dubbed " the floods of the century " in 1999 on the oder river or 2002 at the elbe and danube rivers .
politicians are flocking to the disaster area and their gestures of support and pledges of aid also resemble each other .
but according to environmental experts , nature 's warning signals are still not being taken seriously enough .
a n eed to act climate researchers are convinced the present situation is just a harbinger of much more severe floods that could be caused by climate change in the future .

" a long breath is needed beyond individual legislative periods and a finance policy based on what we already know about the problem .
unfortunately , the budget boosts provided by the federal states to deal with the problem follow the flood waves - except with a year 's delay . "
in the face of climate change , all flood protection concepts have to be reviewed , said regine günther , also of wwf .
on the political level pressure has to be increased to achieve a faster reduction of greenhouse gas emissions .

" the federal government and the states have so far not delivered on their promises they made during the 2002 floods to introduce adequate flood protection measures , " said gerhard timm , director for the german federation for the protection of the environment and nature -lrb- bund -rrb- .
through river regulation , dykes and dams rivers in germany are left with only a fifth of their original flooding areas .
but bavarian premier edmund stoiber said there is no reason for renewed action .
" we have done our homework , " he said , adding that bavaria has invested more than 670 million euros -lrb- $ 822 million -rrb- .

the natural environs of rivers , streams and floodplains have been returned to their original natural state .
the ministry also urges property owners to make available more land faster to be used for conversions into polder areas .
in germany , an area totalling some 150 soccer pitches is being sealed off every day as part of construction projects for streets and buildings .
these areas can no longer absorb rainfalls , according to the ministry .
floods harbi n ger of thi n gs to come spells of extreme weather such as the current heat wave in portugal or the heavy rains in bavaria are but a first sign of global warming already affecting everyday weather patterns , said mojib latif of the institute of oceanography at the university of kiel in northern germany .
the air above the mediterranean absorbs humidity and transports it northwards and past the alps on their eastern flank .
but because of global warming , more water evaporates above the mediterranean , leading to the air moving northwards being wetter , mojib said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 26.08.2005 study : homeopathy no better than placebo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the lancet " says this medicine is no more effective than sugar water homeopathic treatment is no more effective than a placebo , the dummy substance used in medical trials , according to a study appearing in the british medical weekly , " the lancet . " the renowned medical journal said in a hard-hitting editorial called " the end of homeopathy " that the time for more studies is over and doctors should be honest with patients about homeopathy 's " lack of benefit . " the author of the article , dr. matthias egger from the university of berne , said he and associates in britain and switzerland searched 19 electronic databases covering the period from 1995 to 2003 . they compared 110 trials of homeopathic remedies against a placebo with 110 trials of conventional medicines , which were also tested against a placebo . the ailments being treated in these trials included respiratory-tract infections , pollen allergies and asthma , gynecological and obstetric problems , muscle and joint ache and intestinal upsets . the researchers found that , in small trials which they deemed to be of poor quality , both homeopathic and conventional medicines appeared to fare better against placebos .
but in larger trials that were of high quality , they found no convincing evidence that homeopathy worked better than placebos . like with like homeopathy is based on the principle of treating like with like , also called the law of similary . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the homeopathic practitioner generally looks at the totality of symptoms of a given case , then chooses a remedy that has been reported to produce a similar set of symptoms in healthy subjects .
this remedy is usually given in extremely low concentrations . for example , a person with an allergy would be given an ultra-diluted dose of an agent that would cause the same symptoms . saxon founder the theory of homeopathy was developed by samuel hahnemann , a physician from saxony , who first published it in 1796 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : samuel hahnemann came up with the theory behind homeopathy homeopathy went into decline in the 20th century with the rise of antibiotics and other modern medicines , but in the past decade has staged a comeback , igniting controversy at the same time . over the past two decades , there has been a boom in both the use of homeopathic remedies and visits to homeopathic practitioners .
analysts say there are several reasons for this .

women who have such cells in their bone marrow have a far higher risk of developing cancer again , the university said .

while authorities said they expected the flood waters to recede later in the day , cities in bavaria continued to take precautions to stop swollen rivers from flooding streets and causing a repeat of the chaos which has already claimed one life in the region .
in the city of regensburg , the danube rose to levels of 5.6 meters -lrb- 18 feet -rrb- overnight , leaving several quays under water , but it was still one meter lower than the readings during the devastating flooding which hit germany in 2002 .
the benedictine abbey of weltenburg , the oldest monastery in bavaria , was saved from water damage by a dam of sandbags which was hastily assembled by monks and emergency workers .
the cities of passau , which is crisscrossed by three rivers , and ingolstadt appeared to have escaped the devastation caused by torrential rain across central europe .
the only victim of the floods in germany was a 28-year-old man who drowned when he and two friends went out in a rubber dinghy near the city of rosenheim . dw-world.de politicians flock to flood zone floods in bavaria have caused chaos and destruction and galvanized politicians , in the thick of an election campaign , into action .

bernhard glocksin is encouraging members of the audience to smoke joints while taking in performances of " la princesse jaune -lrb- the oriental princess -rrb- " , the one-act druggy opera by camille saint-saens . the opera tells the story of kornélis , a man in love with a portrait of a japanese princess .
under the sway of a hallucinogenic potion which he believes will unite him with the object of his infatuation , he confuses the portrait with his own fiancée . his increasingly long trips into a psychedelic version of japan within his own imagination eventually prevent kornélis from distinguishing between fantasy and reality as he slips further away from his real life love . artistic license in an attempt to create that far-out feeling , the actors themselves will also smoke pot onstage while the audience mellow out in the stalls . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glocksin maintains that the opera experience will be " improved with a few joints " while the opera house asserts that artistic license will protect it from drug laws . " it ’ s a test to see just what we can get away with , " glocksin said . according to german drug laws , however , the opera may be taking a step too far in blurring the lines between art and life .
legal hurdles drug laws concerning cannabis in germany vary from state to state and a fine or referral for prosecution can be administered for personal possession of anything from six to 30 grams .
in berlin , anything up to 10 grams is considered to be " for personal use " and will often be overlooked .
smoking dope in public places , however , can be interpreted by law as an offense against the german constitution and is therefore a punishable act .
as germany does not carry laws like those in neighboring holland which permit establishments with special licenses to sell and allow cannabis to be used on the premises , a location allowing drug consumption on-site would be breaking the law .
enforcement of these laws on opening night may make the first performance of " la princesse jaune " even more surreal .

bernhard glocksin is encouraging members of the audience to smoke joints while taking in performances of " la princesse jaune -lrb- the oriental princess -rrb- " , the one-act druggy opera by camille saint-saens . the opera tells the story of kornélis , a man in love with a portrait of a japanese princess .
under the sway of a hallucinogenic potion which he believes will unite him with the object of his infatuation , he confuses the portrait with his own fiancée . his increasingly long trips into a psychedelic version of japan within his own imagination eventually prevent kornélis from distinguishing between fantasy and reality as he slips further away from his real life love . artistic license in an attempt to create that far-out feeling , the actors themselves will also smoke pot onstage while the audience mellow out in the stalls . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glocksin maintains that the opera experience will be " improved with a few joints " while the opera house asserts that artistic license will protect it from drug laws . " it ’ s a test to see just what we can get away with , " glocksin said . according to german drug laws , however , the opera may be taking a step too far in blurring the lines between art and life .
legal hurdles drug laws concerning cannabis in germany vary from state to state and a fine or referral for prosecution can be administered for personal possession of anything from six to 30 grams .
in berlin , anything up to 10 grams is considered to be " for personal use " and will often be overlooked .
smoking dope in public places , however , can be interpreted by law as an offense against the german constitution and is therefore a punishable act .
as germany does not carry laws like those in neighboring holland which permit establishments with special licenses to sell and allow cannabis to be used on the premises , a location allowing drug consumption on-site would be breaking the law .
enforcement of these laws on opening night may make the first performance of " la princesse jaune " even more surreal .

tehran says it does not fear un sanctions . the un atomic watchdog agency , iaea , got its first taste of the iranian government under its new president mahmoud ahmadinejad .
on friday , iaea chief mohamed elbaradei met iran 's new nuclear program director and negotiator ali larijani in vienna to renew talks surrounding iran 's nuclear energy program that the west says is weapons-related .
iran has defied the international community by resuming work on making power reactor fuel that could also be used to make nuclear weapons but insists that it wants to continue talks with the european union on guaranteeing its atomic program is peaceful .
elbaradei and larijani will be discussing " issues related to international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- safeguards inspections and the current state of play , " spokeswoman melissa fleming said in confirming friday 's meeting .
eu 's role brought into question bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu-3 's negotiations with iran not to open the isfahan facility were for nought .
earlier this month activity was restarted despite claims that they will continue negotiations with the eu-3 - britain , france and germany - tehran has sent signals to the contrary as late as thursday .
larijani had challenged the role of the eu-3 as the leaders of diplomatic efforts over the iran 's nuclear program .
" based on what logic and agreement with the international atomic energy agency have the negotiations been limited and dependent on the three european countries ? "
larijani asked on iranian state television .
larijani signaled that iran may look towards widening involvement in the talks , saying that non-aligned countries had asked iran to explain why the negotiations have only been with the eu-3 .
the us viewed the suggestion with a large dose of skepticism , saying that the ploy was just an attempt by tehran to avoid talks over the issue .
" this is a typical tactic for the iranian government .
they will come up with proposals like this to try and change the subject , " said state department spokesman sean mccormack .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : past attempts by germany and the west to hinder iranian nuclear activities have been fruitless .
here , secretary of iran 's supreme national security council , hasan rowhani -lrb- l -rrb- and german foreign minister , joschka fischer at a 2003 press conference iran has accused the three european states of damaging the diplomatic effort by demanding iran abandon its work on the nuclear fuel cycle - the focus of fears iran could acquire the bomb - even though fuel work is technically permitted by the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- .
the eu-3 countered tehran 's claims , saying iran is to blame for the breakdown in the talks due to its decision earlier this month to resume uranium ore conversion work - the first step in the ultra-sensitive enrichment process which had been suspended .
the iaea board , which is to receive a report on iran on september 3 from elbaradei , also called on tehran to reinstate the suspension .
iran has refused , and could face referral to the un security council , which could impose international economic sanctions .
us and eu to make no early move bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin is currently opposed to economic sanctions against tehran economic sanctions in the near term are improbable however .
while waiting for the september 3 report and whether iran adheres to that day 's deadline , the united states and the european union have decided not to seek an iaea emergency meeting , diplomats said thursday .
an emergency session of the international atomic energy agency on september 6 , which the united states was seeking and which could lead to the referral of iran to the un security council for possible sanctions , is " not going to take place , " a senior eu diplomat told afp in vienna where the iaea is based .
the reason is clear .
russia , which has a large contract to build iran 's first nuclear reactor , had objected to holding such a special meeting ahead of a summit at united nations headquarters in new york from september 14-16 .
iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad and russian president vladimir putin are to attend the summit and russia " wanted to give room for what could happen in new york and not to miss an opportunity " for diplomacy , an eu diplomat said .

tehran says it does not fear un sanctions . the un atomic watchdog agency , iaea , got its first taste of the iranian government under its new president mahmoud ahmadinejad .
on friday , iaea chief mohamed elbaradei met iran 's new nuclear program director and negotiator ali larijani in vienna to renew talks surrounding iran 's nuclear energy program that the west says is weapons-related .
iran has defied the international community by resuming work on making power reactor fuel that could also be used to make nuclear weapons but insists that it wants to continue talks with the european union on guaranteeing its atomic program is peaceful .
elbaradei and larijani will be discussing " issues related to international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- safeguards inspections and the current state of play , " spokeswoman melissa fleming said in confirming friday 's meeting .
eu 's role brought into question bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu-3 's negotiations with iran not to open the isfahan facility were for nought .
earlier this month activity was restarted despite claims that they will continue negotiations with the eu-3 - britain , france and germany - tehran has sent signals to the contrary as late as thursday .
larijani had challenged the role of the eu-3 as the leaders of diplomatic efforts over the iran 's nuclear program .
" based on what logic and agreement with the international atomic energy agency have the negotiations been limited and dependent on the three european countries ? "
larijani asked on iranian state television .
larijani signaled that iran may look towards widening involvement in the talks , saying that non-aligned countries had asked iran to explain why the negotiations have only been with the eu-3 .
the us viewed the suggestion with a large dose of skepticism , saying that the ploy was just an attempt by tehran to avoid talks over the issue .
" this is a typical tactic for the iranian government .
they will come up with proposals like this to try and change the subject , " said state department spokesman sean mccormack .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : past attempts by germany and the west to hinder iranian nuclear activities have been fruitless .
here , secretary of iran 's supreme national security council , hasan rowhani -lrb- l -rrb- and german foreign minister , joschka fischer at a 2003 press conference iran has accused the three european states of damaging the diplomatic effort by demanding iran abandon its work on the nuclear fuel cycle - the focus of fears iran could acquire the bomb - even though fuel work is technically permitted by the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- .
the eu-3 countered tehran 's claims , saying iran is to blame for the breakdown in the talks due to its decision earlier this month to resume uranium ore conversion work - the first step in the ultra-sensitive enrichment process which had been suspended .
the iaea board , which is to receive a report on iran on september 3 from elbaradei , also called on tehran to reinstate the suspension .
iran has refused , and could face referral to the un security council , which could impose international economic sanctions .
us and eu to make no early move bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin is currently opposed to economic sanctions against tehran economic sanctions in the near term are improbable however .
while waiting for the september 3 report and whether iran adheres to that day 's deadline , the united states and the european union have decided not to seek an iaea emergency meeting , diplomats said thursday .
an emergency session of the international atomic energy agency on september 6 , which the united states was seeking and which could lead to the referral of iran to the un security council for possible sanctions , is " not going to take place , " a senior eu diplomat told afp in vienna where the iaea is based .
the reason is clear .
russia , which has a large contract to build iran 's first nuclear reactor , had objected to holding such a special meeting ahead of a summit at united nations headquarters in new york from september 14-16 .
iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad and russian president vladimir putin are to attend the summit and russia " wanted to give room for what could happen in new york and not to miss an opportunity " for diplomacy , an eu diplomat said .

tehran says it does not fear un sanctions . the un atomic watchdog agency , iaea , got its first taste of the iranian government under its new president mahmoud ahmadinejad .
on friday , iaea chief mohamed elbaradei met iran 's new nuclear program director and negotiator ali larijani in vienna to renew talks surrounding iran 's nuclear energy program that the west says is weapons-related .
iran has defied the international community by resuming work on making power reactor fuel that could also be used to make nuclear weapons but insists that it wants to continue talks with the european union on guaranteeing its atomic program is peaceful .
elbaradei and larijani will be discussing " issues related to international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- safeguards inspections and the current state of play , " spokeswoman melissa fleming said in confirming friday 's meeting .
eu 's role brought into question bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu-3 's negotiations with iran not to open the isfahan facility were for nought .
earlier this month activity was restarted despite claims that they will continue negotiations with the eu-3 - britain , france and germany - tehran has sent signals to the contrary as late as thursday .
larijani had challenged the role of the eu-3 as the leaders of diplomatic efforts over the iran 's nuclear program .
" based on what logic and agreement with the international atomic energy agency have the negotiations been limited and dependent on the three european countries ? "
larijani asked on iranian state television .
larijani signaled that iran may look towards widening involvement in the talks , saying that non-aligned countries had asked iran to explain why the negotiations have only been with the eu-3 .
the us viewed the suggestion with a large dose of skepticism , saying that the ploy was just an attempt by tehran to avoid talks over the issue .
" this is a typical tactic for the iranian government .
they will come up with proposals like this to try and change the subject , " said state department spokesman sean mccormack .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : past attempts by germany and the west to hinder iranian nuclear activities have been fruitless .
here , secretary of iran 's supreme national security council , hasan rowhani -lrb- l -rrb- and german foreign minister , joschka fischer at a 2003 press conference iran has accused the three european states of damaging the diplomatic effort by demanding iran abandon its work on the nuclear fuel cycle - the focus of fears iran could acquire the bomb - even though fuel work is technically permitted by the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- .
the eu-3 countered tehran 's claims , saying iran is to blame for the breakdown in the talks due to its decision earlier this month to resume uranium ore conversion work - the first step in the ultra-sensitive enrichment process which had been suspended .
the iaea board , which is to receive a report on iran on september 3 from elbaradei , also called on tehran to reinstate the suspension .
iran has refused , and could face referral to the un security council , which could impose international economic sanctions .
us and eu to make no early move bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin is currently opposed to economic sanctions against tehran economic sanctions in the near term are improbable however .
while waiting for the september 3 report and whether iran adheres to that day 's deadline , the united states and the european union have decided not to seek an iaea emergency meeting , diplomats said thursday .
an emergency session of the international atomic energy agency on september 6 , which the united states was seeking and which could lead to the referral of iran to the un security council for possible sanctions , is " not going to take place , " a senior eu diplomat told afp in vienna where the iaea is based .
the reason is clear .
russia , which has a large contract to build iran 's first nuclear reactor , had objected to holding such a special meeting ahead of a summit at united nations headquarters in new york from september 14-16 .
iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad and russian president vladimir putin are to attend the summit and russia " wanted to give room for what could happen in new york and not to miss an opportunity " for diplomacy , an eu diplomat said .
the diplomat was speaking about efforts to get iran to resume both the fuel suspension and talks with the eu that focus on winning guarantees that tehran will not make nuclear weapons . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu calls for emergency un meeting on iran mahmoud ahmadinejad faces the possibility of being brought before the un 's nuclear watchdog in his first week as iran 's president after the eu called for emergency talks on the islamic republic 's atomic program .

what began as a group of dissident intellectuals became an unstoppable force for change . the poland that begat solidarnosc , or solidarity , a quarter century ago is hardly recognizable today .
then , poland was a totalitarian , satellite state of the soviet union , under moscow 's firm hand .
today , poland is a democratic country and a member of the european union as well as nato .
much of that development is due to the influence of the trade union that got its start in the gdansk shipyards in 1980 . the origins of solidarity go back even further , to 1976 , when a " worker 's defense committee " was founded by a group of dissident intellectuals after several thousand workers who had been on strike were attacked and jailed by authorities in various cities .
in 1979 , the committee published a charter of worker 's rights . in 1980 , a new wave of strikes again broke out , this time sparked by a seemingly insignificant event .
the communist government had raised the price of meat in the cafeteria of the lenin shipyards in the northern industrial city of gdansk .
a female worker had complained about the price hike and was fired . that led 17,000 workers to put down their tools and barricade themselves inside the plant under the leadership of lech walesa , an electrician at the shipyard . by mid-august , strikes had spread throughout the country and millions of polish white and blue-collar workers took to the streets demanding better working conditions , even though only 10 years earlier , similar strikes had ended in bloodshed with dozens of people killed by machine gun fire and over 1,000 injured . bildunterschrift : august 30 , 1980 , one day before signing the agreement with the government , jubilant solidarity members carry their leader lech walesa on their shoulders but on august 31 , 1980 , after weeks of the strike action , the workers in the shipyard reached their goal .
the strike movement , which would soon be formally known as solidarity , was accepted as an independent trade union . " finally we have an independent union under our own administration , " said lech walesa .
" we now have the right to strike and we are going to demand more rights soon . " brief period of freedom organizers were anything but sure of their victory , though , even when , at the end of that august , the government signed the " gdansk treaty " with its 21 demands , including freedom of expression , a free trade union and the right to strike . " getting the right to have an independent trade union was a breakthrough , " said bogdan lis , one of the founders of solidarity .
" it was so unbelievable that we could only wonder then how long it would last . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : general wojciech jaruzelski , poland 's last communist-era leader in warsaw , poland , may 23 , 2005 .
the unionists got their answer 500 days later , when the former defense minister , general wojciech jaruzelski , who took over the reins of government in february 1981 , took away the new-found freedoms . " i hereby proclaim martial law in all of poland , " he announced on television as a shocked nation watched . martial law lasted two years after that and the communist leaders did what they could to cripple the solidarity movement .
government critics and union adherents were put in internment camps , including the leadership circle around walesa .
the party tried to rid the country of what it considered a trade union disease . dogged drive for freedom while forced underground , the drive for freedom was not easily stopped , according to wladyslaw bartoszewski , one-time chair of the polish writers association and polish foreign minister in the 1990s . " the breakup of the trade unions was a step that can not be without consequences , " he said after his release from an internment camp in october 1982 .
" many have been released from prison , but many are still behind bars , even renowned writers and professors .
there are many who are still being arrested and sentenced , many women among them .
we catholics in poland are very upset and worried . " lech walesa himself was arrested and stayed under house arrest until the end of 1982 .
but the movement he led , although officially dissolved by parliament in 1982 and driven underground , remained active .
the unrest in the country could no longer be quieted by draconian measures from on high . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers at the gdansk shipyard in 1988 , a new wave of strikes and labor unrest spread across the country , and high on the list of strikers ' demands was government recognition of solidarity .
general jaruzelski announced he was ready to talk with the opposition and in april 1989 , the government agreed to legalize the trade union and allow it to participate in free elections to a bicameral polish parliament . in 1990 , solidarity experienced its perhaps sweetest triumph when walesa was elected president .
but at the same time , that marked the beginning of its long demise .
the movement began drifting apart with internal fighting over interests and the speed of reforms leading to its losing popularity and influence .
even walesa , a national hero , became a target for criticism with his high-handedness .
he narrowly lost a bid for re-election in 1995 to a former communist , aleksander kwasniewski , head of the democratic left alliance . shadow of its former self today solidarnosc has little influence in polish politics and has returned to its roots as a trade union .
but with just under a million members , it even has little sway in company policy .
at its height , it counted ten million members in its ranks , in a country of just under 40 million . walesa announced he was leaving the union on its 25th anniversary , saying its goals today were very different than the ones from its early days .
solidarity 's golden days , and its great achievements , were behind it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lech walesa in 2004 " with it there would have been no german reunification , no triumph over communism , " he said , adding that there are two very different parts to the solidarity story and they should not be confused .

1 summit , chancellor candidate angela merkel has renewed her call for the eu to offer turkey a " privileged partnership " instead of full membership . merkel penned the letter along with christian social union leader edmund stoiber , timing it to hit the desk of center-right leaders just before an informal meeting on thursday of eu foreign ministers , where eu accession negotiations with turkey will be discussed . turkey is expected to open membership negotiations with the eu on oct .
3 . " we are fully convinced that accepting turkey would overburden the eu politically , economically and socially and would endanger the european integration process , " the letter , addressed to 11 european leaders , said . the letter cited " the continuing refusal of turkey to recognize the republic of cyprus , a member state , under international law " as an obstacle to turkish membership , and also noted " still-significant problems in upholding and imposing human rights . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and edmund stoiber merkel and stoiber underlined that the eu was interested in a close connection between turkey and the european union , but " we ask you to make clear that the framework of the negotiations also includes the perspective of a privileged partnership with turkey . " a copy of the letter also went to the current eu president , british prime minister tony blair , and eu commission president jose barroso . the response from joschka fischer , german foreign minister , was heated . " the attitude of ms. merkel and mr. stoiber is dangerously blind considering the promises that have been made by german governments over the past 43 years , from adenauer to kohl , " fischer told the dpa news agency . wo n't " overplay " turkey on monday this week , german conservatives said they would not let the turkey issue hijack the campaign in front of the country 's general election , scheduled for sept .
18 .
but the interior minister of the state of bavaria , günther beckstein , said turkey had become an election issue and " should not be neglected . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günther beckstein " turkey would now be the second most important country in a european union and in a few years … turkey would be the leading nation , more than france , italy or austria , the netherlands , portugal and greece together , " he said . beckstein said the rejections by france and the netherlands of a new eu constitution earlier this year showed that eu citizens were not ready for another significant expansion of the union . wolfgang schäuble , foreign affairs adviser in merkel 's pre-election team , echoed those sentiments in an interview with the international herald tribune .
he also raised questions about turkey 's identity . " a part of turkey is europe , just like russia , " he said in the interview .
" but a far bigger part of both turkey and russia is definitely not in europe .
that is why russia could never really integrate into the eu . " the position puts a possible merkel government at odds with the current eu position as well as with that of the united states , with which merkel has said she wants a closer relationship . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang schäuble the us considers turkey of great strategic importance and would like to see the country taken into the european fold .
during a trip last month to washington , schäuble said he explained his party 's position to us secretary of state condoleezza rice . " i think condoleezza rice was satisfied with my arguments , " he said . repeat performance it is not the first time merkel has pushed for an eu relationship with turkey which falls short of full membership .
she brought the topic up a year ago , just three weeks before the eu commission released a report on turkey and a few days before regional elections in two eastern german states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel in istanbul then there was disagreement over the proposal even within her own party .
fellow christian democrat and former defense minister volker rühe reminded merkel that the conservative government of helmut kohl had in 1997 signed an agreement laying out turkey 's official eu candidate status .
he said closing the door would destabilize the country and could strengthen anti-european sentiment there . in brussels , merkel 's approach met with astonishment .
jean-claude juncker , prime minister of luxembourg and then-eu president , distanced himself , saying turkey had enjoyed " candidate status " for years and it was too late to offer it a privileged partnership . cdu foreign affairs expert schäuble said despite the position of his party , a merkel government would not stop the beginning of accession negotiations between the eu and turkey .
he said germany would stand by the european council 's decision that the results of negotiations should be kept open . " the negotiations could last for at least 10 years , " he said .

bernhard glocksin is encouraging members of the audience to smoke joints while taking in performances of " la princesse jaune -lrb- the oriental princess -rrb- " , the one-act druggy opera by camille saint-saens . the opera tells the story of kornélis , a man in love with a portrait of a japanese princess .
under the sway of a hallucinogenic potion which he believes will unite him with the object of his infatuation , he confuses the portrait with his own fiancée . his increasingly long trips into a psychedelic version of japan within his own imagination eventually prevent kornélis from distinguishing between fantasy and reality as he slips further away from his real life love . artistic license in an attempt to create that far-out feeling , the actors themselves will also smoke pot onstage while the audience mellow out in the stalls . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glocksin maintains that the opera experience will be " improved with a few joints " while the opera house asserts that artistic license will protect it from drug laws .

what more can be done about the floods ?
climate change outpaces politics , say environmental experts . villages and towns enclosed by water , dramatic efforts to rescue people - the pictures from bavaria , austria and switzerland resemble those of what was previously dubbed " the floods of the century " in 1999 on the oder river or 2002 at the elbe and danube rivers .
politicians are flocking to the disaster area and their gestures of support and pledges of aid also resemble each other .
but according to environmental experts , nature 's warning signals are still not being taken seriously enough .
a n eed to act climate researchers are convinced the present situation is just a harbinger of much more severe floods that could be caused by climate change in the future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman pushes a man in a wheelchair as other persons wade through the flooded schweizerhof quay in lucerne on wednesday " flood protection remains an endless task , as long as nothing is being done to deal with the root causes of floods , " said georg rast of the world wildlife fund -lrb- wwf -rrb- .
" a long breath is needed beyond individual legislative periods and a finance policy based on what we already know about the problem .
unfortunately , the budget boosts provided by the federal states to deal with the problem follow the flood waves - except with a year 's delay . "
in the face of climate change , all flood protection concepts have to be reviewed , said regine günther , also of wwf .
on the political level pressure has to be increased to achieve a faster reduction of greenhouse gas emissions .
a failure to deliver ?
" the federal government and the states have so far not delivered on their promises they made during the 2002 floods to introduce adequate flood protection measures , " said gerhard timm , director for the german federation for the protection of the environment and nature -lrb- bund -rrb- .
through river regulation , dykes and dams rivers in germany are left with only a fifth of their original flooding areas .
but bavarian premier edmund stoiber said there is no reason for renewed action .
" we have done our homework , " he said , adding that bavaria has invested more than 670 million euros -lrb- $ 822 million -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in dresden , streets get regularly flooded , like in this picture taken in march according to the state 's ministry for the environment , the measures include improved prevention and warning systems as well as extended polder areas .
the natural environs of rivers , streams and floodplains have been returned to their original natural state .
the ministry also urges property owners to make available more land faster to be used for conversions into polder areas .
in germany , an area totalling some 150 soccer pitches is being sealed off every day as part of construction projects for streets and buildings .
these areas can no longer absorb rainfalls , according to the ministry .
floods harbi n ger of thi n gs to come spells of extreme weather such as the current heat wave in portugal or the heavy rains in bavaria are but a first sign of global warming already affecting everyday weather patterns , said mojib latif of the institute of oceanography at the university of kiel in northern germany .
the air above the mediterranean absorbs humidity and transports it northwards and past the alps on their eastern flank .
but because of global warming , more water evaporates above the mediterranean , leading to the air moving northwards being wetter , mojib said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rescuers in a rubber dinghy evacuate residents from the flooded areas in downtown prague in august 2002 and once the clouds get stuck at the mountain tops of the alps , massive , torrential downpours are the result .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 26.08.2005 study : homeopathy no better than placebo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the lancet " says this medicine is no more effective than sugar water homeopathic treatment is no more effective than a placebo , the dummy substance used in medical trials , according to a study appearing in the british medical weekly , " the lancet . " the renowned medical journal said in a hard-hitting editorial called " the end of homeopathy " that the time for more studies is over and doctors should be honest with patients about homeopathy 's " lack of benefit . " the author of the article , dr. matthias egger from the university of berne , said he and associates in britain and switzerland searched 19 electronic databases covering the period from 1995 to 2003 . they compared 110 trials of homeopathic remedies against a placebo with 110 trials of conventional medicines , which were also tested against a placebo . the ailments being treated in these trials included respiratory-tract infections , pollen allergies and asthma , gynecological and obstetric problems , muscle and joint ache and intestinal upsets . the researchers found that , in small trials which they deemed to be of poor quality , both homeopathic and conventional medicines appeared to fare better against placebos .
but in larger trials that were of high quality , they found no convincing evidence that homeopathy worked better than placebos . like with like homeopathy is based on the principle of treating like with like , also called the law of similary . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the homeopathic practitioner generally looks at the totality of symptoms of a given case , then chooses a remedy that has been reported to produce a similar set of symptoms in healthy subjects .
this remedy is usually given in extremely low concentrations . for example , a person with an allergy would be given an ultra-diluted dose of an agent that would cause the same symptoms . saxon founder the theory of homeopathy was developed by samuel hahnemann , a physician from saxony , who first published it in 1796 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : samuel hahnemann came up with the theory behind homeopathy homeopathy went into decline in the 20th century with the rise of antibiotics and other modern medicines , but in the past decade has staged a comeback , igniting controversy at the same time . over the past two decades , there has been a boom in both the use of homeopathic remedies and visits to homeopathic practitioners .
analysts say there are several reasons for this .
homeopathic treatment is reported by many to be effective . others are disaffected with the traditional medical establishment , which they consider cold and uncaring .
homeopathic practitioners often spend much more time dealing with their patients than do conventional practitioners .
homeopathic preparations also have few if any side effects and are generally much cheaper than conventional medications . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics , however , consider homeopathy to be unscientific and lacking any plausible mechanism .
they often view homeopathy as a pseudoscientific remnant from the age of alchemy , when the behavior of chemical and biological phenomena were poorly understood . in 2002 , the american illusionist and skeptic james randi offered $ 1 million to anyone able to prove , under observed conditions in a laboratory , that homeopathic remedies can really cure people .
thus far , no one has passed the preliminary tests . popular in germany even so , homeopathy has a fervent vocal lobby of supporters , and health insurance schemes in europe are under increasing pressure to include it in their coverage . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , where homeopathy is very popular , there are about 6,000 physicians specializing in the field .
in 1978 , it was recognized as " special form of therapy , " meaning the medication was freed from the usual requirements of proven efficacy .
but since the beginning of 2004 , homeopathic medications , with a few exceptions , are no longer covered by public health insurance .

they often view homeopathy as a pseudoscientific remnant from the age of alchemy , when the behavior of chemical and biological phenomena were poorly understood . in 2002 , the american illusionist and skeptic james randi offered $ 1 million to anyone able to prove , under observed conditions in a laboratory , that homeopathic remedies can really cure people .
thus far , no one has passed the preliminary tests . popular in germany even so , homeopathy has a fervent vocal lobby of supporters , and health insurance schemes in europe are under increasing pressure to include it in their coverage . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , where homeopathy is very popular , there are about 6,000 physicians specializing in the field .
in 1978 , it was recognized as " special form of therapy , " meaning the medication was freed from the usual requirements of proven efficacy .
but since the beginning of 2004 , homeopathic medications , with a few exceptions , are no longer covered by public health insurance .

1 summit , chancellor candidate angela merkel has renewed her call for the eu to offer turkey a " privileged partnership " instead of full membership . merkel penned the letter along with christian social union leader edmund stoiber , timing it to hit the desk of center-right leaders just before an informal meeting on thursday of eu foreign ministers , where eu accession negotiations with turkey will be discussed . turkey is expected to open membership negotiations with the eu on oct .
3 . " we are fully convinced that accepting turkey would overburden the eu politically , economically and socially and would endanger the european integration process , " the letter , addressed to 11 european leaders , said . the letter cited " the continuing refusal of turkey to recognize the republic of cyprus , a member state , under international law " as an obstacle to turkish membership , and also noted " still-significant problems in upholding and imposing human rights . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and edmund stoiber merkel and stoiber underlined that the eu was interested in a close connection between turkey and the european union , but " we ask you to make clear that the framework of the negotiations also includes the perspective of a privileged partnership with turkey . " a copy of the letter also went to the current eu president , british prime minister tony blair , and eu commission president jose barroso . the response from joschka fischer , german foreign minister , was heated . " the attitude of ms. merkel and mr. stoiber is dangerously blind considering the promises that have been made by german governments over the past 43 years , from adenauer to kohl , " fischer told the dpa news agency . wo n't " overplay " turkey on monday this week , german conservatives said they would not let the turkey issue hijack the campaign in front of the country 's general election , scheduled for sept .
18 .
but the interior minister of the state of bavaria , günther beckstein , said turkey had become an election issue and " should not be neglected . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günther beckstein " turkey would now be the second most important country in a european union and in a few years … turkey would be the leading nation , more than france , italy or austria , the netherlands , portugal and greece together , " he said . beckstein said the rejections by france and the netherlands of a new eu constitution earlier this year showed that eu citizens were not ready for another significant expansion of the union . wolfgang schäuble , foreign affairs adviser in merkel 's pre-election team , echoed those sentiments in an interview with the international herald tribune .
he also raised questions about turkey 's identity . " a part of turkey is europe , just like russia , " he said in the interview .
" but a far bigger part of both turkey and russia is definitely not in europe .
that is why russia could never really integrate into the eu . " the position puts a possible merkel government at odds with the current eu position as well as with that of the united states , with which merkel has said she wants a closer relationship . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang schäuble the us considers turkey of great strategic importance and would like to see the country taken into the european fold .
during a trip last month to washington , schäuble said he explained his party 's position to us secretary of state condoleezza rice . " i think condoleezza rice was satisfied with my arguments , " he said . repeat performance it is not the first time merkel has pushed for an eu relationship with turkey which falls short of full membership .
she brought the topic up a year ago , just three weeks before the eu commission released a report on turkey and a few days before regional elections in two eastern german states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel in istanbul then there was disagreement over the proposal even within her own party .
fellow christian democrat and former defense minister volker rühe reminded merkel that the conservative government of helmut kohl had in 1997 signed an agreement laying out turkey 's official eu candidate status .
he said closing the door would destabilize the country and could strengthen anti-european sentiment there . in brussels , merkel 's approach met with astonishment .
jean-claude juncker , prime minister of luxembourg and then-eu president , distanced himself , saying turkey had enjoyed " candidate status " for years and it was too late to offer it a privileged partnership . cdu foreign affairs expert schäuble said despite the position of his party , a merkel government would not stop the beginning of accession negotiations between the eu and turkey .
he said germany would stand by the european council 's decision that the results of negotiations should be kept open . " the negotiations could last for at least 10 years , " he said .
" things could be very different in 10 years ' time .

1 summit , chancellor candidate angela merkel has renewed her call for the eu to offer turkey a " privileged partnership " instead of full membership . merkel penned the letter along with christian social union leader edmund stoiber , timing it to hit the desk of center-right leaders just before an informal meeting on thursday of eu foreign ministers , where eu accession negotiations with turkey will be discussed . turkey is expected to open membership negotiations with the eu on oct .
3 . " we are fully convinced that accepting turkey would overburden the eu politically , economically and socially and would endanger the european integration process , " the letter , addressed to 11 european leaders , said . the letter cited " the continuing refusal of turkey to recognize the republic of cyprus , a member state , under international law " as an obstacle to turkish membership , and also noted " still-significant problems in upholding and imposing human rights . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and edmund stoiber merkel and stoiber underlined that the eu was interested in a close connection between turkey and the european union , but " we ask you to make clear that the framework of the negotiations also includes the perspective of a privileged partnership with turkey . " a copy of the letter also went to the current eu president , british prime minister tony blair , and eu commission president jose barroso . the response from joschka fischer , german foreign minister , was heated . " the attitude of ms. merkel and mr. stoiber is dangerously blind considering the promises that have been made by german governments over the past 43 years , from adenauer to kohl , " fischer told the dpa news agency . wo n't " overplay " turkey on monday this week , german conservatives said they would not let the turkey issue hijack the campaign in front of the country 's general election , scheduled for sept .
18 .
but the interior minister of the state of bavaria , günther beckstein , said turkey had become an election issue and " should not be neglected . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günther beckstein " turkey would now be the second most important country in a european union and in a few years … turkey would be the leading nation , more than france , italy or austria , the netherlands , portugal and greece together , " he said . beckstein said the rejections by france and the netherlands of a new eu constitution earlier this year showed that eu citizens were not ready for another significant expansion of the union . wolfgang schäuble , foreign affairs adviser in merkel 's pre-election team , echoed those sentiments in an interview with the international herald tribune .
he also raised questions about turkey 's identity . " a part of turkey is europe , just like russia , " he said in the interview .
" but a far bigger part of both turkey and russia is definitely not in europe .
that is why russia could never really integrate into the eu . " the position puts a possible merkel government at odds with the current eu position as well as with that of the united states , with which merkel has said she wants a closer relationship . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang schäuble the us considers turkey of great strategic importance and would like to see the country taken into the european fold .
during a trip last month to washington , schäuble said he explained his party 's position to us secretary of state condoleezza rice . " i think condoleezza rice was satisfied with my arguments , " he said . repeat performance it is not the first time merkel has pushed for an eu relationship with turkey which falls short of full membership .
she brought the topic up a year ago , just three weeks before the eu commission released a report on turkey and a few days before regional elections in two eastern german states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel in istanbul then there was disagreement over the proposal even within her own party .
fellow christian democrat and former defense minister volker rühe reminded merkel that the conservative government of helmut kohl had in 1997 signed an agreement laying out turkey 's official eu candidate status .
he said closing the door would destabilize the country and could strengthen anti-european sentiment there . in brussels , merkel 's approach met with astonishment .
jean-claude juncker , prime minister of luxembourg and then-eu president , distanced himself , saying turkey had enjoyed " candidate status " for years and it was too late to offer it a privileged partnership . cdu foreign affairs expert schäuble said despite the position of his party , a merkel government would not stop the beginning of accession negotiations between the eu and turkey .
he said germany would stand by the european council 's decision that the results of negotiations should be kept open . " the negotiations could last for at least 10 years , " he said .
" things could be very different in 10 years ' time . " dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel calls for petition against turkish membership germany 's conservative opposition leader angela merkel has called for a petition to be drawn up against turkey 's membership of the european union and has advocated privileged partnership status as an alternative .

bernhard glocksin is encouraging members of the audience to smoke joints while taking in performances of " la princesse jaune -lrb- the oriental princess -rrb- " , the one-act druggy opera by camille saint-saens . the opera tells the story of kornélis , a man in love with a portrait of a japanese princess .
under the sway of a hallucinogenic potion which he believes will unite him with the object of his infatuation , he confuses the portrait with his own fiancée . his increasingly long trips into a psychedelic version of japan within his own imagination eventually prevent kornélis from distinguishing between fantasy and reality as he slips further away from his real life love . artistic license in an attempt to create that far-out feeling , the actors themselves will also smoke pot onstage while the audience mellow out in the stalls . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glocksin maintains that the opera experience will be " improved with a few joints " while the opera house asserts that artistic license will protect it from drug laws .

legal hurdles drug laws concerning cannabis in germany vary from state to state and a fine or referral for prosecution can be administered for personal possession of anything from six to 30 grams .

smoking dope in public places , however , can be interpreted by law as an offense against the german constitution and is therefore a punishable act .

tehran says it does not fear un sanctions . the un atomic watchdog agency , iaea , got its first taste of the iranian government under its new president mahmoud ahmadinejad .
on friday , iaea chief mohamed elbaradei met iran 's new nuclear program director and negotiator ali larijani in vienna to renew talks surrounding iran 's nuclear energy program that the west says is weapons-related .
iran has defied the international community by resuming work on making power reactor fuel that could also be used to make nuclear weapons but insists that it wants to continue talks with the european union on guaranteeing its atomic program is peaceful .
elbaradei and larijani will be discussing " issues related to international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- safeguards inspections and the current state of play , " spokeswoman melissa fleming said in confirming friday 's meeting .
eu 's role brought into question bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu-3 's negotiations with iran not to open the isfahan facility were for nought .
earlier this month activity was restarted despite claims that they will continue negotiations with the eu-3 - britain , france and germany - tehran has sent signals to the contrary as late as thursday .
larijani had challenged the role of the eu-3 as the leaders of diplomatic efforts over the iran 's nuclear program .
" based on what logic and agreement with the international atomic energy agency have the negotiations been limited and dependent on the three european countries ? "
larijani asked on iranian state television .
larijani signaled that iran may look towards widening involvement in the talks , saying that non-aligned countries had asked iran to explain why the negotiations have only been with the eu-3 .
the us viewed the suggestion with a large dose of skepticism , saying that the ploy was just an attempt by tehran to avoid talks over the issue .
" this is a typical tactic for the iranian government .
they will come up with proposals like this to try and change the subject , " said state department spokesman sean mccormack .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : past attempts by germany and the west to hinder iranian nuclear activities have been fruitless .
here , secretary of iran 's supreme national security council , hasan rowhani -lrb- l -rrb- and german foreign minister , joschka fischer at a 2003 press conference iran has accused the three european states of damaging the diplomatic effort by demanding iran abandon its work on the nuclear fuel cycle - the focus of fears iran could acquire the bomb - even though fuel work is technically permitted by the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- .
the eu-3 countered tehran 's claims , saying iran is to blame for the breakdown in the talks due to its decision earlier this month to resume uranium ore conversion work - the first step in the ultra-sensitive enrichment process which had been suspended .
the iaea board , which is to receive a report on iran on september 3 from elbaradei , also called on tehran to reinstate the suspension .
iran has refused , and could face referral to the un security council , which could impose international economic sanctions .
us and eu to make no early move bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin is currently opposed to economic sanctions against tehran economic sanctions in the near term are improbable however .
while waiting for the september 3 report and whether iran adheres to that day 's deadline , the united states and the european union have decided not to seek an iaea emergency meeting , diplomats said thursday .
an emergency session of the international atomic energy agency on september 6 , which the united states was seeking and which could lead to the referral of iran to the un security council for possible sanctions , is " not going to take place , " a senior eu diplomat told afp in vienna where the iaea is based .
the reason is clear .
russia , which has a large contract to build iran 's first nuclear reactor , had objected to holding such a special meeting ahead of a summit at united nations headquarters in new york from september 14-16 .
iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad and russian president vladimir putin are to attend the summit and russia " wanted to give room for what could happen in new york and not to miss an opportunity " for diplomacy , an eu diplomat said .
the diplomat was speaking about efforts to get iran to resume both the fuel suspension and talks with the eu that focus on winning guarantees that tehran will not make nuclear weapons . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu calls for emergency un meeting on iran mahmoud ahmadinejad faces the possibility of being brought before the un 's nuclear watchdog in his first week as iran 's president after the eu called for emergency talks on the islamic republic 's atomic program .

earlier this month activity was restarted despite claims that they will continue negotiations with the eu-3 - britain , france and germany - tehran has sent signals to the contrary as late as thursday .
larijani had challenged the role of the eu-3 as the leaders of diplomatic efforts over the iran 's nuclear program .
" based on what logic and agreement with the international atomic energy agency have the negotiations been limited and dependent on the three european countries ? "
larijani asked on iranian state television .
larijani signaled that iran may look towards widening involvement in the talks , saying that non-aligned countries had asked iran to explain why the negotiations have only been with the eu-3 .
the us viewed the suggestion with a large dose of skepticism , saying that the ploy was just an attempt by tehran to avoid talks over the issue .

the eu-3 countered tehran 's claims , saying iran is to blame for the breakdown in the talks due to its decision earlier this month to resume uranium ore conversion work - the first step in the ultra-sensitive enrichment process which had been suspended .

tehran says it does not fear un sanctions . the un atomic watchdog agency , iaea , got its first taste of the iranian government under its new president mahmoud ahmadinejad .
on friday , iaea chief mohamed elbaradei met iran 's new nuclear program director and negotiator ali larijani in vienna to renew talks surrounding iran 's nuclear energy program that the west says is weapons-related .
iran has defied the international community by resuming work on making power reactor fuel that could also be used to make nuclear weapons but insists that it wants to continue talks with the european union on guaranteeing its atomic program is peaceful .

what began as a group of dissident intellectuals became an unstoppable force for change . the poland that begat solidarnosc , or solidarity , a quarter century ago is hardly recognizable today .
then , poland was a totalitarian , satellite state of the soviet union , under moscow 's firm hand .
today , poland is a democratic country and a member of the european union as well as nato .
much of that development is due to the influence of the trade union that got its start in the gdansk shipyards in 1980 . the origins of solidarity go back even further , to 1976 , when a " worker 's defense committee " was founded by a group of dissident intellectuals after several thousand workers who had been on strike were attacked and jailed by authorities in various cities .
in 1979 , the committee published a charter of worker 's rights . in 1980 , a new wave of strikes again broke out , this time sparked by a seemingly insignificant event .
the communist government had raised the price of meat in the cafeteria of the lenin shipyards in the northern industrial city of gdansk .
a female worker had complained about the price hike and was fired . that led 17,000 workers to put down their tools and barricade themselves inside the plant under the leadership of lech walesa , an electrician at the shipyard . by mid-august , strikes had spread throughout the country and millions of polish white and blue-collar workers took to the streets demanding better working conditions , even though only 10 years earlier , similar strikes had ended in bloodshed with dozens of people killed by machine gun fire and over 1,000 injured . bildunterschrift : august 30 , 1980 , one day before signing the agreement with the government , jubilant solidarity members carry their leader lech walesa on their shoulders but on august 31 , 1980 , after weeks of the strike action , the workers in the shipyard reached their goal .
the strike movement , which would soon be formally known as solidarity , was accepted as an independent trade union . " finally we have an independent union under our own administration , " said lech walesa .
" we now have the right to strike and we are going to demand more rights soon . " brief period of freedom organizers were anything but sure of their victory , though , even when , at the end of that august , the government signed the " gdansk treaty " with its 21 demands , including freedom of expression , a free trade union and the right to strike . " getting the right to have an independent trade union was a breakthrough , " said bogdan lis , one of the founders of solidarity .
" it was so unbelievable that we could only wonder then how long it would last . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : general wojciech jaruzelski , poland 's last communist-era leader in warsaw , poland , may 23 , 2005 .
the unionists got their answer 500 days later , when the former defense minister , general wojciech jaruzelski , who took over the reins of government in february 1981 , took away the new-found freedoms . " i hereby proclaim martial law in all of poland , " he announced on television as a shocked nation watched . martial law lasted two years after that and the communist leaders did what they could to cripple the solidarity movement .
government critics and union adherents were put in internment camps , including the leadership circle around walesa .
the party tried to rid the country of what it considered a trade union disease . dogged drive for freedom while forced underground , the drive for freedom was not easily stopped , according to wladyslaw bartoszewski , one-time chair of the polish writers association and polish foreign minister in the 1990s . " the breakup of the trade unions was a step that can not be without consequences , " he said after his release from an internment camp in october 1982 .
" many have been released from prison , but many are still behind bars , even renowned writers and professors .
there are many who are still being arrested and sentenced , many women among them .
we catholics in poland are very upset and worried . " lech walesa himself was arrested and stayed under house arrest until the end of 1982 .
but the movement he led , although officially dissolved by parliament in 1982 and driven underground , remained active .
the unrest in the country could no longer be quieted by draconian measures from on high . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers at the gdansk shipyard in 1988 , a new wave of strikes and labor unrest spread across the country , and high on the list of strikers ' demands was government recognition of solidarity .
general jaruzelski announced he was ready to talk with the opposition and in april 1989 , the government agreed to legalize the trade union and allow it to participate in free elections to a bicameral polish parliament . in 1990 , solidarity experienced its perhaps sweetest triumph when walesa was elected president .
but at the same time , that marked the beginning of its long demise .
the movement began drifting apart with internal fighting over interests and the speed of reforms leading to its losing popularity and influence .
even walesa , a national hero , became a target for criticism with his high-handedness .
he narrowly lost a bid for re-election in 1995 to a former communist , aleksander kwasniewski , head of the democratic left alliance . shadow of its former self today solidarnosc has little influence in polish politics and has returned to its roots as a trade union .
but with just under a million members , it even has little sway in company policy .
at its height , it counted ten million members in its ranks , in a country of just under 40 million . walesa announced he was leaving the union on its 25th anniversary , saying its goals today were very different than the ones from its early days .
solidarity 's golden days , and its great achievements , were behind it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lech walesa in 2004 " with it there would have been no german reunification , no triumph over communism , " he said , adding that there are two very different parts to the solidarity story and they should not be confused .

what began as a group of dissident intellectuals became an unstoppable force for change . the poland that begat solidarnosc , or solidarity , a quarter century ago is hardly recognizable today .
then , poland was a totalitarian , satellite state of the soviet union , under moscow 's firm hand .
today , poland is a democratic country and a member of the european union as well as nato .
much of that development is due to the influence of the trade union that got its start in the gdansk shipyards in 1980 . the origins of solidarity go back even further , to 1976 , when a " worker 's defense committee " was founded by a group of dissident intellectuals after several thousand workers who had been on strike were attacked and jailed by authorities in various cities .
in 1979 , the committee published a charter of worker 's rights . in 1980 , a new wave of strikes again broke out , this time sparked by a seemingly insignificant event .
the communist government had raised the price of meat in the cafeteria of the lenin shipyards in the northern industrial city of gdansk .
a female worker had complained about the price hike and was fired . that led 17,000 workers to put down their tools and barricade themselves inside the plant under the leadership of lech walesa , an electrician at the shipyard . by mid-august , strikes had spread throughout the country and millions of polish white and blue-collar workers took to the streets demanding better working conditions , even though only 10 years earlier , similar strikes had ended in bloodshed with dozens of people killed by machine gun fire and over 1,000 injured . bildunterschrift : august 30 , 1980 , one day before signing the agreement with the government , jubilant solidarity members carry their leader lech walesa on their shoulders but on august 31 , 1980 , after weeks of the strike action , the workers in the shipyard reached their goal .
the strike movement , which would soon be formally known as solidarity , was accepted as an independent trade union . " finally we have an independent union under our own administration , " said lech walesa .
" we now have the right to strike and we are going to demand more rights soon . " brief period of freedom organizers were anything but sure of their victory , though , even when , at the end of that august , the government signed the " gdansk treaty " with its 21 demands , including freedom of expression , a free trade union and the right to strike . " getting the right to have an independent trade union was a breakthrough , " said bogdan lis , one of the founders of solidarity .
" it was so unbelievable that we could only wonder then how long it would last . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : general wojciech jaruzelski , poland 's last communist-era leader in warsaw , poland , may 23 , 2005 .
the unionists got their answer 500 days later , when the former defense minister , general wojciech jaruzelski , who took over the reins of government in february 1981 , took away the new-found freedoms . " i hereby proclaim martial law in all of poland , " he announced on television as a shocked nation watched . martial law lasted two years after that and the communist leaders did what they could to cripple the solidarity movement .
government critics and union adherents were put in internment camps , including the leadership circle around walesa .
the party tried to rid the country of what it considered a trade union disease . dogged drive for freedom while forced underground , the drive for freedom was not easily stopped , according to wladyslaw bartoszewski , one-time chair of the polish writers association and polish foreign minister in the 1990s . " the breakup of the trade unions was a step that can not be without consequences , " he said after his release from an internment camp in october 1982 .
" many have been released from prison , but many are still behind bars , even renowned writers and professors .
there are many who are still being arrested and sentenced , many women among them .
we catholics in poland are very upset and worried . " lech walesa himself was arrested and stayed under house arrest until the end of 1982 .
but the movement he led , although officially dissolved by parliament in 1982 and driven underground , remained active .
the unrest in the country could no longer be quieted by draconian measures from on high . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers at the gdansk shipyard in 1988 , a new wave of strikes and labor unrest spread across the country , and high on the list of strikers ' demands was government recognition of solidarity .
general jaruzelski announced he was ready to talk with the opposition and in april 1989 , the government agreed to legalize the trade union and allow it to participate in free elections to a bicameral polish parliament . in 1990 , solidarity experienced its perhaps sweetest triumph when walesa was elected president .
but at the same time , that marked the beginning of its long demise .
the movement began drifting apart with internal fighting over interests and the speed of reforms leading to its losing popularity and influence .
even walesa , a national hero , became a target for criticism with his high-handedness .
he narrowly lost a bid for re-election in 1995 to a former communist , aleksander kwasniewski , head of the democratic left alliance . shadow of its former self today solidarnosc has little influence in polish politics and has returned to its roots as a trade union .
but with just under a million members , it even has little sway in company policy .
at its height , it counted ten million members in its ranks , in a country of just under 40 million . walesa announced he was leaving the union on its 25th anniversary , saying its goals today were very different than the ones from its early days .
solidarity 's golden days , and its great achievements , were behind it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lech walesa in 2004 " with it there would have been no german reunification , no triumph over communism , " he said , adding that there are two very different parts to the solidarity story and they should not be confused .

" it was so unbelievable that we could only wonder then how long it would last . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : general wojciech jaruzelski , poland 's last communist-era leader in warsaw , poland , may 23 , 2005 .
the unionists got their answer 500 days later , when the former defense minister , general wojciech jaruzelski , who took over the reins of government in february 1981 , took away the new-found freedoms . " i hereby proclaim martial law in all of poland , " he announced on television as a shocked nation watched . martial law lasted two years after that and the communist leaders did what they could to cripple the solidarity movement .
government critics and union adherents were put in internment camps , including the leadership circle around walesa .
the party tried to rid the country of what it considered a trade union disease . dogged drive for freedom while forced underground , the drive for freedom was not easily stopped , according to wladyslaw bartoszewski , one-time chair of the polish writers association and polish foreign minister in the 1990s . " the breakup of the trade unions was a step that can not be without consequences , " he said after his release from an internment camp in october 1982 .
" many have been released from prison , but many are still behind bars , even renowned writers and professors .
there are many who are still being arrested and sentenced , many women among them .
we catholics in poland are very upset and worried . " lech walesa himself was arrested and stayed under house arrest until the end of 1982 .
but the movement he led , although officially dissolved by parliament in 1982 and driven underground , remained active .
the unrest in the country could no longer be quieted by draconian measures from on high . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers at the gdansk shipyard in 1988 , a new wave of strikes and labor unrest spread across the country , and high on the list of strikers ' demands was government recognition of solidarity .
general jaruzelski announced he was ready to talk with the opposition and in april 1989 , the government agreed to legalize the trade union and allow it to participate in free elections to a bicameral polish parliament . in 1990 , solidarity experienced its perhaps sweetest triumph when walesa was elected president .
but at the same time , that marked the beginning of its long demise .
the movement began drifting apart with internal fighting over interests and the speed of reforms leading to its losing popularity and influence .
even walesa , a national hero , became a target for criticism with his high-handedness .
he narrowly lost a bid for re-election in 1995 to a former communist , aleksander kwasniewski , head of the democratic left alliance . shadow of its former self today solidarnosc has little influence in polish politics and has returned to its roots as a trade union .
but with just under a million members , it even has little sway in company policy .
at its height , it counted ten million members in its ranks , in a country of just under 40 million . walesa announced he was leaving the union on its 25th anniversary , saying its goals today were very different than the ones from its early days .
solidarity 's golden days , and its great achievements , were behind it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lech walesa in 2004 " with it there would have been no german reunification , no triumph over communism , " he said , adding that there are two very different parts to the solidarity story and they should not be confused . " on the one side there is our great victory , and on the other there is our weak performance in making use of that victory .

bernhard glocksin is encouraging members of the audience to smoke joints while taking in performances of " la princesse jaune -lrb- the oriental princess -rrb- " , the one-act druggy opera by camille saint-saens . the opera tells the story of kornélis , a man in love with a portrait of a japanese princess .
under the sway of a hallucinogenic potion which he believes will unite him with the object of his infatuation , he confuses the portrait with his own fiancée . his increasingly long trips into a psychedelic version of japan within his own imagination eventually prevent kornélis from distinguishing between fantasy and reality as he slips further away from his real life love . artistic license in an attempt to create that far-out feeling , the actors themselves will also smoke pot onstage while the audience mellow out in the stalls . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glocksin maintains that the opera experience will be " improved with a few joints " while the opera house asserts that artistic license will protect it from drug laws . " it ’ s a test to see just what we can get away with , " glocksin said . according to german drug laws , however , the opera may be taking a step too far in blurring the lines between art and life .
legal hurdles drug laws concerning cannabis in germany vary from state to state and a fine or referral for prosecution can be administered for personal possession of anything from six to 30 grams .
in berlin , anything up to 10 grams is considered to be " for personal use " and will often be overlooked .
smoking dope in public places , however , can be interpreted by law as an offense against the german constitution and is therefore a punishable act .
as germany does not carry laws like those in neighboring holland which permit establishments with special licenses to sell and allow cannabis to be used on the premises , a location allowing drug consumption on-site would be breaking the law .
enforcement of these laws on opening night may make the first performance of " la princesse jaune " even more surreal .

tehran says it does not fear un sanctions . the un atomic watchdog agency , iaea , got its first taste of the iranian government under its new president mahmoud ahmadinejad .
on friday , iaea chief mohamed elbaradei met iran 's new nuclear program director and negotiator ali larijani in vienna to renew talks surrounding iran 's nuclear energy program that the west says is weapons-related .
iran has defied the international community by resuming work on making power reactor fuel that could also be used to make nuclear weapons but insists that it wants to continue talks with the european union on guaranteeing its atomic program is peaceful .
elbaradei and larijani will be discussing " issues related to international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- safeguards inspections and the current state of play , " spokeswoman melissa fleming said in confirming friday 's meeting .
eu 's role brought into question bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu-3 's negotiations with iran not to open the isfahan facility were for nought .
earlier this month activity was restarted despite claims that they will continue negotiations with the eu-3 - britain , france and germany - tehran has sent signals to the contrary as late as thursday .
larijani had challenged the role of the eu-3 as the leaders of diplomatic efforts over the iran 's nuclear program .
" based on what logic and agreement with the international atomic energy agency have the negotiations been limited and dependent on the three european countries ? "
larijani asked on iranian state television .
larijani signaled that iran may look towards widening involvement in the talks , saying that non-aligned countries had asked iran to explain why the negotiations have only been with the eu-3 .
the us viewed the suggestion with a large dose of skepticism , saying that the ploy was just an attempt by tehran to avoid talks over the issue .
" this is a typical tactic for the iranian government .
they will come up with proposals like this to try and change the subject , " said state department spokesman sean mccormack .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : past attempts by germany and the west to hinder iranian nuclear activities have been fruitless .
here , secretary of iran 's supreme national security council , hasan rowhani -lrb- l -rrb- and german foreign minister , joschka fischer at a 2003 press conference iran has accused the three european states of damaging the diplomatic effort by demanding iran abandon its work on the nuclear fuel cycle - the focus of fears iran could acquire the bomb - even though fuel work is technically permitted by the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- .
the eu-3 countered tehran 's claims , saying iran is to blame for the breakdown in the talks due to its decision earlier this month to resume uranium ore conversion work - the first step in the ultra-sensitive enrichment process which had been suspended .
the iaea board , which is to receive a report on iran on september 3 from elbaradei , also called on tehran to reinstate the suspension .
iran has refused , and could face referral to the un security council , which could impose international economic sanctions .
us and eu to make no early move bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin is currently opposed to economic sanctions against tehran economic sanctions in the near term are improbable however .
while waiting for the september 3 report and whether iran adheres to that day 's deadline , the united states and the european union have decided not to seek an iaea emergency meeting , diplomats said thursday .
an emergency session of the international atomic energy agency on september 6 , which the united states was seeking and which could lead to the referral of iran to the un security council for possible sanctions , is " not going to take place , " a senior eu diplomat told afp in vienna where the iaea is based .
the reason is clear .
russia , which has a large contract to build iran 's first nuclear reactor , had objected to holding such a special meeting ahead of a summit at united nations headquarters in new york from september 14-16 .
iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad and russian president vladimir putin are to attend the summit and russia " wanted to give room for what could happen in new york and not to miss an opportunity " for diplomacy , an eu diplomat said .
the diplomat was speaking about efforts to get iran to resume both the fuel suspension and talks with the eu that focus on winning guarantees that tehran will not make nuclear weapons . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu calls for emergency un meeting on iran mahmoud ahmadinejad faces the possibility of being brought before the un 's nuclear watchdog in his first week as iran 's president after the eu called for emergency talks on the islamic republic 's atomic program .

" the chinese side expressed its concern over the textile products blocked at customs in eu countries , " a chinese commerce ministry spokeswoman told afp in describing thursday 's negotiations . european union negotiators said the backlog of products was " not in the interests of eu traders and consumers , " she said . according to the french trade ministry earlier this week , 48 million sweaters , 17 million pairs of trousers , some 500,000 blouses , 1.6 million t-shirts , 3.4 million bras and 1,470 tons of flax yarn are being held up . resolution of stand-off in interest of both parties " the atmosphere of the discussions with our chinese colleagues is , as could be expected , constructive and friendly , given that of course it 's in the interest of the two sides to resolve this problem as quickly as possible , " eu commission spokeswoman amelia torres told journalists in brussels thursday . eu officials in beijing refused to comment on the talks other than to say that negotiations had resumed in earnest friday . lu jianhua , director of the ministry of commerce 's foreign trade administration department , headed up the chinese side , while fritz-harald wenig , a trade director with the european commission , represented the eu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's textile exports to europe surged to 2.1 billion dollars in june , up 85 percent over the same month last year , as rush orders for chinese goods soared while negotiators hammered out the new quotas , china 's trade ministry said . a senior chinese trade official said part of the problem was that the eu and china agreed that the period between june 11 and july 20 was needed to set up mechanisms to monitor the textile trade and the implementation of the agreement . mass influx of chinese products " during this period , 10 categories of chinese products could be freely imported to eu without any application for licenses , and traders in both china and eu rushed -lrb- orders -rrb- in order to avoid the quantity controls , " the unnamed official said in a comment posted on the commerce ministry website .
" the irrational activities of enterprises in china and eu brought on the furious increase of the ... products . " in accordance with normal trade practices , credit guarantees would have already been issued by buyers before the shipping . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clothes not authorized for import are costing retailers and manufacturers dearly european retailers could thus be facing hundreds of millions of dollars in losses not only for the goods , but additional shipping and storage costs , industry sources said . china has protested the re-implementation of us and eu textiles quotas following the end the long-standing global quota system as a move counter to free trade and ongoing world trade organization trade liberalization talks . the united states has invoked wto " safeguards " that limit chinese textile imports in at least six categories to 7.5 percent annual growth and is currently negotiating with china to implement similar limits on nearly 20 categories . us negotiators are expected in beijing next week to restart talks on the issue . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de china wants eu to increase textile quotas beijing and brussels were set to begin trade negotiations over booming chinese textile exports with china expecting the eu to capitulate and increase import quotas , according to chinese sources on wednesday .

climate change outpaces politics , say environmental experts . villages and towns enclosed by water , dramatic efforts to rescue people - the pictures from bavaria , austria and switzerland resemble those of what was previously dubbed " the floods of the century " in 1999 on the oder river or 2002 at the elbe and danube rivers .

1 summit , chancellor candidate angela merkel has renewed her call for the eu to offer turkey a " privileged partnership " instead of full membership . merkel penned the letter along with christian social union leader edmund stoiber , timing it to hit the desk of center-right leaders just before an informal meeting on thursday of eu foreign ministers , where eu accession negotiations with turkey will be discussed . turkey is expected to open membership negotiations with the eu on oct .
3 . " we are fully convinced that accepting turkey would overburden the eu politically , economically and socially and would endanger the european integration process , " the letter , addressed to 11 european leaders , said . the letter cited " the continuing refusal of turkey to recognize the republic of cyprus , a member state , under international law " as an obstacle to turkish membership , and also noted " still-significant problems in upholding and imposing human rights . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and edmund stoiber merkel and stoiber underlined that the eu was interested in a close connection between turkey and the european union , but " we ask you to make clear that the framework of the negotiations also includes the perspective of a privileged partnership with turkey . " a copy of the letter also went to the current eu president , british prime minister tony blair , and eu commission president jose barroso . the response from joschka fischer , german foreign minister , was heated . " the attitude of ms. merkel and mr. stoiber is dangerously blind considering the promises that have been made by german governments over the past 43 years , from adenauer to kohl , " fischer told the dpa news agency . wo n't " overplay " turkey on monday this week , german conservatives said they would not let the turkey issue hijack the campaign in front of the country 's general election , scheduled for sept .
18 .
but the interior minister of the state of bavaria , günther beckstein , said turkey had become an election issue and " should not be neglected . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günther beckstein " turkey would now be the second most important country in a european union and in a few years … turkey would be the leading nation , more than france , italy or austria , the netherlands , portugal and greece together , " he said . beckstein said the rejections by france and the netherlands of a new eu constitution earlier this year showed that eu citizens were not ready for another significant expansion of the union . wolfgang schäuble , foreign affairs adviser in merkel 's pre-election team , echoed those sentiments in an interview with the international herald tribune .
he also raised questions about turkey 's identity . " a part of turkey is europe , just like russia , " he said in the interview .
" but a far bigger part of both turkey and russia is definitely not in europe .
that is why russia could never really integrate into the eu . " the position puts a possible merkel government at odds with the current eu position as well as with that of the united states , with which merkel has said she wants a closer relationship . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang schäuble the us considers turkey of great strategic importance and would like to see the country taken into the european fold .
during a trip last month to washington , schäuble said he explained his party 's position to us secretary of state condoleezza rice . " i think condoleezza rice was satisfied with my arguments , " he said . repeat performance it is not the first time merkel has pushed for an eu relationship with turkey which falls short of full membership .
she brought the topic up a year ago , just three weeks before the eu commission released a report on turkey and a few days before regional elections in two eastern german states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel in istanbul then there was disagreement over the proposal even within her own party .
fellow christian democrat and former defense minister volker rühe reminded merkel that the conservative government of helmut kohl had in 1997 signed an agreement laying out turkey 's official eu candidate status .
he said closing the door would destabilize the country and could strengthen anti-european sentiment there . in brussels , merkel 's approach met with astonishment .
jean-claude juncker , prime minister of luxembourg and then-eu president , distanced himself , saying turkey had enjoyed " candidate status " for years and it was too late to offer it a privileged partnership . cdu foreign affairs expert schäuble said despite the position of his party , a merkel government would not stop the beginning of accession negotiations between the eu and turkey .
he said germany would stand by the european council 's decision that the results of negotiations should be kept open . " the negotiations could last for at least 10 years , " he said .
" things could be very different in 10 years ' time . " dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel calls for petition against turkish membership germany 's conservative opposition leader angela merkel has called for a petition to be drawn up against turkey 's membership of the european union and has advocated privileged partnership status as an alternative .

but the battle for votes has also caught up with the times , and gone online . less than a month before likely federal elections in germany , there is a plethora of web sites poking fun at the various candidates .
internet surfers can watch a photomontage of the christian democrats ' angela merkel breakdancing or a boxing match between merkel and sitting chancellor gerhard schröder . while there is a lot of satire and silliness surrounding the parties and their candidates out there on the web , the targets of all the online barbs are taking cyberspace very seriously these days .
the internet is playing big during this campaign season . strategists at the social democrats ' campaign headquarters are helping chancellor schröder defend his title .
like the opposition , the spd has an entire department dedicated to looking after its web presence - around the clock .
the internet could play a decisive role , according to sebastian reichel of the spd 's campaign team , especially during such a short election campaign . " any party which does n't conduct its campaigning on the internet or sees it as just a sideline is missing a great opportunity not only to mobilize voters , but also to educate and bring them over to your side , " he said . besides explaining their party 's platform and presenting candidates , the social democrats ' site tells supporters how they can get involved , listen to podcasts , and donate to the party . the conservative opposition christian democrats are no less savvy when it comes to going after the digital generation .
they have their own podcast - called ikauder , after general secretary volker kauder - news ticker and links to sites that heap vitriol on the sitting government . bloggers away ! no other medium allows the campaigners to react as quickly to a political opponent 's slip-up and the financial costs are much lower than for more traditional forms of campaign advertising . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hottest trend in this year 's election is the weblog , or blog , a form of online diary in which politicians share their thoughts with voters . social democratic candidate niels annen from hamburg has publicized his day-to-day schedule for the last three weeks on his web site .
aside from his party 's platforms , readers can learn more - if not all - about niels annen himself . " i would n't include certain things about my private life , things i do n't believe belong in the public realm , " he said .
" but it 's more about personal impressions , or perhaps things that i 've felt at various times .
i do include them . " every day annen says he receives around a dozen responses to his blog .
sometimes the remarks are offensive , but annen says he is pleased with most of the comments and writes personal replies . " some who wrote once said : ' you 're too left-leaning for me , but keep it up .

traditional media , like tv , radio , and print still play a big role , " said jo groebel , director of the european institute for the media .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 26.08.2005 taking high culture literally großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sorted for a night at the opera a berlin opera house is encouraging audience members to smoke joints during performances of its coming production " the oriental princess " to enhance the psychedelic experience of saint-saens ' drug opera . while it 's not unusual for critics to suggest the imbibing of illicit substances to make atrocious artistic performances and events more bearable , it is less usual for the producers of a theatrical piece to promote drug use in a bid to enhance the audience 's enjoyment of their show . but this is exactly what the artistic director of the neuköllner opera house in berlin is doing .
bernhard glocksin is encouraging members of the audience to smoke joints while taking in performances of " la princesse jaune -lrb- the oriental princess -rrb- " , the one-act druggy opera by camille saint-saens . the opera tells the story of kornélis , a man in love with a portrait of a japanese princess .
under the sway of a hallucinogenic potion which he believes will unite him with the object of his infatuation , he confuses the portrait with his own fiancée . his increasingly long trips into a psychedelic version of japan within his own imagination eventually prevent kornélis from distinguishing between fantasy and reality as he slips further away from his real life love . artistic license in an attempt to create that far-out feeling , the actors themselves will also smoke pot onstage while the audience mellow out in the stalls . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glocksin maintains that the opera experience will be " improved with a few joints " while the opera house asserts that artistic license will protect it from drug laws . " it ’ s a test to see just what we can get away with , " glocksin said . according to german drug laws , however , the opera may be taking a step too far in blurring the lines between art and life .
legal hurdles drug laws concerning cannabis in germany vary from state to state and a fine or referral for prosecution can be administered for personal possession of anything from six to 30 grams .
in berlin , anything up to 10 grams is considered to be " for personal use " and will often be overlooked .
smoking dope in public places , however , can be interpreted by law as an offense against the german constitution and is therefore a punishable act .
as germany does not carry laws like those in neighboring holland which permit establishments with special licenses to sell and allow cannabis to be used on the premises , a location allowing drug consumption on-site would be breaking the law .
enforcement of these laws on opening night may make the first performance of " la princesse jaune " even more surreal .
" la princesse jaune -lrb- the oriental princess -rrb- " by camille saint-saens opens at the neuköllner oper on sept .

what more can be done about the floods ?
climate change outpaces politics , say environmental experts . villages and towns enclosed by water , dramatic efforts to rescue people - the pictures from bavaria , austria and switzerland resemble those of what was previously dubbed " the floods of the century " in 1999 on the oder river or 2002 at the elbe and danube rivers .
politicians are flocking to the disaster area and their gestures of support and pledges of aid also resemble each other .
but according to environmental experts , nature 's warning signals are still not being taken seriously enough .
a n eed to act climate researchers are convinced the present situation is just a harbinger of much more severe floods that could be caused by climate change in the future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman pushes a man in a wheelchair as other persons wade through the flooded schweizerhof quay in lucerne on wednesday " flood protection remains an endless task , as long as nothing is being done to deal with the root causes of floods , " said georg rast of the world wildlife fund -lrb- wwf -rrb- .
" a long breath is needed beyond individual legislative periods and a finance policy based on what we already know about the problem .
unfortunately , the budget boosts provided by the federal states to deal with the problem follow the flood waves - except with a year 's delay . "
in the face of climate change , all flood protection concepts have to be reviewed , said regine günther , also of wwf .

" the chinese side expressed its concern over the textile products blocked at customs in eu countries , " a chinese commerce ministry spokeswoman told afp in describing thursday 's negotiations . european union negotiators said the backlog of products was " not in the interests of eu traders and consumers , " she said . according to the french trade ministry earlier this week , 48 million sweaters , 17 million pairs of trousers , some 500,000 blouses , 1.6 million t-shirts , 3.4 million bras and 1,470 tons of flax yarn are being held up . resolution of stand-off in interest of both parties " the atmosphere of the discussions with our chinese colleagues is , as could be expected , constructive and friendly , given that of course it 's in the interest of the two sides to resolve this problem as quickly as possible , " eu commission spokeswoman amelia torres told journalists in brussels thursday . eu officials in beijing refused to comment on the talks other than to say that negotiations had resumed in earnest friday . lu jianhua , director of the ministry of commerce 's foreign trade administration department , headed up the chinese side , while fritz-harald wenig , a trade director with the european commission , represented the eu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's textile exports to europe surged to 2.1 billion dollars in june , up 85 percent over the same month last year , as rush orders for chinese goods soared while negotiators hammered out the new quotas , china 's trade ministry said . a senior chinese trade official said part of the problem was that the eu and china agreed that the period between june 11 and july 20 was needed to set up mechanisms to monitor the textile trade and the implementation of the agreement . mass influx of chinese products " during this period , 10 categories of chinese products could be freely imported to eu without any application for licenses , and traders in both china and eu rushed -lrb- orders -rrb- in order to avoid the quantity controls , " the unnamed official said in a comment posted on the commerce ministry website .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 26.08.2005 renewed call for protection after floods großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a village in bavaria engulfed by the floods after the recent floods , cleaning-up operations are under way in bavaria and other alpine regions .
what more can be done about the floods ?
climate change outpaces politics , say environmental experts . villages and towns enclosed by water , dramatic efforts to rescue people - the pictures from bavaria , austria and switzerland resemble those of what was previously dubbed " the floods of the century " in 1999 on the oder river or 2002 at the elbe and danube rivers .
politicians are flocking to the disaster area and their gestures of support and pledges of aid also resemble each other .
but according to environmental experts , nature 's warning signals are still not being taken seriously enough .
a n eed to act climate researchers are convinced the present situation is just a harbinger of much more severe floods that could be caused by climate change in the future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman pushes a man in a wheelchair as other persons wade through the flooded schweizerhof quay in lucerne on wednesday " flood protection remains an endless task , as long as nothing is being done to deal with the root causes of floods , " said georg rast of the world wildlife fund -lrb- wwf -rrb- .
" a long breath is needed beyond individual legislative periods and a finance policy based on what we already know about the problem .
unfortunately , the budget boosts provided by the federal states to deal with the problem follow the flood waves - except with a year 's delay . "
in the face of climate change , all flood protection concepts have to be reviewed , said regine günther , also of wwf .
on the political level pressure has to be increased to achieve a faster reduction of greenhouse gas emissions .
a failure to deliver ?
" the federal government and the states have so far not delivered on their promises they made during the 2002 floods to introduce adequate flood protection measures , " said gerhard timm , director for the german federation for the protection of the environment and nature -lrb- bund -rrb- .
through river regulation , dykes and dams rivers in germany are left with only a fifth of their original flooding areas .
but bavarian premier edmund stoiber said there is no reason for renewed action .

bernhard glocksin is encouraging members of the audience to smoke joints while taking in performances of " la princesse jaune -lrb- the oriental princess -rrb- " , the one-act druggy opera by camille saint-saens . the opera tells the story of kornélis , a man in love with a portrait of a japanese princess .
under the sway of a hallucinogenic potion which he believes will unite him with the object of his infatuation , he confuses the portrait with his own fiancée . his increasingly long trips into a psychedelic version of japan within his own imagination eventually prevent kornélis from distinguishing between fantasy and reality as he slips further away from his real life love . artistic license in an attempt to create that far-out feeling , the actors themselves will also smoke pot onstage while the audience mellow out in the stalls . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glocksin maintains that the opera experience will be " improved with a few joints " while the opera house asserts that artistic license will protect it from drug laws . " it ’ s a test to see just what we can get away with , " glocksin said . according to german drug laws , however , the opera may be taking a step too far in blurring the lines between art and life .
legal hurdles drug laws concerning cannabis in germany vary from state to state and a fine or referral for prosecution can be administered for personal possession of anything from six to 30 grams .
in berlin , anything up to 10 grams is considered to be " for personal use " and will often be overlooked .
smoking dope in public places , however , can be interpreted by law as an offense against the german constitution and is therefore a punishable act .
as germany does not carry laws like those in neighboring holland which permit establishments with special licenses to sell and allow cannabis to be used on the premises , a location allowing drug consumption on-site would be breaking the law .
enforcement of these laws on opening night may make the first performance of " la princesse jaune " even more surreal .

" the chinese side expressed its concern over the textile products blocked at customs in eu countries , " a chinese commerce ministry spokeswoman told afp in describing thursday 's negotiations . european union negotiators said the backlog of products was " not in the interests of eu traders and consumers , " she said . according to the french trade ministry earlier this week , 48 million sweaters , 17 million pairs of trousers , some 500,000 blouses , 1.6 million t-shirts , 3.4 million bras and 1,470 tons of flax yarn are being held up . resolution of stand-off in interest of both parties " the atmosphere of the discussions with our chinese colleagues is , as could be expected , constructive and friendly , given that of course it 's in the interest of the two sides to resolve this problem as quickly as possible , " eu commission spokeswoman amelia torres told journalists in brussels thursday . eu officials in beijing refused to comment on the talks other than to say that negotiations had resumed in earnest friday . lu jianhua , director of the ministry of commerce 's foreign trade administration department , headed up the chinese side , while fritz-harald wenig , a trade director with the european commission , represented the eu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's textile exports to europe surged to 2.1 billion dollars in june , up 85 percent over the same month last year , as rush orders for chinese goods soared while negotiators hammered out the new quotas , china 's trade ministry said . a senior chinese trade official said part of the problem was that the eu and china agreed that the period between june 11 and july 20 was needed to set up mechanisms to monitor the textile trade and the implementation of the agreement . mass influx of chinese products " during this period , 10 categories of chinese products could be freely imported to eu without any application for licenses , and traders in both china and eu rushed -lrb- orders -rrb- in order to avoid the quantity controls , " the unnamed official said in a comment posted on the commerce ministry website .

iran has defied the international community by resuming work on making power reactor fuel that could also be used to make nuclear weapons but insists that it wants to continue talks with the european union on guaranteeing its atomic program is peaceful .

larijani had challenged the role of the eu-3 as the leaders of diplomatic efforts over the iran 's nuclear program .
" based on what logic and agreement with the international atomic energy agency have the negotiations been limited and dependent on the three european countries ? "
larijani asked on iranian state television .
larijani signaled that iran may look towards widening involvement in the talks , saying that non-aligned countries had asked iran to explain why the negotiations have only been with the eu-3 .
the us viewed the suggestion with a large dose of skepticism , saying that the ploy was just an attempt by tehran to avoid talks over the issue .

the eu-3 countered tehran 's claims , saying iran is to blame for the breakdown in the talks due to its decision earlier this month to resume uranium ore conversion work - the first step in the ultra-sensitive enrichment process which had been suspended .

iran has defied the international community by resuming work on making power reactor fuel that could also be used to make nuclear weapons but insists that it wants to continue talks with the european union on guaranteeing its atomic program is peaceful .

what began as a group of dissident intellectuals became an unstoppable force for change . the poland that begat solidarnosc , or solidarity , a quarter century ago is hardly recognizable today .
then , poland was a totalitarian , satellite state of the soviet union , under moscow 's firm hand .
today , poland is a democratic country and a member of the european union as well as nato .
much of that development is due to the influence of the trade union that got its start in the gdansk shipyards in 1980 . the origins of solidarity go back even further , to 1976 , when a " worker 's defense committee " was founded by a group of dissident intellectuals after several thousand workers who had been on strike were attacked and jailed by authorities in various cities .
in 1979 , the committee published a charter of worker 's rights . in 1980 , a new wave of strikes again broke out , this time sparked by a seemingly insignificant event .
the communist government had raised the price of meat in the cafeteria of the lenin shipyards in the northern industrial city of gdansk .
a female worker had complained about the price hike and was fired . that led 17,000 workers to put down their tools and barricade themselves inside the plant under the leadership of lech walesa , an electrician at the shipyard . by mid-august , strikes had spread throughout the country and millions of polish white and blue-collar workers took to the streets demanding better working conditions , even though only 10 years earlier , similar strikes had ended in bloodshed with dozens of people killed by machine gun fire and over 1,000 injured . bildunterschrift : august 30 , 1980 , one day before signing the agreement with the government , jubilant solidarity members carry their leader lech walesa on their shoulders but on august 31 , 1980 , after weeks of the strike action , the workers in the shipyard reached their goal .
the strike movement , which would soon be formally known as solidarity , was accepted as an independent trade union . " finally we have an independent union under our own administration , " said lech walesa .
" we now have the right to strike and we are going to demand more rights soon . " brief period of freedom organizers were anything but sure of their victory , though , even when , at the end of that august , the government signed the " gdansk treaty " with its 21 demands , including freedom of expression , a free trade union and the right to strike . " getting the right to have an independent trade union was a breakthrough , " said bogdan lis , one of the founders of solidarity .
" it was so unbelievable that we could only wonder then how long it would last . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : general wojciech jaruzelski , poland 's last communist-era leader in warsaw , poland , may 23 , 2005 .
the unionists got their answer 500 days later , when the former defense minister , general wojciech jaruzelski , who took over the reins of government in february 1981 , took away the new-found freedoms . " i hereby proclaim martial law in all of poland , " he announced on television as a shocked nation watched . martial law lasted two years after that and the communist leaders did what they could to cripple the solidarity movement .
government critics and union adherents were put in internment camps , including the leadership circle around walesa .
the party tried to rid the country of what it considered a trade union disease . dogged drive for freedom while forced underground , the drive for freedom was not easily stopped , according to wladyslaw bartoszewski , one-time chair of the polish writers association and polish foreign minister in the 1990s . " the breakup of the trade unions was a step that can not be without consequences , " he said after his release from an internment camp in october 1982 .
" many have been released from prison , but many are still behind bars , even renowned writers and professors .
there are many who are still being arrested and sentenced , many women among them .
we catholics in poland are very upset and worried . " lech walesa himself was arrested and stayed under house arrest until the end of 1982 .
but the movement he led , although officially dissolved by parliament in 1982 and driven underground , remained active .
the unrest in the country could no longer be quieted by draconian measures from on high . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers at the gdansk shipyard in 1988 , a new wave of strikes and labor unrest spread across the country , and high on the list of strikers ' demands was government recognition of solidarity .
general jaruzelski announced he was ready to talk with the opposition and in april 1989 , the government agreed to legalize the trade union and allow it to participate in free elections to a bicameral polish parliament . in 1990 , solidarity experienced its perhaps sweetest triumph when walesa was elected president .
but at the same time , that marked the beginning of its long demise .
the movement began drifting apart with internal fighting over interests and the speed of reforms leading to its losing popularity and influence .
even walesa , a national hero , became a target for criticism with his high-handedness .
he narrowly lost a bid for re-election in 1995 to a former communist , aleksander kwasniewski , head of the democratic left alliance . shadow of its former self today solidarnosc has little influence in polish politics and has returned to its roots as a trade union .
but with just under a million members , it even has little sway in company policy .
at its height , it counted ten million members in its ranks , in a country of just under 40 million . walesa announced he was leaving the union on its 25th anniversary , saying its goals today were very different than the ones from its early days .
solidarity 's golden days , and its great achievements , were behind it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lech walesa in 2004 " with it there would have been no german reunification , no triumph over communism , " he said , adding that there are two very different parts to the solidarity story and they should not be confused . " on the one side there is our great victory , and on the other there is our weak performance in making use of that victory .

" brief period of freedom organizers were anything but sure of their victory , though , even when , at the end of that august , the government signed the " gdansk treaty " with its 21 demands , including freedom of expression , a free trade union and the right to strike .

the unionists got their answer 500 days later , when the former defense minister , general wojciech jaruzelski , who took over the reins of government in february 1981 , took away the new-found freedoms . " i hereby proclaim martial law in all of poland , " he announced on television as a shocked nation watched . martial law lasted two years after that and the communist leaders did what they could to cripple the solidarity movement .
government critics and union adherents were put in internment camps , including the leadership circle around walesa .
the party tried to rid the country of what it considered a trade union disease . dogged drive for freedom while forced underground , the drive for freedom was not easily stopped , according to wladyslaw bartoszewski , one-time chair of the polish writers association and polish foreign minister in the 1990s . " the breakup of the trade unions was a step that can not be without consequences , " he said after his release from an internment camp in october 1982 .
" many have been released from prison , but many are still behind bars , even renowned writers and professors .
there are many who are still being arrested and sentenced , many women among them .
we catholics in poland are very upset and worried . " lech walesa himself was arrested and stayed under house arrest until the end of 1982 .
but the movement he led , although officially dissolved by parliament in 1982 and driven underground , remained active .
the unrest in the country could no longer be quieted by draconian measures from on high . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers at the gdansk shipyard in 1988 , a new wave of strikes and labor unrest spread across the country , and high on the list of strikers ' demands was government recognition of solidarity .
general jaruzelski announced he was ready to talk with the opposition and in april 1989 , the government agreed to legalize the trade union and allow it to participate in free elections to a bicameral polish parliament . in 1990 , solidarity experienced its perhaps sweetest triumph when walesa was elected president .
but at the same time , that marked the beginning of its long demise .
the movement began drifting apart with internal fighting over interests and the speed of reforms leading to its losing popularity and influence .
even walesa , a national hero , became a target for criticism with his high-handedness .
he narrowly lost a bid for re-election in 1995 to a former communist , aleksander kwasniewski , head of the democratic left alliance . shadow of its former self today solidarnosc has little influence in polish politics and has returned to its roots as a trade union .
but with just under a million members , it even has little sway in company policy .
at its height , it counted ten million members in its ranks , in a country of just under 40 million . walesa announced he was leaving the union on its 25th anniversary , saying its goals today were very different than the ones from its early days .
solidarity 's golden days , and its great achievements , were behind it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lech walesa in 2004 " with it there would have been no german reunification , no triumph over communism , " he said , adding that there are two very different parts to the solidarity story and they should not be confused .

what began as a group of dissident intellectuals became an unstoppable force for change . the poland that begat solidarnosc , or solidarity , a quarter century ago is hardly recognizable today .
then , poland was a totalitarian , satellite state of the soviet union , under moscow 's firm hand .
today , poland is a democratic country and a member of the european union as well as nato .
much of that development is due to the influence of the trade union that got its start in the gdansk shipyards in 1980 . the origins of solidarity go back even further , to 1976 , when a " worker 's defense committee " was founded by a group of dissident intellectuals after several thousand workers who had been on strike were attacked and jailed by authorities in various cities .
in 1979 , the committee published a charter of worker 's rights . in 1980 , a new wave of strikes again broke out , this time sparked by a seemingly insignificant event .
the communist government had raised the price of meat in the cafeteria of the lenin shipyards in the northern industrial city of gdansk .
a female worker had complained about the price hike and was fired . that led 17,000 workers to put down their tools and barricade themselves inside the plant under the leadership of lech walesa , an electrician at the shipyard . by mid-august , strikes had spread throughout the country and millions of polish white and blue-collar workers took to the streets demanding better working conditions , even though only 10 years earlier , similar strikes had ended in bloodshed with dozens of people killed by machine gun fire and over 1,000 injured . bildunterschrift : august 30 , 1980 , one day before signing the agreement with the government , jubilant solidarity members carry their leader lech walesa on their shoulders but on august 31 , 1980 , after weeks of the strike action , the workers in the shipyard reached their goal .
the strike movement , which would soon be formally known as solidarity , was accepted as an independent trade union . " finally we have an independent union under our own administration , " said lech walesa .
" we now have the right to strike and we are going to demand more rights soon .

what began as a group of dissident intellectuals became an unstoppable force for change . the poland that begat solidarnosc , or solidarity , a quarter century ago is hardly recognizable today .
then , poland was a totalitarian , satellite state of the soviet union , under moscow 's firm hand .
today , poland is a democratic country and a member of the european union as well as nato .
much of that development is due to the influence of the trade union that got its start in the gdansk shipyards in 1980 . the origins of solidarity go back even further , to 1976 , when a " worker 's defense committee " was founded by a group of dissident intellectuals after several thousand workers who had been on strike were attacked and jailed by authorities in various cities .
in 1979 , the committee published a charter of worker 's rights . in 1980 , a new wave of strikes again broke out , this time sparked by a seemingly insignificant event .
the communist government had raised the price of meat in the cafeteria of the lenin shipyards in the northern industrial city of gdansk .
a female worker had complained about the price hike and was fired . that led 17,000 workers to put down their tools and barricade themselves inside the plant under the leadership of lech walesa , an electrician at the shipyard . by mid-august , strikes had spread throughout the country and millions of polish white and blue-collar workers took to the streets demanding better working conditions , even though only 10 years earlier , similar strikes had ended in bloodshed with dozens of people killed by machine gun fire and over 1,000 injured . bildunterschrift : august 30 , 1980 , one day before signing the agreement with the government , jubilant solidarity members carry their leader lech walesa on their shoulders but on august 31 , 1980 , after weeks of the strike action , the workers in the shipyard reached their goal .
the strike movement , which would soon be formally known as solidarity , was accepted as an independent trade union . " finally we have an independent union under our own administration , " said lech walesa .
" we now have the right to strike and we are going to demand more rights soon . " brief period of freedom organizers were anything but sure of their victory , though , even when , at the end of that august , the government signed the " gdansk treaty " with its 21 demands , including freedom of expression , a free trade union and the right to strike . " getting the right to have an independent trade union was a breakthrough , " said bogdan lis , one of the founders of solidarity .

the unionists got their answer 500 days later , when the former defense minister , general wojciech jaruzelski , who took over the reins of government in february 1981 , took away the new-found freedoms . " i hereby proclaim martial law in all of poland , " he announced on television as a shocked nation watched . martial law lasted two years after that and the communist leaders did what they could to cripple the solidarity movement .
government critics and union adherents were put in internment camps , including the leadership circle around walesa .
the party tried to rid the country of what it considered a trade union disease . dogged drive for freedom while forced underground , the drive for freedom was not easily stopped , according to wladyslaw bartoszewski , one-time chair of the polish writers association and polish foreign minister in the 1990s . " the breakup of the trade unions was a step that can not be without consequences , " he said after his release from an internment camp in october 1982 .
" many have been released from prison , but many are still behind bars , even renowned writers and professors .
there are many who are still being arrested and sentenced , many women among them .
we catholics in poland are very upset and worried . " lech walesa himself was arrested and stayed under house arrest until the end of 1982 .

the unrest in the country could no longer be quieted by draconian measures from on high . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers at the gdansk shipyard in 1988 , a new wave of strikes and labor unrest spread across the country , and high on the list of strikers ' demands was government recognition of solidarity .
general jaruzelski announced he was ready to talk with the opposition and in april 1989 , the government agreed to legalize the trade union and allow it to participate in free elections to a bicameral polish parliament . in 1990 , solidarity experienced its perhaps sweetest triumph when walesa was elected president .
but at the same time , that marked the beginning of its long demise .
the movement began drifting apart with internal fighting over interests and the speed of reforms leading to its losing popularity and influence .
even walesa , a national hero , became a target for criticism with his high-handedness .
he narrowly lost a bid for re-election in 1995 to a former communist , aleksander kwasniewski , head of the democratic left alliance . shadow of its former self today solidarnosc has little influence in polish politics and has returned to its roots as a trade union .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 26.08.2005 renewed call for protection after floods großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a village in bavaria engulfed by the floods after the recent floods , cleaning-up operations are under way in bavaria and other alpine regions .
what more can be done about the floods ?
climate change outpaces politics , say environmental experts . villages and towns enclosed by water , dramatic efforts to rescue people - the pictures from bavaria , austria and switzerland resemble those of what was previously dubbed " the floods of the century " in 1999 on the oder river or 2002 at the elbe and danube rivers .
politicians are flocking to the disaster area and their gestures of support and pledges of aid also resemble each other .
but according to environmental experts , nature 's warning signals are still not being taken seriously enough .
a n eed to act climate researchers are convinced the present situation is just a harbinger of much more severe floods that could be caused by climate change in the future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman pushes a man in a wheelchair as other persons wade through the flooded schweizerhof quay in lucerne on wednesday " flood protection remains an endless task , as long as nothing is being done to deal with the root causes of floods , " said georg rast of the world wildlife fund -lrb- wwf -rrb- .
" a long breath is needed beyond individual legislative periods and a finance policy based on what we already know about the problem .
unfortunately , the budget boosts provided by the federal states to deal with the problem follow the flood waves - except with a year 's delay . "
in the face of climate change , all flood protection concepts have to be reviewed , said regine günther , also of wwf .
on the political level pressure has to be increased to achieve a faster reduction of greenhouse gas emissions .
a failure to deliver ?
" the federal government and the states have so far not delivered on their promises they made during the 2002 floods to introduce adequate flood protection measures , " said gerhard timm , director for the german federation for the protection of the environment and nature -lrb- bund -rrb- .
through river regulation , dykes and dams rivers in germany are left with only a fifth of their original flooding areas .
but bavarian premier edmund stoiber said there is no reason for renewed action .
" we have done our homework , " he said , adding that bavaria has invested more than 670 million euros -lrb- $ 822 million -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in dresden , streets get regularly flooded , like in this picture taken in march according to the state 's ministry for the environment , the measures include improved prevention and warning systems as well as extended polder areas .
the natural environs of rivers , streams and floodplains have been returned to their original natural state .
the ministry also urges property owners to make available more land faster to be used for conversions into polder areas .
in germany , an area totalling some 150 soccer pitches is being sealed off every day as part of construction projects for streets and buildings .
these areas can no longer absorb rainfalls , according to the ministry .
floods harbi n ger of thi n gs to come spells of extreme weather such as the current heat wave in portugal or the heavy rains in bavaria are but a first sign of global warming already affecting everyday weather patterns , said mojib latif of the institute of oceanography at the university of kiel in northern germany .
the air above the mediterranean absorbs humidity and transports it northwards and past the alps on their eastern flank .
but because of global warming , more water evaporates above the mediterranean , leading to the air moving northwards being wetter , mojib said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rescuers in a rubber dinghy evacuate residents from the flooded areas in downtown prague in august 2002 and once the clouds get stuck at the mountain tops of the alps , massive , torrential downpours are the result .
poland , the czech republic as well as the eastern and southern parts of germany will have to expect more of these heavy rains and floods in the future , latif said . dw staff -lrb- rri -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de politicians flock to flood zone floods in bavaria have caused chaos and destruction and galvanized politicians , in the thick of an election campaign , into action .
familiar with the scene , chancellor schröder is already donning his rubber boots .
-lrb- aug .
24 , 2005 -rrb- flood waters causing havoc in bavaria parts of the german state of bavaria were declared danger zones after floodwaters on alpine rivers caused chaos and destruction , cutting off access to several towns , including the resort of garmisch-partenkirchen .
-lrb- aug .
23 , 2005 -rrb- germany moves to limit flood damage more than two years after floods caused billions of euros in damage to parts of eastern germany , the federal parliament passed a law that seeks to lessen the damage should the floods come again .

the event , which attracts around 25,000 people annually , is in its sixth year .
in the past festivals , many big names have taken to the stage on the estate between caernarfon and bangor .
however , north wales police are warning that an alcohol ban could be put in place next year if there is evidence of under age drinking at the festival .
chief inspector derek roberts from the force said : " there are concerns children as young as 14 last year were getting drunk here and clearly in cooperation with the organisers we are going to be clamping down on it this year .
" i do n't envisage us taking the bar away altogether but unless things do improve that will be the ultimate sanction here , " he said .
the three evenings of opera , show tunes and welsh language acts have made the event a fixture on the music calendar .
opera star bryn terfel explained how the festival came into being .
" i had been doing concerts with img -lsb- the festival 's promoters -rsb- in scandinavia , and places like leeds castle , and they asked if i would be interested in doing one in north wales , in my own backyard .
the festival attracts thousands against a backdrop of snowdonia " i said yes , if we find the proper venue and , most importantly , a calibre of artists who had to be of a certain standard to bring audiences in .
" seven years ago , i took four members of img to different venues of interest - one was a place called nant gwythern , where there is a welsh school now , but there would have been a little bit of difficulty getting audiences .
" another was parc glynllifon , but at that time there were rumours it could be bought by a guy from the scorpions , so that was a bit up in the air .
" img found the faenol , which i thought was closed and locked up , but it has turned out to be a wonderful amphitheatre .
" six years on , michael ball , elaine paige and carreras have been , and this year it has reached a pinnacle again , the bocelli night is sold out , and with alison moyet and van morrison . "
an artist i would give my right arm for is norah jones - because of her music and because of the jones factor bryn terfel he said he had used his own influence to bring in artists of the calibre of bocelli , lesley garrett and carreras by collaborating with them on concerts and albums in exchange for their attendance at faenol .
" without my name , it is very difficult getting these artists , " he said .
bryn terfel is keen to persuade tom jones to perform he added he had been surprised by how quickly the festival had established itself .
" i have to pinch myself it has gone so well - i hope it has become something very special in the north wales calendar .
" people are getting something they would never have got otherwise .
" people are putting the concert into their diaries and are booking hotels - they are travelling thousands of miles for it . "
he is also planning its long-term future .
" it is in my calendar for the next 10 years , and an artist i would give my right arm for is norah jones - because of her music and because of the jones factor .
" we have been trying to get tom jones every year , and next year the opera night with up-and-coming opera singers - that is what we are thinking .
" we have had seven young singers in the last six years who are now singing all over the place .
if people say they saw them first at the faenol , it is great . "

the three evenings of opera , show tunes and welsh language acts have made the event a fixture on the music calendar .
opera star bryn terfel explained how the festival came into being .
" i had been doing concerts with img -lsb- the festival 's promoters -rsb- in scandinavia , and places like leeds castle , and they asked if i would be interested in doing one in north wales , in my own backyard .
" i said yes , if we find the proper venue and , most importantly , a calibre of artists who had to be of a certain standard to bring audiences in .
" seven years ago , i took four members of img to different venues of interest - one was a place called nant gwythern , where there is a welsh school now , but there would have been a little bit of difficulty getting audiences .
" another was parc glynllifon , but at that time there were rumours it could be bought by a guy from the scorpions , so that was a bit up in the air .
" img found the faenol , which i thought was closed and locked up , but it has turned out to be a wonderful amphitheatre .
" six years on , michael ball , elaine paige and carreras have been , and this year it has reached a pinnacle again , the bocelli night is sold out , and with alison moyet and van morrison . "
" an artist i would give my right arm for is norah jones - because of her music and because of the jones factor " bryn terfel he said he had used his own influence to bring in artists of the calibre of bocelli , lesley garrett and carreras by collaborating with them on concerts and albums in exchange for their attendance at faenol .
" without my name , it is very difficult getting these artists , " he said .
he added he had been surprised by how quickly the festival had established itself .
" i have to pinch myself it has gone so well - i hope it has become something very special in the north wales calendar .
" people are getting something they would never have got otherwise .
" people are putting the concert into their diaries and are booking hotels - they are travelling thousands of miles for it . "
he is also planning its long-term future .
" it is in my calendar for the next 10 years , and an artist i would give my right arm for is norah jones - because of her music and because of the jones factor .
" we have been trying to get tom jones every year , and next year the opera night with up-and-coming opera singers - that is what we are thinking .
" we have had seven young singers in the last six years who are now singing all over the place .
if people say they saw them first at the faenol , it is great . "

a temporary site where travellers will be moved to during the 37th great dorset steam fair is to be set up .
providing and managing the site during the event will cost taxpayers £ 25,000 .
the local council says that is far less than the cost of dealing with residents ' complaints , tidying up the illegal camps and barricading sites .
' successful strategy ' a spokeswoman for north dorset district council said the cost of cleaning up encampments after the 2003 fair was £ 10,000 .
measures taken to keep travellers off various sites was estimated at more than £ 14,000 .
last year was the first time the district and county councils and police used powers to move on illegally camped travellers from around the fair , held at tarrant hinton , near blandford forum .
dave ayre , head of dorset county council 's gypsy and traveller services , said : " at its peak , last year 's site accommodated up to 58 caravans which would otherwise have been involved in unauthorised camping in the blandford area .
we hope to repeat last year 's successful strategy . "
this year 's fair takes place between 31 august and 4 september and will feature 200 working steam engines and 100 fairground organs .

the ex-foreign secretary said he was the same generation as david davis , 56 , and was full of " vitality and energy " .
" a lot of people think that because i was a colleague of ken clarke -lrb- 65 -rrb- and michael howard -lrb- 64 -rrb- that i am the same age - i 'm not , " he told itn .
the misconception came because he was made a senior minister at a young age .
early promotion sir malcolm was replying to comments put to him from ex- daily telegraph editor max hastings that he was " too old " to be the new tory leader .
" i have still got an enormous amount of vitality and energy as max hastings and others will find out , " mr rifkind told interviewer alastair stewart .
michael howard has said he believes he is too old to lead the tories into the next election , while some commentators have questioned whether mr clarke is too old to take on the role .
" they are in their mid sixties , i am the same age as david davis , we are the same generation , " said sir malcolm , who is shadow work and pensions secretary .
' slow progress ' stressing that he would not make any " vainglorious boast " of winning the leadership , sir malcolm said the party should choose " a strategy " before choosing a leader .
" if the party should choose the strategy of one nation conservatism , then i should be proud to lead the conservative party , " he added .
he said the party was in a stronger position than two years ago , but that the improvement in their position was still " painfully slow " .
by returning to its one nation traditions the party would appeal to the " wider public " .
potential other candidates expected to compete for mr howard 's job include : liam fox , theresa may , david cameron , andrew lansley , david willetts , tim yeo and david davis , who is the bookmakers ' favourite .

conservative leadership hopeful sir malcolm rifkind has admitted he has " a problem " with people thinking he is much older than his actual 59 years .
the ex-foreign secretary said he was the same generation as david davis , 56 , and was full of " vitality and energy " .
" a lot of people think that because i was a colleague of ken clarke -lrb- 65 -rrb- and michael howard -lrb- 64 -rrb- that i am the same age - i 'm not , " he told itn .
the misconception came because he was made a senior minister at a young age .
early promotion sir malcolm was replying to comments put to him from ex- daily telegraph editor max hastings that he was " too old " to be the new tory leader .
" i have still got an enormous amount of vitality and energy as max hastings and others will find out , " mr rifkind told interviewer alastair stewart .
michael howard has said he believes he is too old to lead the tories into the next election , while some commentators have questioned whether mr clarke is too old to take on the role .
" they are in their mid sixties , i am the same age as david davis , we are the same generation , " said sir malcolm , who is shadow work and pensions secretary .
' slow progress ' stressing that he would not make any " vainglorious boast " of winning the leadership , sir malcolm said the party should choose " a strategy " before choosing a leader .
" if the party should choose the strategy of one nation conservatism , then i should be proud to lead the conservative party , " he added .
he said the party was in a stronger position than two years ago , but that the improvement in their position was still " painfully slow " .
by returning to its one nation traditions the party would appeal to the " wider public " .
potential other candidates expected to compete for mr howard 's job include : liam fox , theresa may , david cameron , andrew lansley , david willetts , tim yeo and david davis , who is the bookmakers ' favourite .

working conditions deteriorated and stress levels increased substantially for such doctors in the eight years since 1994 , cancer research uk found .
the proportion of consultants reporting distress climbed from 27 % to 32 % .
the lancet paper blamed understaffing , high workload volumes to meet targets and poor support for the trend .
the authors called for urgent action .
cancer specialists are under enormous pressure and need support professor alex markham , chief executive of cancer research uk during the period of the study challenging targets for nhs cancer services were introduced which may have played a part , say the researchers .
the 2000 cancer plan promised patients would have to wait only two months from referral to treatment , and a month from diagnosis to treatment , by december 2005 .
it also said the number of cancer specialists working in the nhs should be increased by one third .
cath taylor 's work suggests boosting staff numbers had not combated the stress of workload demands , based on surveys done in 1994 , involving 880 doctors , and 2002 , involving1,308 doctors .
over-worked the number of medical oncologists being appointed increased by 147 % , surgical oncologists by 45 % and clinical oncologists -lrb- radiotherapists -rrb- by 33 % between 1994 and 2002 .
despite this , radiotherapists and surgeons specialising in cancer care reported increasing mental stress and emotional exhaustion .
workload pressures can be demanding among surgeons , rates of mental distress rose from 22 % to 33 % and emotional exhaustion from 27 % to 41 % , while among radiotherapists the rates were 28 % to 38 % and 39 % to 52 % from 1994-2002 , respectively .
cath taylor , from the institute of psychiatry , king 's college london , said : " it appears to be in part due to increased stress from being poorly resourced and having responsibility for the quality of the work of other staff , together with trying to meet the expectations of relatives .
" on top of this , these consultants have an enormous workload coupled with insufficient levels of satisfaction from some areas of their work . "

"
professor amanda ramirez , director of the cancer research uk london psychosocial group , said engaging consultants more directly in managing their workload and improving their clinical services might increase their job satisfaction .
" more openings for consultants to teach or carry out research are also likely to boost morale , " she said .
dr jonathan fielden , deputy chairman of the bma 's consultants ' committee , said : " all doctors aim to provide their patients with the best possible care .
" this care can be compromised if doctors become exhausted , stressed and emotionally burnt out .
" this is why it is essential that the nhs has a sufficient number of consultants to deal with the emotional pressures that surface when dealing with very sick patients . "
a spokeswoman for macmillan cancer relief said : " patient-centred services are vital but not at the expense of the health of doctors .
" if stress levels and exhaustion continue to rise this will lead to poor quality care , comprised patient safety and worse surgical outcomes . "
a department of health spokesman said : " eighty percent of staff now say they have access to counselling services and the department has also published specialist support for consultants on the responsibilities of taking on such a position .

bbc news -pipe- health -pipe- cancer doctors are ' stressed out ' bbc news / health graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- health contents : medical notes friday , 26 august 2005 , 06:53 gmt 07:53 uk cancer doctors are ' stressed out ' cancer specialists are under enormous pressures and are suffering from emotional exhaustion as a result , researchers warn .
working conditions deteriorated and stress levels increased substantially for such doctors in the eight years since 1994 , cancer research uk found .
the proportion of consultants reporting distress climbed from 27 % to 32 % .
the lancet paper blamed understaffing , high workload volumes to meet targets and poor support for the trend .
the authors called for urgent action . "
cancer specialists are under enormous pressure and need support " professor alex markham , chief executive of cancer research uk during the period of the study challenging targets for nhs cancer services were introduced which may have played a part , say the researchers .
the 2000 cancer plan promised patients would have to wait only two months from referral to treatment , and a month from diagnosis to treatment , by december 2005 .
it also said the number of cancer specialists working in the nhs should be increased by one third .
cath taylor 's work suggests boosting staff numbers had not combated the stress of workload demands , based on surveys done in 1994 , involving 880 doctors , and 2002 , involving1,308 doctors .
over-worked the number of medical oncologists being appointed increased by 147 % , surgical oncologists by 45 % and clinical oncologists -lrb- radiotherapists -rrb- by 33 % between 1994 and 2002 .
despite this , radiotherapists and surgeons specialising in cancer care reported increasing mental stress and emotional exhaustion .
among surgeons , rates of mental distress rose from 22 % to 33 % and emotional exhaustion from 27 % to 41 % , while among radiotherapists the rates were 28 % to 38 % and 39 % to 52 % from 1994-2002 , respectively .
cath taylor , from the institute of psychiatry , king 's college london , said : " it appears to be in part due to increased stress from being poorly resourced and having responsibility for the quality of the work of other staff , together with trying to meet the expectations of relatives .
" on top of this , these consultants have an enormous workload coupled with insufficient levels of satisfaction from some areas of their work . "

forty years or so later , it fixed the world 's gaze when pink floyd reunited and bob geldof told 150,000 people to make poverty history .
hyde park has become more than just a park , it would seem .
its profile has been raised in recent years to something approaching iconic status after a run of high-profile gigs , services , exhibitions and protests .
wet and slippery among the debateable highlights was a £ 20m star trek exhibition in 2002 hailed as the biggest event of its kind in hyde park since 1851 when the great exhibition ran for six months before moving to crystal palace in south london . "
" the thought behind it was fantastic but hyde park is a charisma-free zone " elton john a year later , one million joined a rally against the iraq war , considered one of the biggest public protests in the uk .
that was followed in the summer of 2004 with the creation of the slippery diana memorial fountain , a tribute to the late princess of wales , and the will-it-wo n't-it-reopen saga that ran for months .
and now the mayor of london is making inroads in moving some of notting hill carnival to the park by hosting a complementary carnival event there on monday called caribbean showcase .
in addition , it has been the stage for a host of musicians and artists from simon and garfunkel and queen , to shania twain and italian tenor pavarotti .
the 140-hectare landscaped park is meant to hold 93,000 , a usual turnout for party in the park , although live 8 attracted an unprecedented 150,000 .
' herded like cattle ' this makes the park central london 's largest venue but how does it all sound to fans at the back of 93,000 people ?
paul tanner , 30 , who saw the red hot chilli peppers play at hyde park , said : " it feels like you are three miles from the band .
" you have to queue up for everything and feel like cattle .
i prefer smaller venues like the jazz cafe or brixton academy which feel more intimate . "
speaking after live 8 , elton john said : " the thought behind it was fantastic but hyde park is a charisma-free zone . "
live 8 event organiser harvey goldsmith told bbc news his comment was not entirely fair .
" elton told me that he had a great time , " he said .
" he was there for such a short time that it would be difficult to make such a comment .
if anything it was quite the reverse . "
mr goldsmith said a clear advantage to holding an event in hyde park was the central location but added that park events are expensive to operate .
prices can vary from as little as £ 100 for a sponsored walk for 100 people to £ 1m for a series of five rock concerts .
short memory so how did the park come to be london 's latest playground ?
according to a spokeswoman for the royal parks agency , its growing profile has been more by default than deliberate .
but steve edwards , park manager for seven years , said the general public has a short memory .
" hyde park has always been a well-used venue .
" we hold a couple of hundred events each year and have been holding party in the park since 1996 . "
" people are much more tolerant of state events like the jubilee and millennium but not so forgiving when rock concerts make their windows rattle " steve edwards , park manager he said the most important part of holding events was to ensure a balance between keeping both the crowd and the park 's neighbours happy .
" a lot of people who live locally do n't necessarily think we have always found that balance , " he said .
" there are years when a lot of events happen .
people are much more tolerant of state events like the jubilee and millennium but not so forgiving when rock concerts make their windows rattle , but generally we do not get that many complaints . "
out of the spotlight ?
can the park 's popularity last or will the transformed millennium dome and a completed wembley stadium reposition the spotlight ?
in summer 2007 the millennium dome reopens as a concert venue with a 23,000-capacity indoor arena aiming to host up to 150 music , entertainment and sports events in its first year .
but mr edwards does not see it as a threat , because its capacity is so much lower than the park 's and it is outside central london without all the transport links .
wembley , however , is perceived as having a better atmosphere than the park and will have capacity for 85,000 , he said .

it first passed from abbey monks to henry viii to hunt in , and was a hot-bed for prostitution and free love in the 1960s .
forty years or so later , it fixed the world 's gaze when pink floyd reunited and bob geldof told 150,000 people to make poverty history .
hyde park has become more than just a park , it would seem .
its profile has been raised in recent years to something approaching iconic status after a run of high-profile gigs , services , exhibitions and protests .
wet and slippery among the debateable highlights was a £ 20m star trek exhibition in 2002 hailed as the biggest event of its kind in hyde park since 1851 when the great exhibition ran for six months before moving to crystal palace in south london .
" the thought behind it was fantastic but hyde park is a charisma-free zone elton john a year later , one million joined a rally against the iraq war , considered one of the biggest public protests in the uk .
that was followed in the summer of 2004 with the creation of the slippery diana memorial fountain , a tribute to the late princess of wales , and the will-it-wo n't-it-reopen saga that ran for months .
and now the mayor of london is making inroads in moving some of notting hill carnival to the park by hosting a complementary carnival event there on monday called caribbean showcase .
in addition , it has been the stage for a host of musicians and artists from simon and garfunkel and queen , to shania twain and italian tenor pavarotti .
the 140-hectare landscaped park is meant to hold 93,000 , a usual turnout for party in the park , although live 8 attracted an unprecedented 150,000 .
' herded like cattle ' this makes the park central london 's largest venue but how does it all sound to fans at the back of 93,000 people ?
paul tanner , 30 , who saw the red hot chilli peppers play at hyde park , said : " it feels like you are three miles from the band .
" you have to queue up for everything and feel like cattle .
i prefer smaller venues like the jazz cafe or brixton academy which feel more intimate . "
events are expected to promote london and its cultural diversity speaking after live 8 , elton john said : " the thought behind it was fantastic but hyde park is a charisma-free zone . "
live 8 event organiser harvey goldsmith told bbc news his comment was not entirely fair .
" elton told me that he had a great time , " he said .
" he was there for such a short time that it would be difficult to make such a comment .
if anything it was quite the reverse . "
mr goldsmith said a clear advantage to holding an event in hyde park was the central location but added that park events are expensive to operate .
prices can vary from as little as £ 100 for a sponsored walk for 100 people to £ 1m for a series of five rock concerts .
short memory so how did the park come to be london 's latest playground ?
according to a spokeswoman for the royal parks agency , its growing profile has been more by default than deliberate .
but steve edwards , park manager for seven years , said the general public has a short memory .
" hyde park has always been a well-used venue .
" we hold a couple of hundred events each year and have been holding party in the park since 1996 . "
people are much more tolerant of state events like the jubilee and millennium but not so forgiving when rock concerts make their windows rattle steve edwards , park manager he said the most important part of holding events was to ensure a balance between keeping both the crowd and the park 's neighbours happy .
" a lot of people who live locally do n't necessarily think we have always found that balance , " he said .
" there are years when a lot of events happen .
people are much more tolerant of state events like the jubilee and millennium but not so forgiving when rock concerts make their windows rattle , but generally we do not get that many complaints . "
out of the spotlight ?
can the park 's popularity last or will the transformed millennium dome and a completed wembley stadium reposition the spotlight ?
in summer 2007 the millennium dome reopens as a concert venue with a 23,000-capacity indoor arena aiming to host up to 150 music , entertainment and sports events in its first year .
but mr edwards does not see it as a threat , because its capacity is so much lower than the park 's and it is outside central london without all the transport links .
wembley , however , is perceived as having a better atmosphere than the park and will have capacity for 85,000 , he said .
" a lot of organisers will take outside concerts to wembley so there may be a small drop off .
" but we will still be there as a popular location . "

it first passed from abbey monks to henry viii to hunt in , and was a hot-bed for prostitution and free love in the 1960s .
forty years or so later , it fixed the world 's gaze when pink floyd reunited and bob geldof told 150,000 people to make poverty history .
hyde park has become more than just a park , it would seem .
its profile has been raised in recent years to something approaching iconic status after a run of high-profile gigs , services , exhibitions and protests .
wet and slippery among the debateable highlights was a £ 20m star trek exhibition in 2002 hailed as the biggest event of its kind in hyde park since 1851 when the great exhibition ran for six months before moving to crystal palace in south london .
" the thought behind it was fantastic but hyde park is a charisma-free zone elton john a year later , one million joined a rally against the iraq war , considered one of the biggest public protests in the uk .
that was followed in the summer of 2004 with the creation of the slippery diana memorial fountain , a tribute to the late princess of wales , and the will-it-wo n't-it-reopen saga that ran for months .
and now the mayor of london is making inroads in moving some of notting hill carnival to the park by hosting a complementary carnival event there on monday called caribbean showcase .
in addition , it has been the stage for a host of musicians and artists from simon and garfunkel and queen , to shania twain and italian tenor pavarotti .
the 140-hectare landscaped park is meant to hold 93,000 , a usual turnout for party in the park , although live 8 attracted an unprecedented 150,000 .
' herded like cattle ' this makes the park central london 's largest venue but how does it all sound to fans at the back of 93,000 people ?
paul tanner , 30 , who saw the red hot chilli peppers play at hyde park , said : " it feels like you are three miles from the band .
" you have to queue up for everything and feel like cattle .
i prefer smaller venues like the jazz cafe or brixton academy which feel more intimate . "
events are expected to promote london and its cultural diversity speaking after live 8 , elton john said : " the thought behind it was fantastic but hyde park is a charisma-free zone . "
live 8 event organiser harvey goldsmith told bbc news his comment was not entirely fair .
" elton told me that he had a great time , " he said .
" he was there for such a short time that it would be difficult to make such a comment .
if anything it was quite the reverse . "
mr goldsmith said a clear advantage to holding an event in hyde park was the central location but added that park events are expensive to operate .
prices can vary from as little as £ 100 for a sponsored walk for 100 people to £ 1m for a series of five rock concerts .
short memory so how did the park come to be london 's latest playground ?
according to a spokeswoman for the royal parks agency , its growing profile has been more by default than deliberate .
but steve edwards , park manager for seven years , said the general public has a short memory .
" hyde park has always been a well-used venue .
" we hold a couple of hundred events each year and have been holding party in the park since 1996 . "
people are much more tolerant of state events like the jubilee and millennium but not so forgiving when rock concerts make their windows rattle steve edwards , park manager he said the most important part of holding events was to ensure a balance between keeping both the crowd and the park 's neighbours happy .
" a lot of people who live locally do n't necessarily think we have always found that balance , " he said .
" there are years when a lot of events happen .
people are much more tolerant of state events like the jubilee and millennium but not so forgiving when rock concerts make their windows rattle , but generally we do not get that many complaints . "
out of the spotlight ?
can the park 's popularity last or will the transformed millennium dome and a completed wembley stadium reposition the spotlight ?
in summer 2007 the millennium dome reopens as a concert venue with a 23,000-capacity indoor arena aiming to host up to 150 music , entertainment and sports events in its first year .
but mr edwards does not see it as a threat , because its capacity is so much lower than the park 's and it is outside central london without all the transport links .
wembley , however , is perceived as having a better atmosphere than the park and will have capacity for 85,000 , he said .
" a lot of organisers will take outside concerts to wembley so there may be a small drop off .
" but we will still be there as a popular location . "

' herded like cattle ' this makes the park central london 's largest venue but how does it all sound to fans at the back of 93,000 people ?
paul tanner , 30 , who saw the red hot chilli peppers play at hyde park , said : " it feels like you are three miles from the band .
" you have to queue up for everything and feel like cattle .
i prefer smaller venues like the jazz cafe or brixton academy which feel more intimate . "
events are expected to promote london and its cultural diversity speaking after live 8 , elton john said : " the thought behind it was fantastic but hyde park is a charisma-free zone . "
live 8 event organiser harvey goldsmith told bbc news his comment was not entirely fair .
" elton told me that he had a great time , " he said .
" he was there for such a short time that it would be difficult to make such a comment .
if anything it was quite the reverse . "
mr goldsmith said a clear advantage to holding an event in hyde park was the central location but added that park events are expensive to operate .
prices can vary from as little as £ 100 for a sponsored walk for 100 people to £ 1m for a series of five rock concerts .
short memory so how did the park come to be london 's latest playground ?
according to a spokeswoman for the royal parks agency , its growing profile has been more by default than deliberate .
but steve edwards , park manager for seven years , said the general public has a short memory .
" hyde park has always been a well-used venue .
" we hold a couple of hundred events each year and have been holding party in the park since 1996 . "
people are much more tolerant of state events like the jubilee and millennium but not so forgiving when rock concerts make their windows rattle steve edwards , park manager he said the most important part of holding events was to ensure a balance between keeping both the crowd and the park 's neighbours happy .
" a lot of people who live locally do n't necessarily think we have always found that balance , " he said .
" there are years when a lot of events happen .
people are much more tolerant of state events like the jubilee and millennium but not so forgiving when rock concerts make their windows rattle , but generally we do not get that many complaints . "
out of the spotlight ?
can the park 's popularity last or will the transformed millennium dome and a completed wembley stadium reposition the spotlight ?
in summer 2007 the millennium dome reopens as a concert venue with a 23,000-capacity indoor arena aiming to host up to 150 music , entertainment and sports events in its first year .
but mr edwards does not see it as a threat , because its capacity is so much lower than the park 's and it is outside central london without all the transport links .
wembley , however , is perceived as having a better atmosphere than the park and will have capacity for 85,000 , he said .
" a lot of organisers will take outside concerts to wembley so there may be a small drop off .
" but we will still be there as a popular location . "

some would go further , comparing its impact with that of the launch of commercial television , which broke the staid bbc 's monopoly 50 years ago .
the digital revolution has been speeding up in the past year and is affecting everyone in television - the programme-makers , and the viewers .
it 's changing what we watch , and how we watch it .
digital tv is in 60 % of homes , offering dozens - sometimes hundreds - of channels .
that number is growing at the rate of more than 250,000 a month .
fight harder within the next few months , the order is expected to be given for everyone in britain to switch over to digital - region by region , starting in around two years ' time .
millions of people can also watch tv on their computers , through high-speed broadband connections .
soon they will be able to download missed programmes .
and thousands are watching on their mobile phones .
all this competition means channels must fight harder for ratings .
at the same time , they are finding it harder to give programmes the time they need to develop .
for most viewers the choice is greater than before , provided they can be bothered to seek out the programmes they enjoy and value .
there are more opportunities to watch the best programmes from the past , as well as high quality new ones , from the us as well as the uk .
but that is causing problems for the once-dominant terrestrial channels .
their audiences are steadily going down , as competition grows and more time is spent watching digital channels . "

some would go further , comparing its impact with that of the launch of commercial television , which broke the staid bbc 's monopoly 50 years ago .
the digital revolution has been speeding up in the past year and is affecting everyone in television - the programme-makers , and the viewers .
it 's changing what we watch , and how we watch it .
digital tv is in 60 % of homes , offering dozens - sometimes hundreds - of channels .
that number is growing at the rate of more than 250,000 a month .
fight harder within the next few months , the order is expected to be given for everyone in britain to switch over to digital - region by region , starting in around two years ' time .
millions of people can also watch tv on their computers , through high-speed broadband connections .
soon they will be able to download missed programmes .
and thousands are watching on their mobile phones .
the digital revolution is changing viewers ' habits all this competition means channels must fight harder for ratings .
at the same time , they are finding it harder to give programmes the time they need to develop .
for most viewers the choice is greater than before , provided they can be bothered to seek out the programmes they enjoy and value .
there are more opportunities to watch the best programmes from the past , as well as high quality new ones , from the us as well as the uk .
but that is causing problems for the once-dominant terrestrial channels .
their audiences are steadily going down , as competition grows and more time is spent watching digital channels .
itv now looks a very different channel from its heyday , when there were only two or three channels to compete with not a month goes by without another newspaper headline proclaiming the " worst-ever " day or week for bbc one or itv1 .
for itv , about to celebrate its 50th birthday , this is particularly dangerous because its income is almost entirely dependent on the audience it can offer advertisers .
itv1 has become more reliant on soaps such as coronation street and emmerdale , peaktime dramas and ' event ' programmes such as i 'm a celebrity ...
get me out of here .
it now looks a very different channel from its heyday , when there were only two or three channels to compete with .
greater interactivity but it has found one answer to the digital conundrum , by launching a family of itv channels and promoting them on its own airwaves .
itv2 and itv3 are growing fast , and will soon be joined by channels for men and children .
channel 4 , also dependent on advertising , is about to do the same by launching more4 , alongside filmfour and e4 .
but it is faring better than itv in the new world , with a firm grip on the young and high-spending audience beloved of advertisers .
it has the knack of picking the best us shows , like desperate housewives and lost , and has managed to refresh the big brother franchise .

talks between gate gourmet and the transport and general workers ' union -lrb- t & g -rrb- are on hold following a partial resolution to the jobs impasse .
on thursday night , the two sides agreed that staff at gate gourmet - including 670 sacked workers - would be given the chance to take voluntary redundancy .
the deal offers hopes that some of the axed staff may be reinstated .
however , the issue of the return of alleged militant workers is still to be tackled .
bbc news looks at what could happen next .
what are the hopes of an early resolution to the crisis ?
pretty good .
after four days of intense discussions between gate gourmet and the t & g , a partial deal has been brokered .
the two sides have agreed a framework which will include asking volunteers among the 670 sacked workers and the 1,400 employees still working for the company to take redundancy .
some of the sacked workers could be taken on again , or offered severance pay .
volunteers will be asked to come forward over the next few days , so the next chapter in the saga may have to wait until next week when gate gourmet has a clearer picture of where its stands with its workers .
however , gate gourmet remains adamant that it will not reinstate the 200 so-called " troublemakers " among the 670 sacked workers .
gate gourmet has secured a better catering deal with ba .
is n't the company laughing all the way to the bank ?
no .
although ba now appears to be offering a better deal than previously , it has said it will not sign up to the agreed catering deal until the jobs row is resolved .
so the next few days will be vital to determine the caterer 's future at heathrow , given that gate is determined to avoid allowing militants back into the company .
" the hardliners and militants are never coming back , " gate gourmet boss david siegel insisted earlier this week .
meanwhile , ba is keen for the row to end quickly as it fears its ground staff at heathrow airport could stage further sympathy strikes if gate gourmet workers are not happy .
failure to sign the catering deal with ba would mean gate gourmet 's uk division going into administration , the us-owned company has warned .
what would happen if talks with unions collapse ?
despite agreeing a life-saving deal with ba , it may renew its threat to call in administrators if a deal over the sacked workers is not agreed with unions .
ba has said it is confident that it will be able to continue to source in-flight meals from gate gourmet , even if the caterer goes into administration .
the first concern of any administrator would be to keep gate gourmet in business and sell it as a going concern .
however , if the administrator could not find a potential buyer , the firm might eventually have to cease and be declared bankrupt .
how likely is further industrial action by british airways staff ?
that depends almost entirely upon whether there is a successful conclusion to the ba / gate gourmet / t & g dispute .
if everything ends in agreement and enough gate gourmet workers get their jobs back , it would be highly unlikely that ba staff would walk out again on a sympathy strike .
ba staff walked out for two days two weeks ago in solidarity with the sacked gate gourmet workers .
the t & g wants the sacked gate workers reinstated heathrow airport is a close-knit community of workers , most of whom live in the surrounding london suburbs .
many of ba 's workers will know some of the sacked gate gourmet employees , both as friends and in many cases as family members .
the solidarity between ba and gate gourmet staff can further be explained by the fact that up until december 1997 ba used to make all its own in-flight meals .
one additional cause of future ba strikes could be the airline 's forthcoming report into the first wildcat walkout , especially if union representatives or other ringleaders are highlighted for particular blame and censure .
is ba an innocent party in all this ?
for the most part , yes .
in strict terms , ba can not be blamed for an industrial dispute at a totally separate company .
it is not the airline 's fault that gate gourmet sacked 670 workers , or that its own staff staged a wildcat strike in response .
yet the t & g argues - for a number of reasons - that ba should get involved and help settle the dispute at gate gourmet .
firstly , the union points to the fact that ba is gate gourmet 's main uk customer , and so the airline has a commercial interest in helping sort out the stand-off .
in addition , the union argues that historically gate gourmet workers were ba employees , and so the airline has something of a moral responsibility to its former staff .
analysts have also said that the financial woes of gate gourmet 's uk operations have not been helped by less generous contracts from ba .
yet ba is far from the only airline that has sought to lower its supplier contract costs over the past few years .
since the rise of rival budget airlines , ba and other traditional flag carriers have lowered their costs in order to compete .

a new bridge , and russia 's newest metro system , have been completed and opened on time .
tatarstan , home to almost four million people , has significant oil reserves as well as developed agriculture and heavy industry .
its leader , mintimer shaimiyev , has secured autonomy without provoking moscow into intervention with demands for independence .
the region has a strong sense of ethnic identity and appreciation of its unique history .
' make-or-break ' summit its main people - the tatars - trace their origins back to a turkic people , the volga bulgars , who built a prosperous and powerful state in the 10th century .
some 300 years later , it was annexed by the mongols of the golden horde .
then , as the golden horde itself collapsed , a separate kazan khanate seceded , only to be annexed by russia in the middle of the 16th century .
islam remains important in public life .
kazan is home to an islamic university and europe 's largest mosque , which was opened earlier this year .
against this backdrop , vladimir putin will chair what is being touted as a make-or-break summit of the cis .
russia 's foreign minister , sergei lavrov , said earlier this week that the summit must refocus the cis towards a social and humanitarian agenda .
it is a frank acknowledgement that the cis no longer allows moscow to maintain economic , military or even political influence in the former soviet republics .

the department of health has revealed there were 44,488 cases of c. difficile in over 65s in england last year .
it was the first time mandatory surveillance of the diarrhoea-causing infection has been undertaken .
in the early 1990s there were about 1,000 cases a year , but by 2003 the total rose to 35,536 , england , wales and northern ireland data showed .
however , this was only collected on a voluntary basis so the true figure may have been higher .
clostridium difficile the bacteria are naturally present in the intestine but kept under control by other bacteria antibiotics can kill some of these , allowing c.difficile to take hold overuse of antibiotics is linked to the infection 's rise c.difficile is not resistant to treatment , but some cases are difficult to treat the strain seen at stoke mandeville hospital is related to one which has emerged in the us and canada these latest statistics have showed that c.difficile is nearly seven times more common than mrsa , although the superbug is more deadly .
office for national statistics data has shown c.difficile was the underlying cause of 934 deaths in 2003 , almost three times as many as mrsa .
chief nursing officer christine beasley said some of the rise in infections was down to better reporting .
but she added it was largely due to the fact that advances in medical care were keeping people alive for longer , which meant they were more susceptible to bugs .
" the immune system does not work as well and , therefore , people are more vulnerable , " she said .
she said the c. difficile , which stands for clostridium difficile , will now be included in the government programme to fight mrsa .
the government introduced mandatory surveillance after a new and more virulent strain of the infection , which was first identified in 1978 , emerged .
deaths at one trust - stoke mandeville in buckinghamshire - 12 patients have died and 300 have been infected since 2003 .
and earlier this year royal devon and exeter hospital , exeter , confirmed c. difficile had been a contributory factor in the deaths of 13 patients since january this year .

c. difficile usually affects the elderly , although young people have been affected , and can prove fatal if antibiotic treatment fails to kill all the spores in the gut .
it is also very difficult to eradicate from the ward environment , which means it is easy for other patients to become infected .
the spores of c. difficile can not be destroyed by hand gels , as mrsa can .
experts have said staff must use soap and water to get rid of the bug , and hospital wards must be cleaned using more powerful disinfectants than usual to eradicate the bug .
professor mark willcox is a consultant medical microbiologist at leeds teaching hospital who worked on a c. difficile standards group that reported to the department of health .
he told the bbc : " the most worrying concern is not so much how many cases we are having , but this new strain which appeared first in canada about two or three years ago .
" it appears to cause an excess number of cases when it occurs in a hospital , but the particularly worrisome thing is that it causes more severe cases - patients can be very ill with this strain . "
and simon williams , director of policy at the patients association , said while he welcomed the measure being taken , he still had concerns .
" i am not confident we have fully got to grips with this yet .
as with mrsa , patients do not expect to go into hospital and get ill . "
the department of health also released figures for the number of cases of gre , a bug which can cause wound infections and occasionally blood poisoning .
although hard to treat it is not particularly virulent compared to other hospital infections - there were just 620 cases .
