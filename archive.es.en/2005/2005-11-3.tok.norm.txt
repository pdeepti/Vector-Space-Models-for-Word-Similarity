the cheapest of those still available will set supporters back some 1,900 euros -lrb- $ 2,281 -rrb- plus sales tax .
this pricey package will allow the extravagant fan to attend three first round games .
but that ’ s just the bottom of a sliding scale that reaches an incredible 336,000 euros -lrb- $ 403,300 -rrb- for a 20-person box at all six matches in berlin 's olympic stadium , including the final . while tickets through the regular channel on the official world cup website have been snapped up , the 346,950 tickets held by swiss-based company ise-hospitality have not sold half as well , mainly because of the prices . only half of hospitality packages sold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oli kahn will be there ... but will you ?
the company told reuters that approximately half of the hospitality packages have yet to be sold , in contrast to the first offering of 812,000 tickets from the world cup organizers which was oversubscribed by 10 to one .
the next phase of 300,000 tickets , which go up for grabs after the group draw in december , is expected to generate even more of a mad scramble . with tickets ranging from 35 euros for the lowest category seats at opening round games to 600 euros for the most expensive seats at the final , with relatively modest price points along the way , it is unsurprising that more fans are tempted by the regular offers . " the german market is of course challenging , but we are certain we will sell out , " ise hospitality 's deputy ceo andreas hacker said . hacker and ise hospitality are obviously hoping that business clients who are looking to use the event as a way of entertaining potential clients will eventually see the " speculate to accumulate " factor in the expensive packages . fans with cash also in with a chance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all this plus champagne and caviar .
with food , drink , parking and special stadium access included , the tickets are specifically geared towards corporate buyers .
however hacker was keen to stress that affluent supporters should not be put off from applying for the tickets . " the reasons behind purchases so far have been clear , " he said .
" no other event can offer anything like the opportunities for networking and entertaining at the world cup . " the problem may be that the tickets for the main events , like the knock-out stages and particularly the semi-finals and final , may sell out fast , leaving many of the other games undersold . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans will need to beg for a long time to buy a top price ticket .
the world cup organizing committee has made it clear that any unsold hospitality packages would be taken back and made available to fans but ise hospitality are confident that this wo n't be necessary . " it 's obvious that companies and individuals will have an interest in certain matches more than others , " hacker said .
" but all of the matches will have an amazing atmosphere . " " it 's the world cup .
at the end of the year , the worst thing would be to say you were n't even there .

struthof was located in the town of natzwiller in the eastern french region of alsace , which was annexed by germany during the war . some 22,000 men and women perished at the camp between may 1941 and november 1944 , when it was liberated by us forces .
most of the victims were members of the resistance and political deportees . a simple design barely visible from the outside , the memorial center is built around a vast underground potato shed , dug out by camp laborers from 1943 to 1945 and only unearthed when construction work began at the site two years ago . " in line with the wishes of survivors , it was designed as a simple , square building intended to convey information and emotion , not as a flashy structure " said the center 's director valerie drechsler . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conveying information and emotion without being ostentatious visitors are first taken on an interactive tour of the 14 nazi concentration camps set up in europe during the war , including auschwitz in poland , bergen-belsen in germany and mauthausen in austria . further inside , film clips shot under cover inside the struthof camp are projected alongside nazi propaganda footage , while a poem written by a deportee echoes in three languages around the dimly-lit underground chamber . documenting horror hundreds of press cuttings , drawings and witness accounts - original material as well as documents from museums and image banks - retrace the rise of fascism in the 1920s , as well as the growth of resistance movements in france and elsewhere in europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : struthof prisoners were supposed to disappear without a trace emerging from the center back into the light , the visitor finds himself in front of the gates of struthof . french architect pierre-louis faloci intended the play on light and shadow to be a reference to adolf hitler 's 1941 decree " nacht und nebel " -lrb- night and fog -rrb- , which led to the disappearance of countless political prisoners .
the detainees at struthof were known as " night-and-fog " prisoners : they were supposed to be swallowed by the dark and vanish without a trace . the european center for deported resistance fighters was mainly financed by the french defense ministry , with the remaining one-fifth provided by european union subsidies . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de köhler seeks to soothe wwii controversy at the start of a visit to poland tuesday , german president köhler spoke about a controversial center against war-time expulsions to be built in berlin - an issue that has offended historical sensitivities in poland .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.11.2005 stoiber departs to the sound of sharpening knives großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber risks being exiled and isolated after quitting the cabinet in the midst of all the chaos in berlin , edmund stoiber may have hoped his departure from the cabinet would pass without much comment .
on the contrary , it has prompted harsh criticism and raised doubts over his future . edmund stoiber 's decision to escape the spiraling chaos surrounding the fledgling government in berlin for the safety of his regional fiefdom in munich was being viewed as the last nail in the embryonic grand coalition 's coffin on thursday . but while germany 's politicians vowed to press on with plans to form a government made up of the country 's two largest parties , in some quarters it was stoiber 's political career over which the last rites were being administered . the head of the christian social union , the christian democratic union 's sister party , returned to bavaria after rejecting the cabinet position of economics and technology minister on tuesday during the latest fraught round of coalition discussions between the conservatives and the social democrats . stoiber 's departure left his colleagues to ponder an increasingly difficult situation and prompted many to turn on the man who , for so long , had craved power at the top end of conservative politics only to abandon it . damagi n g beyo n d repair ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when faced with a change , stoiber chose to stay where he felt safest .
some of stoiber 's csu members in bavaria were less than happy at the prospect of their prime minister returning to concentrate on regional matters .
csu state parliament representative sebastian von rotenhan told reporters that stoiber 's u-turn in berlin had caused the csu " irreparable damage " and had lost the party " enormous amounts of respect . "
he added that he thought stoiber 's days as bavarian state premier were numbered . " it is time for a change , " rotenhan said . fellow csu member martin neumeyer also criticized stoiber 's decision and its knock-on effects . " these scars will remain , " he said in an interview with dpa .
" one thing is clear ; the damage will remain with us for some time . " " edmund stoiber was an obstruction in berlin , " said georg milbradt , cdu state premier of saxony , in der spiegel , adding that stoiber 's combative and opinionated approach was only adding to the troubles surrounding the coalition talks . fdp head like n s stoiber to rebel lafo n tai n e bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guido westerwelle -lrb- left -rrb- will now be in opposition to merkel and stoiber .
guido westerwelle , the leader of the opposition free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- which was originally aligned with the cdu / csu in the election campaign , compared stoiber to former social democrat rebel and current left party co-leader , oskar lafontaine . " in terms of escaping his responsibility , edmund stoiber is on a par with lafontaine , " the fdp leader told the westfale n blatt newspaper .
" such an escape from a position of responsibility , a state of office , i would find impossible to imagine had i not seen it . " the german media was also scathing in its reporting of stoiber 's decision .
the mass circulation tabloid bild called stoiber an " eternal ditherer " and said that he had " chickened out " of his responsibility and had fled to the safety of his home state leaving berlin and germany in chaos while " waving the white flag . " the bavarian state premier 's character was further assassinated by the business daily ha n delsblatt which accused stoiber of lacking any sense of duty , loyalty and reliability . " even with the best of intentions it 's impossible to find these qualities in stoiber 's behavior , " the paper wrote .
" it is astonishing that the csu obediently puts up with his actions . " " this is the end of the stoiber era - he gave the csu back its self-confidence and now he 's ruining it , " cried the süddeutsche zeitu n g which went on to describe stoiber as " a faltering figure , a spirit who does n't know what he wants . " csu to discuss stoiber 's style bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber 's approach is a concern for those who fear he may become a critic .
back in berlin , the conservative bloc hierarchy were looking into ways of limiting the damage of stoiber 's desertion and pre-empting any unwanted criticism he may be inclined to direct at the cdu .
the meeting was also likely to address stoiber 's style of politics and promotion ; a style that has alienated many party members and voters alike . in recent days , stoiber has made it clear that he has been extremely unhappy with the shape of the economics ministry he was supposed to head in a grand coalition .
the bavarian leader has openly complained that he wanted more portfolios for his super-ministry than just the research and education ministries he was granted by cdu leader angela merkel . fears bavaria n pm may rock coalitio n boat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber and merkel have had a strained relationship for some time .
as a result , the relationship between the two had soured in recent weeks , dredging up many feelings stoiber may have had about being passed over in favor of merkel after his unsuccessful 2002 election campaign .
some conservative leaders now fear that stoiber - once back in munich - might torpedo grand coalition talks with unqualified and unsolicited comments . but christian democrat senior member wolfgang bosbach ruled out such a scenario .
" any fears that edmund stoiber would cause berlin trouble as state premier in munich are unfounded , " bosbach told reporters .
" he remains in favor of a grand coalition just like those at the negotiating table . " despite this gloss , there is a fear among many in conservative circles that if stoiber is going down , he may want to take as many of his rivals with him .

struthof was located in the town of natzwiller in the eastern french region of alsace , which was annexed by germany during the war . some 22,000 men and women perished at the camp between may 1941 and november 1944 , when it was liberated by us forces .
most of the victims were members of the resistance and political deportees . a simple design barely visible from the outside , the memorial center is built around a vast underground potato shed , dug out by camp laborers from 1943 to 1945 and only unearthed when construction work began at the site two years ago .

the detainees at struthof were known as " night-and-fog " prisoners : they were supposed to be swallowed by the dark and vanish without a trace . the european center for deported resistance fighters was mainly financed by the french defense ministry , with the remaining one-fifth provided by european union subsidies . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de köhler seeks to soothe wwii controversy at the start of a visit to poland tuesday , german president köhler spoke about a controversial center against war-time expulsions to be built in berlin - an issue that has offended historical sensitivities in poland .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.11.2005 stoiber departs to the sound of sharpening knives großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber risks being exiled and isolated after quitting the cabinet in the midst of all the chaos in berlin , edmund stoiber may have hoped his departure from the cabinet would pass without much comment .
on the contrary , it has prompted harsh criticism and raised doubts over his future . edmund stoiber 's decision to escape the spiraling chaos surrounding the fledgling government in berlin for the safety of his regional fiefdom in munich was being viewed as the last nail in the embryonic grand coalition 's coffin on thursday . but while germany 's politicians vowed to press on with plans to form a government made up of the country 's two largest parties , in some quarters it was stoiber 's political career over which the last rites were being administered . the head of the christian social union , the christian democratic union 's sister party , returned to bavaria after rejecting the cabinet position of economics and technology minister on tuesday during the latest fraught round of coalition discussions between the conservatives and the social democrats . stoiber 's departure left his colleagues to ponder an increasingly difficult situation and prompted many to turn on the man who , for so long , had craved power at the top end of conservative politics only to abandon it . damagi n g beyo n d repair ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when faced with a change , stoiber chose to stay where he felt safest .
some of stoiber 's csu members in bavaria were less than happy at the prospect of their prime minister returning to concentrate on regional matters .
csu state parliament representative sebastian von rotenhan told reporters that stoiber 's u-turn in berlin had caused the csu " irreparable damage " and had lost the party " enormous amounts of respect . "
he added that he thought stoiber 's days as bavarian state premier were numbered . " it is time for a change , " rotenhan said . fellow csu member martin neumeyer also criticized stoiber 's decision and its knock-on effects . " these scars will remain , " he said in an interview with dpa .
" one thing is clear ; the damage will remain with us for some time . " " edmund stoiber was an obstruction in berlin , " said georg milbradt , cdu state premier of saxony , in der spiegel , adding that stoiber 's combative and opinionated approach was only adding to the troubles surrounding the coalition talks . fdp head like n s stoiber to rebel lafo n tai n e bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guido westerwelle -lrb- left -rrb- will now be in opposition to merkel and stoiber .
guido westerwelle , the leader of the opposition free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- which was originally aligned with the cdu / csu in the election campaign , compared stoiber to former social democrat rebel and current left party co-leader , oskar lafontaine . " in terms of escaping his responsibility , edmund stoiber is on a par with lafontaine , " the fdp leader told the westfale n blatt newspaper .
" such an escape from a position of responsibility , a state of office , i would find impossible to imagine had i not seen it . " the german media was also scathing in its reporting of stoiber 's decision .
the mass circulation tabloid bild called stoiber an " eternal ditherer " and said that he had " chickened out " of his responsibility and had fled to the safety of his home state leaving berlin and germany in chaos while " waving the white flag . " the bavarian state premier 's character was further assassinated by the business daily ha n delsblatt which accused stoiber of lacking any sense of duty , loyalty and reliability . " even with the best of intentions it 's impossible to find these qualities in stoiber 's behavior , " the paper wrote .
" it is astonishing that the csu obediently puts up with his actions . " " this is the end of the stoiber era - he gave the csu back its self-confidence and now he 's ruining it , " cried the süddeutsche zeitu n g which went on to describe stoiber as " a faltering figure , a spirit who does n't know what he wants . " csu to discuss stoiber 's style bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber 's approach is a concern for those who fear he may become a critic .
back in berlin , the conservative bloc hierarchy were looking into ways of limiting the damage of stoiber 's desertion and pre-empting any unwanted criticism he may be inclined to direct at the cdu .
the meeting was also likely to address stoiber 's style of politics and promotion ; a style that has alienated many party members and voters alike . in recent days , stoiber has made it clear that he has been extremely unhappy with the shape of the economics ministry he was supposed to head in a grand coalition .
the bavarian leader has openly complained that he wanted more portfolios for his super-ministry than just the research and education ministries he was granted by cdu leader angela merkel . fears bavaria n pm may rock coalitio n boat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber and merkel have had a strained relationship for some time .
as a result , the relationship between the two had soured in recent weeks , dredging up many feelings stoiber may have had about being passed over in favor of merkel after his unsuccessful 2002 election campaign .
some conservative leaders now fear that stoiber - once back in munich - might torpedo grand coalition talks with unqualified and unsolicited comments . but christian democrat senior member wolfgang bosbach ruled out such a scenario .
" any fears that edmund stoiber would cause berlin trouble as state premier in munich are unfounded , " bosbach told reporters .
" he remains in favor of a grand coalition just like those at the negotiating table . " despite this gloss , there is a fear among many in conservative circles that if stoiber is going down , he may want to take as many of his rivals with him .

" animals used for their skin suffer from confinement , fear , painful mutilations , deprivation of all that is natural and important to them , and cruel treatment during transport and slaughter , " anderson wrote , in a letter released by people for the ethical treatment of animals -lrb- peta -rrb- .
" i want no part of that , but i would like a mercedes . " peta said that mercedes-benz had informed the group that all future car models will be available with an entirely leather-free option in all markets either directly at the dealership or via special order .
but anderson claims that when she recently inquired about buying a mercedes g55 , she was told that it is not yet available without the incriminating skin . ironically , the gas-guzzling and powerful mercedes g-55 that vegetarian anderson wants was named by a french ecological group as the " world 's most polluting vehicle " in 2004 , while several us surveys said it is one of the least environmentally-friendly vehicles on the us market . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vienna opera ball attracts celebs and protests holllywood actress andie mcdowell was the star guest of this year 's vienna opera ball , austria 's most important society event .

the cheapest of those still available will set supporters back some 1,900 euros -lrb- $ 2,281 -rrb- plus sales tax .
this pricey package will allow the extravagant fan to attend three first round games .
but that ’ s just the bottom of a sliding scale that reaches an incredible 336,000 euros -lrb- $ 403,300 -rrb- for a 20-person box at all six matches in berlin 's olympic stadium , including the final . while tickets through the regular channel on the official world cup website have been snapped up , the 346,950 tickets held by swiss-based company ise-hospitality have not sold half as well , mainly because of the prices . only half of hospitality packages sold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oli kahn will be there ... but will you ?
the company told reuters that approximately half of the hospitality packages have yet to be sold , in contrast to the first offering of 812,000 tickets from the world cup organizers which was oversubscribed by 10 to one .
the next phase of 300,000 tickets , which go up for grabs after the group draw in december , is expected to generate even more of a mad scramble . with tickets ranging from 35 euros for the lowest category seats at opening round games to 600 euros for the most expensive seats at the final , with relatively modest price points along the way , it is unsurprising that more fans are tempted by the regular offers . " the german market is of course challenging , but we are certain we will sell out , " ise hospitality 's deputy ceo andreas hacker said . hacker and ise hospitality are obviously hoping that business clients who are looking to use the event as a way of entertaining potential clients will eventually see the " speculate to accumulate " factor in the expensive packages . fans with cash also in with a chance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all this plus champagne and caviar .
with food , drink , parking and special stadium access included , the tickets are specifically geared towards corporate buyers .
however hacker was keen to stress that affluent supporters should not be put off from applying for the tickets . " the reasons behind purchases so far have been clear , " he said .
" no other event can offer anything like the opportunities for networking and entertaining at the world cup . " the problem may be that the tickets for the main events , like the knock-out stages and particularly the semi-finals and final , may sell out fast , leaving many of the other games undersold . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans will need to beg for a long time to buy a top price ticket .
the world cup organizing committee has made it clear that any unsold hospitality packages would be taken back and made available to fans but ise hospitality are confident that this wo n't be necessary . " it 's obvious that companies and individuals will have an interest in certain matches more than others , " hacker said .
" but all of the matches will have an amazing atmosphere . " " it 's the world cup .

the cheapest of those still available will set supporters back some 1,900 euros -lrb- $ 2,281 -rrb- plus sales tax .
this pricey package will allow the extravagant fan to attend three first round games .

the world cup organizing committee has made it clear that any unsold hospitality packages would be taken back and made available to fans but ise hospitality are confident that this wo n't be necessary .

bayern ’ s coach felix magath threw down the gauntlet before the match against juventus .
“ we will play aggressively up front .
there ’ s no reason why we shouldn ’ t win the second match against juve ” , he said .
fighting talk from the bundesliga champions .
victory would have been bayern ’ s first win in italy for 17 years .

bayern will now have to win those games to avoid confronting big clubs like barcelona and chelseas early in the knockout stage .
despite their optimism going into the game , worries remain about bayern munich ’ s offensive play .
dutch international roy makaay ’ s definetely below his usual goalscoring form and paraguayan interational rocqe sant kruz is sidelined for the next six months with a nasty ligament injury .
makaay did had a good chance of ending his goal drought in the 12 minute , his shot just wide of the juventus goal .
but he was booed off the field , subsitituted 5 minutes before the final whistle , having gone more than a thousand minutes without scoring .
but magath insists there are enough players who can score goals – namely ballack , zé roberto , lucio and deisler .

but in the second half it was the same old story .
within the space of 5 minutes they gave away a 3-nil lead .
what looked like a sure win turned into a nailbiting affair .
bremen clinched the win 4-3 , but were lucky to come away with a victory .
in the dying minutes of the match bremen ’ s nanado elbowed the italian striker – but the referee seemed paralysed and did not award a penalty to udinese .
so a high-scoring match in bremen ’ s weser stadium , but will it be enough to revive their champions league aspirations ?

a win would have given them a good chance of winning their group .
but the pressure ’ s on bremen .
it was really their last chance to make it through to the quarter-finals , so a win against udinese was obligatory .
bayern ’ s coach felix magath threw down the gauntlet before the match against juventus .
“ we will play aggressively up front .
there ’ s no reason why we shouldn ’ t win the second match against juve ” , he said .
fighting talk from the bundesliga champions .
victory would have been bayern ’ s first win in italy for 17 years .
but the 2-1 defeat means it ’ s now wide open in group a with two more games to play .
bayern will now have to win those games to avoid confronting big clubs like barcelona and chelseas early in the knockout stage .
despite their optimism going into the game , worries remain about bayern munich ’ s offensive play .
dutch international roy makaay ’ s definetely below his usual goalscoring form and paraguayan interational rocqe sant kruz is sidelined for the next six months with a nasty ligament injury .
makaay did had a good chance of ending his goal drought in the 12 minute , his shot just wide of the juventus goal .
but he was booed off the field , subsitituted 5 minutes before the final whistle , having gone more than a thousand minutes without scoring .
but magath insists there are enough players who can score goals – namely ballack , zé roberto , lucio and deisler .
juventus took the lead early in the second half with a goal by treseguet , taking full advantage of a goalscoring opportunity .
the reward for piling on the pressure .
bayern ’ s sebastian deisler pulled one back - from 37 metres .
but tresequet hit the target a second time , sealing the victory for the home side .
bayern punished for two mistakes in defence .
meanwhile werder bremen were counting on miroslav klose and ivan klasnic to show udinese why they are the bundesliga 's top goalscoring duo on wednesday night .
but klasnic missed the game , suffering from a bout of appendicitis .
bremen ’ s champion 's league form has been less than convincing so far , leaving them bottom of group c. the northern german side knew only a win would against udinese would give them a chance of making it to the last 16 teams in the quarter finals .
goals by miroslav klose in the 15th minute and thomas baumann in the 24th gave bremen a helping hand .
but in the second half it was the same old story .
within the space of 5 minutes they gave away a 3-nil lead .
what looked like a sure win turned into a nailbiting affair .
bremen clinched the win 4-3 , but were lucky to come away with a victory .
in the dying minutes of the match bremen ’ s nanado elbowed the italian striker – but the referee seemed paralysed and did not award a penalty to udinese .
so a high-scoring match in bremen ’ s weser stadium , but will it be enough to revive their champions league aspirations ?

managing director rudi assauer has invested millions in his squad and had high expectations before the game and will have been a relieved man after the final whistle .
in spite of winning schalke once more showed their two faces .
the bundesliga club took the lead through their centre forward kevin kuranyi who rose well to put a powerful header into the net inspite of being marked by two defenders .
a fine strikers goal . minutes later the turkish side were down to 10 men after fabio brought down lincoln . half-time score 1-0 to schalke .
minutes into the second half the turkish side lost yet another player after the referee very harshly sent off aurelio for a foul on kuranyi .
so , fenerbahce down to nine men . surprisingly after their good first half schalke began to struggle in front of their vociferous fans .
the turkish side were well organised at the back by ghanian captain steven appiah . nicolas anelka , fenerbahce's lone striker had a great chance to equalise but missed .

but that ’ s just the bottom of a sliding scale that reaches an incredible 336,000 euros -lrb- $ 403,300 -rrb- for a 20-person box at all six matches in berlin 's olympic stadium , including the final . while tickets through the regular channel on the official world cup website have been snapped up , the 346,950 tickets held by swiss-based company ise-hospitality have not sold half as well , mainly because of the prices . only half of hospitality packages sold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oli kahn will be there ... but will you ?

the next phase of 300,000 tickets , which go up for grabs after the group draw in december , is expected to generate even more of a mad scramble . with tickets ranging from 35 euros for the lowest category seats at opening round games to 600 euros for the most expensive seats at the final , with relatively modest price points along the way , it is unsurprising that more fans are tempted by the regular offers .

however hacker was keen to stress that affluent supporters should not be put off from applying for the tickets . " the reasons behind purchases so far have been clear , " he said .
" no other event can offer anything like the opportunities for networking and entertaining at the world cup .

others say he lacks experience . regardless , it seems that michael glos , a senior official of the conservative christian social union , will be the next german economics minister in the incoming grand coalition government , replacing csu party head edmund stoiber who backed away from the job after a shakeup in the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- this week .

on the contrary , it has prompted harsh criticism and raised doubts over his future . edmund stoiber 's decision to escape the spiraling chaos surrounding the fledgling government in berlin for the safety of his regional fiefdom in munich was being viewed as the last nail in the embryonic grand coalition 's coffin on thursday . but while germany 's politicians vowed to press on with plans to form a government made up of the country 's two largest parties , in some quarters it was stoiber 's political career over which the last rites were being administered . the head of the christian social union , the christian democratic union 's sister party , returned to bavaria after rejecting the cabinet position of economics and technology minister on tuesday during the latest fraught round of coalition discussions between the conservatives and the social democrats . stoiber 's departure left his colleagues to ponder an increasingly difficult situation and prompted many to turn on the man who , for so long , had craved power at the top end of conservative politics only to abandon it . damagi n g beyo n d repair ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when faced with a change , stoiber chose to stay where he felt safest .
some of stoiber 's csu members in bavaria were less than happy at the prospect of their prime minister returning to concentrate on regional matters .
csu state parliament representative sebastian von rotenhan told reporters that stoiber 's u-turn in berlin had caused the csu " irreparable damage " and had lost the party " enormous amounts of respect . "
he added that he thought stoiber 's days as bavarian state premier were numbered . " it is time for a change , " rotenhan said . fellow csu member martin neumeyer also criticized stoiber 's decision and its knock-on effects . " these scars will remain , " he said in an interview with dpa .
" one thing is clear ; the damage will remain with us for some time . " " edmund stoiber was an obstruction in berlin , " said georg milbradt , cdu state premier of saxony , in der spiegel , adding that stoiber 's combative and opinionated approach was only adding to the troubles surrounding the coalition talks . fdp head like n s stoiber to rebel lafo n tai n e bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guido westerwelle -lrb- left -rrb- will now be in opposition to merkel and stoiber .
guido westerwelle , the leader of the opposition free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- which was originally aligned with the cdu / csu in the election campaign , compared stoiber to former social democrat rebel and current left party co-leader , oskar lafontaine . " in terms of escaping his responsibility , edmund stoiber is on a par with lafontaine , " the fdp leader told the westfale n blatt newspaper .
" such an escape from a position of responsibility , a state of office , i would find impossible to imagine had i not seen it . " the german media was also scathing in its reporting of stoiber 's decision .
the mass circulation tabloid bild called stoiber an " eternal ditherer " and said that he had " chickened out " of his responsibility and had fled to the safety of his home state leaving berlin and germany in chaos while " waving the white flag . " the bavarian state premier 's character was further assassinated by the business daily ha n delsblatt which accused stoiber of lacking any sense of duty , loyalty and reliability . " even with the best of intentions it 's impossible to find these qualities in stoiber 's behavior , " the paper wrote .
" it is astonishing that the csu obediently puts up with his actions . " " this is the end of the stoiber era - he gave the csu back its self-confidence and now he 's ruining it , " cried the süddeutsche zeitu n g which went on to describe stoiber as " a faltering figure , a spirit who does n't know what he wants . " csu to discuss stoiber 's style bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber 's approach is a concern for those who fear he may become a critic .
back in berlin , the conservative bloc hierarchy were looking into ways of limiting the damage of stoiber 's desertion and pre-empting any unwanted criticism he may be inclined to direct at the cdu .
the meeting was also likely to address stoiber 's style of politics and promotion ; a style that has alienated many party members and voters alike . in recent days , stoiber has made it clear that he has been extremely unhappy with the shape of the economics ministry he was supposed to head in a grand coalition .
the bavarian leader has openly complained that he wanted more portfolios for his super-ministry than just the research and education ministries he was granted by cdu leader angela merkel . fears bavaria n pm may rock coalitio n boat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber and merkel have had a strained relationship for some time .
as a result , the relationship between the two had soured in recent weeks , dredging up many feelings stoiber may have had about being passed over in favor of merkel after his unsuccessful 2002 election campaign .
some conservative leaders now fear that stoiber - once back in munich - might torpedo grand coalition talks with unqualified and unsolicited comments . but christian democrat senior member wolfgang bosbach ruled out such a scenario .
" any fears that edmund stoiber would cause berlin trouble as state premier in munich are unfounded , " bosbach told reporters .
" he remains in favor of a grand coalition just like those at the negotiating table . " despite this gloss , there is a fear among many in conservative circles that if stoiber is going down , he may want to take as many of his rivals with him .

on the contrary , it has prompted harsh criticism and raised doubts over his future . edmund stoiber 's decision to escape the spiraling chaos surrounding the fledgling government in berlin for the safety of his regional fiefdom in munich was being viewed as the last nail in the embryonic grand coalition 's coffin on thursday . but while germany 's politicians vowed to press on with plans to form a government made up of the country 's two largest parties , in some quarters it was stoiber 's political career over which the last rites were being administered . the head of the christian social union , the christian democratic union 's sister party , returned to bavaria after rejecting the cabinet position of economics and technology minister on tuesday during the latest fraught round of coalition discussions between the conservatives and the social democrats . stoiber 's departure left his colleagues to ponder an increasingly difficult situation and prompted many to turn on the man who , for so long , had craved power at the top end of conservative politics only to abandon it . damagi n g beyo n d repair ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when faced with a change , stoiber chose to stay where he felt safest .
some of stoiber 's csu members in bavaria were less than happy at the prospect of their prime minister returning to concentrate on regional matters .
csu state parliament representative sebastian von rotenhan told reporters that stoiber 's u-turn in berlin had caused the csu " irreparable damage " and had lost the party " enormous amounts of respect . "
he added that he thought stoiber 's days as bavarian state premier were numbered . " it is time for a change , " rotenhan said . fellow csu member martin neumeyer also criticized stoiber 's decision and its knock-on effects . " these scars will remain , " he said in an interview with dpa .
" one thing is clear ; the damage will remain with us for some time . " " edmund stoiber was an obstruction in berlin , " said georg milbradt , cdu state premier of saxony , in der spiegel , adding that stoiber 's combative and opinionated approach was only adding to the troubles surrounding the coalition talks . fdp head like n s stoiber to rebel lafo n tai n e bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guido westerwelle -lrb- left -rrb- will now be in opposition to merkel and stoiber .
guido westerwelle , the leader of the opposition free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- which was originally aligned with the cdu / csu in the election campaign , compared stoiber to former social democrat rebel and current left party co-leader , oskar lafontaine . " in terms of escaping his responsibility , edmund stoiber is on a par with lafontaine , " the fdp leader told the westfale n blatt newspaper .
" such an escape from a position of responsibility , a state of office , i would find impossible to imagine had i not seen it . " the german media was also scathing in its reporting of stoiber 's decision .
the mass circulation tabloid bild called stoiber an " eternal ditherer " and said that he had " chickened out " of his responsibility and had fled to the safety of his home state leaving berlin and germany in chaos while " waving the white flag . " the bavarian state premier 's character was further assassinated by the business daily ha n delsblatt which accused stoiber of lacking any sense of duty , loyalty and reliability . " even with the best of intentions it 's impossible to find these qualities in stoiber 's behavior , " the paper wrote .
" it is astonishing that the csu obediently puts up with his actions . " " this is the end of the stoiber era - he gave the csu back its self-confidence and now he 's ruining it , " cried the süddeutsche zeitu n g which went on to describe stoiber as " a faltering figure , a spirit who does n't know what he wants . " csu to discuss stoiber 's style bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber 's approach is a concern for those who fear he may become a critic .
back in berlin , the conservative bloc hierarchy were looking into ways of limiting the damage of stoiber 's desertion and pre-empting any unwanted criticism he may be inclined to direct at the cdu .
the meeting was also likely to address stoiber 's style of politics and promotion ; a style that has alienated many party members and voters alike . in recent days , stoiber has made it clear that he has been extremely unhappy with the shape of the economics ministry he was supposed to head in a grand coalition .
the bavarian leader has openly complained that he wanted more portfolios for his super-ministry than just the research and education ministries he was granted by cdu leader angela merkel . fears bavaria n pm may rock coalitio n boat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber and merkel have had a strained relationship for some time .
as a result , the relationship between the two had soured in recent weeks , dredging up many feelings stoiber may have had about being passed over in favor of merkel after his unsuccessful 2002 election campaign .
some conservative leaders now fear that stoiber - once back in munich - might torpedo grand coalition talks with unqualified and unsolicited comments . but christian democrat senior member wolfgang bosbach ruled out such a scenario .
" any fears that edmund stoiber would cause berlin trouble as state premier in munich are unfounded , " bosbach told reporters .
" he remains in favor of a grand coalition just like those at the negotiating table . " despite this gloss , there is a fear among many in conservative circles that if stoiber is going down , he may want to take as many of his rivals with him .

" we will reduce the number of men from 3,100 to 2,800 .
this is not a sign of decreased commitment to international engagement " but due to the withdrawal of reconnaissance aircraft for modernization , a defense ministry spokesman said . the extension of the mandate is expected to be approved by the incoming parliament next week .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.11.2005 stoiber departs to the sound of sharpening knives großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber risks being exiled and isolated after quitting the cabinet in the midst of all the chaos in berlin , edmund stoiber may have hoped his departure from the cabinet would pass without much comment .
on the contrary , it has prompted harsh criticism and raised doubts over his future . edmund stoiber 's decision to escape the spiraling chaos surrounding the fledgling government in berlin for the safety of his regional fiefdom in munich was being viewed as the last nail in the embryonic grand coalition 's coffin on thursday . but while germany 's politicians vowed to press on with plans to form a government made up of the country 's two largest parties , in some quarters it was stoiber 's political career over which the last rites were being administered . the head of the christian social union , the christian democratic union 's sister party , returned to bavaria after rejecting the cabinet position of economics and technology minister on tuesday during the latest fraught round of coalition discussions between the conservatives and the social democrats . stoiber 's departure left his colleagues to ponder an increasingly difficult situation and prompted many to turn on the man who , for so long , had craved power at the top end of conservative politics only to abandon it . damagi n g beyo n d repair ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when faced with a change , stoiber chose to stay where he felt safest .
some of stoiber 's csu members in bavaria were less than happy at the prospect of their prime minister returning to concentrate on regional matters .
csu state parliament representative sebastian von rotenhan told reporters that stoiber 's u-turn in berlin had caused the csu " irreparable damage " and had lost the party " enormous amounts of respect . "
he added that he thought stoiber 's days as bavarian state premier were numbered . " it is time for a change , " rotenhan said . fellow csu member martin neumeyer also criticized stoiber 's decision and its knock-on effects . " these scars will remain , " he said in an interview with dpa .
" one thing is clear ; the damage will remain with us for some time . " " edmund stoiber was an obstruction in berlin , " said georg milbradt , cdu state premier of saxony , in der spiegel , adding that stoiber 's combative and opinionated approach was only adding to the troubles surrounding the coalition talks . fdp head like n s stoiber to rebel lafo n tai n e bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guido westerwelle -lrb- left -rrb- will now be in opposition to merkel and stoiber .
guido westerwelle , the leader of the opposition free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- which was originally aligned with the cdu / csu in the election campaign , compared stoiber to former social democrat rebel and current left party co-leader , oskar lafontaine . " in terms of escaping his responsibility , edmund stoiber is on a par with lafontaine , " the fdp leader told the westfale n blatt newspaper .
" such an escape from a position of responsibility , a state of office , i would find impossible to imagine had i not seen it . " the german media was also scathing in its reporting of stoiber 's decision .
the mass circulation tabloid bild called stoiber an " eternal ditherer " and said that he had " chickened out " of his responsibility and had fled to the safety of his home state leaving berlin and germany in chaos while " waving the white flag . " the bavarian state premier 's character was further assassinated by the business daily ha n delsblatt which accused stoiber of lacking any sense of duty , loyalty and reliability . " even with the best of intentions it 's impossible to find these qualities in stoiber 's behavior , " the paper wrote .
" it is astonishing that the csu obediently puts up with his actions . " " this is the end of the stoiber era - he gave the csu back its self-confidence and now he 's ruining it , " cried the süddeutsche zeitu n g which went on to describe stoiber as " a faltering figure , a spirit who does n't know what he wants . " csu to discuss stoiber 's style bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber 's approach is a concern for those who fear he may become a critic .
back in berlin , the conservative bloc hierarchy were looking into ways of limiting the damage of stoiber 's desertion and pre-empting any unwanted criticism he may be inclined to direct at the cdu .
the meeting was also likely to address stoiber 's style of politics and promotion ; a style that has alienated many party members and voters alike . in recent days , stoiber has made it clear that he has been extremely unhappy with the shape of the economics ministry he was supposed to head in a grand coalition .
the bavarian leader has openly complained that he wanted more portfolios for his super-ministry than just the research and education ministries he was granted by cdu leader angela merkel . fears bavaria n pm may rock coalitio n boat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber and merkel have had a strained relationship for some time .
as a result , the relationship between the two had soured in recent weeks , dredging up many feelings stoiber may have had about being passed over in favor of merkel after his unsuccessful 2002 election campaign .
some conservative leaders now fear that stoiber - once back in munich - might torpedo grand coalition talks with unqualified and unsolicited comments . but christian democrat senior member wolfgang bosbach ruled out such a scenario .
" any fears that edmund stoiber would cause berlin trouble as state premier in munich are unfounded , " bosbach told reporters .
" he remains in favor of a grand coalition just like those at the negotiating table . " despite this gloss , there is a fear among many in conservative circles that if stoiber is going down , he may want to take as many of his rivals with him .

the cheapest of those still available will set supporters back some 1,900 euros -lrb- $ 2,281 -rrb- plus sales tax .
this pricey package will allow the extravagant fan to attend three first round games .
but that ’ s just the bottom of a sliding scale that reaches an incredible 336,000 euros -lrb- $ 403,300 -rrb- for a 20-person box at all six matches in berlin 's olympic stadium , including the final . while tickets through the regular channel on the official world cup website have been snapped up , the 346,950 tickets held by swiss-based company ise-hospitality have not sold half as well , mainly because of the prices . only half of hospitality packages sold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oli kahn will be there ... but will you ?
the company told reuters that approximately half of the hospitality packages have yet to be sold , in contrast to the first offering of 812,000 tickets from the world cup organizers which was oversubscribed by 10 to one .
the next phase of 300,000 tickets , which go up for grabs after the group draw in december , is expected to generate even more of a mad scramble . with tickets ranging from 35 euros for the lowest category seats at opening round games to 600 euros for the most expensive seats at the final , with relatively modest price points along the way , it is unsurprising that more fans are tempted by the regular offers . " the german market is of course challenging , but we are certain we will sell out , " ise hospitality 's deputy ceo andreas hacker said . hacker and ise hospitality are obviously hoping that business clients who are looking to use the event as a way of entertaining potential clients will eventually see the " speculate to accumulate " factor in the expensive packages . fans with cash also in with a chance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all this plus champagne and caviar .
with food , drink , parking and special stadium access included , the tickets are specifically geared towards corporate buyers .
however hacker was keen to stress that affluent supporters should not be put off from applying for the tickets . " the reasons behind purchases so far have been clear , " he said .
" no other event can offer anything like the opportunities for networking and entertaining at the world cup . " the problem may be that the tickets for the main events , like the knock-out stages and particularly the semi-finals and final , may sell out fast , leaving many of the other games undersold . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans will need to beg for a long time to buy a top price ticket .
the world cup organizing committee has made it clear that any unsold hospitality packages would be taken back and made available to fans but ise hospitality are confident that this wo n't be necessary . " it 's obvious that companies and individuals will have an interest in certain matches more than others , " hacker said .
" but all of the matches will have an amazing atmosphere . " " it 's the world cup .

" in that sense , we will check the accuracy of those reports .. then further define our stance . " he added that such prisons would go against the eu human rights charter and the international convention against torture , which all 25 eu members are obligated to abide . the washington post reported this week that the prisons are , or have been , located in eight countries including thailand , afghanistan and " several democracies in eastern europe " since the system was set up after the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks . the names of the eastern european countries were withheld by the post " at the request of senior us officials , " who argued that the disclosure might disrupt counterterrorism efforts .
thailand denied there was a prison there . meanwhile , the czech republic , slovakia , bulgaria , hungary have denied the presence of prisons .
poland refuses to comment and us-based ngo human rights watch has pointed to poland and romania as the most likeliest sites .
both countries , of which only poland is an eu member , have strong us ties and support the iraq war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the white house wo n't confirm or deny the existence of the prisons no confirmation , no denial white house officials refused to confirm the presence of secret prisons around the world , including one in an unnamed eastern european democracy - but they did n't deny it either . instead , president george w. bush 's national security adviser , stephen hadley , said the united states will do what is necessary to fight and win the war on terrorism . " the president has been very clear we 're doing that in a way that is consistent with our values and that is why he 's been very clear that the united states will not torture , " hadley told reporters .
" the united states will conduct its activities in compliance with law , -lrb- and -rrb- international obligations . " hadley and white house spokesman scott mcclellan refused to confirm or deny the post report .
" i would say that the president 's most important responsibility is to protect the american people , " mcclellan told reporters . the refusal to discuss the matter was echoed by us attorney general alberto gonzales and the central intelligence agency .
but former us president jimmy carter denounced what he said was " a profound and radical change in the basic policies or moral values of our country " in reaction to the report . " this is just one indication of what has been done under this administration to change the policies that have persisted all the way through our history , " said carter , who championed human rights during his 1977-1981 term as president . " gulag of our times " the existence of secret cia detention centers has long been claimed .
amnesty international denounced an " archipelago " of prisons in june as a " gulag of our times . " but the report that eastern european countries were among the locations is new . czech interior minister frantisek bublan was quoted by the online news outlet aktualne.cz as saying that the czech republic recently turned down a us request to set up a detention center on its territory . " the negotiations took place around a month ago , " he was quoted as saying .
the americans " made an effort to install something of the sort here , but they did not succeed . " separately , hungary 's intelligence chief , andras toth , said budapest had not been approached , telling afp that " the mere suggestion of this is absurd . " about 100 prisoners the cia has sent more than 100 suspects to the hidden global internment network , the post said , indicating that the number was a rough estimate and did not include prisoners picked up from iraq . about 30 of the detainees , considered major terrorism suspects , have been held at " black sites " organized by the cia in eastern europe and elsewhere , it said . locations in thailand and at guantanamo bay , cuba were closed in 2003 and 2004 , the paper said .
another in afghanistan known as the " salt pit " was moved inside bagram air base . over 70 other detainees - with less direct involvement in alleged terrorism and having limited intelligence value - have been delivered to intelligence services in egypt , jordan , morocco , afghanistan and other countries , the daily added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : isolation cells at the us prison in guantanamo bay , cuba the post said virtually nothing is known about who is kept in the secret facilities , what interrogation methods are employed , or how decisions are made about whether they should be detained or for how long . the covert prison system is " known only to a handful of officials in the united states and , usually , only to the president and a few top intelligence officers in each host country , " it said . the system has been increasingly debated within the cia where some consider it unsustainable and a diversion from its main espionage mission , the report said . the idea of holding suspects outside the us , where it is illegal to hold people in isolation and in secret prisons , was not under consideration before september 11 , former government officials told the paper . " the issue of detaining and interrogating people was never , ever discussed , " said one former senior cia intelligence officer .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.11.2005 germany reaches out to africa großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trying to help more effectively german president horst köhler and other german officials meet with african leaders , writers and ngos later this week in bonn to refocus attention on helping some of the world ’ s poorest people . it is n't an appeal for more development aid .
it is n't about tightening border controls or reducing export duties or even debt forgiveness .
the meetings in bonn , scheduled for nov .
5 and 6 , aim to do something more basic : focus attention on the need to strengthen relations between africa and wealthier nations , namely germany and other members of the european union , through the " partnership for africa " initiative .
" in the north-south dialogue both sides are still far too prone to talk not with but past each other and that , i believe , is one of the reasons why progress here has been so halting and slow , " german president horst köhler , a former director of the washington-based international monetary fund , told the german weekly die zeit .
" if self-sustained development in africa does not take off the results in terms of migration , disease and environmental problems will catch up with us - whether we like it or not . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler wants to improve ties köhler will be joined by south african presdient thabo mbeki , nigerian president olusegun obasanjo , ethiopian prime minister meles zenawi , nobel prize-winner wole soyinka , and other african and german development officials , parliamentarians and entrepreneurs .
topping the agenda is how to increase political , economic and social contact between the continents and listening to each other .
" the point of the whole exercise is not to reaffirm what we think we know , for good or ill , " köhler said .
" what i am hoping for is to bring together a core of people keen to work with me on these issues over the next few years .
i hope this will be an exercise in building trust . "
building cooperation the statistics are grim : in sierra leone , three out of 10 children die before the age of five .
in niger , only 17 percent of the population can read .
in mali , half of all children under the age of 14 work .
and the average ethiopian does not have access to clean water and lives on about 70 euros -lrb- $ 84 -rrb- a year . in the past decade , development aid , debt relief , and economic growth in sub-saharan africa have risen but " reducing poverty remains a challenge , " according to the world bank 's annual report on africa .

it is n't about tightening border controls or reducing export duties or even debt forgiveness .
the meetings in bonn , scheduled for nov .
5 and 6 , aim to do something more basic : focus attention on the need to strengthen relations between africa and wealthier nations , namely germany and other members of the european union , through the " partnership for africa " initiative .
" in the north-south dialogue both sides are still far too prone to talk not with but past each other and that , i believe , is one of the reasons why progress here has been so halting and slow , " german president horst köhler , a former director of the washington-based international monetary fund , told the german weekly die zeit .
" if self-sustained development in africa does not take off the results in terms of migration , disease and environmental problems will catch up with us - whether we like it or not . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler wants to improve ties köhler will be joined by south african presdient thabo mbeki , nigerian president olusegun obasanjo , ethiopian prime minister meles zenawi , nobel prize-winner wole soyinka , and other african and german development officials , parliamentarians and entrepreneurs .
topping the agenda is how to increase political , economic and social contact between the continents and listening to each other .
" the point of the whole exercise is not to reaffirm what we think we know , for good or ill , " köhler said .
" what i am hoping for is to bring together a core of people keen to work with me on these issues over the next few years .
i hope this will be an exercise in building trust . "
building cooperation the statistics are grim : in sierra leone , three out of 10 children die before the age of five .
in niger , only 17 percent of the population can read .
in mali , half of all children under the age of 14 work .
and the average ethiopian does not have access to clean water and lives on about 70 euros -lrb- $ 84 -rrb- a year . in the past decade , development aid , debt relief , and economic growth in sub-saharan africa have risen but " reducing poverty remains a challenge , " according to the world bank 's annual report on africa .
but despite progress , the rapid spread of hiv , insufficient aid and investment flows , weak commodity prices and a lack of trade opportunities could reverse gains .
as a result , the international development community has dubbed 2005 the " year of africa " to call attention to the continent ’ s needs .
they say that with the increased focus on africa 's problems at the g8 summit in july , the un summit in september on the so-called " millennium goals " and the wto meeting in december , africa could have a reach chance to get back on track .

others say he lacks experience . regardless , it seems that michael glos , a senior official of the conservative christian social union , will be the next german economics minister in the incoming grand coalition government , replacing csu party head edmund stoiber who backed away from the job after a shakeup in the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- this week . " i proposed to angela merkel that michael glos take the position and she agreed , " stoiber told reporters earlier this week .

" he remains in favor of a grand coalition just like those at the negotiating table . " despite this gloss , there is a fear among many in conservative circles that if stoiber is going down , he may want to take as many of his rivals with him .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports report -pipe- 03.11.2005 champions league : juventus punish bayern 's mistakes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern munich 's french soccer player valerien ismael , right , and juventus turin 's swedish soccer player zlatan ibrahimovic bayern must wait for chance of winning group stage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juventus logo goup a leaders bayern munich traveled to turin on wednesday , hoping for a repeat performance against juventus two weeks ago .
a win would have given them a good chance of winning their group .
but the pressure ’ s on bremen .
it was really their last chance to make it through to the quarter-finals , so a win against udinese was obligatory .
bayern ’ s coach felix magath threw down the gauntlet before the match against juventus .
“ we will play aggressively up front .
there ’ s no reason why we shouldn ’ t win the second match against juve ” , he said .
fighting talk from the bundesliga champions .
victory would have been bayern ’ s first win in italy for 17 years .
but the 2-1 defeat means it ’ s now wide open in group a with two more games to play .
bayern will now have to win those games to avoid confronting big clubs like barcelona and chelseas early in the knockout stage .
despite their optimism going into the game , worries remain about bayern munich ’ s offensive play .
dutch international roy makaay ’ s definetely below his usual goalscoring form and paraguayan interational rocqe sant kruz is sidelined for the next six months with a nasty ligament injury .
makaay did had a good chance of ending his goal drought in the 12 minute , his shot just wide of the juventus goal .
but he was booed off the field , subsitituted 5 minutes before the final whistle , having gone more than a thousand minutes without scoring .
but magath insists there are enough players who can score goals – namely ballack , zé roberto , lucio and deisler .
juventus took the lead early in the second half with a goal by treseguet , taking full advantage of a goalscoring opportunity .
the reward for piling on the pressure .
bayern ’ s sebastian deisler pulled one back - from 37 metres .
but tresequet hit the target a second time , sealing the victory for the home side .
bayern punished for two mistakes in defence .
meanwhile werder bremen were counting on miroslav klose and ivan klasnic to show udinese why they are the bundesliga 's top goalscoring duo on wednesday night .
but klasnic missed the game , suffering from a bout of appendicitis .
bremen ’ s champion 's league form has been less than convincing so far , leaving them bottom of group c. the northern german side knew only a win would against udinese would give them a chance of making it to the last 16 teams in the quarter finals .
goals by miroslav klose in the 15th minute and thomas baumann in the 24th gave bremen a helping hand .
but in the second half it was the same old story .
within the space of 5 minutes they gave away a 3-nil lead .
what looked like a sure win turned into a nailbiting affair .
bremen clinched the win 4-3 , but were lucky to come away with a victory .
in the dying minutes of the match bremen ’ s nanado elbowed the italian striker – but the referee seemed paralysed and did not award a penalty to udinese .
so a high-scoring match in bremen ’ s weser stadium , but will it be enough to revive their champions league aspirations ?
bremen are now on four points , level with udinese and panathinaikos , but face a tough trip to group c leaders barcelona for their next match on november 22 . in other matches played on wednesday bruges 3 rapid vienna 2 barcelona 5 panathinaikos athens 0 arsenal 3 prague 0 thun 2 amsterdam 4 lille 0 manchester united 1 benfica lisbon 0 villareal 1 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke 's kevin kuranyi , center , celebrates with teammates after scoring during champions league group e soccer match between schalke 04 and fenerbahce istanbul at the gelsenkirchen soccer stadium , tuesday nov 1,2005 . schalke's champions league dream lives on after beating turkish side fenerbahce istanbul 2-0 on tuesday night in the packed arena aufschalke .
managing director rudi assauer has invested millions in his squad and had high expectations before the game and will have been a relieved man after the final whistle .
in spite of winning schalke once more showed their two faces .
the bundesliga club took the lead through their centre forward kevin kuranyi who rose well to put a powerful header into the net inspite of being marked by two defenders .
a fine strikers goal . minutes later the turkish side were down to 10 men after fabio brought down lincoln . half-time score 1-0 to schalke .
minutes into the second half the turkish side lost yet another player after the referee very harshly sent off aurelio for a foul on kuranyi .
so , fenerbahce down to nine men . surprisingly after their good first half schalke began to struggle in front of their vociferous fans .
the turkish side were well organised at the back by ghanian captain steven appiah . nicolas anelka , fenerbahce's lone striker had a great chance to equalise but missed .
minutes before the end danish striker ebbe sand made it 2:0 for schalke and relieved the tension for assauer and his side .

bayern will now have to win those games to avoid confronting big clubs like barcelona and chelseas early in the knockout stage .
despite their optimism going into the game , worries remain about bayern munich ’ s offensive play .
dutch international roy makaay ’ s definetely below his usual goalscoring form and paraguayan interational rocqe sant kruz is sidelined for the next six months with a nasty ligament injury .

despite their optimism going into the game , worries remain about bayern munich ’ s offensive play .
dutch international roy makaay ’ s definetely below his usual goalscoring form and paraguayan interational rocqe sant kruz is sidelined for the next six months with a nasty ligament injury .

a win would have given them a good chance of winning their group .
but the pressure ’ s on bremen .
it was really their last chance to make it through to the quarter-finals , so a win against udinese was obligatory .
bayern ’ s coach felix magath threw down the gauntlet before the match against juventus .
“ we will play aggressively up front .
there ’ s no reason why we shouldn ’ t win the second match against juve ” , he said .
fighting talk from the bundesliga champions .
victory would have been bayern ’ s first win in italy for 17 years .
but the 2-1 defeat means it ’ s now wide open in group a with two more games to play .
bayern will now have to win those games to avoid confronting big clubs like barcelona and chelseas early in the knockout stage .
despite their optimism going into the game , worries remain about bayern munich ’ s offensive play .
dutch international roy makaay ’ s definetely below his usual goalscoring form and paraguayan interational rocqe sant kruz is sidelined for the next six months with a nasty ligament injury .
makaay did had a good chance of ending his goal drought in the 12 minute , his shot just wide of the juventus goal .
but he was booed off the field , subsitituted 5 minutes before the final whistle , having gone more than a thousand minutes without scoring .
but magath insists there are enough players who can score goals – namely ballack , zé roberto , lucio and deisler .
juventus took the lead early in the second half with a goal by treseguet , taking full advantage of a goalscoring opportunity .
the reward for piling on the pressure .
bayern ’ s sebastian deisler pulled one back - from 37 metres .
but tresequet hit the target a second time , sealing the victory for the home side .
bayern punished for two mistakes in defence .
meanwhile werder bremen were counting on miroslav klose and ivan klasnic to show udinese why they are the bundesliga 's top goalscoring duo on wednesday night .
but klasnic missed the game , suffering from a bout of appendicitis .
bremen ’ s champion 's league form has been less than convincing so far , leaving them bottom of group c. the northern german side knew only a win would against udinese would give them a chance of making it to the last 16 teams in the quarter finals .
goals by miroslav klose in the 15th minute and thomas baumann in the 24th gave bremen a helping hand .
but in the second half it was the same old story .
within the space of 5 minutes they gave away a 3-nil lead .
what looked like a sure win turned into a nailbiting affair .
bremen clinched the win 4-3 , but were lucky to come away with a victory .
in the dying minutes of the match bremen ’ s nanado elbowed the italian striker – but the referee seemed paralysed and did not award a penalty to udinese .
so a high-scoring match in bremen ’ s weser stadium , but will it be enough to revive their champions league aspirations ?
bremen are now on four points , level with udinese and panathinaikos , but face a tough trip to group c leaders barcelona for their next match on november 22 . in other matches played on wednesday bruges 3 rapid vienna 2 barcelona 5 panathinaikos athens 0 arsenal 3 prague 0 thun 2 amsterdam 4 lille 0 manchester united 1 benfica lisbon 0 villareal 1 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke 's kevin kuranyi , center , celebrates with teammates after scoring during champions league group e soccer match between schalke 04 and fenerbahce istanbul at the gelsenkirchen soccer stadium , tuesday nov 1,2005 . schalke's champions league dream lives on after beating turkish side fenerbahce istanbul 2-0 on tuesday night in the packed arena aufschalke .
managing director rudi assauer has invested millions in his squad and had high expectations before the game and will have been a relieved man after the final whistle .
in spite of winning schalke once more showed their two faces .
the bundesliga club took the lead through their centre forward kevin kuranyi who rose well to put a powerful header into the net inspite of being marked by two defenders .
a fine strikers goal . minutes later the turkish side were down to 10 men after fabio brought down lincoln . half-time score 1-0 to schalke .
minutes into the second half the turkish side lost yet another player after the referee very harshly sent off aurelio for a foul on kuranyi .
so , fenerbahce down to nine men . surprisingly after their good first half schalke began to struggle in front of their vociferous fans .
the turkish side were well organised at the back by ghanian captain steven appiah . nicolas anelka , fenerbahce's lone striker had a great chance to equalise but missed .
minutes before the end danish striker ebbe sand made it 2:0 for schalke and relieved the tension for assauer and his side .

struthof was located in the town of natzwiller in the eastern french region of alsace , which was annexed by germany during the war . some 22,000 men and women perished at the camp between may 1941 and november 1944 , when it was liberated by us forces .
most of the victims were members of the resistance and political deportees . a simple design barely visible from the outside , the memorial center is built around a vast underground potato shed , dug out by camp laborers from 1943 to 1945 and only unearthed when construction work began at the site two years ago . " in line with the wishes of survivors , it was designed as a simple , square building intended to convey information and emotion , not as a flashy structure " said the center 's director valerie drechsler . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conveying information and emotion without being ostentatious visitors are first taken on an interactive tour of the 14 nazi concentration camps set up in europe during the war , including auschwitz in poland , bergen-belsen in germany and mauthausen in austria . further inside , film clips shot under cover inside the struthof camp are projected alongside nazi propaganda footage , while a poem written by a deportee echoes in three languages around the dimly-lit underground chamber . documenting horror hundreds of press cuttings , drawings and witness accounts - original material as well as documents from museums and image banks - retrace the rise of fascism in the 1920s , as well as the growth of resistance movements in france and elsewhere in europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : struthof prisoners were supposed to disappear without a trace emerging from the center back into the light , the visitor finds himself in front of the gates of struthof . french architect pierre-louis faloci intended the play on light and shadow to be a reference to adolf hitler 's 1941 decree " nacht und nebel " -lrb- night and fog -rrb- , which led to the disappearance of countless political prisoners .
the detainees at struthof were known as " night-and-fog " prisoners : they were supposed to be swallowed by the dark and vanish without a trace . the european center for deported resistance fighters was mainly financed by the french defense ministry , with the remaining one-fifth provided by european union subsidies . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de köhler seeks to soothe wwii controversy at the start of a visit to poland tuesday , german president köhler spoke about a controversial center against war-time expulsions to be built in berlin - an issue that has offended historical sensitivities in poland .

11 , 2001 attacks . the names of the eastern european countries were withheld by the post " at the request of senior us officials , " who argued that the disclosure might disrupt counterterrorism efforts .

" i would say that the president 's most important responsibility is to protect the american people , " mcclellan told reporters . the refusal to discuss the matter was echoed by us attorney general alberto gonzales and the central intelligence agency .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 03.11.2005 us has secret cia prisons in eastern europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us is under scrutiny for its interrogation methods the eu will examine whether the cia operates secret prisons , known as " black sites " for al qaeda suspects in eastern europe and elsewhere around the world . the eu commision will review whether the cia operates secret prisons in eastern europe , noting that such facilities would not comply with eu treaties , officials said thursday . the eu executive will " at technical ... level find out what the truth is in these stories , " said friso roscam abbing , spokesman for security and justice affairs .
" in that sense , we will check the accuracy of those reports .. then further define our stance . " he added that such prisons would go against the eu human rights charter and the international convention against torture , which all 25 eu members are obligated to abide . the washington post reported this week that the prisons are , or have been , located in eight countries including thailand , afghanistan and " several democracies in eastern europe " since the system was set up after the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks . the names of the eastern european countries were withheld by the post " at the request of senior us officials , " who argued that the disclosure might disrupt counterterrorism efforts .
thailand denied there was a prison there . meanwhile , the czech republic , slovakia , bulgaria , hungary have denied the presence of prisons .
poland refuses to comment and us-based ngo human rights watch has pointed to poland and romania as the most likeliest sites .
both countries , of which only poland is an eu member , have strong us ties and support the iraq war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the white house wo n't confirm or deny the existence of the prisons no confirmation , no denial white house officials refused to confirm the presence of secret prisons around the world , including one in an unnamed eastern european democracy - but they did n't deny it either . instead , president george w. bush 's national security adviser , stephen hadley , said the united states will do what is necessary to fight and win the war on terrorism . " the president has been very clear we 're doing that in a way that is consistent with our values and that is why he 's been very clear that the united states will not torture , " hadley told reporters .
" the united states will conduct its activities in compliance with law , -lrb- and -rrb- international obligations . " hadley and white house spokesman scott mcclellan refused to confirm or deny the post report .
" i would say that the president 's most important responsibility is to protect the american people , " mcclellan told reporters . the refusal to discuss the matter was echoed by us attorney general alberto gonzales and the central intelligence agency .
but former us president jimmy carter denounced what he said was " a profound and radical change in the basic policies or moral values of our country " in reaction to the report . " this is just one indication of what has been done under this administration to change the policies that have persisted all the way through our history , " said carter , who championed human rights during his 1977-1981 term as president . " gulag of our times " the existence of secret cia detention centers has long been claimed .
amnesty international denounced an " archipelago " of prisons in june as a " gulag of our times . " but the report that eastern european countries were among the locations is new . czech interior minister frantisek bublan was quoted by the online news outlet aktualne.cz as saying that the czech republic recently turned down a us request to set up a detention center on its territory . " the negotiations took place around a month ago , " he was quoted as saying .
the americans " made an effort to install something of the sort here , but they did not succeed . " separately , hungary 's intelligence chief , andras toth , said budapest had not been approached , telling afp that " the mere suggestion of this is absurd . " about 100 prisoners the cia has sent more than 100 suspects to the hidden global internment network , the post said , indicating that the number was a rough estimate and did not include prisoners picked up from iraq . about 30 of the detainees , considered major terrorism suspects , have been held at " black sites " organized by the cia in eastern europe and elsewhere , it said . locations in thailand and at guantanamo bay , cuba were closed in 2003 and 2004 , the paper said .
another in afghanistan known as the " salt pit " was moved inside bagram air base . over 70 other detainees - with less direct involvement in alleged terrorism and having limited intelligence value - have been delivered to intelligence services in egypt , jordan , morocco , afghanistan and other countries , the daily added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : isolation cells at the us prison in guantanamo bay , cuba the post said virtually nothing is known about who is kept in the secret facilities , what interrogation methods are employed , or how decisions are made about whether they should be detained or for how long . the covert prison system is " known only to a handful of officials in the united states and , usually , only to the president and a few top intelligence officers in each host country , " it said . the system has been increasingly debated within the cia where some consider it unsustainable and a diversion from its main espionage mission , the report said . the idea of holding suspects outside the us , where it is illegal to hold people in isolation and in secret prisons , was not under consideration before september 11 , former government officials told the paper . " the issue of detaining and interrogating people was never , ever discussed , " said one former senior cia intelligence officer .
" it was against the culture and they believed information was best gleaned by other means .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 03.11.2005 new economics minister receives mixed reaction großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some applaud the choice , others are skeptical the nomination of michael glos , a senior csu official , as germany 's new economics minister is drawing praise and criticism from the business community . some are calling him a friend of business .
others say he lacks experience . regardless , it seems that michael glos , a senior official of the conservative christian social union , will be the next german economics minister in the incoming grand coalition government , replacing csu party head edmund stoiber who backed away from the job after a shakeup in the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- this week . " i proposed to angela merkel that michael glos take the position and she agreed , " stoiber told reporters earlier this week . ' ' friend of business " the german chamber of commerce , employer and trade associations have welcomed the appointment , saying that glos has proved he is a friend of business . " when he was younger , he successfully led his family business , " otto kentzler , president of the german confederation of skilled crafts -lrb- zdh -rrb- told the berliner zeitung .
" and in his almost 30 years in the german parliament , he has built a strong and trustworthy relationship with the business community . " but others in that community are more skeptical , saying that germany needs an experienced economics minister to cope with the country 's structural problems . " i know that mr. glos is a good organizer and very experienced politician , " anton börner , the president of the federation of german wholesale and foreign trade -lrb- bga -rrb- , told the berliner zeitung .
" but at the present time , i am not able to say anything about his competence in economic affairs . " the economics minister has to play in an entirely different league than the one glos is used to in bavaria , börner said . " we need a strong economics minister , " he said , adding that if glos does n't learn how to play according to international rules , he 'll have a difficult time in his new office . following stoiber bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both stoiber and müntefering have stepped back from cabinet posts after the resignation of franz müntefering as spd chief on monday , stoiber decided to withdraw from incoming chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet , saying that he believed he could be more useful to his party in munich .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup 2006 -pipe- 03.11.2005 germany welcomes the wealthy world großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : that suitcase better be full of money the 2006 world cup may be billed as a tournament for everyone but it seems that those who have very healthy bank accounts will get the best seats when the global soccer spectacle kicks off in june next year . while thousands of fans bite their nails to the quick waiting for news of their ticket applications as the allocation rounds get fewer and further between , it has been revealed that there are still around 150,000 of the best seats , including those at the final , available to the public . but there is unlikely to be a stampede for these golden tickets .
the cheapest of those still available will set supporters back some 1,900 euros -lrb- $ 2,281 -rrb- plus sales tax .
this pricey package will allow the extravagant fan to attend three first round games .
but that ’ s just the bottom of a sliding scale that reaches an incredible 336,000 euros -lrb- $ 403,300 -rrb- for a 20-person box at all six matches in berlin 's olympic stadium , including the final . while tickets through the regular channel on the official world cup website have been snapped up , the 346,950 tickets held by swiss-based company ise-hospitality have not sold half as well , mainly because of the prices . only half of hospitality packages sold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oli kahn will be there ... but will you ?
the company told reuters that approximately half of the hospitality packages have yet to be sold , in contrast to the first offering of 812,000 tickets from the world cup organizers which was oversubscribed by 10 to one .
the next phase of 300,000 tickets , which go up for grabs after the group draw in december , is expected to generate even more of a mad scramble . with tickets ranging from 35 euros for the lowest category seats at opening round games to 600 euros for the most expensive seats at the final , with relatively modest price points along the way , it is unsurprising that more fans are tempted by the regular offers . " the german market is of course challenging , but we are certain we will sell out , " ise hospitality 's deputy ceo andreas hacker said . hacker and ise hospitality are obviously hoping that business clients who are looking to use the event as a way of entertaining potential clients will eventually see the " speculate to accumulate " factor in the expensive packages . fans with cash also in with a chance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all this plus champagne and caviar .
with food , drink , parking and special stadium access included , the tickets are specifically geared towards corporate buyers .
however hacker was keen to stress that affluent supporters should not be put off from applying for the tickets . " the reasons behind purchases so far have been clear , " he said .
" no other event can offer anything like the opportunities for networking and entertaining at the world cup . " the problem may be that the tickets for the main events , like the knock-out stages and particularly the semi-finals and final , may sell out fast , leaving many of the other games undersold . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans will need to beg for a long time to buy a top price ticket .
the world cup organizing committee has made it clear that any unsold hospitality packages would be taken back and made available to fans but ise hospitality are confident that this wo n't be necessary . " it 's obvious that companies and individuals will have an interest in certain matches more than others , " hacker said .
" but all of the matches will have an amazing atmosphere . " " it 's the world cup .
at the end of the year , the worst thing would be to say you were n't even there .

the cheapest of those still available will set supporters back some 1,900 euros -lrb- $ 2,281 -rrb- plus sales tax .
this pricey package will allow the extravagant fan to attend three first round games .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports report -pipe- 03.11.2005 champions league : juventus punish bayern 's mistakes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern munich 's french soccer player valerien ismael , right , and juventus turin 's swedish soccer player zlatan ibrahimovic bayern must wait for chance of winning group stage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juventus logo goup a leaders bayern munich traveled to turin on wednesday , hoping for a repeat performance against juventus two weeks ago .
a win would have given them a good chance of winning their group .
but the pressure ’ s on bremen .
it was really their last chance to make it through to the quarter-finals , so a win against udinese was obligatory .
bayern ’ s coach felix magath threw down the gauntlet before the match against juventus .
“ we will play aggressively up front .
there ’ s no reason why we shouldn ’ t win the second match against juve ” , he said .
fighting talk from the bundesliga champions .
victory would have been bayern ’ s first win in italy for 17 years .
but the 2-1 defeat means it ’ s now wide open in group a with two more games to play .
bayern will now have to win those games to avoid confronting big clubs like barcelona and chelseas early in the knockout stage .
despite their optimism going into the game , worries remain about bayern munich ’ s offensive play .
dutch international roy makaay ’ s definetely below his usual goalscoring form and paraguayan interational rocqe sant kruz is sidelined for the next six months with a nasty ligament injury .
makaay did had a good chance of ending his goal drought in the 12 minute , his shot just wide of the juventus goal .
but he was booed off the field , subsitituted 5 minutes before the final whistle , having gone more than a thousand minutes without scoring .
but magath insists there are enough players who can score goals – namely ballack , zé roberto , lucio and deisler .
juventus took the lead early in the second half with a goal by treseguet , taking full advantage of a goalscoring opportunity .
the reward for piling on the pressure .
bayern ’ s sebastian deisler pulled one back - from 37 metres .
but tresequet hit the target a second time , sealing the victory for the home side .
bayern punished for two mistakes in defence .
meanwhile werder bremen were counting on miroslav klose and ivan klasnic to show udinese why they are the bundesliga 's top goalscoring duo on wednesday night .
but klasnic missed the game , suffering from a bout of appendicitis .
bremen ’ s champion 's league form has been less than convincing so far , leaving them bottom of group c. the northern german side knew only a win would against udinese would give them a chance of making it to the last 16 teams in the quarter finals .
goals by miroslav klose in the 15th minute and thomas baumann in the 24th gave bremen a helping hand .
but in the second half it was the same old story .
within the space of 5 minutes they gave away a 3-nil lead .
what looked like a sure win turned into a nailbiting affair .
bremen clinched the win 4-3 , but were lucky to come away with a victory .

a win would have given them a good chance of winning their group .
but the pressure ’ s on bremen .
it was really their last chance to make it through to the quarter-finals , so a win against udinese was obligatory .
bayern ’ s coach felix magath threw down the gauntlet before the match against juventus .
“ we will play aggressively up front .
there ’ s no reason why we shouldn ’ t win the second match against juve ” , he said .
fighting talk from the bundesliga champions .
victory would have been bayern ’ s first win in italy for 17 years .
but the 2-1 defeat means it ’ s now wide open in group a with two more games to play .
bayern will now have to win those games to avoid confronting big clubs like barcelona and chelseas early in the knockout stage .
despite their optimism going into the game , worries remain about bayern munich ’ s offensive play .
dutch international roy makaay ’ s definetely below his usual goalscoring form and paraguayan interational rocqe sant kruz is sidelined for the next six months with a nasty ligament injury .
makaay did had a good chance of ending his goal drought in the 12 minute , his shot just wide of the juventus goal .
but he was booed off the field , subsitituted 5 minutes before the final whistle , having gone more than a thousand minutes without scoring .
but magath insists there are enough players who can score goals – namely ballack , zé roberto , lucio and deisler .
juventus took the lead early in the second half with a goal by treseguet , taking full advantage of a goalscoring opportunity .
the reward for piling on the pressure .
bayern ’ s sebastian deisler pulled one back - from 37 metres .
but tresequet hit the target a second time , sealing the victory for the home side .
bayern punished for two mistakes in defence .
meanwhile werder bremen were counting on miroslav klose and ivan klasnic to show udinese why they are the bundesliga 's top goalscoring duo on wednesday night .
but klasnic missed the game , suffering from a bout of appendicitis .
bremen ’ s champion 's league form has been less than convincing so far , leaving them bottom of group c. the northern german side knew only a win would against udinese would give them a chance of making it to the last 16 teams in the quarter finals .
goals by miroslav klose in the 15th minute and thomas baumann in the 24th gave bremen a helping hand .
but in the second half it was the same old story .
within the space of 5 minutes they gave away a 3-nil lead .
what looked like a sure win turned into a nailbiting affair .
bremen clinched the win 4-3 , but were lucky to come away with a victory .
in the dying minutes of the match bremen ’ s nanado elbowed the italian striker – but the referee seemed paralysed and did not award a penalty to udinese .
so a high-scoring match in bremen ’ s weser stadium , but will it be enough to revive their champions league aspirations ?

the cheapest of those still available will set supporters back some 1,900 euros -lrb- $ 2,281 -rrb- plus sales tax .
this pricey package will allow the extravagant fan to attend three first round games .
but that ’ s just the bottom of a sliding scale that reaches an incredible 336,000 euros -lrb- $ 403,300 -rrb- for a 20-person box at all six matches in berlin 's olympic stadium , including the final . while tickets through the regular channel on the official world cup website have been snapped up , the 346,950 tickets held by swiss-based company ise-hospitality have not sold half as well , mainly because of the prices . only half of hospitality packages sold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oli kahn will be there ... but will you ?
the company told reuters that approximately half of the hospitality packages have yet to be sold , in contrast to the first offering of 812,000 tickets from the world cup organizers which was oversubscribed by 10 to one .
the next phase of 300,000 tickets , which go up for grabs after the group draw in december , is expected to generate even more of a mad scramble . with tickets ranging from 35 euros for the lowest category seats at opening round games to 600 euros for the most expensive seats at the final , with relatively modest price points along the way , it is unsurprising that more fans are tempted by the regular offers . " the german market is of course challenging , but we are certain we will sell out , " ise hospitality 's deputy ceo andreas hacker said . hacker and ise hospitality are obviously hoping that business clients who are looking to use the event as a way of entertaining potential clients will eventually see the " speculate to accumulate " factor in the expensive packages . fans with cash also in with a chance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all this plus champagne and caviar .
with food , drink , parking and special stadium access included , the tickets are specifically geared towards corporate buyers .
however hacker was keen to stress that affluent supporters should not be put off from applying for the tickets . " the reasons behind purchases so far have been clear , " he said .
" no other event can offer anything like the opportunities for networking and entertaining at the world cup . " the problem may be that the tickets for the main events , like the knock-out stages and particularly the semi-finals and final , may sell out fast , leaving many of the other games undersold . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans will need to beg for a long time to buy a top price ticket .
the world cup organizing committee has made it clear that any unsold hospitality packages would be taken back and made available to fans but ise hospitality are confident that this wo n't be necessary . " it 's obvious that companies and individuals will have an interest in certain matches more than others , " hacker said .

the cheapest of those still available will set supporters back some 1,900 euros -lrb- $ 2,281 -rrb- plus sales tax .

but that ’ s just the bottom of a sliding scale that reaches an incredible 336,000 euros -lrb- $ 403,300 -rrb- for a 20-person box at all six matches in berlin 's olympic stadium , including the final . while tickets through the regular channel on the official world cup website have been snapped up , the 346,950 tickets held by swiss-based company ise-hospitality have not sold half as well , mainly because of the prices . only half of hospitality packages sold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oli kahn will be there ... but will you ?
the company told reuters that approximately half of the hospitality packages have yet to be sold , in contrast to the first offering of 812,000 tickets from the world cup organizers which was oversubscribed by 10 to one .
the next phase of 300,000 tickets , which go up for grabs after the group draw in december , is expected to generate even more of a mad scramble . with tickets ranging from 35 euros for the lowest category seats at opening round games to 600 euros for the most expensive seats at the final , with relatively modest price points along the way , it is unsurprising that more fans are tempted by the regular offers . " the german market is of course challenging , but we are certain we will sell out , " ise hospitality 's deputy ceo andreas hacker said . hacker and ise hospitality are obviously hoping that business clients who are looking to use the event as a way of entertaining potential clients will eventually see the " speculate to accumulate " factor in the expensive packages . fans with cash also in with a chance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all this plus champagne and caviar .
with food , drink , parking and special stadium access included , the tickets are specifically geared towards corporate buyers .
however hacker was keen to stress that affluent supporters should not be put off from applying for the tickets . " the reasons behind purchases so far have been clear , " he said .
" no other event can offer anything like the opportunities for networking and entertaining at the world cup . " the problem may be that the tickets for the main events , like the knock-out stages and particularly the semi-finals and final , may sell out fast , leaving many of the other games undersold . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans will need to beg for a long time to buy a top price ticket .
the world cup organizing committee has made it clear that any unsold hospitality packages would be taken back and made available to fans but ise hospitality are confident that this wo n't be necessary . " it 's obvious that companies and individuals will have an interest in certain matches more than others , " hacker said .
" but all of the matches will have an amazing atmosphere . " " it 's the world cup .
at the end of the year , the worst thing would be to say you were n't even there .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports report -pipe- 03.11.2005 champions league : juventus punish bayern 's mistakes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern munich 's french soccer player valerien ismael , right , and juventus turin 's swedish soccer player zlatan ibrahimovic bayern must wait for chance of winning group stage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juventus logo goup a leaders bayern munich traveled to turin on wednesday , hoping for a repeat performance against juventus two weeks ago .
a win would have given them a good chance of winning their group .
but the pressure ’ s on bremen .
it was really their last chance to make it through to the quarter-finals , so a win against udinese was obligatory .
bayern ’ s coach felix magath threw down the gauntlet before the match against juventus .
“ we will play aggressively up front .
there ’ s no reason why we shouldn ’ t win the second match against juve ” , he said .
fighting talk from the bundesliga champions .
victory would have been bayern ’ s first win in italy for 17 years .
but the 2-1 defeat means it ’ s now wide open in group a with two more games to play .
bayern will now have to win those games to avoid confronting big clubs like barcelona and chelseas early in the knockout stage .
despite their optimism going into the game , worries remain about bayern munich ’ s offensive play .
dutch international roy makaay ’ s definetely below his usual goalscoring form and paraguayan interational rocqe sant kruz is sidelined for the next six months with a nasty ligament injury .
makaay did had a good chance of ending his goal drought in the 12 minute , his shot just wide of the juventus goal .
but he was booed off the field , subsitituted 5 minutes before the final whistle , having gone more than a thousand minutes without scoring .
but magath insists there are enough players who can score goals – namely ballack , zé roberto , lucio and deisler .
juventus took the lead early in the second half with a goal by treseguet , taking full advantage of a goalscoring opportunity .
the reward for piling on the pressure .
bayern ’ s sebastian deisler pulled one back - from 37 metres .
but tresequet hit the target a second time , sealing the victory for the home side .
bayern punished for two mistakes in defence .
meanwhile werder bremen were counting on miroslav klose and ivan klasnic to show udinese why they are the bundesliga 's top goalscoring duo on wednesday night .
but klasnic missed the game , suffering from a bout of appendicitis .
bremen ’ s champion 's league form has been less than convincing so far , leaving them bottom of group c. the northern german side knew only a win would against udinese would give them a chance of making it to the last 16 teams in the quarter finals .
goals by miroslav klose in the 15th minute and thomas baumann in the 24th gave bremen a helping hand .
but in the second half it was the same old story .
within the space of 5 minutes they gave away a 3-nil lead .
what looked like a sure win turned into a nailbiting affair .
bremen clinched the win 4-3 , but were lucky to come away with a victory .
in the dying minutes of the match bremen ’ s nanado elbowed the italian striker – but the referee seemed paralysed and did not award a penalty to udinese .
so a high-scoring match in bremen ’ s weser stadium , but will it be enough to revive their champions league aspirations ?

a win would have given them a good chance of winning their group .
but the pressure ’ s on bremen .
it was really their last chance to make it through to the quarter-finals , so a win against udinese was obligatory .
bayern ’ s coach felix magath threw down the gauntlet before the match against juventus .
“ we will play aggressively up front .
there ’ s no reason why we shouldn ’ t win the second match against juve ” , he said .
fighting talk from the bundesliga champions .
victory would have been bayern ’ s first win in italy for 17 years .
but the 2-1 defeat means it ’ s now wide open in group a with two more games to play .
bayern will now have to win those games to avoid confronting big clubs like barcelona and chelseas early in the knockout stage .
despite their optimism going into the game , worries remain about bayern munich ’ s offensive play .
dutch international roy makaay ’ s definetely below his usual goalscoring form and paraguayan interational rocqe sant kruz is sidelined for the next six months with a nasty ligament injury .
makaay did had a good chance of ending his goal drought in the 12 minute , his shot just wide of the juventus goal .
but he was booed off the field , subsitituted 5 minutes before the final whistle , having gone more than a thousand minutes without scoring .
but magath insists there are enough players who can score goals – namely ballack , zé roberto , lucio and deisler .
juventus took the lead early in the second half with a goal by treseguet , taking full advantage of a goalscoring opportunity .
the reward for piling on the pressure .
bayern ’ s sebastian deisler pulled one back - from 37 metres .
but tresequet hit the target a second time , sealing the victory for the home side .
bayern punished for two mistakes in defence .

but klasnic missed the game , suffering from a bout of appendicitis .
bremen ’ s champion 's league form has been less than convincing so far , leaving them bottom of group c. the northern german side knew only a win would against udinese would give them a chance of making it to the last 16 teams in the quarter finals .
goals by miroslav klose in the 15th minute and thomas baumann in the 24th gave bremen a helping hand .
but in the second half it was the same old story .
within the space of 5 minutes they gave away a 3-nil lead .
what looked like a sure win turned into a nailbiting affair .
bremen clinched the win 4-3 , but were lucky to come away with a victory .
in the dying minutes of the match bremen ’ s nanado elbowed the italian striker – but the referee seemed paralysed and did not award a penalty to udinese .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.11.2005 stoiber departs to the sound of sharpening knives großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber risks being exiled and isolated after quitting the cabinet in the midst of all the chaos in berlin , edmund stoiber may have hoped his departure from the cabinet would pass without much comment .
on the contrary , it has prompted harsh criticism and raised doubts over his future . edmund stoiber 's decision to escape the spiraling chaos surrounding the fledgling government in berlin for the safety of his regional fiefdom in munich was being viewed as the last nail in the embryonic grand coalition 's coffin on thursday . but while germany 's politicians vowed to press on with plans to form a government made up of the country 's two largest parties , in some quarters it was stoiber 's political career over which the last rites were being administered . the head of the christian social union , the christian democratic union 's sister party , returned to bavaria after rejecting the cabinet position of economics and technology minister on tuesday during the latest fraught round of coalition discussions between the conservatives and the social democrats . stoiber 's departure left his colleagues to ponder an increasingly difficult situation and prompted many to turn on the man who , for so long , had craved power at the top end of conservative politics only to abandon it . damagi n g beyo n d repair ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when faced with a change , stoiber chose to stay where he felt safest .
some of stoiber 's csu members in bavaria were less than happy at the prospect of their prime minister returning to concentrate on regional matters .
csu state parliament representative sebastian von rotenhan told reporters that stoiber 's u-turn in berlin had caused the csu " irreparable damage " and had lost the party " enormous amounts of respect . "
he added that he thought stoiber 's days as bavarian state premier were numbered . " it is time for a change , " rotenhan said . fellow csu member martin neumeyer also criticized stoiber 's decision and its knock-on effects . " these scars will remain , " he said in an interview with dpa .
" one thing is clear ; the damage will remain with us for some time . " " edmund stoiber was an obstruction in berlin , " said georg milbradt , cdu state premier of saxony , in der spiegel , adding that stoiber 's combative and opinionated approach was only adding to the troubles surrounding the coalition talks . fdp head like n s stoiber to rebel lafo n tai n e bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guido westerwelle -lrb- left -rrb- will now be in opposition to merkel and stoiber .
guido westerwelle , the leader of the opposition free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- which was originally aligned with the cdu / csu in the election campaign , compared stoiber to former social democrat rebel and current left party co-leader , oskar lafontaine . " in terms of escaping his responsibility , edmund stoiber is on a par with lafontaine , " the fdp leader told the westfale n blatt newspaper .
" such an escape from a position of responsibility , a state of office , i would find impossible to imagine had i not seen it . " the german media was also scathing in its reporting of stoiber 's decision .
the mass circulation tabloid bild called stoiber an " eternal ditherer " and said that he had " chickened out " of his responsibility and had fled to the safety of his home state leaving berlin and germany in chaos while " waving the white flag . " the bavarian state premier 's character was further assassinated by the business daily ha n delsblatt which accused stoiber of lacking any sense of duty , loyalty and reliability . " even with the best of intentions it 's impossible to find these qualities in stoiber 's behavior , " the paper wrote .
" it is astonishing that the csu obediently puts up with his actions . " " this is the end of the stoiber era - he gave the csu back its self-confidence and now he 's ruining it , " cried the süddeutsche zeitu n g which went on to describe stoiber as " a faltering figure , a spirit who does n't know what he wants . " csu to discuss stoiber 's style bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber 's approach is a concern for those who fear he may become a critic .
back in berlin , the conservative bloc hierarchy were looking into ways of limiting the damage of stoiber 's desertion and pre-empting any unwanted criticism he may be inclined to direct at the cdu .
the meeting was also likely to address stoiber 's style of politics and promotion ; a style that has alienated many party members and voters alike . in recent days , stoiber has made it clear that he has been extremely unhappy with the shape of the economics ministry he was supposed to head in a grand coalition .
the bavarian leader has openly complained that he wanted more portfolios for his super-ministry than just the research and education ministries he was granted by cdu leader angela merkel . fears bavaria n pm may rock coalitio n boat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber and merkel have had a strained relationship for some time .
as a result , the relationship between the two had soured in recent weeks , dredging up many feelings stoiber may have had about being passed over in favor of merkel after his unsuccessful 2002 election campaign .
some conservative leaders now fear that stoiber - once back in munich - might torpedo grand coalition talks with unqualified and unsolicited comments . but christian democrat senior member wolfgang bosbach ruled out such a scenario .
" any fears that edmund stoiber would cause berlin trouble as state premier in munich are unfounded , " bosbach told reporters .
" he remains in favor of a grand coalition just like those at the negotiating table . " despite this gloss , there is a fear among many in conservative circles that if stoiber is going down , he may want to take as many of his rivals with him .

the cheapest of those still available will set supporters back some 1,900 euros -lrb- $ 2,281 -rrb- plus sales tax .
this pricey package will allow the extravagant fan to attend three first round games .
but that ’ s just the bottom of a sliding scale that reaches an incredible 336,000 euros -lrb- $ 403,300 -rrb- for a 20-person box at all six matches in berlin 's olympic stadium , including the final . while tickets through the regular channel on the official world cup website have been snapped up , the 346,950 tickets held by swiss-based company ise-hospitality have not sold half as well , mainly because of the prices . only half of hospitality packages sold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oli kahn will be there ... but will you ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.11.2005 germany reaches out to africa großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trying to help more effectively german president horst köhler and other german officials meet with african leaders , writers and ngos later this week in bonn to refocus attention on helping some of the world ’ s poorest people . it is n't an appeal for more development aid .
it is n't about tightening border controls or reducing export duties or even debt forgiveness .
the meetings in bonn , scheduled for nov .
5 and 6 , aim to do something more basic : focus attention on the need to strengthen relations between africa and wealthier nations , namely germany and other members of the european union , through the " partnership for africa " initiative .
" in the north-south dialogue both sides are still far too prone to talk not with but past each other and that , i believe , is one of the reasons why progress here has been so halting and slow , " german president horst köhler , a former director of the washington-based international monetary fund , told the german weekly die zeit .
" if self-sustained development in africa does not take off the results in terms of migration , disease and environmental problems will catch up with us - whether we like it or not . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler wants to improve ties köhler will be joined by south african presdient thabo mbeki , nigerian president olusegun obasanjo , ethiopian prime minister meles zenawi , nobel prize-winner wole soyinka , and other african and german development officials , parliamentarians and entrepreneurs .
topping the agenda is how to increase political , economic and social contact between the continents and listening to each other .
" the point of the whole exercise is not to reaffirm what we think we know , for good or ill , " köhler said .
" what i am hoping for is to bring together a core of people keen to work with me on these issues over the next few years .
i hope this will be an exercise in building trust . "
building cooperation the statistics are grim : in sierra leone , three out of 10 children die before the age of five .
in niger , only 17 percent of the population can read .
in mali , half of all children under the age of 14 work .
and the average ethiopian does not have access to clean water and lives on about 70 euros -lrb- $ 84 -rrb- a year . in the past decade , development aid , debt relief , and economic growth in sub-saharan africa have risen but " reducing poverty remains a challenge , " according to the world bank 's annual report on africa .
but despite progress , the rapid spread of hiv , insufficient aid and investment flows , weak commodity prices and a lack of trade opportunities could reverse gains .
as a result , the international development community has dubbed 2005 the " year of africa " to call attention to the continent ’ s needs .
they say that with the increased focus on africa 's problems at the g8 summit in july , the un summit in september on the so-called " millennium goals " and the wto meeting in december , africa could have a reach chance to get back on track .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south african president thabo mbeki is one of the african leaders coming to germany but many , including leading german officials , say that just pouring more funds into the continent won ’ t be effective .
that is essentially why german chancellor gerhard schröder earlier this year opposed an african " marshall plan " proposed by british prime minister tony blair to double financial assistance to africa to total around 40 billion euros .
instead , through the partnership for africa köhler and others want to promote a dialogue , brainstorm new ideas , but most of all , figure out what kind of development assistance africans really want and what will be most effective .
" we do n't know the answers , " said michael göring , head of the hamburg-based zeit foundation , a partner in the initiative .
" what we always hear is how africa is the lost continent .
but what we want to learn is about the success stories , the successful enterprises and ideas - then help multiply them if we can . "
a renaissance over the past few years , there has been a sort of a renaissance in regards to the attention africa has received , according to africa expert denis tull of the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs .
chancellor schröder and foreign minister joschka fischer have visited the region , and there has been more debate in foreign policy circles .
at the eu level , european commission president jose manuel barroso and african union president alpha oumar konare announced a new strategic partnership between africa and europe earlier this month to increase cooperation on development aid .
at the same time , the eu has drafted an africa strategy to increase and better coordinate relations between the two , which is expected to be adopted later this year .
but what can the german and eu initiatives accomplish concretely ?
some doubt anything at all .
most are not sure .
" we have to wait and see , " said tull .
" there has always been a lot of talk about partnerships , but to make a difference they need to be linked to practical policies .
still , at the very least , africa , which is fairly neglected in german politics , is now on the agenda . " jabeen bhatti send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spain , france join forces on immigration spain and france have announced that they will propose a joint plan for a european-african conference on immigration at a european union summit later this month .

" in the north-south dialogue both sides are still far too prone to talk not with but past each other and that , i believe , is one of the reasons why progress here has been so halting and slow , " german president horst köhler , a former director of the washington-based international monetary fund , told the german weekly die zeit .
" if self-sustained development in africa does not take off the results in terms of migration , disease and environmental problems will catch up with us - whether we like it or not . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler wants to improve ties köhler will be joined by south african presdient thabo mbeki , nigerian president olusegun obasanjo , ethiopian prime minister meles zenawi , nobel prize-winner wole soyinka , and other african and german development officials , parliamentarians and entrepreneurs .
topping the agenda is how to increase political , economic and social contact between the continents and listening to each other .
" the point of the whole exercise is not to reaffirm what we think we know , for good or ill , " köhler said .
" what i am hoping for is to bring together a core of people keen to work with me on these issues over the next few years .
i hope this will be an exercise in building trust . "
building cooperation the statistics are grim : in sierra leone , three out of 10 children die before the age of five .
in niger , only 17 percent of the population can read .
in mali , half of all children under the age of 14 work .
and the average ethiopian does not have access to clean water and lives on about 70 euros -lrb- $ 84 -rrb- a year . in the past decade , development aid , debt relief , and economic growth in sub-saharan africa have risen but " reducing poverty remains a challenge , " according to the world bank 's annual report on africa .
but despite progress , the rapid spread of hiv , insufficient aid and investment flows , weak commodity prices and a lack of trade opportunities could reverse gains .
as a result , the international development community has dubbed 2005 the " year of africa " to call attention to the continent ’ s needs .
they say that with the increased focus on africa 's problems at the g8 summit in july , the un summit in september on the so-called " millennium goals " and the wto meeting in december , africa could have a reach chance to get back on track .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south african president thabo mbeki is one of the african leaders coming to germany but many , including leading german officials , say that just pouring more funds into the continent won ’ t be effective .
that is essentially why german chancellor gerhard schröder earlier this year opposed an african " marshall plan " proposed by british prime minister tony blair to double financial assistance to africa to total around 40 billion euros .
instead , through the partnership for africa köhler and others want to promote a dialogue , brainstorm new ideas , but most of all , figure out what kind of development assistance africans really want and what will be most effective .
" we do n't know the answers , " said michael göring , head of the hamburg-based zeit foundation , a partner in the initiative .
" what we always hear is how africa is the lost continent .
but what we want to learn is about the success stories , the successful enterprises and ideas - then help multiply them if we can . "
a renaissance over the past few years , there has been a sort of a renaissance in regards to the attention africa has received , according to africa expert denis tull of the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs .
chancellor schröder and foreign minister joschka fischer have visited the region , and there has been more debate in foreign policy circles .
at the eu level , european commission president jose manuel barroso and african union president alpha oumar konare announced a new strategic partnership between africa and europe earlier this month to increase cooperation on development aid .
at the same time , the eu has drafted an africa strategy to increase and better coordinate relations between the two , which is expected to be adopted later this year .
but what can the german and eu initiatives accomplish concretely ?
some doubt anything at all .
most are not sure .
" we have to wait and see , " said tull .
" there has always been a lot of talk about partnerships , but to make a difference they need to be linked to practical policies .
still , at the very least , africa , which is fairly neglected in german politics , is now on the agenda . " jabeen bhatti send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spain , france join forces on immigration spain and france have announced that they will propose a joint plan for a european-african conference on immigration at a european union summit later this month .

" in that sense , we will check the accuracy of those reports .. then further define our stance . " he added that such prisons would go against the eu human rights charter and the international convention against torture , which all 25 eu members are obligated to abide . the washington post reported this week that the prisons are , or have been , located in eight countries including thailand , afghanistan and " several democracies in eastern europe " since the system was set up after the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks . the names of the eastern european countries were withheld by the post " at the request of senior us officials , " who argued that the disclosure might disrupt counterterrorism efforts .
thailand denied there was a prison there . meanwhile , the czech republic , slovakia , bulgaria , hungary have denied the presence of prisons .
poland refuses to comment and us-based ngo human rights watch has pointed to poland and romania as the most likeliest sites .
both countries , of which only poland is an eu member , have strong us ties and support the iraq war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the white house wo n't confirm or deny the existence of the prisons no confirmation , no denial white house officials refused to confirm the presence of secret prisons around the world , including one in an unnamed eastern european democracy - but they did n't deny it either . instead , president george w. bush 's national security adviser , stephen hadley , said the united states will do what is necessary to fight and win the war on terrorism . " the president has been very clear we 're doing that in a way that is consistent with our values and that is why he 's been very clear that the united states will not torture , " hadley told reporters .
" the united states will conduct its activities in compliance with law , -lrb- and -rrb- international obligations . " hadley and white house spokesman scott mcclellan refused to confirm or deny the post report .
" i would say that the president 's most important responsibility is to protect the american people , " mcclellan told reporters . the refusal to discuss the matter was echoed by us attorney general alberto gonzales and the central intelligence agency .
but former us president jimmy carter denounced what he said was " a profound and radical change in the basic policies or moral values of our country " in reaction to the report . " this is just one indication of what has been done under this administration to change the policies that have persisted all the way through our history , " said carter , who championed human rights during his 1977-1981 term as president . " gulag of our times " the existence of secret cia detention centers has long been claimed .
amnesty international denounced an " archipelago " of prisons in june as a " gulag of our times . " but the report that eastern european countries were among the locations is new . czech interior minister frantisek bublan was quoted by the online news outlet aktualne.cz as saying that the czech republic recently turned down a us request to set up a detention center on its territory . " the negotiations took place around a month ago , " he was quoted as saying .
the americans " made an effort to install something of the sort here , but they did not succeed . " separately , hungary 's intelligence chief , andras toth , said budapest had not been approached , telling afp that " the mere suggestion of this is absurd . " about 100 prisoners the cia has sent more than 100 suspects to the hidden global internment network , the post said , indicating that the number was a rough estimate and did not include prisoners picked up from iraq . about 30 of the detainees , considered major terrorism suspects , have been held at " black sites " organized by the cia in eastern europe and elsewhere , it said . locations in thailand and at guantanamo bay , cuba were closed in 2003 and 2004 , the paper said .
another in afghanistan known as the " salt pit " was moved inside bagram air base . over 70 other detainees - with less direct involvement in alleged terrorism and having limited intelligence value - have been delivered to intelligence services in egypt , jordan , morocco , afghanistan and other countries , the daily added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : isolation cells at the us prison in guantanamo bay , cuba the post said virtually nothing is known about who is kept in the secret facilities , what interrogation methods are employed , or how decisions are made about whether they should be detained or for how long . the covert prison system is " known only to a handful of officials in the united states and , usually , only to the president and a few top intelligence officers in each host country , " it said . the system has been increasingly debated within the cia where some consider it unsustainable and a diversion from its main espionage mission , the report said . the idea of holding suspects outside the us , where it is illegal to hold people in isolation and in secret prisons , was not under consideration before september 11 , former government officials told the paper . " the issue of detaining and interrogating people was never , ever discussed , " said one former senior cia intelligence officer .

amnesty international denounced an " archipelago " of prisons in june as a " gulag of our times .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.11.2005 germany reaches out to africa großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trying to help more effectively german president horst köhler and other german officials meet with african leaders , writers and ngos later this week in bonn to refocus attention on helping some of the world ’ s poorest people . it is n't an appeal for more development aid .
it is n't about tightening border controls or reducing export duties or even debt forgiveness .
the meetings in bonn , scheduled for nov .
5 and 6 , aim to do something more basic : focus attention on the need to strengthen relations between africa and wealthier nations , namely germany and other members of the european union , through the " partnership for africa " initiative .
" in the north-south dialogue both sides are still far too prone to talk not with but past each other and that , i believe , is one of the reasons why progress here has been so halting and slow , " german president horst köhler , a former director of the washington-based international monetary fund , told the german weekly die zeit .
" if self-sustained development in africa does not take off the results in terms of migration , disease and environmental problems will catch up with us - whether we like it or not . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler wants to improve ties köhler will be joined by south african presdient thabo mbeki , nigerian president olusegun obasanjo , ethiopian prime minister meles zenawi , nobel prize-winner wole soyinka , and other african and german development officials , parliamentarians and entrepreneurs .
topping the agenda is how to increase political , economic and social contact between the continents and listening to each other .
" the point of the whole exercise is not to reaffirm what we think we know , for good or ill , " köhler said .
" what i am hoping for is to bring together a core of people keen to work with me on these issues over the next few years .
i hope this will be an exercise in building trust . "
building cooperation the statistics are grim : in sierra leone , three out of 10 children die before the age of five .
in niger , only 17 percent of the population can read .
in mali , half of all children under the age of 14 work .
and the average ethiopian does not have access to clean water and lives on about 70 euros -lrb- $ 84 -rrb- a year . in the past decade , development aid , debt relief , and economic growth in sub-saharan africa have risen but " reducing poverty remains a challenge , " according to the world bank 's annual report on africa .
but despite progress , the rapid spread of hiv , insufficient aid and investment flows , weak commodity prices and a lack of trade opportunities could reverse gains .
as a result , the international development community has dubbed 2005 the " year of africa " to call attention to the continent ’ s needs .
they say that with the increased focus on africa 's problems at the g8 summit in july , the un summit in september on the so-called " millennium goals " and the wto meeting in december , africa could have a reach chance to get back on track .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south african president thabo mbeki is one of the african leaders coming to germany but many , including leading german officials , say that just pouring more funds into the continent won ’ t be effective .
that is essentially why german chancellor gerhard schröder earlier this year opposed an african " marshall plan " proposed by british prime minister tony blair to double financial assistance to africa to total around 40 billion euros .
instead , through the partnership for africa köhler and others want to promote a dialogue , brainstorm new ideas , but most of all , figure out what kind of development assistance africans really want and what will be most effective .
" we do n't know the answers , " said michael göring , head of the hamburg-based zeit foundation , a partner in the initiative .
" what we always hear is how africa is the lost continent .
but what we want to learn is about the success stories , the successful enterprises and ideas - then help multiply them if we can . "
a renaissance over the past few years , there has been a sort of a renaissance in regards to the attention africa has received , according to africa expert denis tull of the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs .
chancellor schröder and foreign minister joschka fischer have visited the region , and there has been more debate in foreign policy circles .
at the eu level , european commission president jose manuel barroso and african union president alpha oumar konare announced a new strategic partnership between africa and europe earlier this month to increase cooperation on development aid .
at the same time , the eu has drafted an africa strategy to increase and better coordinate relations between the two , which is expected to be adopted later this year .
but what can the german and eu initiatives accomplish concretely ?
some doubt anything at all .
most are not sure .
" we have to wait and see , " said tull .
" there has always been a lot of talk about partnerships , but to make a difference they need to be linked to practical policies .
still , at the very least , africa , which is fairly neglected in german politics , is now on the agenda .

others say he lacks experience . regardless , it seems that michael glos , a senior official of the conservative christian social union , will be the next german economics minister in the incoming grand coalition government , replacing csu party head edmund stoiber who backed away from the job after a shakeup in the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- this week . " i proposed to angela merkel that michael glos take the position and she agreed , " stoiber told reporters earlier this week .

" when he was younger , he successfully led his family business , " otto kentzler , president of the german confederation of skilled crafts -lrb- zdh -rrb- told the berliner zeitung .
" and in his almost 30 years in the german parliament , he has built a strong and trustworthy relationship with the business community .

" in that sense , we will check the accuracy of those reports .. then further define our stance . " he added that such prisons would go against the eu human rights charter and the international convention against torture , which all 25 eu members are obligated to abide . the washington post reported this week that the prisons are , or have been , located in eight countries including thailand , afghanistan and " several democracies in eastern europe " since the system was set up after the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks . the names of the eastern european countries were withheld by the post " at the request of senior us officials , " who argued that the disclosure might disrupt counterterrorism efforts .
thailand denied there was a prison there . meanwhile , the czech republic , slovakia , bulgaria , hungary have denied the presence of prisons .
poland refuses to comment and us-based ngo human rights watch has pointed to poland and romania as the most likeliest sites .
both countries , of which only poland is an eu member , have strong us ties and support the iraq war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the white house wo n't confirm or deny the existence of the prisons no confirmation , no denial white house officials refused to confirm the presence of secret prisons around the world , including one in an unnamed eastern european democracy - but they did n't deny it either . instead , president george w. bush 's national security adviser , stephen hadley , said the united states will do what is necessary to fight and win the war on terrorism . " the president has been very clear we 're doing that in a way that is consistent with our values and that is why he 's been very clear that the united states will not torture , " hadley told reporters .
" the united states will conduct its activities in compliance with law , -lrb- and -rrb- international obligations . " hadley and white house spokesman scott mcclellan refused to confirm or deny the post report .
" i would say that the president 's most important responsibility is to protect the american people , " mcclellan told reporters . the refusal to discuss the matter was echoed by us attorney general alberto gonzales and the central intelligence agency .
but former us president jimmy carter denounced what he said was " a profound and radical change in the basic policies or moral values of our country " in reaction to the report . " this is just one indication of what has been done under this administration to change the policies that have persisted all the way through our history , " said carter , who championed human rights during his 1977-1981 term as president . " gulag of our times " the existence of secret cia detention centers has long been claimed .
amnesty international denounced an " archipelago " of prisons in june as a " gulag of our times . " but the report that eastern european countries were among the locations is new . czech interior minister frantisek bublan was quoted by the online news outlet aktualne.cz as saying that the czech republic recently turned down a us request to set up a detention center on its territory . " the negotiations took place around a month ago , " he was quoted as saying .
the americans " made an effort to install something of the sort here , but they did not succeed . " separately , hungary 's intelligence chief , andras toth , said budapest had not been approached , telling afp that " the mere suggestion of this is absurd . " about 100 prisoners the cia has sent more than 100 suspects to the hidden global internment network , the post said , indicating that the number was a rough estimate and did not include prisoners picked up from iraq . about 30 of the detainees , considered major terrorism suspects , have been held at " black sites " organized by the cia in eastern europe and elsewhere , it said . locations in thailand and at guantanamo bay , cuba were closed in 2003 and 2004 , the paper said .
another in afghanistan known as the " salt pit " was moved inside bagram air base . over 70 other detainees - with less direct involvement in alleged terrorism and having limited intelligence value - have been delivered to intelligence services in egypt , jordan , morocco , afghanistan and other countries , the daily added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : isolation cells at the us prison in guantanamo bay , cuba the post said virtually nothing is known about who is kept in the secret facilities , what interrogation methods are employed , or how decisions are made about whether they should be detained or for how long . the covert prison system is " known only to a handful of officials in the united states and , usually , only to the president and a few top intelligence officers in each host country , " it said . the system has been increasingly debated within the cia where some consider it unsustainable and a diversion from its main espionage mission , the report said . the idea of holding suspects outside the us , where it is illegal to hold people in isolation and in secret prisons , was not under consideration before september 11 , former government officials told the paper . " the issue of detaining and interrogating people was never , ever discussed , " said one former senior cia intelligence officer .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.11.2005 germany reaches out to africa großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trying to help more effectively german president horst köhler and other german officials meet with african leaders , writers and ngos later this week in bonn to refocus attention on helping some of the world ’ s poorest people . it is n't an appeal for more development aid .
it is n't about tightening border controls or reducing export duties or even debt forgiveness .
the meetings in bonn , scheduled for nov .
5 and 6 , aim to do something more basic : focus attention on the need to strengthen relations between africa and wealthier nations , namely germany and other members of the european union , through the " partnership for africa " initiative .
" in the north-south dialogue both sides are still far too prone to talk not with but past each other and that , i believe , is one of the reasons why progress here has been so halting and slow , " german president horst köhler , a former director of the washington-based international monetary fund , told the german weekly die zeit .
" if self-sustained development in africa does not take off the results in terms of migration , disease and environmental problems will catch up with us - whether we like it or not . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler wants to improve ties köhler will be joined by south african presdient thabo mbeki , nigerian president olusegun obasanjo , ethiopian prime minister meles zenawi , nobel prize-winner wole soyinka , and other african and german development officials , parliamentarians and entrepreneurs .
topping the agenda is how to increase political , economic and social contact between the continents and listening to each other .
" the point of the whole exercise is not to reaffirm what we think we know , for good or ill , " köhler said .
" what i am hoping for is to bring together a core of people keen to work with me on these issues over the next few years .
i hope this will be an exercise in building trust . "
building cooperation the statistics are grim : in sierra leone , three out of 10 children die before the age of five .
in niger , only 17 percent of the population can read .
in mali , half of all children under the age of 14 work .
and the average ethiopian does not have access to clean water and lives on about 70 euros -lrb- $ 84 -rrb- a year . in the past decade , development aid , debt relief , and economic growth in sub-saharan africa have risen but " reducing poverty remains a challenge , " according to the world bank 's annual report on africa .
but despite progress , the rapid spread of hiv , insufficient aid and investment flows , weak commodity prices and a lack of trade opportunities could reverse gains .
as a result , the international development community has dubbed 2005 the " year of africa " to call attention to the continent ’ s needs .
they say that with the increased focus on africa 's problems at the g8 summit in july , the un summit in september on the so-called " millennium goals " and the wto meeting in december , africa could have a reach chance to get back on track .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south african president thabo mbeki is one of the african leaders coming to germany but many , including leading german officials , say that just pouring more funds into the continent won ’ t be effective .
that is essentially why german chancellor gerhard schröder earlier this year opposed an african " marshall plan " proposed by british prime minister tony blair to double financial assistance to africa to total around 40 billion euros .
instead , through the partnership for africa köhler and others want to promote a dialogue , brainstorm new ideas , but most of all , figure out what kind of development assistance africans really want and what will be most effective .
" we do n't know the answers , " said michael göring , head of the hamburg-based zeit foundation , a partner in the initiative .
" what we always hear is how africa is the lost continent .
but what we want to learn is about the success stories , the successful enterprises and ideas - then help multiply them if we can . "
a renaissance over the past few years , there has been a sort of a renaissance in regards to the attention africa has received , according to africa expert denis tull of the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs .
chancellor schröder and foreign minister joschka fischer have visited the region , and there has been more debate in foreign policy circles .
at the eu level , european commission president jose manuel barroso and african union president alpha oumar konare announced a new strategic partnership between africa and europe earlier this month to increase cooperation on development aid .
at the same time , the eu has drafted an africa strategy to increase and better coordinate relations between the two , which is expected to be adopted later this year .
but what can the german and eu initiatives accomplish concretely ?
some doubt anything at all .
most are not sure .
" we have to wait and see , " said tull .
" there has always been a lot of talk about partnerships , but to make a difference they need to be linked to practical policies .
still , at the very least , africa , which is fairly neglected in german politics , is now on the agenda . " jabeen bhatti send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spain , france join forces on immigration spain and france have announced that they will propose a joint plan for a european-african conference on immigration at a european union summit later this month .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.11.2005 stoiber departs to the sound of sharpening knives großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber risks being exiled and isolated after quitting the cabinet in the midst of all the chaos in berlin , edmund stoiber may have hoped his departure from the cabinet would pass without much comment .
on the contrary , it has prompted harsh criticism and raised doubts over his future . edmund stoiber 's decision to escape the spiraling chaos surrounding the fledgling government in berlin for the safety of his regional fiefdom in munich was being viewed as the last nail in the embryonic grand coalition 's coffin on thursday . but while germany 's politicians vowed to press on with plans to form a government made up of the country 's two largest parties , in some quarters it was stoiber 's political career over which the last rites were being administered . the head of the christian social union , the christian democratic union 's sister party , returned to bavaria after rejecting the cabinet position of economics and technology minister on tuesday during the latest fraught round of coalition discussions between the conservatives and the social democrats . stoiber 's departure left his colleagues to ponder an increasingly difficult situation and prompted many to turn on the man who , for so long , had craved power at the top end of conservative politics only to abandon it . damagi n g beyo n d repair ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when faced with a change , stoiber chose to stay where he felt safest .
some of stoiber 's csu members in bavaria were less than happy at the prospect of their prime minister returning to concentrate on regional matters .
csu state parliament representative sebastian von rotenhan told reporters that stoiber 's u-turn in berlin had caused the csu " irreparable damage " and had lost the party " enormous amounts of respect . "
he added that he thought stoiber 's days as bavarian state premier were numbered . " it is time for a change , " rotenhan said . fellow csu member martin neumeyer also criticized stoiber 's decision and its knock-on effects . " these scars will remain , " he said in an interview with dpa .
" one thing is clear ; the damage will remain with us for some time . " " edmund stoiber was an obstruction in berlin , " said georg milbradt , cdu state premier of saxony , in der spiegel , adding that stoiber 's combative and opinionated approach was only adding to the troubles surrounding the coalition talks . fdp head like n s stoiber to rebel lafo n tai n e bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guido westerwelle -lrb- left -rrb- will now be in opposition to merkel and stoiber .
guido westerwelle , the leader of the opposition free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- which was originally aligned with the cdu / csu in the election campaign , compared stoiber to former social democrat rebel and current left party co-leader , oskar lafontaine . " in terms of escaping his responsibility , edmund stoiber is on a par with lafontaine , " the fdp leader told the westfale n blatt newspaper .
" such an escape from a position of responsibility , a state of office , i would find impossible to imagine had i not seen it . " the german media was also scathing in its reporting of stoiber 's decision .
the mass circulation tabloid bild called stoiber an " eternal ditherer " and said that he had " chickened out " of his responsibility and had fled to the safety of his home state leaving berlin and germany in chaos while " waving the white flag . " the bavarian state premier 's character was further assassinated by the business daily ha n delsblatt which accused stoiber of lacking any sense of duty , loyalty and reliability . " even with the best of intentions it 's impossible to find these qualities in stoiber 's behavior , " the paper wrote .
" it is astonishing that the csu obediently puts up with his actions . " " this is the end of the stoiber era - he gave the csu back its self-confidence and now he 's ruining it , " cried the süddeutsche zeitu n g which went on to describe stoiber as " a faltering figure , a spirit who does n't know what he wants . " csu to discuss stoiber 's style bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber 's approach is a concern for those who fear he may become a critic .
back in berlin , the conservative bloc hierarchy were looking into ways of limiting the damage of stoiber 's desertion and pre-empting any unwanted criticism he may be inclined to direct at the cdu .
the meeting was also likely to address stoiber 's style of politics and promotion ; a style that has alienated many party members and voters alike . in recent days , stoiber has made it clear that he has been extremely unhappy with the shape of the economics ministry he was supposed to head in a grand coalition .
the bavarian leader has openly complained that he wanted more portfolios for his super-ministry than just the research and education ministries he was granted by cdu leader angela merkel . fears bavaria n pm may rock coalitio n boat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber and merkel have had a strained relationship for some time .
as a result , the relationship between the two had soured in recent weeks , dredging up many feelings stoiber may have had about being passed over in favor of merkel after his unsuccessful 2002 election campaign .
some conservative leaders now fear that stoiber - once back in munich - might torpedo grand coalition talks with unqualified and unsolicited comments . but christian democrat senior member wolfgang bosbach ruled out such a scenario .
" any fears that edmund stoiber would cause berlin trouble as state premier in munich are unfounded , " bosbach told reporters .
" he remains in favor of a grand coalition just like those at the negotiating table . " despite this gloss , there is a fear among many in conservative circles that if stoiber is going down , he may want to take as many of his rivals with him .

11 , 2001 attacks . the names of the eastern european countries were withheld by the post " at the request of senior us officials , " who argued that the disclosure might disrupt counterterrorism efforts .
thailand denied there was a prison there . meanwhile , the czech republic , slovakia , bulgaria , hungary have denied the presence of prisons .
poland refuses to comment and us-based ngo human rights watch has pointed to poland and romania as the most likeliest sites .
both countries , of which only poland is an eu member , have strong us ties and support the iraq war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the white house wo n't confirm or deny the existence of the prisons no confirmation , no denial white house officials refused to confirm the presence of secret prisons around the world , including one in an unnamed eastern european democracy - but they did n't deny it either . instead , president george w. bush 's national security adviser , stephen hadley , said the united states will do what is necessary to fight and win the war on terrorism . " the president has been very clear we 're doing that in a way that is consistent with our values and that is why he 's been very clear that the united states will not torture , " hadley told reporters .
" the united states will conduct its activities in compliance with law , -lrb- and -rrb- international obligations . " hadley and white house spokesman scott mcclellan refused to confirm or deny the post report .
" i would say that the president 's most important responsibility is to protect the american people , " mcclellan told reporters . the refusal to discuss the matter was echoed by us attorney general alberto gonzales and the central intelligence agency .
but former us president jimmy carter denounced what he said was " a profound and radical change in the basic policies or moral values of our country " in reaction to the report . " this is just one indication of what has been done under this administration to change the policies that have persisted all the way through our history , " said carter , who championed human rights during his 1977-1981 term as president . " gulag of our times " the existence of secret cia detention centers has long been claimed .
amnesty international denounced an " archipelago " of prisons in june as a " gulag of our times . " but the report that eastern european countries were among the locations is new . czech interior minister frantisek bublan was quoted by the online news outlet aktualne.cz as saying that the czech republic recently turned down a us request to set up a detention center on its territory . " the negotiations took place around a month ago , " he was quoted as saying .
the americans " made an effort to install something of the sort here , but they did not succeed . " separately , hungary 's intelligence chief , andras toth , said budapest had not been approached , telling afp that " the mere suggestion of this is absurd . " about 100 prisoners the cia has sent more than 100 suspects to the hidden global internment network , the post said , indicating that the number was a rough estimate and did not include prisoners picked up from iraq . about 30 of the detainees , considered major terrorism suspects , have been held at " black sites " organized by the cia in eastern europe and elsewhere , it said . locations in thailand and at guantanamo bay , cuba were closed in 2003 and 2004 , the paper said .
another in afghanistan known as the " salt pit " was moved inside bagram air base . over 70 other detainees - with less direct involvement in alleged terrorism and having limited intelligence value - have been delivered to intelligence services in egypt , jordan , morocco , afghanistan and other countries , the daily added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : isolation cells at the us prison in guantanamo bay , cuba the post said virtually nothing is known about who is kept in the secret facilities , what interrogation methods are employed , or how decisions are made about whether they should be detained or for how long . the covert prison system is " known only to a handful of officials in the united states and , usually , only to the president and a few top intelligence officers in each host country , " it said . the system has been increasingly debated within the cia where some consider it unsustainable and a diversion from its main espionage mission , the report said . the idea of holding suspects outside the us , where it is illegal to hold people in isolation and in secret prisons , was not under consideration before september 11 , former government officials told the paper .

" in line with the wishes of survivors , it was designed as a simple , square building intended to convey information and emotion , not as a flashy structure " said the center 's director valerie drechsler . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conveying information and emotion without being ostentatious visitors are first taken on an interactive tour of the 14 nazi concentration camps set up in europe during the war , including auschwitz in poland , bergen-belsen in germany and mauthausen in austria . further inside , film clips shot under cover inside the struthof camp are projected alongside nazi propaganda footage , while a poem written by a deportee echoes in three languages around the dimly-lit underground chamber . documenting horror hundreds of press cuttings , drawings and witness accounts - original material as well as documents from museums and image banks - retrace the rise of fascism in the 1920s , as well as the growth of resistance movements in france and elsewhere in europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : struthof prisoners were supposed to disappear without a trace emerging from the center back into the light , the visitor finds himself in front of the gates of struthof . french architect pierre-louis faloci intended the play on light and shadow to be a reference to adolf hitler 's 1941 decree " nacht und nebel " -lrb- night and fog -rrb- , which led to the disappearance of countless political prisoners .
the detainees at struthof were known as " night-and-fog " prisoners : they were supposed to be swallowed by the dark and vanish without a trace . the european center for deported resistance fighters was mainly financed by the french defense ministry , with the remaining one-fifth provided by european union subsidies . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de köhler seeks to soothe wwii controversy at the start of a visit to poland tuesday , german president köhler spoke about a controversial center against war-time expulsions to be built in berlin - an issue that has offended historical sensitivities in poland .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup 2006 -pipe- 03.11.2005 germany welcomes the wealthy world großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : that suitcase better be full of money the 2006 world cup may be billed as a tournament for everyone but it seems that those who have very healthy bank accounts will get the best seats when the global soccer spectacle kicks off in june next year . while thousands of fans bite their nails to the quick waiting for news of their ticket applications as the allocation rounds get fewer and further between , it has been revealed that there are still around 150,000 of the best seats , including those at the final , available to the public . but there is unlikely to be a stampede for these golden tickets .
the cheapest of those still available will set supporters back some 1,900 euros -lrb- $ 2,281 -rrb- plus sales tax .
this pricey package will allow the extravagant fan to attend three first round games .
but that ’ s just the bottom of a sliding scale that reaches an incredible 336,000 euros -lrb- $ 403,300 -rrb- for a 20-person box at all six matches in berlin 's olympic stadium , including the final . while tickets through the regular channel on the official world cup website have been snapped up , the 346,950 tickets held by swiss-based company ise-hospitality have not sold half as well , mainly because of the prices . only half of hospitality packages sold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oli kahn will be there ... but will you ?
the company told reuters that approximately half of the hospitality packages have yet to be sold , in contrast to the first offering of 812,000 tickets from the world cup organizers which was oversubscribed by 10 to one .
the next phase of 300,000 tickets , which go up for grabs after the group draw in december , is expected to generate even more of a mad scramble . with tickets ranging from 35 euros for the lowest category seats at opening round games to 600 euros for the most expensive seats at the final , with relatively modest price points along the way , it is unsurprising that more fans are tempted by the regular offers . " the german market is of course challenging , but we are certain we will sell out , " ise hospitality 's deputy ceo andreas hacker said . hacker and ise hospitality are obviously hoping that business clients who are looking to use the event as a way of entertaining potential clients will eventually see the " speculate to accumulate " factor in the expensive packages . fans with cash also in with a chance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all this plus champagne and caviar .
with food , drink , parking and special stadium access included , the tickets are specifically geared towards corporate buyers .
however hacker was keen to stress that affluent supporters should not be put off from applying for the tickets . " the reasons behind purchases so far have been clear , " he said .
" no other event can offer anything like the opportunities for networking and entertaining at the world cup . " the problem may be that the tickets for the main events , like the knock-out stages and particularly the semi-finals and final , may sell out fast , leaving many of the other games undersold . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans will need to beg for a long time to buy a top price ticket .
the world cup organizing committee has made it clear that any unsold hospitality packages would be taken back and made available to fans but ise hospitality are confident that this wo n't be necessary . " it 's obvious that companies and individuals will have an interest in certain matches more than others , " hacker said .
" but all of the matches will have an amazing atmosphere . " " it 's the world cup .
at the end of the year , the worst thing would be to say you were n't even there .

the cheapest of those still available will set supporters back some 1,900 euros -lrb- $ 2,281 -rrb- plus sales tax .
this pricey package will allow the extravagant fan to attend three first round games .
but that ’ s just the bottom of a sliding scale that reaches an incredible 336,000 euros -lrb- $ 403,300 -rrb- for a 20-person box at all six matches in berlin 's olympic stadium , including the final . while tickets through the regular channel on the official world cup website have been snapped up , the 346,950 tickets held by swiss-based company ise-hospitality have not sold half as well , mainly because of the prices . only half of hospitality packages sold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oli kahn will be there ... but will you ?
the company told reuters that approximately half of the hospitality packages have yet to be sold , in contrast to the first offering of 812,000 tickets from the world cup organizers which was oversubscribed by 10 to one .
the next phase of 300,000 tickets , which go up for grabs after the group draw in december , is expected to generate even more of a mad scramble . with tickets ranging from 35 euros for the lowest category seats at opening round games to 600 euros for the most expensive seats at the final , with relatively modest price points along the way , it is unsurprising that more fans are tempted by the regular offers . " the german market is of course challenging , but we are certain we will sell out , " ise hospitality 's deputy ceo andreas hacker said . hacker and ise hospitality are obviously hoping that business clients who are looking to use the event as a way of entertaining potential clients will eventually see the " speculate to accumulate " factor in the expensive packages . fans with cash also in with a chance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all this plus champagne and caviar .
with food , drink , parking and special stadium access included , the tickets are specifically geared towards corporate buyers .
however hacker was keen to stress that affluent supporters should not be put off from applying for the tickets . " the reasons behind purchases so far have been clear , " he said .
" no other event can offer anything like the opportunities for networking and entertaining at the world cup . " the problem may be that the tickets for the main events , like the knock-out stages and particularly the semi-finals and final , may sell out fast , leaving many of the other games undersold . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans will need to beg for a long time to buy a top price ticket .
the world cup organizing committee has made it clear that any unsold hospitality packages would be taken back and made available to fans but ise hospitality are confident that this wo n't be necessary . " it 's obvious that companies and individuals will have an interest in certain matches more than others , " hacker said .

it is n't about tightening border controls or reducing export duties or even debt forgiveness .
the meetings in bonn , scheduled for nov .
5 and 6 , aim to do something more basic : focus attention on the need to strengthen relations between africa and wealthier nations , namely germany and other members of the european union , through the " partnership for africa " initiative .
" in the north-south dialogue both sides are still far too prone to talk not with but past each other and that , i believe , is one of the reasons why progress here has been so halting and slow , " german president horst köhler , a former director of the washington-based international monetary fund , told the german weekly die zeit .
" if self-sustained development in africa does not take off the results in terms of migration , disease and environmental problems will catch up with us - whether we like it or not . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler wants to improve ties köhler will be joined by south african presdient thabo mbeki , nigerian president olusegun obasanjo , ethiopian prime minister meles zenawi , nobel prize-winner wole soyinka , and other african and german development officials , parliamentarians and entrepreneurs .
topping the agenda is how to increase political , economic and social contact between the continents and listening to each other .
" the point of the whole exercise is not to reaffirm what we think we know , for good or ill , " köhler said .
" what i am hoping for is to bring together a core of people keen to work with me on these issues over the next few years .
i hope this will be an exercise in building trust . "
building cooperation the statistics are grim : in sierra leone , three out of 10 children die before the age of five .
in niger , only 17 percent of the population can read .
in mali , half of all children under the age of 14 work .
and the average ethiopian does not have access to clean water and lives on about 70 euros -lrb- $ 84 -rrb- a year . in the past decade , development aid , debt relief , and economic growth in sub-saharan africa have risen but " reducing poverty remains a challenge , " according to the world bank 's annual report on africa .
but despite progress , the rapid spread of hiv , insufficient aid and investment flows , weak commodity prices and a lack of trade opportunities could reverse gains .
as a result , the international development community has dubbed 2005 the " year of africa " to call attention to the continent ’ s needs .
they say that with the increased focus on africa 's problems at the g8 summit in july , the un summit in september on the so-called " millennium goals " and the wto meeting in december , africa could have a reach chance to get back on track .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south african president thabo mbeki is one of the african leaders coming to germany but many , including leading german officials , say that just pouring more funds into the continent won ’ t be effective .
that is essentially why german chancellor gerhard schröder earlier this year opposed an african " marshall plan " proposed by british prime minister tony blair to double financial assistance to africa to total around 40 billion euros .
instead , through the partnership for africa köhler and others want to promote a dialogue , brainstorm new ideas , but most of all , figure out what kind of development assistance africans really want and what will be most effective .
" we do n't know the answers , " said michael göring , head of the hamburg-based zeit foundation , a partner in the initiative .
" what we always hear is how africa is the lost continent .
but what we want to learn is about the success stories , the successful enterprises and ideas - then help multiply them if we can . "
a renaissance over the past few years , there has been a sort of a renaissance in regards to the attention africa has received , according to africa expert denis tull of the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs .
chancellor schröder and foreign minister joschka fischer have visited the region , and there has been more debate in foreign policy circles .
at the eu level , european commission president jose manuel barroso and african union president alpha oumar konare announced a new strategic partnership between africa and europe earlier this month to increase cooperation on development aid .
at the same time , the eu has drafted an africa strategy to increase and better coordinate relations between the two , which is expected to be adopted later this year .
but what can the german and eu initiatives accomplish concretely ?
some doubt anything at all .
most are not sure .
" we have to wait and see , " said tull .
" there has always been a lot of talk about partnerships , but to make a difference they need to be linked to practical policies .
still , at the very least , africa , which is fairly neglected in german politics , is now on the agenda . " jabeen bhatti send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spain , france join forces on immigration spain and france have announced that they will propose a joint plan for a european-african conference on immigration at a european union summit later this month .

" in the north-south dialogue both sides are still far too prone to talk not with but past each other and that , i believe , is one of the reasons why progress here has been so halting and slow , " german president horst köhler , a former director of the washington-based international monetary fund , told the german weekly die zeit .
" if self-sustained development in africa does not take off the results in terms of migration , disease and environmental problems will catch up with us - whether we like it or not . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler wants to improve ties köhler will be joined by south african presdient thabo mbeki , nigerian president olusegun obasanjo , ethiopian prime minister meles zenawi , nobel prize-winner wole soyinka , and other african and german development officials , parliamentarians and entrepreneurs .
topping the agenda is how to increase political , economic and social contact between the continents and listening to each other .
" the point of the whole exercise is not to reaffirm what we think we know , for good or ill , " köhler said .
" what i am hoping for is to bring together a core of people keen to work with me on these issues over the next few years .
i hope this will be an exercise in building trust . "
building cooperation the statistics are grim : in sierra leone , three out of 10 children die before the age of five .
in niger , only 17 percent of the population can read .
in mali , half of all children under the age of 14 work .
and the average ethiopian does not have access to clean water and lives on about 70 euros -lrb- $ 84 -rrb- a year . in the past decade , development aid , debt relief , and economic growth in sub-saharan africa have risen but " reducing poverty remains a challenge , " according to the world bank 's annual report on africa .
but despite progress , the rapid spread of hiv , insufficient aid and investment flows , weak commodity prices and a lack of trade opportunities could reverse gains .
as a result , the international development community has dubbed 2005 the " year of africa " to call attention to the continent ’ s needs .
they say that with the increased focus on africa 's problems at the g8 summit in july , the un summit in september on the so-called " millennium goals " and the wto meeting in december , africa could have a reach chance to get back on track .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south african president thabo mbeki is one of the african leaders coming to germany but many , including leading german officials , say that just pouring more funds into the continent won ’ t be effective .
that is essentially why german chancellor gerhard schröder earlier this year opposed an african " marshall plan " proposed by british prime minister tony blair to double financial assistance to africa to total around 40 billion euros .
instead , through the partnership for africa köhler and others want to promote a dialogue , brainstorm new ideas , but most of all , figure out what kind of development assistance africans really want and what will be most effective .
" we do n't know the answers , " said michael göring , head of the hamburg-based zeit foundation , a partner in the initiative .
" what we always hear is how africa is the lost continent .
but what we want to learn is about the success stories , the successful enterprises and ideas - then help multiply them if we can . "
a renaissance over the past few years , there has been a sort of a renaissance in regards to the attention africa has received , according to africa expert denis tull of the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs .
chancellor schröder and foreign minister joschka fischer have visited the region , and there has been more debate in foreign policy circles .
at the eu level , european commission president jose manuel barroso and african union president alpha oumar konare announced a new strategic partnership between africa and europe earlier this month to increase cooperation on development aid .
at the same time , the eu has drafted an africa strategy to increase and better coordinate relations between the two , which is expected to be adopted later this year .
but what can the german and eu initiatives accomplish concretely ?
some doubt anything at all .
most are not sure .
" we have to wait and see , " said tull .
" there has always been a lot of talk about partnerships , but to make a difference they need to be linked to practical policies .
still , at the very least , africa , which is fairly neglected in german politics , is now on the agenda . " jabeen bhatti send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spain , france join forces on immigration spain and france have announced that they will propose a joint plan for a european-african conference on immigration at a european union summit later this month .

in mali , half of all children under the age of 14 work .
and the average ethiopian does not have access to clean water and lives on about 70 euros -lrb- $ 84 -rrb- a year . in the past decade , development aid , debt relief , and economic growth in sub-saharan africa have risen but " reducing poverty remains a challenge , " according to the world bank 's annual report on africa .
but despite progress , the rapid spread of hiv , insufficient aid and investment flows , weak commodity prices and a lack of trade opportunities could reverse gains .
as a result , the international development community has dubbed 2005 the " year of africa " to call attention to the continent ’ s needs .
they say that with the increased focus on africa 's problems at the g8 summit in july , the un summit in september on the so-called " millennium goals " and the wto meeting in december , africa could have a reach chance to get back on track .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south african president thabo mbeki is one of the african leaders coming to germany but many , including leading german officials , say that just pouring more funds into the continent won ’ t be effective .
that is essentially why german chancellor gerhard schröder earlier this year opposed an african " marshall plan " proposed by british prime minister tony blair to double financial assistance to africa to total around 40 billion euros .
instead , through the partnership for africa köhler and others want to promote a dialogue , brainstorm new ideas , but most of all , figure out what kind of development assistance africans really want and what will be most effective .
" we do n't know the answers , " said michael göring , head of the hamburg-based zeit foundation , a partner in the initiative .
" what we always hear is how africa is the lost continent .
but what we want to learn is about the success stories , the successful enterprises and ideas - then help multiply them if we can . "
a renaissance over the past few years , there has been a sort of a renaissance in regards to the attention africa has received , according to africa expert denis tull of the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs .
chancellor schröder and foreign minister joschka fischer have visited the region , and there has been more debate in foreign policy circles .
at the eu level , european commission president jose manuel barroso and african union president alpha oumar konare announced a new strategic partnership between africa and europe earlier this month to increase cooperation on development aid .
at the same time , the eu has drafted an africa strategy to increase and better coordinate relations between the two , which is expected to be adopted later this year .
but what can the german and eu initiatives accomplish concretely ?
some doubt anything at all .
most are not sure .
" we have to wait and see , " said tull .
" there has always been a lot of talk about partnerships , but to make a difference they need to be linked to practical policies .
still , at the very least , africa , which is fairly neglected in german politics , is now on the agenda . " jabeen bhatti send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spain , france join forces on immigration spain and france have announced that they will propose a joint plan for a european-african conference on immigration at a european union summit later this month .

-lrb- july 8 , 2005 -rrb- africa needs help , but how ?
the g8 summit kicks off wednesday in the wake of rock concerts and calls for increased aid and debt relief for africa .

others say he lacks experience . regardless , it seems that michael glos , a senior official of the conservative christian social union , will be the next german economics minister in the incoming grand coalition government , replacing csu party head edmund stoiber who backed away from the job after a shakeup in the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- this week . " i proposed to angela merkel that michael glos take the position and she agreed , " stoiber told reporters earlier this week .

" when he was younger , he successfully led his family business , " otto kentzler , president of the german confederation of skilled crafts -lrb- zdh -rrb- told the berliner zeitung .
" and in his almost 30 years in the german parliament , he has built a strong and trustworthy relationship with the business community .

" i know that mr. glos is a good organizer and very experienced politician , " anton börner , the president of the federation of german wholesale and foreign trade -lrb- bga -rrb- , told the berliner zeitung .
" but at the present time , i am not able to say anything about his competence in economic affairs . " the economics minister has to play in an entirely different league than the one glos is used to in bavaria , börner said . " we need a strong economics minister , " he said , adding that if glos does n't learn how to play according to international rules , he 'll have a difficult time in his new office . following stoiber bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both stoiber and müntefering have stepped back from cabinet posts after the resignation of franz müntefering as spd chief on monday , stoiber decided to withdraw from incoming chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet , saying that he believed he could be more useful to his party in munich .

on the contrary , it has prompted harsh criticism and raised doubts over his future . edmund stoiber 's decision to escape the spiraling chaos surrounding the fledgling government in berlin for the safety of his regional fiefdom in munich was being viewed as the last nail in the embryonic grand coalition 's coffin on thursday . but while germany 's politicians vowed to press on with plans to form a government made up of the country 's two largest parties , in some quarters it was stoiber 's political career over which the last rites were being administered . the head of the christian social union , the christian democratic union 's sister party , returned to bavaria after rejecting the cabinet position of economics and technology minister on tuesday during the latest fraught round of coalition discussions between the conservatives and the social democrats . stoiber 's departure left his colleagues to ponder an increasingly difficult situation and prompted many to turn on the man who , for so long , had craved power at the top end of conservative politics only to abandon it . damagi n g beyo n d repair ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when faced with a change , stoiber chose to stay where he felt safest .
some of stoiber 's csu members in bavaria were less than happy at the prospect of their prime minister returning to concentrate on regional matters .
csu state parliament representative sebastian von rotenhan told reporters that stoiber 's u-turn in berlin had caused the csu " irreparable damage " and had lost the party " enormous amounts of respect . "
he added that he thought stoiber 's days as bavarian state premier were numbered . " it is time for a change , " rotenhan said . fellow csu member martin neumeyer also criticized stoiber 's decision and its knock-on effects . " these scars will remain , " he said in an interview with dpa .
" one thing is clear ; the damage will remain with us for some time . " " edmund stoiber was an obstruction in berlin , " said georg milbradt , cdu state premier of saxony , in der spiegel , adding that stoiber 's combative and opinionated approach was only adding to the troubles surrounding the coalition talks . fdp head like n s stoiber to rebel lafo n tai n e bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guido westerwelle -lrb- left -rrb- will now be in opposition to merkel and stoiber .
guido westerwelle , the leader of the opposition free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- which was originally aligned with the cdu / csu in the election campaign , compared stoiber to former social democrat rebel and current left party co-leader , oskar lafontaine . " in terms of escaping his responsibility , edmund stoiber is on a par with lafontaine , " the fdp leader told the westfale n blatt newspaper .
" such an escape from a position of responsibility , a state of office , i would find impossible to imagine had i not seen it . " the german media was also scathing in its reporting of stoiber 's decision .
the mass circulation tabloid bild called stoiber an " eternal ditherer " and said that he had " chickened out " of his responsibility and had fled to the safety of his home state leaving berlin and germany in chaos while " waving the white flag . " the bavarian state premier 's character was further assassinated by the business daily ha n delsblatt which accused stoiber of lacking any sense of duty , loyalty and reliability . " even with the best of intentions it 's impossible to find these qualities in stoiber 's behavior , " the paper wrote .
" it is astonishing that the csu obediently puts up with his actions . " " this is the end of the stoiber era - he gave the csu back its self-confidence and now he 's ruining it , " cried the süddeutsche zeitu n g which went on to describe stoiber as " a faltering figure , a spirit who does n't know what he wants . " csu to discuss stoiber 's style bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber 's approach is a concern for those who fear he may become a critic .
back in berlin , the conservative bloc hierarchy were looking into ways of limiting the damage of stoiber 's desertion and pre-empting any unwanted criticism he may be inclined to direct at the cdu .
the meeting was also likely to address stoiber 's style of politics and promotion ; a style that has alienated many party members and voters alike . in recent days , stoiber has made it clear that he has been extremely unhappy with the shape of the economics ministry he was supposed to head in a grand coalition .
the bavarian leader has openly complained that he wanted more portfolios for his super-ministry than just the research and education ministries he was granted by cdu leader angela merkel . fears bavaria n pm may rock coalitio n boat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber and merkel have had a strained relationship for some time .
as a result , the relationship between the two had soured in recent weeks , dredging up many feelings stoiber may have had about being passed over in favor of merkel after his unsuccessful 2002 election campaign .
some conservative leaders now fear that stoiber - once back in munich - might torpedo grand coalition talks with unqualified and unsolicited comments . but christian democrat senior member wolfgang bosbach ruled out such a scenario .
" any fears that edmund stoiber would cause berlin trouble as state premier in munich are unfounded , " bosbach told reporters .
" he remains in favor of a grand coalition just like those at the negotiating table . " despite this gloss , there is a fear among many in conservative circles that if stoiber is going down , he may want to take as many of his rivals with him .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.11.2005 germany reaches out to africa großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trying to help more effectively german president horst köhler and other german officials meet with african leaders , writers and ngos later this week in bonn to refocus attention on helping some of the world ’ s poorest people . it is n't an appeal for more development aid .
it is n't about tightening border controls or reducing export duties or even debt forgiveness .
the meetings in bonn , scheduled for nov .
5 and 6 , aim to do something more basic : focus attention on the need to strengthen relations between africa and wealthier nations , namely germany and other members of the european union , through the " partnership for africa " initiative .
" in the north-south dialogue both sides are still far too prone to talk not with but past each other and that , i believe , is one of the reasons why progress here has been so halting and slow , " german president horst köhler , a former director of the washington-based international monetary fund , told the german weekly die zeit .
" if self-sustained development in africa does not take off the results in terms of migration , disease and environmental problems will catch up with us - whether we like it or not . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler wants to improve ties köhler will be joined by south african presdient thabo mbeki , nigerian president olusegun obasanjo , ethiopian prime minister meles zenawi , nobel prize-winner wole soyinka , and other african and german development officials , parliamentarians and entrepreneurs .
topping the agenda is how to increase political , economic and social contact between the continents and listening to each other .
" the point of the whole exercise is not to reaffirm what we think we know , for good or ill , " köhler said .
" what i am hoping for is to bring together a core of people keen to work with me on these issues over the next few years .
i hope this will be an exercise in building trust . "
building cooperation the statistics are grim : in sierra leone , three out of 10 children die before the age of five .
in niger , only 17 percent of the population can read .

it is n't about tightening border controls or reducing export duties or even debt forgiveness .
the meetings in bonn , scheduled for nov .
5 and 6 , aim to do something more basic : focus attention on the need to strengthen relations between africa and wealthier nations , namely germany and other members of the european union , through the " partnership for africa " initiative .
" in the north-south dialogue both sides are still far too prone to talk not with but past each other and that , i believe , is one of the reasons why progress here has been so halting and slow , " german president horst köhler , a former director of the washington-based international monetary fund , told the german weekly die zeit .
" if self-sustained development in africa does not take off the results in terms of migration , disease and environmental problems will catch up with us - whether we like it or not . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler wants to improve ties köhler will be joined by south african presdient thabo mbeki , nigerian president olusegun obasanjo , ethiopian prime minister meles zenawi , nobel prize-winner wole soyinka , and other african and german development officials , parliamentarians and entrepreneurs .
topping the agenda is how to increase political , economic and social contact between the continents and listening to each other .
" the point of the whole exercise is not to reaffirm what we think we know , for good or ill , " köhler said .
" what i am hoping for is to bring together a core of people keen to work with me on these issues over the next few years .
i hope this will be an exercise in building trust . "
building cooperation the statistics are grim : in sierra leone , three out of 10 children die before the age of five .
in niger , only 17 percent of the population can read .
in mali , half of all children under the age of 14 work .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.11.2005 stoiber departs to the sound of sharpening knives großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber risks being exiled and isolated after quitting the cabinet in the midst of all the chaos in berlin , edmund stoiber may have hoped his departure from the cabinet would pass without much comment .
on the contrary , it has prompted harsh criticism and raised doubts over his future . edmund stoiber 's decision to escape the spiraling chaos surrounding the fledgling government in berlin for the safety of his regional fiefdom in munich was being viewed as the last nail in the embryonic grand coalition 's coffin on thursday . but while germany 's politicians vowed to press on with plans to form a government made up of the country 's two largest parties , in some quarters it was stoiber 's political career over which the last rites were being administered . the head of the christian social union , the christian democratic union 's sister party , returned to bavaria after rejecting the cabinet position of economics and technology minister on tuesday during the latest fraught round of coalition discussions between the conservatives and the social democrats . stoiber 's departure left his colleagues to ponder an increasingly difficult situation and prompted many to turn on the man who , for so long , had craved power at the top end of conservative politics only to abandon it . damagi n g beyo n d repair ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when faced with a change , stoiber chose to stay where he felt safest .
some of stoiber 's csu members in bavaria were less than happy at the prospect of their prime minister returning to concentrate on regional matters .
csu state parliament representative sebastian von rotenhan told reporters that stoiber 's u-turn in berlin had caused the csu " irreparable damage " and had lost the party " enormous amounts of respect . "
he added that he thought stoiber 's days as bavarian state premier were numbered . " it is time for a change , " rotenhan said . fellow csu member martin neumeyer also criticized stoiber 's decision and its knock-on effects . " these scars will remain , " he said in an interview with dpa .
" one thing is clear ; the damage will remain with us for some time . " " edmund stoiber was an obstruction in berlin , " said georg milbradt , cdu state premier of saxony , in der spiegel , adding that stoiber 's combative and opinionated approach was only adding to the troubles surrounding the coalition talks . fdp head like n s stoiber to rebel lafo n tai n e bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guido westerwelle -lrb- left -rrb- will now be in opposition to merkel and stoiber .
guido westerwelle , the leader of the opposition free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- which was originally aligned with the cdu / csu in the election campaign , compared stoiber to former social democrat rebel and current left party co-leader , oskar lafontaine . " in terms of escaping his responsibility , edmund stoiber is on a par with lafontaine , " the fdp leader told the westfale n blatt newspaper .
" such an escape from a position of responsibility , a state of office , i would find impossible to imagine had i not seen it . " the german media was also scathing in its reporting of stoiber 's decision .
the mass circulation tabloid bild called stoiber an " eternal ditherer " and said that he had " chickened out " of his responsibility and had fled to the safety of his home state leaving berlin and germany in chaos while " waving the white flag . " the bavarian state premier 's character was further assassinated by the business daily ha n delsblatt which accused stoiber of lacking any sense of duty , loyalty and reliability . " even with the best of intentions it 's impossible to find these qualities in stoiber 's behavior , " the paper wrote .
" it is astonishing that the csu obediently puts up with his actions . " " this is the end of the stoiber era - he gave the csu back its self-confidence and now he 's ruining it , " cried the süddeutsche zeitu n g which went on to describe stoiber as " a faltering figure , a spirit who does n't know what he wants . " csu to discuss stoiber 's style bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber 's approach is a concern for those who fear he may become a critic .
back in berlin , the conservative bloc hierarchy were looking into ways of limiting the damage of stoiber 's desertion and pre-empting any unwanted criticism he may be inclined to direct at the cdu .
the meeting was also likely to address stoiber 's style of politics and promotion ; a style that has alienated many party members and voters alike . in recent days , stoiber has made it clear that he has been extremely unhappy with the shape of the economics ministry he was supposed to head in a grand coalition .
the bavarian leader has openly complained that he wanted more portfolios for his super-ministry than just the research and education ministries he was granted by cdu leader angela merkel . fears bavaria n pm may rock coalitio n boat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber and merkel have had a strained relationship for some time .
as a result , the relationship between the two had soured in recent weeks , dredging up many feelings stoiber may have had about being passed over in favor of merkel after his unsuccessful 2002 election campaign .
some conservative leaders now fear that stoiber - once back in munich - might torpedo grand coalition talks with unqualified and unsolicited comments . but christian democrat senior member wolfgang bosbach ruled out such a scenario .
" any fears that edmund stoiber would cause berlin trouble as state premier in munich are unfounded , " bosbach told reporters .
" he remains in favor of a grand coalition just like those at the negotiating table . " despite this gloss , there is a fear among many in conservative circles that if stoiber is going down , he may want to take as many of his rivals with him .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.11.2005 germany reaches out to africa großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trying to help more effectively german president horst köhler and other german officials meet with african leaders , writers and ngos later this week in bonn to refocus attention on helping some of the world ’ s poorest people . it is n't an appeal for more development aid .
it is n't about tightening border controls or reducing export duties or even debt forgiveness .
the meetings in bonn , scheduled for nov .
5 and 6 , aim to do something more basic : focus attention on the need to strengthen relations between africa and wealthier nations , namely germany and other members of the european union , through the " partnership for africa " initiative .
" in the north-south dialogue both sides are still far too prone to talk not with but past each other and that , i believe , is one of the reasons why progress here has been so halting and slow , " german president horst köhler , a former director of the washington-based international monetary fund , told the german weekly die zeit .
" if self-sustained development in africa does not take off the results in terms of migration , disease and environmental problems will catch up with us - whether we like it or not . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler wants to improve ties köhler will be joined by south african presdient thabo mbeki , nigerian president olusegun obasanjo , ethiopian prime minister meles zenawi , nobel prize-winner wole soyinka , and other african and german development officials , parliamentarians and entrepreneurs .
topping the agenda is how to increase political , economic and social contact between the continents and listening to each other .
" the point of the whole exercise is not to reaffirm what we think we know , for good or ill , " köhler said .
" what i am hoping for is to bring together a core of people keen to work with me on these issues over the next few years .
i hope this will be an exercise in building trust . "
building cooperation the statistics are grim : in sierra leone , three out of 10 children die before the age of five .
in niger , only 17 percent of the population can read .
in mali , half of all children under the age of 14 work .
and the average ethiopian does not have access to clean water and lives on about 70 euros -lrb- $ 84 -rrb- a year . in the past decade , development aid , debt relief , and economic growth in sub-saharan africa have risen but " reducing poverty remains a challenge , " according to the world bank 's annual report on africa .
but despite progress , the rapid spread of hiv , insufficient aid and investment flows , weak commodity prices and a lack of trade opportunities could reverse gains .
as a result , the international development community has dubbed 2005 the " year of africa " to call attention to the continent ’ s needs .
they say that with the increased focus on africa 's problems at the g8 summit in july , the un summit in september on the so-called " millennium goals " and the wto meeting in december , africa could have a reach chance to get back on track .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south african president thabo mbeki is one of the african leaders coming to germany but many , including leading german officials , say that just pouring more funds into the continent won ’ t be effective .
that is essentially why german chancellor gerhard schröder earlier this year opposed an african " marshall plan " proposed by british prime minister tony blair to double financial assistance to africa to total around 40 billion euros .
instead , through the partnership for africa köhler and others want to promote a dialogue , brainstorm new ideas , but most of all , figure out what kind of development assistance africans really want and what will be most effective .
" we do n't know the answers , " said michael göring , head of the hamburg-based zeit foundation , a partner in the initiative .
" what we always hear is how africa is the lost continent .
but what we want to learn is about the success stories , the successful enterprises and ideas - then help multiply them if we can . "
a renaissance over the past few years , there has been a sort of a renaissance in regards to the attention africa has received , according to africa expert denis tull of the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs .
chancellor schröder and foreign minister joschka fischer have visited the region , and there has been more debate in foreign policy circles .
at the eu level , european commission president jose manuel barroso and african union president alpha oumar konare announced a new strategic partnership between africa and europe earlier this month to increase cooperation on development aid .
at the same time , the eu has drafted an africa strategy to increase and better coordinate relations between the two , which is expected to be adopted later this year .
but what can the german and eu initiatives accomplish concretely ?
some doubt anything at all .
most are not sure .
" we have to wait and see , " said tull .
" there has always been a lot of talk about partnerships , but to make a difference they need to be linked to practical policies .
still , at the very least , africa , which is fairly neglected in german politics , is now on the agenda . " jabeen bhatti send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spain , france join forces on immigration spain and france have announced that they will propose a joint plan for a european-african conference on immigration at a european union summit later this month .

" in that sense , we will check the accuracy of those reports .. then further define our stance . " he added that such prisons would go against the eu human rights charter and the international convention against torture , which all 25 eu members are obligated to abide . the washington post reported this week that the prisons are , or have been , located in eight countries including thailand , afghanistan and " several democracies in eastern europe " since the system was set up after the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks . the names of the eastern european countries were withheld by the post " at the request of senior us officials , " who argued that the disclosure might disrupt counterterrorism efforts .
thailand denied there was a prison there . meanwhile , the czech republic , slovakia , bulgaria , hungary have denied the presence of prisons .
poland refuses to comment and us-based ngo human rights watch has pointed to poland and romania as the most likeliest sites .
both countries , of which only poland is an eu member , have strong us ties and support the iraq war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the white house wo n't confirm or deny the existence of the prisons no confirmation , no denial white house officials refused to confirm the presence of secret prisons around the world , including one in an unnamed eastern european democracy - but they did n't deny it either . instead , president george w. bush 's national security adviser , stephen hadley , said the united states will do what is necessary to fight and win the war on terrorism . " the president has been very clear we 're doing that in a way that is consistent with our values and that is why he 's been very clear that the united states will not torture , " hadley told reporters .
" the united states will conduct its activities in compliance with law , -lrb- and -rrb- international obligations . " hadley and white house spokesman scott mcclellan refused to confirm or deny the post report .
" i would say that the president 's most important responsibility is to protect the american people , " mcclellan told reporters . the refusal to discuss the matter was echoed by us attorney general alberto gonzales and the central intelligence agency .
but former us president jimmy carter denounced what he said was " a profound and radical change in the basic policies or moral values of our country " in reaction to the report . " this is just one indication of what has been done under this administration to change the policies that have persisted all the way through our history , " said carter , who championed human rights during his 1977-1981 term as president .

" in that sense , we will check the accuracy of those reports .. then further define our stance . " he added that such prisons would go against the eu human rights charter and the international convention against torture , which all 25 eu members are obligated to abide . the washington post reported this week that the prisons are , or have been , located in eight countries including thailand , afghanistan and " several democracies in eastern europe " since the system was set up after the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks . the names of the eastern european countries were withheld by the post " at the request of senior us officials , " who argued that the disclosure might disrupt counterterrorism efforts .
thailand denied there was a prison there . meanwhile , the czech republic , slovakia , bulgaria , hungary have denied the presence of prisons .
poland refuses to comment and us-based ngo human rights watch has pointed to poland and romania as the most likeliest sites .
both countries , of which only poland is an eu member , have strong us ties and support the iraq war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the white house wo n't confirm or deny the existence of the prisons no confirmation , no denial white house officials refused to confirm the presence of secret prisons around the world , including one in an unnamed eastern european democracy - but they did n't deny it either . instead , president george w. bush 's national security adviser , stephen hadley , said the united states will do what is necessary to fight and win the war on terrorism . " the president has been very clear we 're doing that in a way that is consistent with our values and that is why he 's been very clear that the united states will not torture , " hadley told reporters .
" the united states will conduct its activities in compliance with law , -lrb- and -rrb- international obligations . " hadley and white house spokesman scott mcclellan refused to confirm or deny the post report .
" i would say that the president 's most important responsibility is to protect the american people , " mcclellan told reporters . the refusal to discuss the matter was echoed by us attorney general alberto gonzales and the central intelligence agency .
but former us president jimmy carter denounced what he said was " a profound and radical change in the basic policies or moral values of our country " in reaction to the report . " this is just one indication of what has been done under this administration to change the policies that have persisted all the way through our history , " said carter , who championed human rights during his 1977-1981 term as president .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.11.2005 germany reaches out to africa großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trying to help more effectively german president horst köhler and other german officials meet with african leaders , writers and ngos later this week in bonn to refocus attention on helping some of the world ’ s poorest people . it is n't an appeal for more development aid .
it is n't about tightening border controls or reducing export duties or even debt forgiveness .
the meetings in bonn , scheduled for nov .
5 and 6 , aim to do something more basic : focus attention on the need to strengthen relations between africa and wealthier nations , namely germany and other members of the european union , through the " partnership for africa " initiative .
" in the north-south dialogue both sides are still far too prone to talk not with but past each other and that , i believe , is one of the reasons why progress here has been so halting and slow , " german president horst köhler , a former director of the washington-based international monetary fund , told the german weekly die zeit .
" if self-sustained development in africa does not take off the results in terms of migration , disease and environmental problems will catch up with us - whether we like it or not . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler wants to improve ties köhler will be joined by south african presdient thabo mbeki , nigerian president olusegun obasanjo , ethiopian prime minister meles zenawi , nobel prize-winner wole soyinka , and other african and german development officials , parliamentarians and entrepreneurs .
topping the agenda is how to increase political , economic and social contact between the continents and listening to each other .
" the point of the whole exercise is not to reaffirm what we think we know , for good or ill , " köhler said .
" what i am hoping for is to bring together a core of people keen to work with me on these issues over the next few years .
i hope this will be an exercise in building trust . "
building cooperation the statistics are grim : in sierra leone , three out of 10 children die before the age of five .
in niger , only 17 percent of the population can read .
in mali , half of all children under the age of 14 work .
and the average ethiopian does not have access to clean water and lives on about 70 euros -lrb- $ 84 -rrb- a year . in the past decade , development aid , debt relief , and economic growth in sub-saharan africa have risen but " reducing poverty remains a challenge , " according to the world bank 's annual report on africa .
but despite progress , the rapid spread of hiv , insufficient aid and investment flows , weak commodity prices and a lack of trade opportunities could reverse gains .
as a result , the international development community has dubbed 2005 the " year of africa " to call attention to the continent ’ s needs .
they say that with the increased focus on africa 's problems at the g8 summit in july , the un summit in september on the so-called " millennium goals " and the wto meeting in december , africa could have a reach chance to get back on track .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south african president thabo mbeki is one of the african leaders coming to germany but many , including leading german officials , say that just pouring more funds into the continent won ’ t be effective .
that is essentially why german chancellor gerhard schröder earlier this year opposed an african " marshall plan " proposed by british prime minister tony blair to double financial assistance to africa to total around 40 billion euros .
instead , through the partnership for africa köhler and others want to promote a dialogue , brainstorm new ideas , but most of all , figure out what kind of development assistance africans really want and what will be most effective .
" we do n't know the answers , " said michael göring , head of the hamburg-based zeit foundation , a partner in the initiative .
" what we always hear is how africa is the lost continent .
but what we want to learn is about the success stories , the successful enterprises and ideas - then help multiply them if we can . "
a renaissance over the past few years , there has been a sort of a renaissance in regards to the attention africa has received , according to africa expert denis tull of the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs .
chancellor schröder and foreign minister joschka fischer have visited the region , and there has been more debate in foreign policy circles .
at the eu level , european commission president jose manuel barroso and african union president alpha oumar konare announced a new strategic partnership between africa and europe earlier this month to increase cooperation on development aid .
at the same time , the eu has drafted an africa strategy to increase and better coordinate relations between the two , which is expected to be adopted later this year .
but what can the german and eu initiatives accomplish concretely ?
some doubt anything at all .
most are not sure .
" we have to wait and see , " said tull .
" there has always been a lot of talk about partnerships , but to make a difference they need to be linked to practical policies .
still , at the very least , africa , which is fairly neglected in german politics , is now on the agenda . " jabeen bhatti send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spain , france join forces on immigration spain and france have announced that they will propose a joint plan for a european-african conference on immigration at a european union summit later this month .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.11.2005 stoiber departs to the sound of sharpening knives großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber risks being exiled and isolated after quitting the cabinet in the midst of all the chaos in berlin , edmund stoiber may have hoped his departure from the cabinet would pass without much comment .
on the contrary , it has prompted harsh criticism and raised doubts over his future . edmund stoiber 's decision to escape the spiraling chaos surrounding the fledgling government in berlin for the safety of his regional fiefdom in munich was being viewed as the last nail in the embryonic grand coalition 's coffin on thursday . but while germany 's politicians vowed to press on with plans to form a government made up of the country 's two largest parties , in some quarters it was stoiber 's political career over which the last rites were being administered . the head of the christian social union , the christian democratic union 's sister party , returned to bavaria after rejecting the cabinet position of economics and technology minister on tuesday during the latest fraught round of coalition discussions between the conservatives and the social democrats . stoiber 's departure left his colleagues to ponder an increasingly difficult situation and prompted many to turn on the man who , for so long , had craved power at the top end of conservative politics only to abandon it . damagi n g beyo n d repair ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when faced with a change , stoiber chose to stay where he felt safest .
some of stoiber 's csu members in bavaria were less than happy at the prospect of their prime minister returning to concentrate on regional matters .
csu state parliament representative sebastian von rotenhan told reporters that stoiber 's u-turn in berlin had caused the csu " irreparable damage " and had lost the party " enormous amounts of respect . "
he added that he thought stoiber 's days as bavarian state premier were numbered . " it is time for a change , " rotenhan said . fellow csu member martin neumeyer also criticized stoiber 's decision and its knock-on effects . " these scars will remain , " he said in an interview with dpa .
" one thing is clear ; the damage will remain with us for some time . " " edmund stoiber was an obstruction in berlin , " said georg milbradt , cdu state premier of saxony , in der spiegel , adding that stoiber 's combative and opinionated approach was only adding to the troubles surrounding the coalition talks . fdp head like n s stoiber to rebel lafo n tai n e bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guido westerwelle -lrb- left -rrb- will now be in opposition to merkel and stoiber .
guido westerwelle , the leader of the opposition free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- which was originally aligned with the cdu / csu in the election campaign , compared stoiber to former social democrat rebel and current left party co-leader , oskar lafontaine . " in terms of escaping his responsibility , edmund stoiber is on a par with lafontaine , " the fdp leader told the westfale n blatt newspaper .
" such an escape from a position of responsibility , a state of office , i would find impossible to imagine had i not seen it . " the german media was also scathing in its reporting of stoiber 's decision .
the mass circulation tabloid bild called stoiber an " eternal ditherer " and said that he had " chickened out " of his responsibility and had fled to the safety of his home state leaving berlin and germany in chaos while " waving the white flag . " the bavarian state premier 's character was further assassinated by the business daily ha n delsblatt which accused stoiber of lacking any sense of duty , loyalty and reliability . " even with the best of intentions it 's impossible to find these qualities in stoiber 's behavior , " the paper wrote .
" it is astonishing that the csu obediently puts up with his actions . " " this is the end of the stoiber era - he gave the csu back its self-confidence and now he 's ruining it , " cried the süddeutsche zeitu n g which went on to describe stoiber as " a faltering figure , a spirit who does n't know what he wants . " csu to discuss stoiber 's style bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber 's approach is a concern for those who fear he may become a critic .
back in berlin , the conservative bloc hierarchy were looking into ways of limiting the damage of stoiber 's desertion and pre-empting any unwanted criticism he may be inclined to direct at the cdu .
the meeting was also likely to address stoiber 's style of politics and promotion ; a style that has alienated many party members and voters alike . in recent days , stoiber has made it clear that he has been extremely unhappy with the shape of the economics ministry he was supposed to head in a grand coalition .
the bavarian leader has openly complained that he wanted more portfolios for his super-ministry than just the research and education ministries he was granted by cdu leader angela merkel . fears bavaria n pm may rock coalitio n boat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber and merkel have had a strained relationship for some time .
as a result , the relationship between the two had soured in recent weeks , dredging up many feelings stoiber may have had about being passed over in favor of merkel after his unsuccessful 2002 election campaign .
some conservative leaders now fear that stoiber - once back in munich - might torpedo grand coalition talks with unqualified and unsolicited comments . but christian democrat senior member wolfgang bosbach ruled out such a scenario .
" any fears that edmund stoiber would cause berlin trouble as state premier in munich are unfounded , " bosbach told reporters .
" he remains in favor of a grand coalition just like those at the negotiating table . " despite this gloss , there is a fear among many in conservative circles that if stoiber is going down , he may want to take as many of his rivals with him .

" in that sense , we will check the accuracy of those reports .. then further define our stance . " he added that such prisons would go against the eu human rights charter and the international convention against torture , which all 25 eu members are obligated to abide . the washington post reported this week that the prisons are , or have been , located in eight countries including thailand , afghanistan and " several democracies in eastern europe " since the system was set up after the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks . the names of the eastern european countries were withheld by the post " at the request of senior us officials , " who argued that the disclosure might disrupt counterterrorism efforts .
thailand denied there was a prison there . meanwhile , the czech republic , slovakia , bulgaria , hungary have denied the presence of prisons .
poland refuses to comment and us-based ngo human rights watch has pointed to poland and romania as the most likeliest sites .
both countries , of which only poland is an eu member , have strong us ties and support the iraq war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the white house wo n't confirm or deny the existence of the prisons no confirmation , no denial white house officials refused to confirm the presence of secret prisons around the world , including one in an unnamed eastern european democracy - but they did n't deny it either . instead , president george w. bush 's national security adviser , stephen hadley , said the united states will do what is necessary to fight and win the war on terrorism . " the president has been very clear we 're doing that in a way that is consistent with our values and that is why he 's been very clear that the united states will not torture , " hadley told reporters .
" the united states will conduct its activities in compliance with law , -lrb- and -rrb- international obligations . " hadley and white house spokesman scott mcclellan refused to confirm or deny the post report .
" i would say that the president 's most important responsibility is to protect the american people , " mcclellan told reporters . the refusal to discuss the matter was echoed by us attorney general alberto gonzales and the central intelligence agency .
but former us president jimmy carter denounced what he said was " a profound and radical change in the basic policies or moral values of our country " in reaction to the report . " this is just one indication of what has been done under this administration to change the policies that have persisted all the way through our history , " said carter , who championed human rights during his 1977-1981 term as president . " gulag of our times " the existence of secret cia detention centers has long been claimed .
amnesty international denounced an " archipelago " of prisons in june as a " gulag of our times . " but the report that eastern european countries were among the locations is new . czech interior minister frantisek bublan was quoted by the online news outlet aktualne.cz as saying that the czech republic recently turned down a us request to set up a detention center on its territory . " the negotiations took place around a month ago , " he was quoted as saying .
the americans " made an effort to install something of the sort here , but they did not succeed . " separately , hungary 's intelligence chief , andras toth , said budapest had not been approached , telling afp that " the mere suggestion of this is absurd . " about 100 prisoners the cia has sent more than 100 suspects to the hidden global internment network , the post said , indicating that the number was a rough estimate and did not include prisoners picked up from iraq . about 30 of the detainees , considered major terrorism suspects , have been held at " black sites " organized by the cia in eastern europe and elsewhere , it said . locations in thailand and at guantanamo bay , cuba were closed in 2003 and 2004 , the paper said .
another in afghanistan known as the " salt pit " was moved inside bagram air base . over 70 other detainees - with less direct involvement in alleged terrorism and having limited intelligence value - have been delivered to intelligence services in egypt , jordan , morocco , afghanistan and other countries , the daily added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : isolation cells at the us prison in guantanamo bay , cuba the post said virtually nothing is known about who is kept in the secret facilities , what interrogation methods are employed , or how decisions are made about whether they should be detained or for how long . the covert prison system is " known only to a handful of officials in the united states and , usually , only to the president and a few top intelligence officers in each host country , " it said . the system has been increasingly debated within the cia where some consider it unsustainable and a diversion from its main espionage mission , the report said . the idea of holding suspects outside the us , where it is illegal to hold people in isolation and in secret prisons , was not under consideration before september 11 , former government officials told the paper . " the issue of detaining and interrogating people was never , ever discussed , " said one former senior cia intelligence officer .

the meeting was also likely to address stoiber 's style of politics and promotion ; a style that has alienated many party members and voters alike . in recent days , stoiber has made it clear that he has been extremely unhappy with the shape of the economics ministry he was supposed to head in a grand coalition .
the bavarian leader has openly complained that he wanted more portfolios for his super-ministry than just the research and education ministries he was granted by cdu leader angela merkel . fears bavaria n pm may rock coalitio n boat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber and merkel have had a strained relationship for some time .
as a result , the relationship between the two had soured in recent weeks , dredging up many feelings stoiber may have had about being passed over in favor of merkel after his unsuccessful 2002 election campaign .
some conservative leaders now fear that stoiber - once back in munich - might torpedo grand coalition talks with unqualified and unsolicited comments . but christian democrat senior member wolfgang bosbach ruled out such a scenario .
" any fears that edmund stoiber would cause berlin trouble as state premier in munich are unfounded , " bosbach told reporters .
" he remains in favor of a grand coalition just like those at the negotiating table . " despite this gloss , there is a fear among many in conservative circles that if stoiber is going down , he may want to take as many of his rivals with him .

" in that sense , we will check the accuracy of those reports .. then further define our stance . " he added that such prisons would go against the eu human rights charter and the international convention against torture , which all 25 eu members are obligated to abide . the washington post reported this week that the prisons are , or have been , located in eight countries including thailand , afghanistan and " several democracies in eastern europe " since the system was set up after the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks . the names of the eastern european countries were withheld by the post " at the request of senior us officials , " who argued that the disclosure might disrupt counterterrorism efforts .
thailand denied there was a prison there . meanwhile , the czech republic , slovakia , bulgaria , hungary have denied the presence of prisons .
poland refuses to comment and us-based ngo human rights watch has pointed to poland and romania as the most likeliest sites .
both countries , of which only poland is an eu member , have strong us ties and support the iraq war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the white house wo n't confirm or deny the existence of the prisons no confirmation , no denial white house officials refused to confirm the presence of secret prisons around the world , including one in an unnamed eastern european democracy - but they did n't deny it either . instead , president george w. bush 's national security adviser , stephen hadley , said the united states will do what is necessary to fight and win the war on terrorism . " the president has been very clear we 're doing that in a way that is consistent with our values and that is why he 's been very clear that the united states will not torture , " hadley told reporters .
" the united states will conduct its activities in compliance with law , -lrb- and -rrb- international obligations . " hadley and white house spokesman scott mcclellan refused to confirm or deny the post report .
" i would say that the president 's most important responsibility is to protect the american people , " mcclellan told reporters . the refusal to discuss the matter was echoed by us attorney general alberto gonzales and the central intelligence agency .
but former us president jimmy carter denounced what he said was " a profound and radical change in the basic policies or moral values of our country " in reaction to the report . " this is just one indication of what has been done under this administration to change the policies that have persisted all the way through our history , " said carter , who championed human rights during his 1977-1981 term as president . " gulag of our times " the existence of secret cia detention centers has long been claimed .
amnesty international denounced an " archipelago " of prisons in june as a " gulag of our times . " but the report that eastern european countries were among the locations is new . czech interior minister frantisek bublan was quoted by the online news outlet aktualne.cz as saying that the czech republic recently turned down a us request to set up a detention center on its territory . " the negotiations took place around a month ago , " he was quoted as saying .
the americans " made an effort to install something of the sort here , but they did not succeed . " separately , hungary 's intelligence chief , andras toth , said budapest had not been approached , telling afp that " the mere suggestion of this is absurd . " about 100 prisoners the cia has sent more than 100 suspects to the hidden global internment network , the post said , indicating that the number was a rough estimate and did not include prisoners picked up from iraq . about 30 of the detainees , considered major terrorism suspects , have been held at " black sites " organized by the cia in eastern europe and elsewhere , it said . locations in thailand and at guantanamo bay , cuba were closed in 2003 and 2004 , the paper said .
another in afghanistan known as the " salt pit " was moved inside bagram air base . over 70 other detainees - with less direct involvement in alleged terrorism and having limited intelligence value - have been delivered to intelligence services in egypt , jordan , morocco , afghanistan and other countries , the daily added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : isolation cells at the us prison in guantanamo bay , cuba the post said virtually nothing is known about who is kept in the secret facilities , what interrogation methods are employed , or how decisions are made about whether they should be detained or for how long . the covert prison system is " known only to a handful of officials in the united states and , usually , only to the president and a few top intelligence officers in each host country , " it said . the system has been increasingly debated within the cia where some consider it unsustainable and a diversion from its main espionage mission , the report said . the idea of holding suspects outside the us , where it is illegal to hold people in isolation and in secret prisons , was not under consideration before september 11 , former government officials told the paper . " the issue of detaining and interrogating people was never , ever discussed , " said one former senior cia intelligence officer .

struthof was located in the town of natzwiller in the eastern french region of alsace , which was annexed by germany during the war . some 22,000 men and women perished at the camp between may 1941 and november 1944 , when it was liberated by us forces .
most of the victims were members of the resistance and political deportees . a simple design barely visible from the outside , the memorial center is built around a vast underground potato shed , dug out by camp laborers from 1943 to 1945 and only unearthed when construction work began at the site two years ago . " in line with the wishes of survivors , it was designed as a simple , square building intended to convey information and emotion , not as a flashy structure " said the center 's director valerie drechsler . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conveying information and emotion without being ostentatious visitors are first taken on an interactive tour of the 14 nazi concentration camps set up in europe during the war , including auschwitz in poland , bergen-belsen in germany and mauthausen in austria . further inside , film clips shot under cover inside the struthof camp are projected alongside nazi propaganda footage , while a poem written by a deportee echoes in three languages around the dimly-lit underground chamber . documenting horror hundreds of press cuttings , drawings and witness accounts - original material as well as documents from museums and image banks - retrace the rise of fascism in the 1920s , as well as the growth of resistance movements in france and elsewhere in europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : struthof prisoners were supposed to disappear without a trace emerging from the center back into the light , the visitor finds himself in front of the gates of struthof . french architect pierre-louis faloci intended the play on light and shadow to be a reference to adolf hitler 's 1941 decree " nacht und nebel " -lrb- night and fog -rrb- , which led to the disappearance of countless political prisoners .
the detainees at struthof were known as " night-and-fog " prisoners : they were supposed to be swallowed by the dark and vanish without a trace . the european center for deported resistance fighters was mainly financed by the french defense ministry , with the remaining one-fifth provided by european union subsidies . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de köhler seeks to soothe wwii controversy at the start of a visit to poland tuesday , german president köhler spoke about a controversial center against war-time expulsions to be built in berlin - an issue that has offended historical sensitivities in poland .

the home secretary has asked for a vote on plans to extend the time suspects can be held without charge from 14 days to 90 days to be delayed by a week .
on wednesday , ministers won a commons vote on plans to outlaw indirect incitement of terror by just one vote .
it was the government 's smallest majority since coming to power in 1997 .
' urgent talks ' however , the conservatives , liberal democrats and some labour mps oppose the plans to extend the detention time limit to 90 days .
civil liberties campaigners say the move would effectively bring back internment .
mr clarke told mps that police and prosecutors had made a " compelling case " for extending the limit because of the complexity and volume of evidence in terrorism cases .
anti-terror proposals have faced stiff opposition and he promised to look at new safeguards , such as a senior judge supervising the process .
acknowledging there was no consensus on his plans , mr clarke said he hoped to return with new proposals when the terrorism bill is debated in the commons again next week .
" my proposal is that we engage in urgent discussions with colleagues on all sides of the house to see if we can reach consensus on a figure beyond 14 days , " said mr clarke .
labour mp david winnick , who led backbench opposition to the plans , withdrew his attempt to force through a compromise time limit of 28 days .
have your say i would welcome tougher laws robert neve , newport , uk send us your comments but he warned : " if it 's a question of 90 days being dropped to 80 days or 75 days , i believe that is totally unacceptable . "
the conservatives and lib dems welcomed the pledge of all-party talks .
tory shadow attorney general dominic grieve said he regretted the government had only moved when it appeared to be facing defeat .
and liberal democrat spokesman mark oaten said the terrorism plans were now " in tatters " .
" the home secretary should act now to amend this illiberal and dangerous piece of legislation , " he said .
vote missed earlier , 33 labour mps rebelled against the government over plans for a new offence of indirect incitement or glorification of terrorism .
the government , which normally has a majority of 66 , won the vote by 300 to 299 - tony blair 's slimmest majority .
it later emerged that lib dem frontbencher vince cable had missed the crunch vote which the government won by just one vote .
mr cable told bbc news he had wanted to vote .
but he had gone to see a large group of trade justice protesters who could not get through commons security and then been unable to return to parliament in time for the vote .
the mp , who said he had taken part in other terror laws ' votes , said he had written to the commons authorities to complain about the " preposterous " security arrangements .

" you only leave twice , " is how the sun headlines the departure of the work and pensions secretary .
david aaronovich , writing in the times , says mr blunkett 's " political nous seems to have disintegrated " .
but the paper points out the hardship of life without ministerial perks will be cushioned by drawing a second £ 18,000 redundancy payment in a year .
the daily express points out that the former minister 's " colourful life " was responsible for his problems , making him the architect of his own downfall .
but the daily mail says many will still feel a pang of pity over the tragedy that he brought on himself .
the paper adds that , in a government full of pygmies , mr blunkett stood out as a genuine heavyweight .
' day from hell ' for many papers , the real story behind david blunkett 's resignation is its consequences for tony blair .
the morning star says the two men were bound by a " devotion to new labour 's tendency to trample over all that labour used to stand for " .
meanwhile , " blair 's power drains away " is the stark warning that forms the daily telegraph 's main headline .
and the independent says mr blair is battling to restore his battered authority after his " day from hell " .
the daily mirror likens the " panic " around the resignation to the end of john major 's " shambolic " administration .
and the guardian says mr blair 's future is bleak .
its leader article says : " all prime ministers run out of credit in the end .
this one is in trouble . "
however , the financial times says by appointing john hutton , a leading moderniser , it is clear that mr blair still plans to pursue radical welfare system reforms .

one copy protection system analysed by coder mark russinovich uses cloaked files to hide deep inside windows .
the difficult uninstallation process left mr russinovich saying that sony 's anti-piracy efforts had gone " too far " .
in response to criticism , sony bmg said it would provide tools to users and security firms that would reveal the hidden files .
search history mr russinovich , a renowned windows programming expert , came across the sony bmg anti-piracy system when performing a scan of his computer with a utility he co-created that spots so-called rootkits .
rootkits are starting to be used by a small number of computer virus writers because they allow malicious code to be inserted deep inside the windows operating system , meaning that it will not be spotted by most anti-virus scanners .
rootkits are used to hide malicious software once it is installed and ensure it is not found and removed by anti-virus programs after extensive analysis mr russinovich realised that the " cloaked " software had been installed when he first listened to the cd album get right with the man cd by country rockers van zant .
although resembling a virus , mr russinovich found the hidden files had come from an anti-copying system called extended copy protection -lrb- xcp -rrb- developed by uk software company first 4 internet .
about 20 titles are thought to be using the xcp software and in may 2005 sony said more than two million discs had been shipped using the technology .
xcp is just one of several anti-piracy systems sony is trying .
xcp only allows three copies of an album to be made and only allows the cd to be listened to on a computer via a proprietary media player .
the hidden files are installed alongside the media player .
the cd plays normally on a hi-fi system and the copy protection does not affect computers running on apple mac or linux operating systems .
in some countries cd piracy is rampant ridding his computer of xcp proved difficult and briefly crippled mr russinovich 's cd player .
writing in his blog about the incident , he said : " not only had sony put software on my system that uses techniques commonly used by malware to mask its presence , the software is poorly written and provides no means for uninstall . "
mr russinovich said the licence agreement that he accepted when he first listened to the cd made no mention of the fact that he could not uninstall the program or of the significant changes it made to his computer .
if sony bmg released xcp copy-protected cds in the uk this oversight could leave the music company open to prosecution under the computer misuse act because it made " unauthorised " changes to a machine , said net law expert nick lockett .
" there would be no problem if there 's a big screen coming up saying as part of the anti-piracy measures this cd will amend your operating system , " he said .
mr lockett added that sony might be inadvertently provoking piracy as consumers irritated by the anti-copying system rip the tracks to get around the restrictions .
virus link mr russinovich feared that diligent users trying to keep their systems clean of viruses could stumble across the hidden xcp files , delete them and inadvertently cripple their computer .
his worries were echoed by mikko hypponen , chief research officer at finnish security firm f-secure , who has been looking into xcp since he first came across it in late september .
" what we are scared of is when we find a new virus written by someone that relies on the fact that this -lsb- xcp -rsb- software is running on tens of thousands of computers around the world , " he said .
" the rootkit would hide that virus from pretty much any anti-virus program out there . "
unauthorised changes are outlawed under uk law mathew gilliat-smith , chief executive of first 4 internet , said the techniques used to hide xcp were used by many other programs and added that there was no evidence that viruses were being written that took advantage of xcp .
he said the debate on the net sparked by mr russinovich 's work had prompted the company to release information to anti-virus companies to help them correctly spot the hidden xcp files .
consumers can also contact sony bmg for the patch to unveil , rather than remove , the hidden files .
he said that users were adequately warned about the copy protection software in the licence agreement and were told that it used proprietary software to play the cd .
" it 's clearly packaged on the cd that its copy-protected , " he said .
a spokesman for sony bmg said the licence agreement was explicit about what was being installed and how to go about removing it .
it referred technical questions to first 4 internet .
mr gilliat-smith said mr russinovich had problems removing xcp because he tried to do it manually something that was not a " recommended action " .
instead , said mr gilliat-smith , he should have contacted sony bmg which gives consumers advice about how to remove the software .
getting the software removed involves filling in a form on the sony website , visiting a unique url and agreeing to have another program downloaded on to a user 's pc that then does the uninstallation .
he added that first 4 internet had had no complaints about xcp since it started being used eight months ago .
he also added that the latest generation of xcp no longer used cloaked files to do its job .
" we 've moved away from using that sort of methodology , " he said .

" it 's clearly packaged on the cd that its copy-protected , " he said .
a spokesman for sony bmg said the licence agreement was explicit about what was being installed and how to go about removing it .
it referred technical questions to first 4 internet .
mr gilliat-smith said mr russinovich had problems removing xcp because he tried to do it manually something that was not a " recommended action " .
instead , said mr gilliat-smith , he should have contacted sony bmg which gives consumers advice about how to remove the software .
getting the software removed involves filling in a form on the sony website , visiting a unique url and agreeing to have another program downloaded on to a user 's pc that then does the uninstallation .
he added that first 4 internet had had no complaints about xcp since it started being used eight months ago .
he also added that the latest generation of xcp no longer used cloaked files to do its job .
" we 've moved away from using that sort of methodology , " he said .

one copy protection system analysed by coder mark russinovich uses cloaked files to hide deep inside windows .
the difficult uninstallation process left mr russinovich saying that sony 's anti-piracy efforts had gone " too far " .
in response to criticism , sony bmg said it would provide tools to users and security firms that would reveal the hidden files .
search history mr russinovich , a renowned windows programming expert , came across the sony bmg anti-piracy system when performing a scan of his computer with a utility he co-created that spots so-called rootkits .
rootkits are starting to be used by a small number of computer virus writers because they allow malicious code to be inserted deep inside the windows operating system , meaning that it will not be spotted by most anti-virus scanners .
rootkits are used to hide malicious software once it is installed and ensure it is not found and removed by anti-virus programs after extensive analysis mr russinovich realised that the " cloaked " software had been installed when he first listened to the cd album get right with the man cd by country rockers van zant .
although resembling a virus , mr russinovich found the hidden files had come from an anti-copying system called extended copy protection -lrb- xcp -rrb- developed by uk software company first 4 internet .
about 20 titles are thought to be using the xcp software and in may 2005 sony said more than two million discs had been shipped using the technology .
xcp is just one of several anti-piracy systems sony is trying .
xcp only allows three copies of an album to be made and only allows the cd to be listened to on a computer via a proprietary media player .
the hidden files are installed alongside the media player .
the cd plays normally on a hi-fi system and the copy protection does not affect computers running on apple mac or linux operating systems .
in some countries cd piracy is rampant ridding his computer of xcp proved difficult and briefly crippled mr russinovich 's cd player .
writing in his blog about the incident , he said : " not only had sony put software on my system that uses techniques commonly used by malware to mask its presence , the software is poorly written and provides no means for uninstall . "
mr russinovich said the licence agreement that he accepted when he first listened to the cd made no mention of the fact that he could not uninstall the program or of the significant changes it made to his computer .
if sony bmg released xcp copy-protected cds in the uk this oversight could leave the music company open to prosecution under the computer misuse act because it made " unauthorised " changes to a machine , said net law expert nick lockett .
" there would be no problem if there 's a big screen coming up saying as part of the anti-piracy measures this cd will amend your operating system , " he said .
mr lockett added that sony might be inadvertently provoking piracy as consumers irritated by the anti-copying system rip the tracks to get around the restrictions .
virus link mr russinovich feared that diligent users trying to keep their systems clean of viruses could stumble across the hidden xcp files , delete them and inadvertently cripple their computer .
his worries were echoed by mikko hypponen , chief research officer at finnish security firm f-secure , who has been looking into xcp since he first came across it in late september .
" what we are scared of is when we find a new virus written by someone that relies on the fact that this -lsb- xcp -rsb- software is running on tens of thousands of computers around the world , " he said .
" the rootkit would hide that virus from pretty much any anti-virus program out there . "
unauthorised changes are outlawed under uk law mathew gilliat-smith , chief executive of first 4 internet , said the techniques used to hide xcp were used by many other programs and added that there was no evidence that viruses were being written that took advantage of xcp .
he said the debate on the net sparked by mr russinovich 's work had prompted the company to release information to anti-virus companies to help them correctly spot the hidden xcp files .
consumers can also contact sony bmg for the patch to unveil , rather than remove , the hidden files .

he said the debate on the net sparked by mr russinovich 's work had prompted the company to release information to anti-virus companies to help them correctly spot the hidden xcp files .
consumers can also contact sony bmg for the patch to unveil , rather than remove , the hidden files .
he said that users were adequately warned about the copy protection software in the licence agreement and were told that it used proprietary software to play the cd .
" it 's clearly packaged on the cd that its copy-protected , " he said .
a spokesman for sony bmg said the licence agreement was explicit about what was being installed and how to go about removing it .
it referred technical questions to first 4 internet .
mr gilliat-smith said mr russinovich had problems removing xcp because he tried to do it manually something that was not a " recommended action " .
instead , said mr gilliat-smith , he should have contacted sony bmg which gives consumers advice about how to remove the software .
getting the software removed involves filling in a form on the sony website , visiting a unique url and agreeing to have another program downloaded on to a user 's pc that then does the uninstallation .
he added that first 4 internet had had no complaints about xcp since it started being used eight months ago .
he also added that the latest generation of xcp no longer used cloaked files to do its job .
" we 've moved away from using that sort of methodology , " he said .

one copy protection system analysed by coder mark russinovich uses cloaked files to hide deep inside windows .
the difficult uninstallation process left mr russinovich saying that sony 's anti-piracy efforts had gone " too far " .
in response to criticism , sony bmg said it would provide tools to users and security firms that would reveal the hidden files .
search history mr russinovich , a renowned windows programming expert , came across the sony bmg anti-piracy system when performing a scan of his computer with a utility he co-created that spots so-called rootkits .
rootkits are starting to be used by a small number of computer virus writers because they allow malicious code to be inserted deep inside the windows operating system , meaning that it will not be spotted by most anti-virus scanners .
rootkits are used to hide malicious software once it is installed and ensure it is not found and removed by anti-virus programs after extensive analysis mr russinovich realised that the " cloaked " software had been installed when he first listened to the cd album get right with the man cd by country rockers van zant .
although resembling a virus , mr russinovich found the hidden files had come from an anti-copying system called extended copy protection -lrb- xcp -rrb- developed by uk software company first 4 internet .
about 20 titles are thought to be using the xcp software and in may 2005 sony said more than two million discs had been shipped using the technology .
xcp is just one of several anti-piracy systems sony is trying .
xcp only allows three copies of an album to be made and only allows the cd to be listened to on a computer via a proprietary media player .
the hidden files are installed alongside the media player .
the cd plays normally on a hi-fi system and the copy protection does not affect computers running on apple mac or linux operating systems .
in some countries cd piracy is rampant ridding his computer of xcp proved difficult and briefly crippled mr russinovich 's cd player .
writing in his blog about the incident , he said : " not only had sony put software on my system that uses techniques commonly used by malware to mask its presence , the software is poorly written and provides no means for uninstall . "
mr russinovich said the licence agreement that he accepted when he first listened to the cd made no mention of the fact that he could not uninstall the program or of the significant changes it made to his computer .
if sony bmg released xcp copy-protected cds in the uk this oversight could leave the music company open to prosecution under the computer misuse act because it made " unauthorised " changes to a machine , said net law expert nick lockett .
" there would be no problem if there 's a big screen coming up saying as part of the anti-piracy measures this cd will amend your operating system , " he said .
mr lockett added that sony might be inadvertently provoking piracy as consumers irritated by the anti-copying system rip the tracks to get around the restrictions .
virus link mr russinovich feared that diligent users trying to keep their systems clean of viruses could stumble across the hidden xcp files , delete them and inadvertently cripple their computer .
his worries were echoed by mikko hypponen , chief research officer at finnish security firm f-secure , who has been looking into xcp since he first came across it in late september .
" what we are scared of is when we find a new virus written by someone that relies on the fact that this -lsb- xcp -rsb- software is running on tens of thousands of computers around the world , " he said .
" the rootkit would hide that virus from pretty much any anti-virus program out there . "

mathew gilliat-smith , chief executive of first 4 internet , said the techniques used to hide xcp were used by many other programs and added that there was no evidence that viruses were being written that took advantage of xcp .
he said the debate on the net sparked by mr russinovich 's work had prompted the company to release information to anti-virus companies to help them correctly spot the hidden xcp files .
consumers can also contact sony bmg for the patch to unveil , rather than remove , the hidden files .
he said that users were adequately warned about the copy protection software in the licence agreement and were told that it used proprietary software to play the cd .
" it 's clearly packaged on the cd that its copy-protected , " he said .
a spokesman for sony bmg said the licence agreement was explicit about what was being installed and how to go about removing it .
it referred technical questions to first 4 internet .
mr gilliat-smith said mr russinovich had problems removing xcp because he tried to do it manually something that was not a " recommended action " .
instead , said mr gilliat-smith , he should have contacted sony bmg which gives consumers advice about how to remove the software .
getting the software removed involves filling in a form on the sony website , visiting a unique url and agreeing to have another program downloaded on to a user 's pc that then does the uninstallation .
he added that first 4 internet had had no complaints about xcp since it started being used eight months ago .
he also added that the latest generation of xcp no longer used cloaked files to do its job .
" we 've moved away from using that sort of methodology , " he said .

this earliest group of stars , called population iii , probably formed from primordial gas less than 200 million years after the big bang .
these objects can not be seen by any present or planned telescopes .
nasa scientists detected the stars from the imprint they have left on the general glow of infrared radiation dispersed throughout the cosmos . "
these first stars ... were huge thermonuclear furnaces ; few and far between , but they burned ferociously " alexander kashlinsky , nasa goddard space flight center this glow , which is composed of radiation from stars past and present , is known as the cosmic infrared background -lrb- cib -rrb- .
the observations used in the latest study were made by the infrared array camera -lrb- irac -rrb- on the us space agency 's spitzer space telescope .
the results present the first evidence for cessation of the so-called cosmic dark ages .
the term , coined by the english astronomer royal , sir martin rees , refers to the period in cosmic history when hydrogen and helium atoms had formed but had not yet had the opportunity to condense and ignite as stars .
blazing into existence the first stars after the dark ages were probably composed solely of hydrogen , helium and a little lithium .
after blazing into existence , their lives would have been intense and short , burning up their hydrogen in only a few million years .
energy radiated by the population iii stars must have contributed to the cib ; the problem for researchers is that many more much younger stars have also contributed .
in order to isolate a signal from the earliest stars , alexander kashlinsky and his colleagues at nasa 's goddard space flight center in maryland carefully removed the contributions from other stars and galaxies to the cib .
" it took us a year to remove the signal sufficiently accurately in order to convince ourselves there was something out there that could not be explained by anything else we could think of , " dr kashlinsky told the bbc news website .
the team discovered clustering in the distribution of infrared light over and above that expected from the combined effect of known galaxies .
in fact , the total contribution of foreground galaxies is small compared with the residual signal ascribed by the authors to the primordial stars .
massive stars in order to contribute this large signal , the primordial stars must have been extremely massive , in the region of hundreds of solar masses , dr kashlinsky explained .
" it seems these first stars were quite unlike those we see today .
they were huge thermonuclear furnaces ; few and far between , but they burned ferociously because they were so massive , " dr kashlinsky explained .
the distribution of cosmic infrared light suggests these stars were clustered together , which might be partially explained if they were around only for a short time - perhaps a few hundred million years .
it is believed that these earliest stars manufactured the metals that would become important for later populations of stars .
however , other researchers wondered whether the analysis had missed , for example , foreground galaxies with low luminosities .
richard ellis , of the california institute of technology -lrb- caltech -rrb- , in pasadena , said that " even a minor blunder in removing these foreground signals might lead to a spurious result " .
he added : " a number of untested assumptions involved in allowing for unobserved galaxies could represent a weakness in the analysis . "

the term , coined by the english astronomer royal , sir martin rees , refers to the period in cosmic history when hydrogen and helium atoms had formed but had not yet had the opportunity to condense and ignite as stars .
blazing into existence the first stars after the dark ages were probably composed solely of hydrogen , helium and a little lithium .
after blazing into existence , their lives would have been intense and short , burning up their hydrogen in only a few million years .
nasa 's spitzer infrared telescope more details energy radiated by the population iii stars must have contributed to the cib ; the problem for researchers is that many more much younger stars have also contributed .
in order to isolate a signal from the earliest stars , alexander kashlinsky and his colleagues at nasa 's goddard space flight center in maryland carefully removed the contributions from other stars and galaxies to the cib .
" it took us a year to remove the signal sufficiently accurately in order to convince ourselves there was something out there that could not be explained by anything else we could think of , " dr kashlinsky told the bbc news website .
the team discovered clustering in the distribution of infrared light over and above that expected from the combined effect of known galaxies .
in fact , the total contribution of foreground galaxies is small compared with the residual signal ascribed by the authors to the primordial stars .
massive stars in order to contribute this large signal , the primordial stars must have been extremely massive , in the region of hundreds of solar masses , dr kashlinsky explained .
" it seems these first stars were quite unlike those we see today .
they were huge thermonuclear furnaces ; few and far between , but they burned ferociously because they were so massive , " dr kashlinsky explained .
the distribution of cosmic infrared light suggests these stars were clustered together , which might be partially explained if they were around only for a short time - perhaps a few hundred million years .
it is believed that these earliest stars manufactured the metals that would become important for later populations of stars .
however , other researchers wondered whether the analysis had missed , for example , foreground galaxies with low luminosities .
richard ellis , of the california institute of technology -lrb- caltech -rrb- , in pasadena , said that " even a minor blunder in removing these foreground signals might lead to a spurious result " .
he added : " a number of untested assumptions involved in allowing for unobserved galaxies could represent a weakness in the analysis . "

last week the international organisation for migration launched a " safe journey " campaign in zimbabwe , with help from some of the country 's best-known musicians , to make would-be migrants aware of the dangers involved .
rejoice mkwananzi -lrb- not her real name -rrb- , 49 , gave up her position as deputy head teacher of an infant school in zimbabwe and moved to israel to be a maid so that she could support her extended family .
when i left zimbabwe in 1999 i was the acting head teacher at a very respected junior school .
i was in charge of 45 other teachers and would have soon been promoted to head teacher .
basically at that time wages were too low - and then it was so much better than it is now .
i wish i could do a proper job - doing this is killing me mentally and i have developed a low self-esteem .
almost half of my salary would go to the taxman .
i then had my mortgage to pay for , my car , my various policies and at the end of it all i was left with almost nothing .
it was so hard to make ends meet .
it felt as though the moment i received my salary , it was all gone .
my life was hand-to-mouth .
my sister had recently died tragically and her two children were left all alone .
the way our society works is that the family steps in and takes over caring and providing as needed .
and so instead of supporting myself and my poor-in-health mother , i now had to provide for my sister 's two little girls too .
if i had stayed at home i would n't have managed .
initial intentions at that time the situation in zimbabwe was really desperate .
now though , when i look back it was not all that bad !
rejoice lives in a town near tel aviv i met a cousin of mine who had a job in israel and she told me that the family that she had been working for were looking for someone to help them .
i was just lucky .
the family paid for all my relocation expenses to where they live near tel aviv and sorted out a work permit for me .
my initial intentions were just to stay a year .
but things , back home , went from bad to worse and now i do n't see myself going back .
well not soon anyway .
i do n't see how that would be possible .
money the work is so depressing .
i never thought i would find myself doing these jobs .
i clean the house , look after the children when they come home from school , sometimes i cook , i do everything .
i leave my apartment at half-seven in the morning and get home at nine in the evening , and between those hours i am constantly on my feet .
i only start work at the family 's home in the afternoon but to make more money i spend my mornings going about cleaning in different places .
some of the people are welcoming and good to me but the woman that i mainly work for , i could n't call her exactly warm .
when i first arrived i used to share a three-bedroom apartment with a ghanaian and a kenyan .
it was really difficult though and i had to be so accommodating .
people are different - our cultures , the food we eat and how it smells , manners and all that .
i could n't get used to it .
i am an independent woman and had always lived on my own , apart from when i was married .
and so as soon as i could i found myself a one-bedroom apartment to rent .
lonely it is better to have my own space but i am lonely .
one does not have a social life living here .
there are several zimbabweans and south africans that i am friends with - we all stick together .
rejoice says the thought of bombs makes her fearful of travelling on buses they normally visit over our weekends - from friday afternoons till saturday .
but few of them have the correct papers and so are too frightened to go out in case the police stop them .
instead we meet in people 's houses .
when i go around town i am sometimes nervous of a bomb going off .
there was a time two , three years ago when we would have to carry gas masks .
and you feel frightened taking buses , because of the bombing .
you can feel tensions amongst crowds of people .
nothing bad has happened to me .
god has really protected me .
phone home i miss home , so much .
i applied and was given political asylum and so i can not go home , not even for a holiday .
if i went , i would not be allowed back .
i wish i could do a proper job - doing this is killing me mentally and i have developed a low self-esteem .
i love children and would give anything to be able to teach once more .
my mother is physically very ill but is so strong mentally .
i phone home once a week and she tells me to think of what i have achieved .
i have achieved a lot and it makes me happy that i can support my mother and nieces but i am living for my family .
i do n't even have a boyfriend !
my family depend on me for everything .
i send them money to pay all their bills , pay for the school fees .
i make sure my mother can pay to see a private doctor , and that she has all her medications .
they depend on me left , right and centre .
i hope all the things happening in zimbabwe end soon .
i want to go home and live the kind of life that i used to have .

derbyshire wildlife trust is asking people to help them find out exactly how many otters are around the city .
wildlife officers say evidence of the creatures has been found both north and south of the river derwent .
phillip precey from the trust said otters virtually disappeared in the middle of the last century , because of pesticides and poor water quality .
he added : " as pesticides are no longer used , the water quality 's coming up , the rivers are a lot better now and as the fish come back , so the otters will come back . "
otters are mainly nocturnal , but evidence of their presence can be found via their droppings .
" they look a bit like cigar ash and they smell of jasmine tea , and they 're made of fish bones and fish scales - so once seen , never forgotten . "
mr precey said .
anyone who sees either an otter or their droppings should contact derbyshire wildlife trust .

it is aimed at those aged 11 to 25 , who did not catch mumps when they were younger , or received the vaccine , which was introduced in 1988 .
there have been 3,000 reported cases of mumps so far this year .
in 2001 there were just 72 cases .
free mmr jabs will be offered at universities and gp surgeries .
public health experts have warned that many young people are at risk of contracting mumps because they have not been given the combined measles , mumps and rubella vaccination .
mumps facts mumps is an acute viral illness transmitted by contact with saliva from infected people symptoms begin with a headache and fever in some cases mumps has been linked with sterility in adolescent and adult males the campaign will offer two doses of mmr vaccine to those still in schools and up to 18 years of age , and one dose of mmr to those between 18 and 25 who are not sure whether they have received the jab before .
the mmr immunisation is estimated to protect about 95 % of people who receive one dose , and around 99 % of those who receive two doses .
dr richard roberts , head of the immunisation programme at the national public health service for wales , said it was a very safe vaccine and was a good opportunity for many vulnerable young people to get protection from measles , mumps and rubella .

the measures were due to be debated earlier this week , but were delayed due to concern among some state leaders that they threatened civil liberties .
the move comes a day after leader john howard announced an amendment to existing laws , in light of specific intelligence of a possible attack .
the amendment was passed by the senate on thursday .
australia has not experienced a major terrorist attack on its soil , although australians overseas have been targeted in blasts in indonesia .
there is growing concern that an attack may take place closer to home , with the australian newspaper saying on thursday that the cities of sydney and melbourne were on " terror alert " .
' strongest position possible ' attorney-general philip ruddock introduced the counter-terrorism bill to parliament on thursday , following behind-the-scenes assurances on a few key areas of concern .
" the bill ensures that we are in the strongest position possible to prevent new and emerging threats , to stop terrorists carrying out their intended acts , " mr ruddock told parliament .
the proposed measures include allowing security forces to hold terror suspects without charge for up to 14 days .
security services will also be able to track people suspected of involvement with terrorist groups for up to a year .
the bill 's passage was held up on tuesday , due to concern by backbenchers and state leaders .
in light of their fears , the government has said it will re-examine what constitutes incitement to a terrorist attack , as well as rules relating to preventative detention orders .
a planned shoot-to-kill provision for police is also expected to be watered down .
the government hopes the bill will become law by christmas .
amendment meanwhile an amendment to the existing anti-terror laws was rushed through the house of representatives on wednesday .
it was then passed by a special sitting of the senate on thursday .
the amendment replaces the word " the " with " a " in the definition of a terrorism offence , to clarify that it is not necessary to identify a particular terrorist act .
it also means that people can be charged for considering a terrorist attack , even if they had not yet decided on its timing and location .
mr howard said on wednesday that he had received specific intelligence of a possible attack , but could give no further details for operational reasons .
according to the australian newspaper , the intelligence relates to home-grown terrorist suspects in melbourne and sydney , who are believed to be building the capability to mount an attack .
mr howard 's announcement caused anxiety , but the lack of detail in the warning prompted some politicians to cast doubt on the seriousness of the threat .
opposition parties said the timing of wednesday 's warning was a political ploy to divert attention from both the main anti-terror laws and unpopular labour laws introduced to parliament on wednesday .
" i think it 's convenient for the government to constantly keep people fearful about the terrorist threat to this country , " said democrats leader lynn allison .
but mr howard told a sydney radio station on thursday that " the idea that yesterday was some giant manipulative conspiracy is ridiculous " .

blunkett affair was damaging the prime minister while most in westminster had been transfixed by the drama surrounding david blunkett 's departure , a potentially far more damaging scene was being acted out in the commons as the prime minister 's flagship anti-terror laws were being torn to pieces .
first , his large majority was slashed to just one and then his home secretary was forced to withdraw proposals for 90 day detention to stop them being defeated by mps .
the thing that unites these events is that they were both pretty inevitable and , many labour mps now argue , preventable by any prime minister who retained full authority and a sure touch .
the fact that tony blair failed to prevent them has only served to fan the flames surrounding his own position - already seen as weakened in the wake of cabinet revolts , splits and near open warfare .
so mr blair faced his cabinet on thursday morning once again having to urge his team to focus on the big picture - notably securing his so-called legacy reforms .
he tried to stiffen their spines by admitting things were tough because he was doing the right thing on welfare reform , terrorism , public servcies and so on .
but he gave no sign he believed things were tough for his own leadership .
real business it all started when mr blunkett left the cabinet for the second time in a year declaring he did it for the good of the government and tony blair 's premiership .
his simple " mistake " of breaking the ministerial code was proving a massive distraction from the real business of government and was embarrassing the prime minister , he declared .
clarke was forced to climb down he had done nothing wrong and there had been any number of lies and innuendoes spread about his business and private life .
in a charged press conference he gave the impression of a man who , under other circumstances , would have continued to fight his corner against his enemies , who he suggested were as much in the media as on the tory benches .
but it was the prime minister people really wanted to target , he said , and he clearly was n't about to help them by staying .
he was certainly right about that , and the damage his continuing presence in the cabinet was doing to tony blair .
and whether he decided to quit after a long and interrupted heart-to-heart with the prime minister on wednesday morning , or whether he was sacked as some suspect , there will still be questions over how serious and lasting that damage has been .
open revolt the prime minister 's continuing support for his friend and ally had worried many on the labour benches who believed mr blunkett had lost his bearings and become dangerously accident prone and unable to see the problems caused by his own actions .
the longer the prime minister stuck to him , the more the prime minister would be attacked for losing his own judgement , and authority , they feared .
blair was reluctant to lose his friend and so it was when , just an hour after mr blunkett 's resignation was officially announced , mr blair was under personal attack from michael howard on precisely those grounds .
only hours later , there was what many saw as a prime example of that waning authority as labour mps humiliated the government over its anti-terror laws .
so , while mr blunkett 's resignation may have been another personal tragedy for him , it has helped push the prime minister closer towards what many fear may become a genuine crisis of leadership .
in just a few days , mr blair has seen some of his cabinet in open revolt over his education reforms , a major ministerial split over a smoking ban , continued rumblings against his wider welfare reforms and speculation over his allegedly dwindling authority .

the prime minister needed and trusted mr blunkett to push through his keynote reforms of the welfare state .
and he showed great loyalty to him over both episodes which led to mr blunkett 's resignations - a trait some feared would damage him .
the fact this all happened at the time the prime minister was already under pressure , with many on his own side said to be looking beyond the end of his premiership , added to the worries .

the sample was 100 million times more likely to come from bradley murdoch than from anybody else , said british forensic expert jonathan whitaker .
mr murdoch denies kidnap and the murder of ms lees ' boyfriend peter falconio .
dr whitaker said the sample came from adhesive on the inner layer of tape taken from inside the cable ties .
mr falconio , from huddersfield , west yorkshire , has not been seen since july 2001 when the couple 's campervan was flagged down on a remote road north of alice springs .
" the profile matched mr murdoch 's , " dr whitaker told the court in darwin , northern territory .
he said : " if the dna originated from an unknown person unrelated to mr murdoch , a fair and reasonable estimate -lsb- of that -rsb- would be one in 100 million .
" that means it 's 100 million times more likely to get that dna profile if it came from mr murdoch than from somebody else . "

the us is considering giving overseas firms more input into key decisions such as route selection and marketing to encourage them to invest capital .
some us carriers have sought bankruptcy protection after recording huge losses .
the move comes as the us and europe try to reach agreement on liberalising transatlantic traffic .
active investors discussions over a so-called " open skies " agreement resumed last month after stalling for several years .
a fresh round of talks - which stumbled over european demands for greater access to us destinations - takes place later this month . "
no strategic investor is going to come in if he is required to remain in a passive position " jeffrey shane , us transportation department undersecretary current regulations limit the degree of influence which foreign investors can have over us airlines .
the 49 % cap on foreign ownership of us carriers or the 25 % limit on voting rights are not up for discussion , the us says .
however , it is seeking ways of allowing foreign firms to have a bigger say in the decision making of us airlines .
" no strategic investor is going to come in if he is required to remain in a passive position , " jeffrey shane , an undersecretary at the transportation department , said .
" we think that by facilitating more participation by non-us citizens , we enhance the flow of capital to us airlines . "
financial turmoil the proposed changes would only apply to investors in countries with existing aviation agreements with the us and which permit us investment in their own domestic airlines .
the us aviation industry has been in financial crisis since the 11 september terrorist attacks , its problems compounded by soaring oil prices , fluctuating demand and huge labour costs .
combined losses across the industry could total $ 10bn this year .
united airlines , delta airlines , us airways and northwest have all been forced into bankruptcy protection as they try to sort out their finances .
despite the industry 's financial problems , washington has baulked at relaxing the ownership rules governing the industry , citing safety and national security concerns .
unions have argued that foreign ownership could threaten jobs and employment rights .
current regulations require two-thirds of the directors and executive officers of us airlines to be us citizens .
