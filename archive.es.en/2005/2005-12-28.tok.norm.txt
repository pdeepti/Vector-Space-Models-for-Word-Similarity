today , the stars have been replaced by satellites . orbiting at a distance of some 23,000 kilometers above the earth ’ s surface , several dozen satellites , many sent up in the late 1950s and 1960s by the united states and the soviet union for military use , provide ships and planes with a global navigation system .
in the last 10 years , the number of satellites used for commercial purposes has increased rapidly , but the united states still dominates the field , and the pentagon controls access .
all that will change in the next few years with the launch of galileo , the european global satellite navigation system .
the giove-a satellite - the first in what will eventually become a constellation of 30 satellites encircling the globe - is scheduled for launch on wednesday morning .
a global service industry when galileo becomes fully operational , people anywhere in the world will be able to rely on the esa ’ s satellite technology for personal navigation .
in northern norway , for example , where there is no possibility of accessing global navigation systems because the current satellite network does not cover the region , a combination of galileo and special mobile phones will enable people to determine their exact position , down to the very meter , free of charge .

a transport company , for instance , will be able to keep track of where each one of its trucks is located , while the truck drivers themselves rely on galileo to help them navigate through foreign cities .
europe 's biggest infrastructure project ever , galileo is lead by the european space agency and the firm galileo industries , a germany-based consortium that includes european space industry giants like eads , alcatel and alenia spazio .
by the time operations of the 30-satellite constellation begin , the eu will have invested approximately 3.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.5 billion -rrb- in this ambitious project .
galileo creates employment opportunities global navigation is rapidly becoming a lucrative market .
the european states participating in the galileo project are expecting big returns on their investment .

today , the stars have been replaced by satellites . orbiting at a distance of some 23,000 kilometers above the earth ’ s surface , several dozen satellites , many sent up in the late 1950s and 1960s by the united states and the soviet union for military use , provide ships and planes with a global navigation system .
in the last 10 years , the number of satellites used for commercial purposes has increased rapidly , but the united states still dominates the field , and the pentagon controls access .
all that will change in the next few years with the launch of galileo , the european global satellite navigation system .
the giove-a satellite - the first in what will eventually become a constellation of 30 satellites encircling the globe - is scheduled for launch on wednesday morning .
a global service industry when galileo becomes fully operational , people anywhere in the world will be able to rely on the esa ’ s satellite technology for personal navigation .
in northern norway , for example , where there is no possibility of accessing global navigation systems because the current satellite network does not cover the region , a combination of galileo and special mobile phones will enable people to determine their exact position , down to the very meter , free of charge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : personal navigation systems may change the way we travel commercial channels , on the other hand , will charge a fee for their use .
a transport company , for instance , will be able to keep track of where each one of its trucks is located , while the truck drivers themselves rely on galileo to help them navigate through foreign cities .
europe 's biggest infrastructure project ever , galileo is lead by the european space agency and the firm galileo industries , a germany-based consortium that includes european space industry giants like eads , alcatel and alenia spazio .
by the time operations of the 30-satellite constellation begin , the eu will have invested approximately 3.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.5 billion -rrb- in this ambitious project .
galileo creates employment opportunities global navigation is rapidly becoming a lucrative market .
the european states participating in the galileo project are expecting big returns on their investment .
supporters of the project predict that it will lead to the creation of some 140,000 jobs in the high-tech sector and generate € 74 billion in earnings over the next 20 years .

but to many europeans , the most important thing about galileo is that it will wean the eu of its technological dependence on the american global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- .

for a number of years , galileo served as a serious thorn in the side of transatlantic relations .
officials in washington feared the spectrum used by galileo could interfere with the gps signal used by the military , making it difficult for the americans to scramble the signal in times of crisis .
others in the us argued that satellite navigation systems should be available for free , like gps , and there was no need for a commercial version .

within germany , the armed forces are only allowed to be deployed for defense or to counter a looming threat to the democracy of the federal republic or a state . further , the army may be deployed to protect civilian objects to support police measures .

" during the world cup , for example , our federal and state police forces will be very stretched , " schäuble told daily süddeutsche zeitung earlier this month , suggesting the army could be deployed during the finals , which take place in 12 german cities from june 9 to july 9 . " why should n't we transfer security services temporarily to the armed forces from the police to relieve them , " he suggested . germany 's constitution , written in 1949 with the lessons of nazi rule in mind , establishes strict separation between police and military .
under the nazis , the line between the two became blurred , leading to a ruthless militarized police state . schäuble said armed forces could be used to guard stadiums , airports and team quarters .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the latest report is bad news for germany 's jobless the so-called psas " hire " the jobless and " lend " them to companies in the hope the companies would eventually offer them jobs . the report found that the program in fact lengthened the amount of time a person was unemployed by an average of one month and created additional costs of 5,700 euros -lrb- $ 6,800 -rrb- per person . efforts to make the hiring of older workers more attractive were also entirely ineffective , the report found , and a " minijob " program to create low-wage , part-time positions did little to pave the way toward full employment . training programs , government salary subsidy programs and state job creation measures also proved a disappointment in driving down unemployment , which is consistently listed by germans as the number-one national problem . the one silver lining came from programs to foster small business start-ups .
" as a whole , the programs can be seen as successful in averting the return to unemployment , " the study said . opposition feels vindicated the study has provided the opposition free-market liberal party -lrb- fdp -rrb- with fresh ammunition to attack the government 's labor market reforms . " i feel vindicated in my criticism of the reforms , " dirk niebel , general secretary of the fdp said . niebel pointed out that the fdp had consistently opposed the reforms right from the outset .
he criticized the psas as state-financed , unfair competition for private part-time companies , urging the government to completely scrap the measure . criticism was also evident in government ranks with the conservatives , who are currently in a coalition with the social democrats , saying the study had confirmed their misgivings about certain aspects of the reforms . " particularly when it comes to the psas , we completely share the criticism , " ralf brauksiepe , labor spokesman for the christian democratic parliamentary group told berlin daily der tagesspiegel .
" the instrument is n't fundamentally wrong , but introducing it in such a widespread manner was a mistake . " schröder paid dearly schröder paid a heavy political price for the hartz package of reforms that were often praised as courageous by economists and foreign leaders . however , the final and most contentious plank - measures slashing unemployment benefits for the long-term jobless - has not yet been studied . even without the definitive statistics , the german population seems to have made up its mind about what it thinks of the reforms .
in a recent survey , 82 percent said that the reforms had widened the gap between rich and poor .
in former communist eastern germany , 90 percent echoed the view . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hartz reforms were the centerpiece of schröder 's reform agenda schröder lost a humiliating series of state elections in the measures ' wake , and was finally defeated as chancellor by angela merkel in an early general election in september . merkel 's new " grand coalition " government comprising her christian democrats and schröder 's social democrats has agreed to review all the labor market measures by the end of 2006 . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german labor market struggles with transition plants closures , lay-offs , outsourcing - rarely was the news for the job market worse than in 2005 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 28.12.2005 germany both reformer and violator of eu budgetary pact großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany and other eu members will be forced to rein in spending next year germany is set to breach the eu 's stability and growth pact for the fourth time in a row despite succeeding in loosening the guidelines earlier this year . the eu stability and growth pact , which sets a ceiling of 3 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- on member countries ' budget deficits , was all but declared dead earlier this year . but , now it 's meant to be revived and flex some new muscle if joaquin almunia gets his way . the eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner plans to doggedly force eu members to rein in spending even though the budgetary pact was reformed and relaxed in march this year . almunia has said that starting january next year , ongoing disciplinary measures against certain eu budgetary pact violators , including germany , will be toughened . germany a serial offender the move spells further bad news for germany , which despite pressurizing the eu to ease budgetary guidelines , looks likely to fall victim to its own scheme . every year since 2002 , germany has violated the stability pact rules .
in 2004 , the budget deficit reached 3.9 percent , and the commission predicts the 2005 deficit to reach 3.3 percent of gdp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrück finds himself between a rock and a hard place new german finance minister peer steinbrück , who finds himself in the unenviable position of explaining how germany could initiate loosening the pact and then promptly violate it again , has indicated that he plans to tread carefully . " all i want to say is that i am aware that german interests are in sync with the eu commission and we do n't want to allow a repeat of november 2003 , " steinbrück said recently . a franco-german scheme at that time , former german finance minister hans eichel together with his french counterpart torpedoed a decision by eu finance ministers to tighten disciplinary measures against eu stability and growth pact offenders . the european parliament later ruled that the procedure was , in important aspects , not entirely legal .
but , since the stability pact was then reformed by march 2005 under the leadership of luxembourg 's jean-claude juncker , the commission held back with taking further disciplinary measures against germany and other members . one of the reasons was also hans eichel 's insistence that germany would respect the three percent deficit ceiling - something that is not likely to happen even in 2006 . reform brings more flexibility juncker , who is eurogroup chairman , said he was hopeful that germany would finally manage to honor its promises . " in the meetings i have had with -lrb- new german chancellor -rrb- angela merkel , i have noted a genuine willingness to respect the pact , " juncker said last month .
" germany will manage to fulfill all conditions of the stability pact by the end of 2007 .
i 'm confident that the new government will manage it . " the german government however need not fear direct financial sanctions from brussels to start with , even when disciplinary measures are officially taken a step further in 2006 . the reformed stability and growth pact has created overall flexibility , particularly for member countries whose budgets , despite reforms , can only be consolidated gradually whether it 's because of weak economic growth or special financial burdens that hamper an economic upswing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans eichel managed to chew down the stability pact in march this year " we have achieved what i have always demanded : the pact is now more economically rational , growth-friendly and allows - what is also economically needed and what the pact itself aims for - a stronger case by case assessment , " eichel said in march this year after a marathon night of negotiations in which the original stability pact was fundamentally loosened . present government benefits from relaxed pact as the present grand coalition looks for ways to cut its public spending and rein in its budget deficit below the crucial three percent of gdp , one ca n't help wondering at the irony of things : the conservative-dominated government is profiting from the greater leeway afforded by the reformed pact though the conservatives had always , during their time in opposition , slammed hans eichel for watering down the pact . christopher plass -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de meet the eu 's deficit sinners although repeatedly cited for failure to rein in deficit spending , germany and france are by no means the only violaters of eu deficit guidelines .

the european giove-a test satellite was sent into orbit piggybacking on a russian soyuz rocket . the 600-kilo -lrb- 1,320 pound -rrb- british-built giove-a is scheduled to orbit at 23,000 kilometers -lrb- 14,500 miles -rrb- above the earth . a strategic step for europe " this is an essential step in the galileo project : going from theory to practice , " said dominique detain , a spokesman for esa on the galileo project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : galileo will be the first civilian-controlled satellite navigation system the giove-a satellite will test various technologies including an atomic clock that esa says is the most exact ever sent into space .
giove is an acronym standing for galileo in orbit validation element , but also the italian name for the planet jupiter whose moons were discovered by the famous renaissance astronomer galileo galilei . with the galileo project europe hopes to gain its independence in the strategic domain of navigating by satellite , which has become indispensable for managing traffic in the air , at sea , and even on motorways . the united states and the eu last year reached an accord on adopting common operating standards for the two systems , overcoming american concerns that the galileo system will compromise the security of gps , on which the us military is heavily dependent . an extraordinary level of precision according to esa , galileo , which will be under civilian control , is designed to deliver real-time positioning accuracy down to the meter range , which is unprecedented for a publicly available system . it will guarantee service under all but the most extreme circumstances and will inform users within seconds of a failure of any satellite , which will make it especially valuable where safety is crucial , such as running trains , guiding cars and landing aircraft . once in orbit , giove-a will be under the control of the surrey satellite systems operations center in the british city of guildford . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : galileo will consist of 30 satellites orbiting around the earth the project 's next phase will be the launch of a second giove-b test satellite in 2006 , followed with four working satellites by 2008 .
the ultimate goal remains a constellation of 30 satellites encircling the globe . the date for opening the network to commercial use has been pushed back two years to 2010 . to help cover the cost of the huge investment , the eu has sought other contributors to the project .
to date , agreements have been signed with china and israel , and negotiations are under way with about a dozen other nations including ukraine , india and morocco . between cooperation and competition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : urging russia to compete with both europe and the us : russian president vladimir putin galileo will also be compatible with glonass , the russian network of 24 geostationary satellites , which is not scheduled to be in operation before 2008 . according to the ria-novosti news agency , russian president vladimir putin urged his government on monday to speed up development of russia 's planned satellite navigation system . " we have to see what we can do in 2006 and 2007 to develop the commercial utilization of this system , " putin said . like the american network , glonass will be controlled by military operators that can not guarantee the maintenance of an uninterrupted service . russia has already launched 17 of the planned system satellites , including three placed into orbit on sunday , but putin warned that some of these may be out of date by the time the navigation system is inaugurated unless the development is hurried along . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe keen to join russia in new spaceship project the russian plan to build a new spacecraft for manned missions has captured the attention of the european space agency .

schröder prepares for a life in stand-up former german chancellor schröder certainly knows how to stay in the headlines .
his wildly lucrative business deals are not giving his critics a chance to even begin lowering their eyebrows . when asked what his plans were after leaving the white house , former president bill clinton responded - frankly and without any qualms - that he was interested in making money .
the enticing connection between politics and profit seems to have captured the imagination of former german chancellor gerhard schröder as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they have the same agent : gerhard schröder and former us president bill clinton schröder 's office announced on tuesday that the media-savvy former chancellor had landed another lucrative business contract , this time with new york-based public speaking booking agency . the harry walker agency , which already boasts a stable of prominent ex-politicians including former us presidents bill clinton and jimmy carter , reportedly commands up to $ 250,000 -lrb- 210,000 euros -rrb- per speech .
schröder 's office declined to comment on his rate for speaking engagements . the press is having a blast the mass-market german daily bild reprinted a promotional letter by the harry walker agency in which it announced its " exclusive representation of gerhard schröder , german chancellor 1998-2005 . " " the twice elected leader of germany , chancellor gerhard schröder , has been a major force on the world 's political stage for the past eight years , " the letter printed in bild and signed by a company executive said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder closed the russian-german pipeline deal while still in office " chancellor schröder is a leading world statesman and internationally recognized authority on global relations , economic development and social change .
i look forward to speaking with you about scheduling this charismatic and influential world leader for an upcoming event . " schröder 's swift career moves and his ability to turn his political experience into profitable business deals has been picked up in other european countries as well : " -lrb- schröder -rrb- made a name for himself with his opposition to the iraq war .
that increases the price of his fame , if not his weight as a statesman , " the italian daily corriere della sera commented on wednesday . same old story schröder already came under fire in german and european political circles this month for taking a job with a subsidiary of russian energy giant gazprom , which is building an ambitious gas pipeline from russia to germany , just after he left office in november . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what a ride it 's been !
russian president putin ended up as schröder 's best buddy the four-billion euro pipeline agreement was signed just 10 days before the german general elections in september , at a ceremony attended by schröder and russian president vladimir putin . the 61-year-old schröder , who is also setting up shop in berlin as a lawyer , has already accepted a position as a part-time adviser on international political affairs for the swiss publishing group ringier . to prepare for his new career in international business , schröder recently spent 12 days brushing up on his english skills in the welsh countryside . introduction of honor code unlikely members of the opposition green party in the german parliament - who used to be schröder 's coalition partners during both of his terms in office - are now toying with the idea of introducing a binding honor code for former politicians in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : constitutional court president hans-jürgen papier president of the german constitutional court hans-jürgen papier , however , seemed skeptical about the proposal . " i am not sure if such a code of honor could ever cover all the possible cases , " papier said . " in the end , leaders in high offices should be able to judge for themselves what is appropriate , morally acceptable and fair , " he said . parliamentary group leaders are expected to address the issue at a meeting on jan .

the european giove-a test satellite was sent into orbit piggybacking on a russian soyuz rocket . the 600-kilo -lrb- 1,320 pound -rrb- british-built giove-a is scheduled to orbit at 23,000 kilometers -lrb- 14,500 miles -rrb- above the earth . a strategic step for europe " this is an essential step in the galileo project : going from theory to practice , " said dominique detain , a spokesman for esa on the galileo project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : galileo will be the first civilian-controlled satellite navigation system the giove-a satellite will test various technologies including an atomic clock that esa says is the most exact ever sent into space .
giove is an acronym standing for galileo in orbit validation element , but also the italian name for the planet jupiter whose moons were discovered by the famous renaissance astronomer galileo galilei . with the galileo project europe hopes to gain its independence in the strategic domain of navigating by satellite , which has become indispensable for managing traffic in the air , at sea , and even on motorways . the united states and the eu last year reached an accord on adopting common operating standards for the two systems , overcoming american concerns that the galileo system will compromise the security of gps , on which the us military is heavily dependent . an extraordinary level of precision according to esa , galileo , which will be under civilian control , is designed to deliver real-time positioning accuracy down to the meter range , which is unprecedented for a publicly available system . it will guarantee service under all but the most extreme circumstances and will inform users within seconds of a failure of any satellite , which will make it especially valuable where safety is crucial , such as running trains , guiding cars and landing aircraft . once in orbit , giove-a will be under the control of the surrey satellite systems operations center in the british city of guildford . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : galileo will consist of 30 satellites orbiting around the earth the project 's next phase will be the launch of a second giove-b test satellite in 2006 , followed with four working satellites by 2008 .
the ultimate goal remains a constellation of 30 satellites encircling the globe . the date for opening the network to commercial use has been pushed back two years to 2010 . to help cover the cost of the huge investment , the eu has sought other contributors to the project .
to date , agreements have been signed with china and israel , and negotiations are under way with about a dozen other nations including ukraine , india and morocco . between cooperation and competition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : urging russia to compete with both europe and the us : russian president vladimir putin galileo will also be compatible with glonass , the russian network of 24 geostationary satellites , which is not scheduled to be in operation before 2008 . according to the ria-novosti news agency , russian president vladimir putin urged his government on monday to speed up development of russia 's planned satellite navigation system . " we have to see what we can do in 2006 and 2007 to develop the commercial utilization of this system , " putin said . like the american network , glonass will be controlled by military operators that can not guarantee the maintenance of an uninterrupted service . russia has already launched 17 of the planned system satellites , including three placed into orbit on sunday , but putin warned that some of these may be out of date by the time the navigation system is inaugurated unless the development is hurried along . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe keen to join russia in new spaceship project the russian plan to build a new spacecraft for manned missions has captured the attention of the european space agency .

but it remains unclear whether the german army will take over security duties during the mammoth event . the german army 's duties are unambiguously laid down in the constitution .
within germany , the armed forces are only allowed to be deployed for defense or to counter a looming threat to the democracy of the federal republic or a state . further , the army may be deployed to protect civilian objects to support police measures .
such deployments however , require the support of both houses of parliament . " relieving a stretched police force " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble has already raised an outcry with plans to tighten anti-terror measures but new german interior minister wolfgang schäuble of the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- wants to go a step further by pressing the army into service to secure next year 's soccer world cup . " during the world cup , for example , our federal and state police forces will be very stretched , " schäuble told daily süddeutsche zeitung earlier this month , suggesting the army could be deployed during the finals , which take place in 12 german cities from june 9 to july 9 . " why should n't we transfer security services temporarily to the armed forces from the police to relieve them , " he suggested . germany 's constitution , written in 1949 with the lessons of nazi rule in mind , establishes strict separation between police and military .
under the nazis , the line between the two became blurred , leading to a ruthless militarized police state . schäuble said armed forces could be used to guard stadiums , airports and team quarters . " no one wants to see tanks in front of train stations or stadiums , this is completely absurd … yet you can imagine what would happen if somewhere a bomb in a back pack would explode . " " not the army 's brief " however , schäuble 's comments to call on the army in " exceptional circumstances " have met with resistance .
german defense minister franz josef jung said on tuesday he would be opposed to the army being deployed during the world cup finals in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the presence of german soliders on the streets is viewed uneasily in germany " we should not have a discussion now about whether the army takes on police duties .
that is not their brief , " jung told the rheinische post newspaper . the military would , however , be pressed into service during the finals in the event of a catastrophe , jung added , pointing to the work of soldiers in keeping transport links and electricity supplies functioning during heavy snowfalls in the heavily populated german state of north rhine-westphalia following christmas . debate to continue at the same time , both the parties in the ruling grand coalition - the cdu as well as the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- plan to further thrash out the issue of domestic deployments for the german army . the coalition treaty signed by the two parties mentions that in light of new terror threats , foreign security can no longer be clearly separated from domestic security .
the topic is expected to involve legal and constitutional clarifications . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de in war on terror , how far is too far ?

today , the stars have been replaced by satellites . orbiting at a distance of some 23,000 kilometers above the earth ’ s surface , several dozen satellites , many sent up in the late 1950s and 1960s by the united states and the soviet union for military use , provide ships and planes with a global navigation system .
in the last 10 years , the number of satellites used for commercial purposes has increased rapidly , but the united states still dominates the field , and the pentagon controls access .
all that will change in the next few years with the launch of galileo , the european global satellite navigation system .
the giove-a satellite - the first in what will eventually become a constellation of 30 satellites encircling the globe - is scheduled for launch on wednesday morning .
a global service industry when galileo becomes fully operational , people anywhere in the world will be able to rely on the esa ’ s satellite technology for personal navigation .
in northern norway , for example , where there is no possibility of accessing global navigation systems because the current satellite network does not cover the region , a combination of galileo and special mobile phones will enable people to determine their exact position , down to the very meter , free of charge .

the european giove-a test satellite was sent into orbit piggybacking on a russian soyuz rocket . the 600-kilo -lrb- 1,320 pound -rrb- british-built giove-a is scheduled to orbit at 23,000 kilometers -lrb- 14,500 miles -rrb- above the earth . a strategic step for europe " this is an essential step in the galileo project : going from theory to practice , " said dominique detain , a spokesman for esa on the galileo project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : galileo will be the first civilian-controlled satellite navigation system the giove-a satellite will test various technologies including an atomic clock that esa says is the most exact ever sent into space .
giove is an acronym standing for galileo in orbit validation element , but also the italian name for the planet jupiter whose moons were discovered by the famous renaissance astronomer galileo galilei . with the galileo project europe hopes to gain its independence in the strategic domain of navigating by satellite , which has become indispensable for managing traffic in the air , at sea , and even on motorways . the united states and the eu last year reached an accord on adopting common operating standards for the two systems , overcoming american concerns that the galileo system will compromise the security of gps , on which the us military is heavily dependent . an extraordinary level of precision according to esa , galileo , which will be under civilian control , is designed to deliver real-time positioning accuracy down to the meter range , which is unprecedented for a publicly available system . it will guarantee service under all but the most extreme circumstances and will inform users within seconds of a failure of any satellite , which will make it especially valuable where safety is crucial , such as running trains , guiding cars and landing aircraft . once in orbit , giove-a will be under the control of the surrey satellite systems operations center in the british city of guildford . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : galileo will consist of 30 satellites orbiting around the earth the project 's next phase will be the launch of a second giove-b test satellite in 2006 , followed with four working satellites by 2008 .
the ultimate goal remains a constellation of 30 satellites encircling the globe . the date for opening the network to commercial use has been pushed back two years to 2010 . to help cover the cost of the huge investment , the eu has sought other contributors to the project .
to date , agreements have been signed with china and israel , and negotiations are under way with about a dozen other nations including ukraine , india and morocco . between cooperation and competition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : urging russia to compete with both europe and the us : russian president vladimir putin galileo will also be compatible with glonass , the russian network of 24 geostationary satellites , which is not scheduled to be in operation before 2008 . according to the ria-novosti news agency , russian president vladimir putin urged his government on monday to speed up development of russia 's planned satellite navigation system . " we have to see what we can do in 2006 and 2007 to develop the commercial utilization of this system , " putin said . like the american network , glonass will be controlled by military operators that can not guarantee the maintenance of an uninterrupted service . russia has already launched 17 of the planned system satellites , including three placed into orbit on sunday , but putin warned that some of these may be out of date by the time the navigation system is inaugurated unless the development is hurried along . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe keen to join russia in new spaceship project the russian plan to build a new spacecraft for manned missions has captured the attention of the european space agency .

but it remains unclear whether the german army will take over security duties during the mammoth event . the german army 's duties are unambiguously laid down in the constitution .
within germany , the armed forces are only allowed to be deployed for defense or to counter a looming threat to the democracy of the federal republic or a state . further , the army may be deployed to protect civilian objects to support police measures .
such deployments however , require the support of both houses of parliament .

" during the world cup , for example , our federal and state police forces will be very stretched , " schäuble told daily süddeutsche zeitung earlier this month , suggesting the army could be deployed during the finals , which take place in 12 german cities from june 9 to july 9 . " why should n't we transfer security services temporarily to the armed forces from the police to relieve them , " he suggested . germany 's constitution , written in 1949 with the lessons of nazi rule in mind , establishes strict separation between police and military .
under the nazis , the line between the two became blurred , leading to a ruthless militarized police state . schäuble said armed forces could be used to guard stadiums , airports and team quarters . " no one wants to see tanks in front of train stations or stadiums , this is completely absurd … yet you can imagine what would happen if somewhere a bomb in a back pack would explode . " " not the army 's brief " however , schäuble 's comments to call on the army in " exceptional circumstances " have met with resistance .
german defense minister franz josef jung said on tuesday he would be opposed to the army being deployed during the world cup finals in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the presence of german soliders on the streets is viewed uneasily in germany " we should not have a discussion now about whether the army takes on police duties .
that is not their brief , " jung told the rheinische post newspaper . the military would , however , be pressed into service during the finals in the event of a catastrophe , jung added , pointing to the work of soldiers in keeping transport links and electricity supplies functioning during heavy snowfalls in the heavily populated german state of north rhine-westphalia following christmas . debate to continue at the same time , both the parties in the ruling grand coalition - the cdu as well as the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- plan to further thrash out the issue of domestic deployments for the german army . the coalition treaty signed by the two parties mentions that in light of new terror threats , foreign security can no longer be clearly separated from domestic security .

a look at one of the geniuses of the german-speaking world . on jan .
27 , 1756 , musical wunderkind wolfgang amadeus mozart was born in salzburg , austria .
despite early success , the composer died in poverty in vienna on dec .
5 , 1791 .
only after his death was mozart celebrated as one of the greatest musical geniuses of all times . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world-famous mozart kugeln interest in the composer never seems to wane .
publishers continue to put out murder mysteries , audio books , novels , biographies , and new academic findings from the world of mozart research .
and if anyone had thought to secure the royalties for mozart-related products during the composer 's lifetime , he would be rich today .
probably the best known are mozart kugeln - the marzipan flavored chocolate balls wrapped in cellophane bearing his likeness . festivities in augsburg some facts of mozart 's life are well known .
for instance , he began showing extraordinary music talent at an exceptionally young age .
he wrote his first composition at age five ; at seven he is said to have taught himself how to play the violin and the organ .
by age eight he had composed piano sonatas , and at 12 he wrote his first opera .
his father leopold , himself a violin teacher , recognized his son 's talent and toured europe with wolfgang and his sister anna maria .
by 1766 , the siblings had been to paris , london and the hague , where they played before royalty and in public academies .
at first , though , mozart performed in munich and vienna , then in augsburg and frankfurt . augsburg was leopold mozart 's home town , and that is where germany 's " mozart year 2006 " will take place , under the patronage of german president horst köhler . the year gets under full swing during may , with two straight weeks of historically accurate performances of works by both father and son .
vienna will be hosting a similar festival . return to salzburg mozart is considered one of the first composers who was not dependent on the court ; he earned enough money in his child-star years to be financially independent .
as a teenager , he was temporarily named unpaid concert master of the salzburg court orchestra , but he asked to be let go in august .
he tried unsuccessfully to get jobs in munich , mannheim and paris before returning to be court organist in salzburg after his mother 's death in 1788 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ubiquitous in salzburg : the composer 's statue in mozart square today , salzburg is the epicenter of mozart studies .
in 2006 the town will host innumerable artistic projects , workshops and exhibits that aim to shed some light on the composer 's life , work and personality .
the head of the salzburg festival , peter ruzicka , has put all 22 mozart operas on the festival lineup . in 1782 , mozart married konstanze weber , and the two lived together in vienna .
he supported his family by giving piano lessons and found patronage from emperor joseph ii , for whom he wrote operas , including the marriage of figaro . not pleasing to the public but the public found his music too complex and critical of social mores , and mozart 's financial situation worsened steadily . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this oil portrait of mozart is said to be truest to his likeness although he was named royal chamber composer in 1787 , the pay was low .
he had a final success with his opera the magic flute in 1791 , but died at age 35 , impoverished , while working on his requiem . the exact cause of mozart 's death is debated , and speculations range from poisoning to syphillis .
he was given a pauper 's burial at the st. marx cemetary in vienna , which is being restored for the occasion . despite his short life , mozart composed more than 600 works ; a multifaceted repertoire of symphonies , concerts , sonatas , operas , and secular and religious vocal music .

probably the best known are mozart kugeln - the marzipan flavored chocolate balls wrapped in cellophane bearing his likeness . festivities in augsburg some facts of mozart 's life are well known .
for instance , he began showing extraordinary music talent at an exceptionally young age .
he wrote his first composition at age five ; at seven he is said to have taught himself how to play the violin and the organ .
by age eight he had composed piano sonatas , and at 12 he wrote his first opera .
his father leopold , himself a violin teacher , recognized his son 's talent and toured europe with wolfgang and his sister anna maria .

vienna will be hosting a similar festival . return to salzburg mozart is considered one of the first composers who was not dependent on the court ; he earned enough money in his child-star years to be financially independent .

the head of the salzburg festival , peter ruzicka , has put all 22 mozart operas on the festival lineup . in 1782 , mozart married konstanze weber , and the two lived together in vienna .
he supported his family by giving piano lessons and found patronage from emperor joseph ii , for whom he wrote operas , including the marriage of figaro . not pleasing to the public but the public found his music too complex and critical of social mores , and mozart 's financial situation worsened steadily . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this oil portrait of mozart is said to be truest to his likeness although he was named royal chamber composer in 1787 , the pay was low .

he was given a pauper 's burial at the st. marx cemetary in vienna , which is being restored for the occasion . despite his short life , mozart composed more than 600 works ; a multifaceted repertoire of symphonies , concerts , sonatas , operas , and secular and religious vocal music .

today , the stars have been replaced by satellites . orbiting at a distance of some 23,000 kilometers above the earth ’ s surface , several dozen satellites , many sent up in the late 1950s and 1960s by the united states and the soviet union for military use , provide ships and planes with a global navigation system .

a look at one of the geniuses of the german-speaking world . on jan .
27 , 1756 , musical wunderkind wolfgang amadeus mozart was born in salzburg , austria .
despite early success , the composer died in poverty in vienna on dec .
5 , 1791 .
only after his death was mozart celebrated as one of the greatest musical geniuses of all times . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world-famous mozart kugeln interest in the composer never seems to wane .
publishers continue to put out murder mysteries , audio books , novels , biographies , and new academic findings from the world of mozart research .
and if anyone had thought to secure the royalties for mozart-related products during the composer 's lifetime , he would be rich today .
probably the best known are mozart kugeln - the marzipan flavored chocolate balls wrapped in cellophane bearing his likeness . festivities in augsburg some facts of mozart 's life are well known .
for instance , he began showing extraordinary music talent at an exceptionally young age .
he wrote his first composition at age five ; at seven he is said to have taught himself how to play the violin and the organ .
by age eight he had composed piano sonatas , and at 12 he wrote his first opera .
his father leopold , himself a violin teacher , recognized his son 's talent and toured europe with wolfgang and his sister anna maria .
by 1766 , the siblings had been to paris , london and the hague , where they played before royalty and in public academies .
at first , though , mozart performed in munich and vienna , then in augsburg and frankfurt . augsburg was leopold mozart 's home town , and that is where germany 's " mozart year 2006 " will take place , under the patronage of german president horst köhler . the year gets under full swing during may , with two straight weeks of historically accurate performances of works by both father and son .
vienna will be hosting a similar festival . return to salzburg mozart is considered one of the first composers who was not dependent on the court ; he earned enough money in his child-star years to be financially independent .
as a teenager , he was temporarily named unpaid concert master of the salzburg court orchestra , but he asked to be let go in august .
he tried unsuccessfully to get jobs in munich , mannheim and paris before returning to be court organist in salzburg after his mother 's death in 1788 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ubiquitous in salzburg : the composer 's statue in mozart square today , salzburg is the epicenter of mozart studies .
in 2006 the town will host innumerable artistic projects , workshops and exhibits that aim to shed some light on the composer 's life , work and personality .
the head of the salzburg festival , peter ruzicka , has put all 22 mozart operas on the festival lineup . in 1782 , mozart married konstanze weber , and the two lived together in vienna .
he supported his family by giving piano lessons and found patronage from emperor joseph ii , for whom he wrote operas , including the marriage of figaro . not pleasing to the public but the public found his music too complex and critical of social mores , and mozart 's financial situation worsened steadily . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this oil portrait of mozart is said to be truest to his likeness although he was named royal chamber composer in 1787 , the pay was low .
he had a final success with his opera the magic flute in 1791 , but died at age 35 , impoverished , while working on his requiem . the exact cause of mozart 's death is debated , and speculations range from poisoning to syphillis .
he was given a pauper 's burial at the st. marx cemetary in vienna , which is being restored for the occasion . despite his short life , mozart composed more than 600 works ; a multifaceted repertoire of symphonies , concerts , sonatas , operas , and secular and religious vocal music .
even if recent research shows the genius was not above borrowing from his contemporaries -lrb- such as joseph haydn -rrb- , his oeuvre is still an important part of the western canon . the performances honoring mozart will go on throughout the year , but on jan .
27 , 2006 , mozart afficionados who want to be at the center of the action should travel to vienna .
there will be premieres , concerts and television shows broadast around the world , in honor of nearly a quarter-millennium of the maestro 's music . gaby reucher -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bringing bach to the mtv generation last year , 25-year-old martin stadtfeld shot to fame on a daring recording of bach 's goldberg variations .

but , since the stability pact was then reformed by march 2005 under the leadership of luxembourg 's jean-claude juncker , the commission held back with taking further disciplinary measures against germany and other members . one of the reasons was also hans eichel 's insistence that germany would respect the three percent deficit ceiling - something that is not likely to happen even in 2006 . reform brings more flexibility juncker , who is eurogroup chairman , said he was hopeful that germany would finally manage to honor its promises . " in the meetings i have had with -lrb- new german chancellor -rrb- angela merkel , i have noted a genuine willingness to respect the pact , " juncker said last month .

" a wakeup call " pledges to reduce harmful greenhouse gases , however , were of little use unless countries followed through with action , the ippr warned . “ this study is a wakeup call .
it says that as things stand , the european union is not on course to meet its commitments under the kyoto protocol , " the group 's associate director tony grayling said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu countries need to do more to cut pollution " we are nearing the point of no return on climate change , " grayling added . " we have very little time left to start reducing global greenhouse gas emissions before irreparable damage is done , " he said .
" it is vital that eu countries keep their promises to cut pollution . " the ippr used a traffic light system to grade countries on their ability to meet kyoto pledges , giving those who looked set to fail a red warning . france , greece and germany - rated as amber - would reach their targets only if planned policies were successfully carried out , the study found . time running out grayling urged those countries that were falling behind to take action immediately to get back on track , suggesting energy saving and investment in renewable energy sources . " in the new year , eu countries will need to adopt tougher limits on emissions from power stations and heavy industry , in the second phase of the eu emissions trading scheme , " he said . under the kyoto protocol , the european signatories have until 2012 to reduce gas emissions to 8 per cent below 1990 levels . but the european environment agency warned in november that if things keep going the way they are , the european union is likely to achieve a cut of just 2.5 per cent – much less than the treaty demands . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany seeks to extend climate accords germany 's new environment minister is calling for binding climate-change accords beyond kyoto - with or without us participation .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 28.12.2005 germany both reformer and violator of eu budgetary pact großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany and other eu members will be forced to rein in spending next year germany is set to breach the eu 's stability and growth pact for the fourth time in a row despite succeeding in loosening the guidelines earlier this year . the eu stability and growth pact , which sets a ceiling of 3 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- on member countries ' budget deficits , was all but declared dead earlier this year . but , now it 's meant to be revived and flex some new muscle if joaquin almunia gets his way . the eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner plans to doggedly force eu members to rein in spending even though the budgetary pact was reformed and relaxed in march this year . almunia has said that starting january next year , ongoing disciplinary measures against certain eu budgetary pact violators , including germany , will be toughened . germany a serial offender the move spells further bad news for germany , which despite pressurizing the eu to ease budgetary guidelines , looks likely to fall victim to its own scheme . every year since 2002 , germany has violated the stability pact rules .
in 2004 , the budget deficit reached 3.9 percent , and the commission predicts the 2005 deficit to reach 3.3 percent of gdp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrück finds himself between a rock and a hard place new german finance minister peer steinbrück , who finds himself in the unenviable position of explaining how germany could initiate loosening the pact and then promptly violate it again , has indicated that he plans to tread carefully . " all i want to say is that i am aware that german interests are in sync with the eu commission and we do n't want to allow a repeat of november 2003 , " steinbrück said recently . a franco-german scheme at that time , former german finance minister hans eichel together with his french counterpart torpedoed a decision by eu finance ministers to tighten disciplinary measures against eu stability and growth pact offenders . the european parliament later ruled that the procedure was , in important aspects , not entirely legal .
but , since the stability pact was then reformed by march 2005 under the leadership of luxembourg 's jean-claude juncker , the commission held back with taking further disciplinary measures against germany and other members . one of the reasons was also hans eichel 's insistence that germany would respect the three percent deficit ceiling - something that is not likely to happen even in 2006 . reform brings more flexibility juncker , who is eurogroup chairman , said he was hopeful that germany would finally manage to honor its promises . " in the meetings i have had with -lrb- new german chancellor -rrb- angela merkel , i have noted a genuine willingness to respect the pact , " juncker said last month .
" germany will manage to fulfill all conditions of the stability pact by the end of 2007 .
i 'm confident that the new government will manage it . " the german government however need not fear direct financial sanctions from brussels to start with , even when disciplinary measures are officially taken a step further in 2006 . the reformed stability and growth pact has created overall flexibility , particularly for member countries whose budgets , despite reforms , can only be consolidated gradually whether it 's because of weak economic growth or special financial burdens that hamper an economic upswing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans eichel managed to chew down the stability pact in march this year " we have achieved what i have always demanded : the pact is now more economically rational , growth-friendly and allows - what is also economically needed and what the pact itself aims for - a stronger case by case assessment , " eichel said in march this year after a marathon night of negotiations in which the original stability pact was fundamentally loosened . present government benefits from relaxed pact as the present grand coalition looks for ways to cut its public spending and rein in its budget deficit below the crucial three percent of gdp , one ca n't help wondering at the irony of things : the conservative-dominated government is profiting from the greater leeway afforded by the reformed pact though the conservatives had always , during their time in opposition , slammed hans eichel for watering down the pact . christopher plass -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de meet the eu 's deficit sinners although repeatedly cited for failure to rein in deficit spending , germany and france are by no means the only violaters of eu deficit guidelines .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 28.12.2005 report slams controversial german job market reforms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no amount of tweaking , it seems , helped the so-called hartz labor market reforms a controversial raft of labor market reforms to stem germany 's double-digit unemployment rate is not working and in some cases is aggravating the problem , a new report shows . a government-commissioned study gave the so-called hartz reforms , rolled out in 2003 and 2004 under former chancellor gerhard schröder as the centerpiece of his battle to combat joblessness , a dismal report card . the study , weighing in at several thousand pages and obtained by business daily handelsblatt , found that many of the reforms were costly , ineffective and fell wide of the mark in tackling the structural problems in the german labor market . miserable card for psas , mini-jobs the study by several leading economic think tanks ordered by the federal government was particularly critical of one of the major planks , the introduction of " personal service agencies . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the latest report is bad news for germany 's jobless the so-called psas " hire " the jobless and " lend " them to companies in the hope the companies would eventually offer them jobs . the report found that the program in fact lengthened the amount of time a person was unemployed by an average of one month and created additional costs of 5,700 euros -lrb- $ 6,800 -rrb- per person . efforts to make the hiring of older workers more attractive were also entirely ineffective , the report found , and a " minijob " program to create low-wage , part-time positions did little to pave the way toward full employment . training programs , government salary subsidy programs and state job creation measures also proved a disappointment in driving down unemployment , which is consistently listed by germans as the number-one national problem . the one silver lining came from programs to foster small business start-ups .
" as a whole , the programs can be seen as successful in averting the return to unemployment , " the study said . opposition feels vindicated the study has provided the opposition free-market liberal party -lrb- fdp -rrb- with fresh ammunition to attack the government 's labor market reforms . " i feel vindicated in my criticism of the reforms , " dirk niebel , general secretary of the fdp said . niebel pointed out that the fdp had consistently opposed the reforms right from the outset .
he criticized the psas as state-financed , unfair competition for private part-time companies , urging the government to completely scrap the measure . criticism was also evident in government ranks with the conservatives , who are currently in a coalition with the social democrats , saying the study had confirmed their misgivings about certain aspects of the reforms . " particularly when it comes to the psas , we completely share the criticism , " ralf brauksiepe , labor spokesman for the christian democratic parliamentary group told berlin daily der tagesspiegel .
" the instrument is n't fundamentally wrong , but introducing it in such a widespread manner was a mistake . " schröder paid dearly schröder paid a heavy political price for the hartz package of reforms that were often praised as courageous by economists and foreign leaders . however , the final and most contentious plank - measures slashing unemployment benefits for the long-term jobless - has not yet been studied . even without the definitive statistics , the german population seems to have made up its mind about what it thinks of the reforms .
in a recent survey , 82 percent said that the reforms had widened the gap between rich and poor .
in former communist eastern germany , 90 percent echoed the view . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hartz reforms were the centerpiece of schröder 's reform agenda schröder lost a humiliating series of state elections in the measures ' wake , and was finally defeated as chancellor by angela merkel in an early general election in september . merkel 's new " grand coalition " government comprising her christian democrats and schröder 's social democrats has agreed to review all the labor market measures by the end of 2006 . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german labor market struggles with transition plants closures , lay-offs , outsourcing - rarely was the news for the job market worse than in 2005 .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the latest report is bad news for germany 's jobless the so-called psas " hire " the jobless and " lend " them to companies in the hope the companies would eventually offer them jobs . the report found that the program in fact lengthened the amount of time a person was unemployed by an average of one month and created additional costs of 5,700 euros -lrb- $ 6,800 -rrb- per person . efforts to make the hiring of older workers more attractive were also entirely ineffective , the report found , and a " minijob " program to create low-wage , part-time positions did little to pave the way toward full employment . training programs , government salary subsidy programs and state job creation measures also proved a disappointment in driving down unemployment , which is consistently listed by germans as the number-one national problem . the one silver lining came from programs to foster small business start-ups .
" as a whole , the programs can be seen as successful in averting the return to unemployment , " the study said . opposition feels vindicated the study has provided the opposition free-market liberal party -lrb- fdp -rrb- with fresh ammunition to attack the government 's labor market reforms . " i feel vindicated in my criticism of the reforms , " dirk niebel , general secretary of the fdp said . niebel pointed out that the fdp had consistently opposed the reforms right from the outset .
he criticized the psas as state-financed , unfair competition for private part-time companies , urging the government to completely scrap the measure . criticism was also evident in government ranks with the conservatives , who are currently in a coalition with the social democrats , saying the study had confirmed their misgivings about certain aspects of the reforms . " particularly when it comes to the psas , we completely share the criticism , " ralf brauksiepe , labor spokesman for the christian democratic parliamentary group told berlin daily der tagesspiegel .
" the instrument is n't fundamentally wrong , but introducing it in such a widespread manner was a mistake . " schröder paid dearly schröder paid a heavy political price for the hartz package of reforms that were often praised as courageous by economists and foreign leaders . however , the final and most contentious plank - measures slashing unemployment benefits for the long-term jobless - has not yet been studied . even without the definitive statistics , the german population seems to have made up its mind about what it thinks of the reforms .
in a recent survey , 82 percent said that the reforms had widened the gap between rich and poor .
in former communist eastern germany , 90 percent echoed the view . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hartz reforms were the centerpiece of schröder 's reform agenda schröder lost a humiliating series of state elections in the measures ' wake , and was finally defeated as chancellor by angela merkel in an early general election in september . merkel 's new " grand coalition " government comprising her christian democrats and schröder 's social democrats has agreed to review all the labor market measures by the end of 2006 . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german labor market struggles with transition plants closures , lay-offs , outsourcing - rarely was the news for the job market worse than in 2005 .

today , the stars have been replaced by satellites . orbiting at a distance of some 23,000 kilometers above the earth ’ s surface , several dozen satellites , many sent up in the late 1950s and 1960s by the united states and the soviet union for military use , provide ships and planes with a global navigation system .
in the last 10 years , the number of satellites used for commercial purposes has increased rapidly , but the united states still dominates the field , and the pentagon controls access .
all that will change in the next few years with the launch of galileo , the european global satellite navigation system .
the giove-a satellite - the first in what will eventually become a constellation of 30 satellites encircling the globe - is scheduled for launch on wednesday morning .
a global service industry when galileo becomes fully operational , people anywhere in the world will be able to rely on the esa ’ s satellite technology for personal navigation .
in northern norway , for example , where there is no possibility of accessing global navigation systems because the current satellite network does not cover the region , a combination of galileo and special mobile phones will enable people to determine their exact position , down to the very meter , free of charge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : personal navigation systems may change the way we travel commercial channels , on the other hand , will charge a fee for their use .
a transport company , for instance , will be able to keep track of where each one of its trucks is located , while the truck drivers themselves rely on galileo to help them navigate through foreign cities .
europe 's biggest infrastructure project ever , galileo is lead by the european space agency and the firm galileo industries , a germany-based consortium that includes european space industry giants like eads , alcatel and alenia spazio .
by the time operations of the 30-satellite constellation begin , the eu will have invested approximately 3.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.5 billion -rrb- in this ambitious project .
galileo creates employment opportunities global navigation is rapidly becoming a lucrative market .
the european states participating in the galileo project are expecting big returns on their investment .
supporters of the project predict that it will lead to the creation of some 140,000 jobs in the high-tech sector and generate € 74 billion in earnings over the next 20 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : returning to nature , aided by satellite navigation germany , as galileo ’ s largest financial investor hopes to profit the most from the system , and was a strong advocate in lobbying for esa approval .
after its completion , europe 's galileo navigation system will guide trucks carrying goods across european highways , it will help land planes at europe 's crowded airports , it will assist ships docking in its busy ports , and it will aid the blind in finding their way through city streets .
but to many europeans , the most important thing about galileo is that it will wean the eu of its technological dependence on the american global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- .
cutting a deal with washington europeans have long complained that gps is unreliable for critical use because , as a military system , it can and has been scrambled during times of crisis .
the system , which is under the control of the u.s. department of defense , can be downgraded or even switched off if the government believes it is being manipulated by an enemy state or a terrorist group .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european satellite navigation system was named after italian astronomer galileo galilei this happened , for instance , during the war in kosovo when the u.s. restricted european use of the gps .
that lack of reliability has made gps unfeasible for applications where a slight inaccuracy could result in deaths , like air traffic control .
for a number of years , galileo served as a serious thorn in the side of transatlantic relations .
officials in washington feared the spectrum used by galileo could interfere with the gps signal used by the military , making it difficult for the americans to scramble the signal in times of crisis .
others in the us argued that satellite navigation systems should be available for free , like gps , and there was no need for a commercial version .
but washington and brussels reached a deal in june 2004 that will make the two systems compatible and interoperable while at the same time maintaining autonomy over each system , effectively eliminating any remaining conflict over the project dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe keen to join russia in new spaceship project the russian plan to build a new spacecraft for manned missions has captured the attention of the european space agency .

" we have very little time left to start reducing global greenhouse gas emissions before irreparable damage is done , " he said .
" it is vital that eu countries keep their promises to cut pollution . " the ippr used a traffic light system to grade countries on their ability to meet kyoto pledges , giving those who looked set to fail a red warning . france , greece and germany - rated as amber - would reach their targets only if planned policies were successfully carried out , the study found . time running out grayling urged those countries that were falling behind to take action immediately to get back on track , suggesting energy saving and investment in renewable energy sources . " in the new year , eu countries will need to adopt tougher limits on emissions from power stations and heavy industry , in the second phase of the eu emissions trading scheme , " he said . under the kyoto protocol , the european signatories have until 2012 to reduce gas emissions to 8 per cent below 1990 levels . but the european environment agency warned in november that if things keep going the way they are , the european union is likely to achieve a cut of just 2.5 per cent – much less than the treaty demands . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany seeks to extend climate accords germany 's new environment minister is calling for binding climate-change accords beyond kyoto - with or without us participation .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the latest report is bad news for germany 's jobless the so-called psas " hire " the jobless and " lend " them to companies in the hope the companies would eventually offer them jobs . the report found that the program in fact lengthened the amount of time a person was unemployed by an average of one month and created additional costs of 5,700 euros -lrb- $ 6,800 -rrb- per person . efforts to make the hiring of older workers more attractive were also entirely ineffective , the report found , and a " minijob " program to create low-wage , part-time positions did little to pave the way toward full employment . training programs , government salary subsidy programs and state job creation measures also proved a disappointment in driving down unemployment , which is consistently listed by germans as the number-one national problem . the one silver lining came from programs to foster small business start-ups .
" as a whole , the programs can be seen as successful in averting the return to unemployment , " the study said . opposition feels vindicated the study has provided the opposition free-market liberal party -lrb- fdp -rrb- with fresh ammunition to attack the government 's labor market reforms . " i feel vindicated in my criticism of the reforms , " dirk niebel , general secretary of the fdp said . niebel pointed out that the fdp had consistently opposed the reforms right from the outset .
he criticized the psas as state-financed , unfair competition for private part-time companies , urging the government to completely scrap the measure . criticism was also evident in government ranks with the conservatives , who are currently in a coalition with the social democrats , saying the study had confirmed their misgivings about certain aspects of the reforms . " particularly when it comes to the psas , we completely share the criticism , " ralf brauksiepe , labor spokesman for the christian democratic parliamentary group told berlin daily der tagesspiegel .
" the instrument is n't fundamentally wrong , but introducing it in such a widespread manner was a mistake . " schröder paid dearly schröder paid a heavy political price for the hartz package of reforms that were often praised as courageous by economists and foreign leaders . however , the final and most contentious plank - measures slashing unemployment benefits for the long-term jobless - has not yet been studied . even without the definitive statistics , the german population seems to have made up its mind about what it thinks of the reforms .
in a recent survey , 82 percent said that the reforms had widened the gap between rich and poor .
in former communist eastern germany , 90 percent echoed the view . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hartz reforms were the centerpiece of schröder 's reform agenda schröder lost a humiliating series of state elections in the measures ' wake , and was finally defeated as chancellor by angela merkel in an early general election in september . merkel 's new " grand coalition " government comprising her christian democrats and schröder 's social democrats has agreed to review all the labor market measures by the end of 2006 . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german labor market struggles with transition plants closures , lay-offs , outsourcing - rarely was the news for the job market worse than in 2005 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 28.12.2005 politicians divided over army deployment for world cup großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german police is already gearing up to prevent fan violence as germany prepares to host the soccer world cup next year , security concerns are looming large .
but it remains unclear whether the german army will take over security duties during the mammoth event . the german army 's duties are unambiguously laid down in the constitution .
within germany , the armed forces are only allowed to be deployed for defense or to counter a looming threat to the democracy of the federal republic or a state . further , the army may be deployed to protect civilian objects to support police measures .
such deployments however , require the support of both houses of parliament . " relieving a stretched police force " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble has already raised an outcry with plans to tighten anti-terror measures but new german interior minister wolfgang schäuble of the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- wants to go a step further by pressing the army into service to secure next year 's soccer world cup . " during the world cup , for example , our federal and state police forces will be very stretched , " schäuble told daily süddeutsche zeitung earlier this month , suggesting the army could be deployed during the finals , which take place in 12 german cities from june 9 to july 9 . " why should n't we transfer security services temporarily to the armed forces from the police to relieve them , " he suggested . germany 's constitution , written in 1949 with the lessons of nazi rule in mind , establishes strict separation between police and military .
under the nazis , the line between the two became blurred , leading to a ruthless militarized police state . schäuble said armed forces could be used to guard stadiums , airports and team quarters . " no one wants to see tanks in front of train stations or stadiums , this is completely absurd … yet you can imagine what would happen if somewhere a bomb in a back pack would explode . " " not the army 's brief " however , schäuble 's comments to call on the army in " exceptional circumstances " have met with resistance .
german defense minister franz josef jung said on tuesday he would be opposed to the army being deployed during the world cup finals in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the presence of german soliders on the streets is viewed uneasily in germany " we should not have a discussion now about whether the army takes on police duties .
that is not their brief , " jung told the rheinische post newspaper . the military would , however , be pressed into service during the finals in the event of a catastrophe , jung added , pointing to the work of soldiers in keeping transport links and electricity supplies functioning during heavy snowfalls in the heavily populated german state of north rhine-westphalia following christmas . debate to continue at the same time , both the parties in the ruling grand coalition - the cdu as well as the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- plan to further thrash out the issue of domestic deployments for the german army . the coalition treaty signed by the two parties mentions that in light of new terror threats , foreign security can no longer be clearly separated from domestic security .
the topic is expected to involve legal and constitutional clarifications . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de in war on terror , how far is too far ?

giove is an acronym standing for galileo in orbit validation element , but also the italian name for the planet jupiter whose moons were discovered by the famous renaissance astronomer galileo galilei . with the galileo project europe hopes to gain its independence in the strategic domain of navigating by satellite , which has become indispensable for managing traffic in the air , at sea , and even on motorways . the united states and the eu last year reached an accord on adopting common operating standards for the two systems , overcoming american concerns that the galileo system will compromise the security of gps , on which the us military is heavily dependent . an extraordinary level of precision according to esa , galileo , which will be under civilian control , is designed to deliver real-time positioning accuracy down to the meter range , which is unprecedented for a publicly available system . it will guarantee service under all but the most extreme circumstances and will inform users within seconds of a failure of any satellite , which will make it especially valuable where safety is crucial , such as running trains , guiding cars and landing aircraft . once in orbit , giove-a will be under the control of the surrey satellite systems operations center in the british city of guildford . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : galileo will consist of 30 satellites orbiting around the earth the project 's next phase will be the launch of a second giove-b test satellite in 2006 , followed with four working satellites by 2008 .
the ultimate goal remains a constellation of 30 satellites encircling the globe . the date for opening the network to commercial use has been pushed back two years to 2010 . to help cover the cost of the huge investment , the eu has sought other contributors to the project .
to date , agreements have been signed with china and israel , and negotiations are under way with about a dozen other nations including ukraine , india and morocco . between cooperation and competition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : urging russia to compete with both europe and the us : russian president vladimir putin galileo will also be compatible with glonass , the russian network of 24 geostationary satellites , which is not scheduled to be in operation before 2008 . according to the ria-novosti news agency , russian president vladimir putin urged his government on monday to speed up development of russia 's planned satellite navigation system . " we have to see what we can do in 2006 and 2007 to develop the commercial utilization of this system , " putin said . like the american network , glonass will be controlled by military operators that can not guarantee the maintenance of an uninterrupted service . russia has already launched 17 of the planned system satellites , including three placed into orbit on sunday , but putin warned that some of these may be out of date by the time the navigation system is inaugurated unless the development is hurried along . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe keen to join russia in new spaceship project the russian plan to build a new spacecraft for manned missions has captured the attention of the european space agency .

but it remains unclear whether the german army will take over security duties during the mammoth event . the german army 's duties are unambiguously laid down in the constitution .
within germany , the armed forces are only allowed to be deployed for defense or to counter a looming threat to the democracy of the federal republic or a state . further , the army may be deployed to protect civilian objects to support police measures .
such deployments however , require the support of both houses of parliament .

" during the world cup , for example , our federal and state police forces will be very stretched , " schäuble told daily süddeutsche zeitung earlier this month , suggesting the army could be deployed during the finals , which take place in 12 german cities from june 9 to july 9 . " why should n't we transfer security services temporarily to the armed forces from the police to relieve them , " he suggested . germany 's constitution , written in 1949 with the lessons of nazi rule in mind , establishes strict separation between police and military .
under the nazis , the line between the two became blurred , leading to a ruthless militarized police state . schäuble said armed forces could be used to guard stadiums , airports and team quarters . " no one wants to see tanks in front of train stations or stadiums , this is completely absurd … yet you can imagine what would happen if somewhere a bomb in a back pack would explode . " " not the army 's brief " however , schäuble 's comments to call on the army in " exceptional circumstances " have met with resistance .

that is not their brief , " jung told the rheinische post newspaper . the military would , however , be pressed into service during the finals in the event of a catastrophe , jung added , pointing to the work of soldiers in keeping transport links and electricity supplies functioning during heavy snowfalls in the heavily populated german state of north rhine-westphalia following christmas . debate to continue at the same time , both the parties in the ruling grand coalition - the cdu as well as the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- plan to further thrash out the issue of domestic deployments for the german army . the coalition treaty signed by the two parties mentions that in light of new terror threats , foreign security can no longer be clearly separated from domestic security .

but it remains unclear whether the german army will take over security duties during the mammoth event . the german army 's duties are unambiguously laid down in the constitution .
within germany , the armed forces are only allowed to be deployed for defense or to counter a looming threat to the democracy of the federal republic or a state . further , the army may be deployed to protect civilian objects to support police measures .
such deployments however , require the support of both houses of parliament . " relieving a stretched police force " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble has already raised an outcry with plans to tighten anti-terror measures but new german interior minister wolfgang schäuble of the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- wants to go a step further by pressing the army into service to secure next year 's soccer world cup . " during the world cup , for example , our federal and state police forces will be very stretched , " schäuble told daily süddeutsche zeitung earlier this month , suggesting the army could be deployed during the finals , which take place in 12 german cities from june 9 to july 9 . " why should n't we transfer security services temporarily to the armed forces from the police to relieve them , " he suggested . germany 's constitution , written in 1949 with the lessons of nazi rule in mind , establishes strict separation between police and military .
under the nazis , the line between the two became blurred , leading to a ruthless militarized police state . schäuble said armed forces could be used to guard stadiums , airports and team quarters . " no one wants to see tanks in front of train stations or stadiums , this is completely absurd … yet you can imagine what would happen if somewhere a bomb in a back pack would explode . " " not the army 's brief " however , schäuble 's comments to call on the army in " exceptional circumstances " have met with resistance .

today , the stars have been replaced by satellites . orbiting at a distance of some 23,000 kilometers above the earth ’ s surface , several dozen satellites , many sent up in the late 1950s and 1960s by the united states and the soviet union for military use , provide ships and planes with a global navigation system .
in the last 10 years , the number of satellites used for commercial purposes has increased rapidly , but the united states still dominates the field , and the pentagon controls access .

the european states participating in the galileo project are expecting big returns on their investment .

today , the stars have been replaced by satellites . orbiting at a distance of some 23,000 kilometers above the earth ’ s surface , several dozen satellites , many sent up in the late 1950s and 1960s by the united states and the soviet union for military use , provide ships and planes with a global navigation system .
in the last 10 years , the number of satellites used for commercial purposes has increased rapidly , but the united states still dominates the field , and the pentagon controls access .
all that will change in the next few years with the launch of galileo , the european global satellite navigation system .
the giove-a satellite - the first in what will eventually become a constellation of 30 satellites encircling the globe - is scheduled for launch on wednesday morning .
a global service industry when galileo becomes fully operational , people anywhere in the world will be able to rely on the esa ’ s satellite technology for personal navigation .
in northern norway , for example , where there is no possibility of accessing global navigation systems because the current satellite network does not cover the region , a combination of galileo and special mobile phones will enable people to determine their exact position , down to the very meter , free of charge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : personal navigation systems may change the way we travel commercial channels , on the other hand , will charge a fee for their use .
a transport company , for instance , will be able to keep track of where each one of its trucks is located , while the truck drivers themselves rely on galileo to help them navigate through foreign cities .
europe 's biggest infrastructure project ever , galileo is lead by the european space agency and the firm galileo industries , a germany-based consortium that includes european space industry giants like eads , alcatel and alenia spazio .
by the time operations of the 30-satellite constellation begin , the eu will have invested approximately 3.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.5 billion -rrb- in this ambitious project .
galileo creates employment opportunities global navigation is rapidly becoming a lucrative market .
the european states participating in the galileo project are expecting big returns on their investment .
supporters of the project predict that it will lead to the creation of some 140,000 jobs in the high-tech sector and generate € 74 billion in earnings over the next 20 years .

" a wakeup call " pledges to reduce harmful greenhouse gases , however , were of little use unless countries followed through with action , the ippr warned . “ this study is a wakeup call .
it says that as things stand , the european union is not on course to meet its commitments under the kyoto protocol , " the group 's associate director tony grayling said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu countries need to do more to cut pollution " we are nearing the point of no return on climate change , " grayling added . " we have very little time left to start reducing global greenhouse gas emissions before irreparable damage is done , " he said .
" it is vital that eu countries keep their promises to cut pollution . " the ippr used a traffic light system to grade countries on their ability to meet kyoto pledges , giving those who looked set to fail a red warning . france , greece and germany - rated as amber - would reach their targets only if planned policies were successfully carried out , the study found . time running out grayling urged those countries that were falling behind to take action immediately to get back on track , suggesting energy saving and investment in renewable energy sources . " in the new year , eu countries will need to adopt tougher limits on emissions from power stations and heavy industry , in the second phase of the eu emissions trading scheme , " he said . under the kyoto protocol , the european signatories have until 2012 to reduce gas emissions to 8 per cent below 1990 levels . but the european environment agency warned in november that if things keep going the way they are , the european union is likely to achieve a cut of just 2.5 per cent – much less than the treaty demands . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany seeks to extend climate accords germany 's new environment minister is calling for binding climate-change accords beyond kyoto - with or without us participation .

the european giove-a test satellite was sent into orbit piggybacking on a russian soyuz rocket . the 600-kilo -lrb- 1,320 pound -rrb- british-built giove-a is scheduled to orbit at 23,000 kilometers -lrb- 14,500 miles -rrb- above the earth . a strategic step for europe " this is an essential step in the galileo project : going from theory to practice , " said dominique detain , a spokesman for esa on the galileo project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : galileo will be the first civilian-controlled satellite navigation system the giove-a satellite will test various technologies including an atomic clock that esa says is the most exact ever sent into space .
giove is an acronym standing for galileo in orbit validation element , but also the italian name for the planet jupiter whose moons were discovered by the famous renaissance astronomer galileo galilei . with the galileo project europe hopes to gain its independence in the strategic domain of navigating by satellite , which has become indispensable for managing traffic in the air , at sea , and even on motorways . the united states and the eu last year reached an accord on adopting common operating standards for the two systems , overcoming american concerns that the galileo system will compromise the security of gps , on which the us military is heavily dependent . an extraordinary level of precision according to esa , galileo , which will be under civilian control , is designed to deliver real-time positioning accuracy down to the meter range , which is unprecedented for a publicly available system . it will guarantee service under all but the most extreme circumstances and will inform users within seconds of a failure of any satellite , which will make it especially valuable where safety is crucial , such as running trains , guiding cars and landing aircraft . once in orbit , giove-a will be under the control of the surrey satellite systems operations center in the british city of guildford . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : galileo will consist of 30 satellites orbiting around the earth the project 's next phase will be the launch of a second giove-b test satellite in 2006 , followed with four working satellites by 2008 .
the ultimate goal remains a constellation of 30 satellites encircling the globe . the date for opening the network to commercial use has been pushed back two years to 2010 . to help cover the cost of the huge investment , the eu has sought other contributors to the project .
to date , agreements have been signed with china and israel , and negotiations are under way with about a dozen other nations including ukraine , india and morocco . between cooperation and competition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : urging russia to compete with both europe and the us : russian president vladimir putin galileo will also be compatible with glonass , the russian network of 24 geostationary satellites , which is not scheduled to be in operation before 2008 . according to the ria-novosti news agency , russian president vladimir putin urged his government on monday to speed up development of russia 's planned satellite navigation system . " we have to see what we can do in 2006 and 2007 to develop the commercial utilization of this system , " putin said . like the american network , glonass will be controlled by military operators that can not guarantee the maintenance of an uninterrupted service . russia has already launched 17 of the planned system satellites , including three placed into orbit on sunday , but putin warned that some of these may be out of date by the time the navigation system is inaugurated unless the development is hurried along . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe keen to join russia in new spaceship project the russian plan to build a new spacecraft for manned missions has captured the attention of the european space agency .

his wildly lucrative business deals are not giving his critics a chance to even begin lowering their eyebrows . when asked what his plans were after leaving the white house , former president bill clinton responded - frankly and without any qualms - that he was interested in making money .
the enticing connection between politics and profit seems to have captured the imagination of former german chancellor gerhard schröder as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they have the same agent : gerhard schröder and former us president bill clinton schröder 's office announced on tuesday that the media-savvy former chancellor had landed another lucrative business contract , this time with new york-based public speaking booking agency . the harry walker agency , which already boasts a stable of prominent ex-politicians including former us presidents bill clinton and jimmy carter , reportedly commands up to $ 250,000 -lrb- 210,000 euros -rrb- per speech .
schröder 's office declined to comment on his rate for speaking engagements . the press is having a blast the mass-market german daily bild reprinted a promotional letter by the harry walker agency in which it announced its " exclusive representation of gerhard schröder , german chancellor 1998-2005 . " " the twice elected leader of germany , chancellor gerhard schröder , has been a major force on the world 's political stage for the past eight years , " the letter printed in bild and signed by a company executive said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder closed the russian-german pipeline deal while still in office " chancellor schröder is a leading world statesman and internationally recognized authority on global relations , economic development and social change .
i look forward to speaking with you about scheduling this charismatic and influential world leader for an upcoming event . " schröder 's swift career moves and his ability to turn his political experience into profitable business deals has been picked up in other european countries as well : " -lrb- schröder -rrb- made a name for himself with his opposition to the iraq war .
that increases the price of his fame , if not his weight as a statesman , " the italian daily corriere della sera commented on wednesday . same old story schröder already came under fire in german and european political circles this month for taking a job with a subsidiary of russian energy giant gazprom , which is building an ambitious gas pipeline from russia to germany , just after he left office in november . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what a ride it 's been !
russian president putin ended up as schröder 's best buddy the four-billion euro pipeline agreement was signed just 10 days before the german general elections in september , at a ceremony attended by schröder and russian president vladimir putin . the 61-year-old schröder , who is also setting up shop in berlin as a lawyer , has already accepted a position as a part-time adviser on international political affairs for the swiss publishing group ringier . to prepare for his new career in international business , schröder recently spent 12 days brushing up on his english skills in the welsh countryside . introduction of honor code unlikely members of the opposition green party in the german parliament - who used to be schröder 's coalition partners during both of his terms in office - are now toying with the idea of introducing a binding honor code for former politicians in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : constitutional court president hans-jürgen papier president of the german constitutional court hans-jürgen papier , however , seemed skeptical about the proposal . " i am not sure if such a code of honor could ever cover all the possible cases , " papier said . " in the end , leaders in high offices should be able to judge for themselves what is appropriate , morally acceptable and fair , " he said . parliamentary group leaders are expected to address the issue at a meeting on jan .

the european giove-a test satellite was sent into orbit piggybacking on a russian soyuz rocket . the 600-kilo -lrb- 1,320 pound -rrb- british-built giove-a is scheduled to orbit at 23,000 kilometers -lrb- 14,500 miles -rrb- above the earth . a strategic step for europe " this is an essential step in the galileo project : going from theory to practice , " said dominique detain , a spokesman for esa on the galileo project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : galileo will be the first civilian-controlled satellite navigation system the giove-a satellite will test various technologies including an atomic clock that esa says is the most exact ever sent into space .
giove is an acronym standing for galileo in orbit validation element , but also the italian name for the planet jupiter whose moons were discovered by the famous renaissance astronomer galileo galilei . with the galileo project europe hopes to gain its independence in the strategic domain of navigating by satellite , which has become indispensable for managing traffic in the air , at sea , and even on motorways . the united states and the eu last year reached an accord on adopting common operating standards for the two systems , overcoming american concerns that the galileo system will compromise the security of gps , on which the us military is heavily dependent . an extraordinary level of precision according to esa , galileo , which will be under civilian control , is designed to deliver real-time positioning accuracy down to the meter range , which is unprecedented for a publicly available system . it will guarantee service under all but the most extreme circumstances and will inform users within seconds of a failure of any satellite , which will make it especially valuable where safety is crucial , such as running trains , guiding cars and landing aircraft . once in orbit , giove-a will be under the control of the surrey satellite systems operations center in the british city of guildford . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : galileo will consist of 30 satellites orbiting around the earth the project 's next phase will be the launch of a second giove-b test satellite in 2006 , followed with four working satellites by 2008 .
the ultimate goal remains a constellation of 30 satellites encircling the globe . the date for opening the network to commercial use has been pushed back two years to 2010 . to help cover the cost of the huge investment , the eu has sought other contributors to the project .
to date , agreements have been signed with china and israel , and negotiations are under way with about a dozen other nations including ukraine , india and morocco . between cooperation and competition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : urging russia to compete with both europe and the us : russian president vladimir putin galileo will also be compatible with glonass , the russian network of 24 geostationary satellites , which is not scheduled to be in operation before 2008 . according to the ria-novosti news agency , russian president vladimir putin urged his government on monday to speed up development of russia 's planned satellite navigation system . " we have to see what we can do in 2006 and 2007 to develop the commercial utilization of this system , " putin said . like the american network , glonass will be controlled by military operators that can not guarantee the maintenance of an uninterrupted service . russia has already launched 17 of the planned system satellites , including three placed into orbit on sunday , but putin warned that some of these may be out of date by the time the navigation system is inaugurated unless the development is hurried along . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe keen to join russia in new spaceship project the russian plan to build a new spacecraft for manned missions has captured the attention of the european space agency .

but it remains unclear whether the german army will take over security duties during the mammoth event . the german army 's duties are unambiguously laid down in the constitution .
within germany , the armed forces are only allowed to be deployed for defense or to counter a looming threat to the democracy of the federal republic or a state . further , the army may be deployed to protect civilian objects to support police measures .
such deployments however , require the support of both houses of parliament . " relieving a stretched police force " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble has already raised an outcry with plans to tighten anti-terror measures but new german interior minister wolfgang schäuble of the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- wants to go a step further by pressing the army into service to secure next year 's soccer world cup . " during the world cup , for example , our federal and state police forces will be very stretched , " schäuble told daily süddeutsche zeitung earlier this month , suggesting the army could be deployed during the finals , which take place in 12 german cities from june 9 to july 9 . " why should n't we transfer security services temporarily to the armed forces from the police to relieve them , " he suggested . germany 's constitution , written in 1949 with the lessons of nazi rule in mind , establishes strict separation between police and military .
under the nazis , the line between the two became blurred , leading to a ruthless militarized police state . schäuble said armed forces could be used to guard stadiums , airports and team quarters . " no one wants to see tanks in front of train stations or stadiums , this is completely absurd … yet you can imagine what would happen if somewhere a bomb in a back pack would explode . " " not the army 's brief " however , schäuble 's comments to call on the army in " exceptional circumstances " have met with resistance .
german defense minister franz josef jung said on tuesday he would be opposed to the army being deployed during the world cup finals in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the presence of german soliders on the streets is viewed uneasily in germany " we should not have a discussion now about whether the army takes on police duties .
that is not their brief , " jung told the rheinische post newspaper . the military would , however , be pressed into service during the finals in the event of a catastrophe , jung added , pointing to the work of soldiers in keeping transport links and electricity supplies functioning during heavy snowfalls in the heavily populated german state of north rhine-westphalia following christmas . debate to continue at the same time , both the parties in the ruling grand coalition - the cdu as well as the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- plan to further thrash out the issue of domestic deployments for the german army . the coalition treaty signed by the two parties mentions that in light of new terror threats , foreign security can no longer be clearly separated from domestic security .

"
schröder prepares for a life in stand-up former german chancellor schröder certainly knows how to stay in the headlines .
his wildly lucrative business deals are not giving his critics a chance to even begin lowering their eyebrows . when asked what his plans were after leaving the white house , former president bill clinton responded - frankly and without any qualms - that he was interested in making money .
the enticing connection between politics and profit seems to have captured the imagination of former german chancellor gerhard schröder as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they have the same agent : gerhard schröder and former us president bill clinton schröder 's office announced on tuesday that the media-savvy former chancellor had landed another lucrative business contract , this time with new york-based public speaking booking agency . the harry walker agency , which already boasts a stable of prominent ex-politicians including former us presidents bill clinton and jimmy carter , reportedly commands up to $ 250,000 -lrb- 210,000 euros -rrb- per speech .
schröder 's office declined to comment on his rate for speaking engagements . the press is having a blast the mass-market german daily bild reprinted a promotional letter by the harry walker agency in which it announced its " exclusive representation of gerhard schröder , german chancellor 1998-2005 . " " the twice elected leader of germany , chancellor gerhard schröder , has been a major force on the world 's political stage for the past eight years , " the letter printed in bild and signed by a company executive said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder closed the russian-german pipeline deal while still in office " chancellor schröder is a leading world statesman and internationally recognized authority on global relations , economic development and social change .
i look forward to speaking with you about scheduling this charismatic and influential world leader for an upcoming event . " schröder 's swift career moves and his ability to turn his political experience into profitable business deals has been picked up in other european countries as well : " -lrb- schröder -rrb- made a name for himself with his opposition to the iraq war .
that increases the price of his fame , if not his weight as a statesman , " the italian daily corriere della sera commented on wednesday . same old story schröder already came under fire in german and european political circles this month for taking a job with a subsidiary of russian energy giant gazprom , which is building an ambitious gas pipeline from russia to germany , just after he left office in november . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what a ride it 's been !

but it remains unclear whether the german army will take over security duties during the mammoth event . the german army 's duties are unambiguously laid down in the constitution .
within germany , the armed forces are only allowed to be deployed for defense or to counter a looming threat to the democracy of the federal republic or a state . further , the army may be deployed to protect civilian objects to support police measures .
such deployments however , require the support of both houses of parliament . " relieving a stretched police force " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble has already raised an outcry with plans to tighten anti-terror measures but new german interior minister wolfgang schäuble of the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- wants to go a step further by pressing the army into service to secure next year 's soccer world cup . " during the world cup , for example , our federal and state police forces will be very stretched , " schäuble told daily süddeutsche zeitung earlier this month , suggesting the army could be deployed during the finals , which take place in 12 german cities from june 9 to july 9 . " why should n't we transfer security services temporarily to the armed forces from the police to relieve them , " he suggested . germany 's constitution , written in 1949 with the lessons of nazi rule in mind , establishes strict separation between police and military .
under the nazis , the line between the two became blurred , leading to a ruthless militarized police state . schäuble said armed forces could be used to guard stadiums , airports and team quarters . " no one wants to see tanks in front of train stations or stadiums , this is completely absurd … yet you can imagine what would happen if somewhere a bomb in a back pack would explode . " " not the army 's brief " however , schäuble 's comments to call on the army in " exceptional circumstances " have met with resistance .
german defense minister franz josef jung said on tuesday he would be opposed to the army being deployed during the world cup finals in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the presence of german soliders on the streets is viewed uneasily in germany " we should not have a discussion now about whether the army takes on police duties .
that is not their brief , " jung told the rheinische post newspaper . the military would , however , be pressed into service during the finals in the event of a catastrophe , jung added , pointing to the work of soldiers in keeping transport links and electricity supplies functioning during heavy snowfalls in the heavily populated german state of north rhine-westphalia following christmas . debate to continue at the same time , both the parties in the ruling grand coalition - the cdu as well as the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- plan to further thrash out the issue of domestic deployments for the german army . the coalition treaty signed by the two parties mentions that in light of new terror threats , foreign security can no longer be clearly separated from domestic security .

today , the stars have been replaced by satellites . orbiting at a distance of some 23,000 kilometers above the earth ’ s surface , several dozen satellites , many sent up in the late 1950s and 1960s by the united states and the soviet union for military use , provide ships and planes with a global navigation system .
in the last 10 years , the number of satellites used for commercial purposes has increased rapidly , but the united states still dominates the field , and the pentagon controls access .
all that will change in the next few years with the launch of galileo , the european global satellite navigation system .
the giove-a satellite - the first in what will eventually become a constellation of 30 satellites encircling the globe - is scheduled for launch on wednesday morning .
a global service industry when galileo becomes fully operational , people anywhere in the world will be able to rely on the esa ’ s satellite technology for personal navigation .
in northern norway , for example , where there is no possibility of accessing global navigation systems because the current satellite network does not cover the region , a combination of galileo and special mobile phones will enable people to determine their exact position , down to the very meter , free of charge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : personal navigation systems may change the way we travel commercial channels , on the other hand , will charge a fee for their use .
a transport company , for instance , will be able to keep track of where each one of its trucks is located , while the truck drivers themselves rely on galileo to help them navigate through foreign cities .
europe 's biggest infrastructure project ever , galileo is lead by the european space agency and the firm galileo industries , a germany-based consortium that includes european space industry giants like eads , alcatel and alenia spazio .
by the time operations of the 30-satellite constellation begin , the eu will have invested approximately 3.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.5 billion -rrb- in this ambitious project .
galileo creates employment opportunities global navigation is rapidly becoming a lucrative market .
the european states participating in the galileo project are expecting big returns on their investment .
supporters of the project predict that it will lead to the creation of some 140,000 jobs in the high-tech sector and generate € 74 billion in earnings over the next 20 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : returning to nature , aided by satellite navigation germany , as galileo ’ s largest financial investor hopes to profit the most from the system , and was a strong advocate in lobbying for esa approval .
after its completion , europe 's galileo navigation system will guide trucks carrying goods across european highways , it will help land planes at europe 's crowded airports , it will assist ships docking in its busy ports , and it will aid the blind in finding their way through city streets .
but to many europeans , the most important thing about galileo is that it will wean the eu of its technological dependence on the american global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- .
cutting a deal with washington europeans have long complained that gps is unreliable for critical use because , as a military system , it can and has been scrambled during times of crisis .
the system , which is under the control of the u.s. department of defense , can be downgraded or even switched off if the government believes it is being manipulated by an enemy state or a terrorist group .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european satellite navigation system was named after italian astronomer galileo galilei this happened , for instance , during the war in kosovo when the u.s. restricted european use of the gps .
that lack of reliability has made gps unfeasible for applications where a slight inaccuracy could result in deaths , like air traffic control .
for a number of years , galileo served as a serious thorn in the side of transatlantic relations .
officials in washington feared the spectrum used by galileo could interfere with the gps signal used by the military , making it difficult for the americans to scramble the signal in times of crisis .
others in the us argued that satellite navigation systems should be available for free , like gps , and there was no need for a commercial version .
but washington and brussels reached a deal in june 2004 that will make the two systems compatible and interoperable while at the same time maintaining autonomy over each system , effectively eliminating any remaining conflict over the project dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe keen to join russia in new spaceship project the russian plan to build a new spacecraft for manned missions has captured the attention of the european space agency .

"
schröder prepares for a life in stand-up former german chancellor schröder certainly knows how to stay in the headlines .
his wildly lucrative business deals are not giving his critics a chance to even begin lowering their eyebrows . when asked what his plans were after leaving the white house , former president bill clinton responded - frankly and without any qualms - that he was interested in making money .
the enticing connection between politics and profit seems to have captured the imagination of former german chancellor gerhard schröder as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they have the same agent : gerhard schröder and former us president bill clinton schröder 's office announced on tuesday that the media-savvy former chancellor had landed another lucrative business contract , this time with new york-based public speaking booking agency . the harry walker agency , which already boasts a stable of prominent ex-politicians including former us presidents bill clinton and jimmy carter , reportedly commands up to $ 250,000 -lrb- 210,000 euros -rrb- per speech .
schröder 's office declined to comment on his rate for speaking engagements . the press is having a blast the mass-market german daily bild reprinted a promotional letter by the harry walker agency in which it announced its " exclusive representation of gerhard schröder , german chancellor 1998-2005 . " " the twice elected leader of germany , chancellor gerhard schröder , has been a major force on the world 's political stage for the past eight years , " the letter printed in bild and signed by a company executive said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder closed the russian-german pipeline deal while still in office " chancellor schröder is a leading world statesman and internationally recognized authority on global relations , economic development and social change .
i look forward to speaking with you about scheduling this charismatic and influential world leader for an upcoming event . " schröder 's swift career moves and his ability to turn his political experience into profitable business deals has been picked up in other european countries as well : " -lrb- schröder -rrb- made a name for himself with his opposition to the iraq war .
that increases the price of his fame , if not his weight as a statesman , " the italian daily corriere della sera commented on wednesday . same old story schröder already came under fire in german and european political circles this month for taking a job with a subsidiary of russian energy giant gazprom , which is building an ambitious gas pipeline from russia to germany , just after he left office in november . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what a ride it 's been !
russian president putin ended up as schröder 's best buddy the four-billion euro pipeline agreement was signed just 10 days before the german general elections in september , at a ceremony attended by schröder and russian president vladimir putin . the 61-year-old schröder , who is also setting up shop in berlin as a lawyer , has already accepted a position as a part-time adviser on international political affairs for the swiss publishing group ringier . to prepare for his new career in international business , schröder recently spent 12 days brushing up on his english skills in the welsh countryside . introduction of honor code unlikely members of the opposition green party in the german parliament - who used to be schröder 's coalition partners during both of his terms in office - are now toying with the idea of introducing a binding honor code for former politicians in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : constitutional court president hans-jürgen papier president of the german constitutional court hans-jürgen papier , however , seemed skeptical about the proposal . " i am not sure if such a code of honor could ever cover all the possible cases , " papier said . " in the end , leaders in high offices should be able to judge for themselves what is appropriate , morally acceptable and fair , " he said . parliamentary group leaders are expected to address the issue at a meeting on jan .

a look at one of the geniuses of the german-speaking world . on jan .
27 , 1756 , musical wunderkind wolfgang amadeus mozart was born in salzburg , austria .
despite early success , the composer died in poverty in vienna on dec .
5 , 1791 .
only after his death was mozart celebrated as one of the greatest musical geniuses of all times . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world-famous mozart kugeln interest in the composer never seems to wane .
publishers continue to put out murder mysteries , audio books , novels , biographies , and new academic findings from the world of mozart research .
and if anyone had thought to secure the royalties for mozart-related products during the composer 's lifetime , he would be rich today .
probably the best known are mozart kugeln - the marzipan flavored chocolate balls wrapped in cellophane bearing his likeness . festivities in augsburg some facts of mozart 's life are well known .
for instance , he began showing extraordinary music talent at an exceptionally young age .
he wrote his first composition at age five ; at seven he is said to have taught himself how to play the violin and the organ .
by age eight he had composed piano sonatas , and at 12 he wrote his first opera .
his father leopold , himself a violin teacher , recognized his son 's talent and toured europe with wolfgang and his sister anna maria .
by 1766 , the siblings had been to paris , london and the hague , where they played before royalty and in public academies .
at first , though , mozart performed in munich and vienna , then in augsburg and frankfurt . augsburg was leopold mozart 's home town , and that is where germany 's " mozart year 2006 " will take place , under the patronage of german president horst köhler . the year gets under full swing during may , with two straight weeks of historically accurate performances of works by both father and son .
vienna will be hosting a similar festival . return to salzburg mozart is considered one of the first composers who was not dependent on the court ; he earned enough money in his child-star years to be financially independent .
as a teenager , he was temporarily named unpaid concert master of the salzburg court orchestra , but he asked to be let go in august .
he tried unsuccessfully to get jobs in munich , mannheim and paris before returning to be court organist in salzburg after his mother 's death in 1788 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ubiquitous in salzburg : the composer 's statue in mozart square today , salzburg is the epicenter of mozart studies .
in 2006 the town will host innumerable artistic projects , workshops and exhibits that aim to shed some light on the composer 's life , work and personality .
the head of the salzburg festival , peter ruzicka , has put all 22 mozart operas on the festival lineup . in 1782 , mozart married konstanze weber , and the two lived together in vienna .
he supported his family by giving piano lessons and found patronage from emperor joseph ii , for whom he wrote operas , including the marriage of figaro . not pleasing to the public but the public found his music too complex and critical of social mores , and mozart 's financial situation worsened steadily . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this oil portrait of mozart is said to be truest to his likeness although he was named royal chamber composer in 1787 , the pay was low .
he had a final success with his opera the magic flute in 1791 , but died at age 35 , impoverished , while working on his requiem . the exact cause of mozart 's death is debated , and speculations range from poisoning to syphillis .
he was given a pauper 's burial at the st. marx cemetary in vienna , which is being restored for the occasion . despite his short life , mozart composed more than 600 works ; a multifaceted repertoire of symphonies , concerts , sonatas , operas , and secular and religious vocal music .
even if recent research shows the genius was not above borrowing from his contemporaries -lrb- such as joseph haydn -rrb- , his oeuvre is still an important part of the western canon . the performances honoring mozart will go on throughout the year , but on jan .
27 , 2006 , mozart afficionados who want to be at the center of the action should travel to vienna .
there will be premieres , concerts and television shows broadast around the world , in honor of nearly a quarter-millennium of the maestro 's music . gaby reucher -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bringing bach to the mtv generation last year , 25-year-old martin stadtfeld shot to fame on a daring recording of bach 's goldberg variations .

a look at one of the geniuses of the german-speaking world . on jan .
27 , 1756 , musical wunderkind wolfgang amadeus mozart was born in salzburg , austria .
despite early success , the composer died in poverty in vienna on dec .
5 , 1791 .
only after his death was mozart celebrated as one of the greatest musical geniuses of all times . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world-famous mozart kugeln interest in the composer never seems to wane .
publishers continue to put out murder mysteries , audio books , novels , biographies , and new academic findings from the world of mozart research .
and if anyone had thought to secure the royalties for mozart-related products during the composer 's lifetime , he would be rich today .
probably the best known are mozart kugeln - the marzipan flavored chocolate balls wrapped in cellophane bearing his likeness . festivities in augsburg some facts of mozart 's life are well known .
for instance , he began showing extraordinary music talent at an exceptionally young age .
he wrote his first composition at age five ; at seven he is said to have taught himself how to play the violin and the organ .
by age eight he had composed piano sonatas , and at 12 he wrote his first opera .
his father leopold , himself a violin teacher , recognized his son 's talent and toured europe with wolfgang and his sister anna maria .
by 1766 , the siblings had been to paris , london and the hague , where they played before royalty and in public academies .
at first , though , mozart performed in munich and vienna , then in augsburg and frankfurt . augsburg was leopold mozart 's home town , and that is where germany 's " mozart year 2006 " will take place , under the patronage of german president horst köhler . the year gets under full swing during may , with two straight weeks of historically accurate performances of works by both father and son .
vienna will be hosting a similar festival . return to salzburg mozart is considered one of the first composers who was not dependent on the court ; he earned enough money in his child-star years to be financially independent .
as a teenager , he was temporarily named unpaid concert master of the salzburg court orchestra , but he asked to be let go in august .
he tried unsuccessfully to get jobs in munich , mannheim and paris before returning to be court organist in salzburg after his mother 's death in 1788 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ubiquitous in salzburg : the composer 's statue in mozart square today , salzburg is the epicenter of mozart studies .
in 2006 the town will host innumerable artistic projects , workshops and exhibits that aim to shed some light on the composer 's life , work and personality .
the head of the salzburg festival , peter ruzicka , has put all 22 mozart operas on the festival lineup . in 1782 , mozart married konstanze weber , and the two lived together in vienna .
he supported his family by giving piano lessons and found patronage from emperor joseph ii , for whom he wrote operas , including the marriage of figaro . not pleasing to the public but the public found his music too complex and critical of social mores , and mozart 's financial situation worsened steadily . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this oil portrait of mozart is said to be truest to his likeness although he was named royal chamber composer in 1787 , the pay was low .
he had a final success with his opera the magic flute in 1791 , but died at age 35 , impoverished , while working on his requiem . the exact cause of mozart 's death is debated , and speculations range from poisoning to syphillis .
he was given a pauper 's burial at the st. marx cemetary in vienna , which is being restored for the occasion . despite his short life , mozart composed more than 600 works ; a multifaceted repertoire of symphonies , concerts , sonatas , operas , and secular and religious vocal music .
even if recent research shows the genius was not above borrowing from his contemporaries -lrb- such as joseph haydn -rrb- , his oeuvre is still an important part of the western canon . the performances honoring mozart will go on throughout the year , but on jan .
27 , 2006 , mozart afficionados who want to be at the center of the action should travel to vienna .
there will be premieres , concerts and television shows broadast around the world , in honor of nearly a quarter-millennium of the maestro 's music . gaby reucher -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bringing bach to the mtv generation last year , 25-year-old martin stadtfeld shot to fame on a daring recording of bach 's goldberg variations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 28.12.2005 galileo : europe 's biggest infrastructure project großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : galileo will be a truly global navigation system five hundred years ago people looked to the stars for navigation , relying on their position in the hemisphere to guide them across the continents and oceans .
today , the stars have been replaced by satellites . orbiting at a distance of some 23,000 kilometers above the earth ’ s surface , several dozen satellites , many sent up in the late 1950s and 1960s by the united states and the soviet union for military use , provide ships and planes with a global navigation system .
in the last 10 years , the number of satellites used for commercial purposes has increased rapidly , but the united states still dominates the field , and the pentagon controls access .
all that will change in the next few years with the launch of galileo , the european global satellite navigation system .
the giove-a satellite - the first in what will eventually become a constellation of 30 satellites encircling the globe - is scheduled for launch on wednesday morning .
a global service industry when galileo becomes fully operational , people anywhere in the world will be able to rely on the esa ’ s satellite technology for personal navigation .
in northern norway , for example , where there is no possibility of accessing global navigation systems because the current satellite network does not cover the region , a combination of galileo and special mobile phones will enable people to determine their exact position , down to the very meter , free of charge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : personal navigation systems may change the way we travel commercial channels , on the other hand , will charge a fee for their use .
a transport company , for instance , will be able to keep track of where each one of its trucks is located , while the truck drivers themselves rely on galileo to help them navigate through foreign cities .
europe 's biggest infrastructure project ever , galileo is lead by the european space agency and the firm galileo industries , a germany-based consortium that includes european space industry giants like eads , alcatel and alenia spazio .
by the time operations of the 30-satellite constellation begin , the eu will have invested approximately 3.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.5 billion -rrb- in this ambitious project .
galileo creates employment opportunities global navigation is rapidly becoming a lucrative market .
the european states participating in the galileo project are expecting big returns on their investment .
supporters of the project predict that it will lead to the creation of some 140,000 jobs in the high-tech sector and generate € 74 billion in earnings over the next 20 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : returning to nature , aided by satellite navigation germany , as galileo ’ s largest financial investor hopes to profit the most from the system , and was a strong advocate in lobbying for esa approval .
after its completion , europe 's galileo navigation system will guide trucks carrying goods across european highways , it will help land planes at europe 's crowded airports , it will assist ships docking in its busy ports , and it will aid the blind in finding their way through city streets .
but to many europeans , the most important thing about galileo is that it will wean the eu of its technological dependence on the american global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- .
cutting a deal with washington europeans have long complained that gps is unreliable for critical use because , as a military system , it can and has been scrambled during times of crisis .
the system , which is under the control of the u.s. department of defense , can be downgraded or even switched off if the government believes it is being manipulated by an enemy state or a terrorist group .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european satellite navigation system was named after italian astronomer galileo galilei this happened , for instance , during the war in kosovo when the u.s. restricted european use of the gps .
that lack of reliability has made gps unfeasible for applications where a slight inaccuracy could result in deaths , like air traffic control .
for a number of years , galileo served as a serious thorn in the side of transatlantic relations .
officials in washington feared the spectrum used by galileo could interfere with the gps signal used by the military , making it difficult for the americans to scramble the signal in times of crisis .
others in the us argued that satellite navigation systems should be available for free , like gps , and there was no need for a commercial version .
but washington and brussels reached a deal in june 2004 that will make the two systems compatible and interoperable while at the same time maintaining autonomy over each system , effectively eliminating any remaining conflict over the project dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe keen to join russia in new spaceship project the russian plan to build a new spacecraft for manned missions has captured the attention of the european space agency .

today , the stars have been replaced by satellites . orbiting at a distance of some 23,000 kilometers above the earth ’ s surface , several dozen satellites , many sent up in the late 1950s and 1960s by the united states and the soviet union for military use , provide ships and planes with a global navigation system .
in the last 10 years , the number of satellites used for commercial purposes has increased rapidly , but the united states still dominates the field , and the pentagon controls access .
all that will change in the next few years with the launch of galileo , the european global satellite navigation system .
the giove-a satellite - the first in what will eventually become a constellation of 30 satellites encircling the globe - is scheduled for launch on wednesday morning .
a global service industry when galileo becomes fully operational , people anywhere in the world will be able to rely on the esa ’ s satellite technology for personal navigation .
in northern norway , for example , where there is no possibility of accessing global navigation systems because the current satellite network does not cover the region , a combination of galileo and special mobile phones will enable people to determine their exact position , down to the very meter , free of charge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : personal navigation systems may change the way we travel commercial channels , on the other hand , will charge a fee for their use .
a transport company , for instance , will be able to keep track of where each one of its trucks is located , while the truck drivers themselves rely on galileo to help them navigate through foreign cities .
europe 's biggest infrastructure project ever , galileo is lead by the european space agency and the firm galileo industries , a germany-based consortium that includes european space industry giants like eads , alcatel and alenia spazio .
by the time operations of the 30-satellite constellation begin , the eu will have invested approximately 3.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.5 billion -rrb- in this ambitious project .
galileo creates employment opportunities global navigation is rapidly becoming a lucrative market .
the european states participating in the galileo project are expecting big returns on their investment .
supporters of the project predict that it will lead to the creation of some 140,000 jobs in the high-tech sector and generate € 74 billion in earnings over the next 20 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : returning to nature , aided by satellite navigation germany , as galileo ’ s largest financial investor hopes to profit the most from the system , and was a strong advocate in lobbying for esa approval .
after its completion , europe 's galileo navigation system will guide trucks carrying goods across european highways , it will help land planes at europe 's crowded airports , it will assist ships docking in its busy ports , and it will aid the blind in finding their way through city streets .
but to many europeans , the most important thing about galileo is that it will wean the eu of its technological dependence on the american global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- .
cutting a deal with washington europeans have long complained that gps is unreliable for critical use because , as a military system , it can and has been scrambled during times of crisis .
the system , which is under the control of the u.s. department of defense , can be downgraded or even switched off if the government believes it is being manipulated by an enemy state or a terrorist group .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european satellite navigation system was named after italian astronomer galileo galilei this happened , for instance , during the war in kosovo when the u.s. restricted european use of the gps .
that lack of reliability has made gps unfeasible for applications where a slight inaccuracy could result in deaths , like air traffic control .
for a number of years , galileo served as a serious thorn in the side of transatlantic relations .
officials in washington feared the spectrum used by galileo could interfere with the gps signal used by the military , making it difficult for the americans to scramble the signal in times of crisis .
others in the us argued that satellite navigation systems should be available for free , like gps , and there was no need for a commercial version .
but washington and brussels reached a deal in june 2004 that will make the two systems compatible and interoperable while at the same time maintaining autonomy over each system , effectively eliminating any remaining conflict over the project dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe keen to join russia in new spaceship project the russian plan to build a new spacecraft for manned missions has captured the attention of the european space agency .

in 2004 , the budget deficit reached 3.9 percent , and the commission predicts the 2005 deficit to reach 3.3 percent of gdp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrück finds himself between a rock and a hard place new german finance minister peer steinbrück , who finds himself in the unenviable position of explaining how germany could initiate loosening the pact and then promptly violate it again , has indicated that he plans to tread carefully . " all i want to say is that i am aware that german interests are in sync with the eu commission and we do n't want to allow a repeat of november 2003 , " steinbrück said recently . a franco-german scheme at that time , former german finance minister hans eichel together with his french counterpart torpedoed a decision by eu finance ministers to tighten disciplinary measures against eu stability and growth pact offenders . the european parliament later ruled that the procedure was , in important aspects , not entirely legal .
but , since the stability pact was then reformed by march 2005 under the leadership of luxembourg 's jean-claude juncker , the commission held back with taking further disciplinary measures against germany and other members . one of the reasons was also hans eichel 's insistence that germany would respect the three percent deficit ceiling - something that is not likely to happen even in 2006 . reform brings more flexibility juncker , who is eurogroup chairman , said he was hopeful that germany would finally manage to honor its promises . " in the meetings i have had with -lrb- new german chancellor -rrb- angela merkel , i have noted a genuine willingness to respect the pact , " juncker said last month .
" germany will manage to fulfill all conditions of the stability pact by the end of 2007 .
i 'm confident that the new government will manage it . " the german government however need not fear direct financial sanctions from brussels to start with , even when disciplinary measures are officially taken a step further in 2006 . the reformed stability and growth pact has created overall flexibility , particularly for member countries whose budgets , despite reforms , can only be consolidated gradually whether it 's because of weak economic growth or special financial burdens that hamper an economic upswing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans eichel managed to chew down the stability pact in march this year " we have achieved what i have always demanded : the pact is now more economically rational , growth-friendly and allows - what is also economically needed and what the pact itself aims for - a stronger case by case assessment , " eichel said in march this year after a marathon night of negotiations in which the original stability pact was fundamentally loosened . present government benefits from relaxed pact as the present grand coalition looks for ways to cut its public spending and rein in its budget deficit below the crucial three percent of gdp , one ca n't help wondering at the irony of things : the conservative-dominated government is profiting from the greater leeway afforded by the reformed pact though the conservatives had always , during their time in opposition , slammed hans eichel for watering down the pact . christopher plass -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de meet the eu 's deficit sinners although repeatedly cited for failure to rein in deficit spending , germany and france are by no means the only violaters of eu deficit guidelines .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 28.12.2005 germany both reformer and violator of eu budgetary pact großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany and other eu members will be forced to rein in spending next year germany is set to breach the eu 's stability and growth pact for the fourth time in a row despite succeeding in loosening the guidelines earlier this year . the eu stability and growth pact , which sets a ceiling of 3 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- on member countries ' budget deficits , was all but declared dead earlier this year . but , now it 's meant to be revived and flex some new muscle if joaquin almunia gets his way . the eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner plans to doggedly force eu members to rein in spending even though the budgetary pact was reformed and relaxed in march this year . almunia has said that starting january next year , ongoing disciplinary measures against certain eu budgetary pact violators , including germany , will be toughened . germany a serial offender the move spells further bad news for germany , which despite pressurizing the eu to ease budgetary guidelines , looks likely to fall victim to its own scheme . every year since 2002 , germany has violated the stability pact rules .
in 2004 , the budget deficit reached 3.9 percent , and the commission predicts the 2005 deficit to reach 3.3 percent of gdp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrück finds himself between a rock and a hard place new german finance minister peer steinbrück , who finds himself in the unenviable position of explaining how germany could initiate loosening the pact and then promptly violate it again , has indicated that he plans to tread carefully . " all i want to say is that i am aware that german interests are in sync with the eu commission and we do n't want to allow a repeat of november 2003 , " steinbrück said recently . a franco-german scheme at that time , former german finance minister hans eichel together with his french counterpart torpedoed a decision by eu finance ministers to tighten disciplinary measures against eu stability and growth pact offenders . the european parliament later ruled that the procedure was , in important aspects , not entirely legal .
but , since the stability pact was then reformed by march 2005 under the leadership of luxembourg 's jean-claude juncker , the commission held back with taking further disciplinary measures against germany and other members . one of the reasons was also hans eichel 's insistence that germany would respect the three percent deficit ceiling - something that is not likely to happen even in 2006 . reform brings more flexibility juncker , who is eurogroup chairman , said he was hopeful that germany would finally manage to honor its promises . " in the meetings i have had with -lrb- new german chancellor -rrb- angela merkel , i have noted a genuine willingness to respect the pact , " juncker said last month .
" germany will manage to fulfill all conditions of the stability pact by the end of 2007 .
i 'm confident that the new government will manage it . " the german government however need not fear direct financial sanctions from brussels to start with , even when disciplinary measures are officially taken a step further in 2006 . the reformed stability and growth pact has created overall flexibility , particularly for member countries whose budgets , despite reforms , can only be consolidated gradually whether it 's because of weak economic growth or special financial burdens that hamper an economic upswing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans eichel managed to chew down the stability pact in march this year " we have achieved what i have always demanded : the pact is now more economically rational , growth-friendly and allows - what is also economically needed and what the pact itself aims for - a stronger case by case assessment , " eichel said in march this year after a marathon night of negotiations in which the original stability pact was fundamentally loosened . present government benefits from relaxed pact as the present grand coalition looks for ways to cut its public spending and rein in its budget deficit below the crucial three percent of gdp , one ca n't help wondering at the irony of things : the conservative-dominated government is profiting from the greater leeway afforded by the reformed pact though the conservatives had always , during their time in opposition , slammed hans eichel for watering down the pact . christopher plass -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de meet the eu 's deficit sinners although repeatedly cited for failure to rein in deficit spending , germany and france are by no means the only violaters of eu deficit guidelines .

today , the stars have been replaced by satellites . orbiting at a distance of some 23,000 kilometers above the earth ’ s surface , several dozen satellites , many sent up in the late 1950s and 1960s by the united states and the soviet union for military use , provide ships and planes with a global navigation system .
in the last 10 years , the number of satellites used for commercial purposes has increased rapidly , but the united states still dominates the field , and the pentagon controls access .
all that will change in the next few years with the launch of galileo , the european global satellite navigation system .
the giove-a satellite - the first in what will eventually become a constellation of 30 satellites encircling the globe - is scheduled for launch on wednesday morning .
a global service industry when galileo becomes fully operational , people anywhere in the world will be able to rely on the esa ’ s satellite technology for personal navigation .
in northern norway , for example , where there is no possibility of accessing global navigation systems because the current satellite network does not cover the region , a combination of galileo and special mobile phones will enable people to determine their exact position , down to the very meter , free of charge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : personal navigation systems may change the way we travel commercial channels , on the other hand , will charge a fee for their use .
a transport company , for instance , will be able to keep track of where each one of its trucks is located , while the truck drivers themselves rely on galileo to help them navigate through foreign cities .
europe 's biggest infrastructure project ever , galileo is lead by the european space agency and the firm galileo industries , a germany-based consortium that includes european space industry giants like eads , alcatel and alenia spazio .
by the time operations of the 30-satellite constellation begin , the eu will have invested approximately 3.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.5 billion -rrb- in this ambitious project .
galileo creates employment opportunities global navigation is rapidly becoming a lucrative market .
the european states participating in the galileo project are expecting big returns on their investment .
supporters of the project predict that it will lead to the creation of some 140,000 jobs in the high-tech sector and generate € 74 billion in earnings over the next 20 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : returning to nature , aided by satellite navigation germany , as galileo ’ s largest financial investor hopes to profit the most from the system , and was a strong advocate in lobbying for esa approval .
after its completion , europe 's galileo navigation system will guide trucks carrying goods across european highways , it will help land planes at europe 's crowded airports , it will assist ships docking in its busy ports , and it will aid the blind in finding their way through city streets .
but to many europeans , the most important thing about galileo is that it will wean the eu of its technological dependence on the american global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- .
cutting a deal with washington europeans have long complained that gps is unreliable for critical use because , as a military system , it can and has been scrambled during times of crisis .
the system , which is under the control of the u.s. department of defense , can be downgraded or even switched off if the government believes it is being manipulated by an enemy state or a terrorist group .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european satellite navigation system was named after italian astronomer galileo galilei this happened , for instance , during the war in kosovo when the u.s. restricted european use of the gps .
that lack of reliability has made gps unfeasible for applications where a slight inaccuracy could result in deaths , like air traffic control .
for a number of years , galileo served as a serious thorn in the side of transatlantic relations .
officials in washington feared the spectrum used by galileo could interfere with the gps signal used by the military , making it difficult for the americans to scramble the signal in times of crisis .
others in the us argued that satellite navigation systems should be available for free , like gps , and there was no need for a commercial version .
but washington and brussels reached a deal in june 2004 that will make the two systems compatible and interoperable while at the same time maintaining autonomy over each system , effectively eliminating any remaining conflict over the project dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe keen to join russia in new spaceship project the russian plan to build a new spacecraft for manned missions has captured the attention of the european space agency .

by the time operations of the 30-satellite constellation begin , the eu will have invested approximately 3.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.5 billion -rrb- in this ambitious project .
galileo creates employment opportunities global navigation is rapidly becoming a lucrative market .
the european states participating in the galileo project are expecting big returns on their investment .
supporters of the project predict that it will lead to the creation of some 140,000 jobs in the high-tech sector and generate € 74 billion in earnings over the next 20 years .

after its completion , europe 's galileo navigation system will guide trucks carrying goods across european highways , it will help land planes at europe 's crowded airports , it will assist ships docking in its busy ports , and it will aid the blind in finding their way through city streets .
but to many europeans , the most important thing about galileo is that it will wean the eu of its technological dependence on the american global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- .
cutting a deal with washington europeans have long complained that gps is unreliable for critical use because , as a military system , it can and has been scrambled during times of crisis .
the system , which is under the control of the u.s. department of defense , can be downgraded or even switched off if the government believes it is being manipulated by an enemy state or a terrorist group .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european satellite navigation system was named after italian astronomer galileo galilei this happened , for instance , during the war in kosovo when the u.s. restricted european use of the gps .
that lack of reliability has made gps unfeasible for applications where a slight inaccuracy could result in deaths , like air traffic control .
for a number of years , galileo served as a serious thorn in the side of transatlantic relations .
officials in washington feared the spectrum used by galileo could interfere with the gps signal used by the military , making it difficult for the americans to scramble the signal in times of crisis .
others in the us argued that satellite navigation systems should be available for free , like gps , and there was no need for a commercial version .
but washington and brussels reached a deal in june 2004 that will make the two systems compatible and interoperable while at the same time maintaining autonomy over each system , effectively eliminating any remaining conflict over the project dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe keen to join russia in new spaceship project the russian plan to build a new spacecraft for manned missions has captured the attention of the european space agency .

"
schröder prepares for a life in stand-up former german chancellor schröder certainly knows how to stay in the headlines .
his wildly lucrative business deals are not giving his critics a chance to even begin lowering their eyebrows . when asked what his plans were after leaving the white house , former president bill clinton responded - frankly and without any qualms - that he was interested in making money .
the enticing connection between politics and profit seems to have captured the imagination of former german chancellor gerhard schröder as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they have the same agent : gerhard schröder and former us president bill clinton schröder 's office announced on tuesday that the media-savvy former chancellor had landed another lucrative business contract , this time with new york-based public speaking booking agency . the harry walker agency , which already boasts a stable of prominent ex-politicians including former us presidents bill clinton and jimmy carter , reportedly commands up to $ 250,000 -lrb- 210,000 euros -rrb- per speech .
schröder 's office declined to comment on his rate for speaking engagements . the press is having a blast the mass-market german daily bild reprinted a promotional letter by the harry walker agency in which it announced its " exclusive representation of gerhard schröder , german chancellor 1998-2005 . " " the twice elected leader of germany , chancellor gerhard schröder , has been a major force on the world 's political stage for the past eight years , " the letter printed in bild and signed by a company executive said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder closed the russian-german pipeline deal while still in office " chancellor schröder is a leading world statesman and internationally recognized authority on global relations , economic development and social change .
i look forward to speaking with you about scheduling this charismatic and influential world leader for an upcoming event . " schröder 's swift career moves and his ability to turn his political experience into profitable business deals has been picked up in other european countries as well : " -lrb- schröder -rrb- made a name for himself with his opposition to the iraq war .
that increases the price of his fame , if not his weight as a statesman , " the italian daily corriere della sera commented on wednesday . same old story schröder already came under fire in german and european political circles this month for taking a job with a subsidiary of russian energy giant gazprom , which is building an ambitious gas pipeline from russia to germany , just after he left office in november . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what a ride it 's been !
russian president putin ended up as schröder 's best buddy the four-billion euro pipeline agreement was signed just 10 days before the german general elections in september , at a ceremony attended by schröder and russian president vladimir putin . the 61-year-old schröder , who is also setting up shop in berlin as a lawyer , has already accepted a position as a part-time adviser on international political affairs for the swiss publishing group ringier . to prepare for his new career in international business , schröder recently spent 12 days brushing up on his english skills in the welsh countryside . introduction of honor code unlikely members of the opposition green party in the german parliament - who used to be schröder 's coalition partners during both of his terms in office - are now toying with the idea of introducing a binding honor code for former politicians in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : constitutional court president hans-jürgen papier president of the german constitutional court hans-jürgen papier , however , seemed skeptical about the proposal . " i am not sure if such a code of honor could ever cover all the possible cases , " papier said . " in the end , leaders in high offices should be able to judge for themselves what is appropriate , morally acceptable and fair , " he said . parliamentary group leaders are expected to address the issue at a meeting on jan .

but it remains unclear whether the german army will take over security duties during the mammoth event . the german army 's duties are unambiguously laid down in the constitution .
within germany , the armed forces are only allowed to be deployed for defense or to counter a looming threat to the democracy of the federal republic or a state . further , the army may be deployed to protect civilian objects to support police measures .
such deployments however , require the support of both houses of parliament . " relieving a stretched police force " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble has already raised an outcry with plans to tighten anti-terror measures but new german interior minister wolfgang schäuble of the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- wants to go a step further by pressing the army into service to secure next year 's soccer world cup . " during the world cup , for example , our federal and state police forces will be very stretched , " schäuble told daily süddeutsche zeitung earlier this month , suggesting the army could be deployed during the finals , which take place in 12 german cities from june 9 to july 9 . " why should n't we transfer security services temporarily to the armed forces from the police to relieve them , " he suggested . germany 's constitution , written in 1949 with the lessons of nazi rule in mind , establishes strict separation between police and military .
under the nazis , the line between the two became blurred , leading to a ruthless militarized police state . schäuble said armed forces could be used to guard stadiums , airports and team quarters . " no one wants to see tanks in front of train stations or stadiums , this is completely absurd … yet you can imagine what would happen if somewhere a bomb in a back pack would explode . " " not the army 's brief " however , schäuble 's comments to call on the army in " exceptional circumstances " have met with resistance .
german defense minister franz josef jung said on tuesday he would be opposed to the army being deployed during the world cup finals in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the presence of german soliders on the streets is viewed uneasily in germany " we should not have a discussion now about whether the army takes on police duties .
that is not their brief , " jung told the rheinische post newspaper . the military would , however , be pressed into service during the finals in the event of a catastrophe , jung added , pointing to the work of soldiers in keeping transport links and electricity supplies functioning during heavy snowfalls in the heavily populated german state of north rhine-westphalia following christmas . debate to continue at the same time , both the parties in the ruling grand coalition - the cdu as well as the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- plan to further thrash out the issue of domestic deployments for the german army . the coalition treaty signed by the two parties mentions that in light of new terror threats , foreign security can no longer be clearly separated from domestic security .

but it remains unclear whether the german army will take over security duties during the mammoth event . the german army 's duties are unambiguously laid down in the constitution .
within germany , the armed forces are only allowed to be deployed for defense or to counter a looming threat to the democracy of the federal republic or a state . further , the army may be deployed to protect civilian objects to support police measures .
such deployments however , require the support of both houses of parliament . " relieving a stretched police force " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble has already raised an outcry with plans to tighten anti-terror measures but new german interior minister wolfgang schäuble of the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- wants to go a step further by pressing the army into service to secure next year 's soccer world cup . " during the world cup , for example , our federal and state police forces will be very stretched , " schäuble told daily süddeutsche zeitung earlier this month , suggesting the army could be deployed during the finals , which take place in 12 german cities from june 9 to july 9 . " why should n't we transfer security services temporarily to the armed forces from the police to relieve them , " he suggested . germany 's constitution , written in 1949 with the lessons of nazi rule in mind , establishes strict separation between police and military .
under the nazis , the line between the two became blurred , leading to a ruthless militarized police state . schäuble said armed forces could be used to guard stadiums , airports and team quarters . " no one wants to see tanks in front of train stations or stadiums , this is completely absurd … yet you can imagine what would happen if somewhere a bomb in a back pack would explode . " " not the army 's brief " however , schäuble 's comments to call on the army in " exceptional circumstances " have met with resistance .
german defense minister franz josef jung said on tuesday he would be opposed to the army being deployed during the world cup finals in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the presence of german soliders on the streets is viewed uneasily in germany " we should not have a discussion now about whether the army takes on police duties .
that is not their brief , " jung told the rheinische post newspaper . the military would , however , be pressed into service during the finals in the event of a catastrophe , jung added , pointing to the work of soldiers in keeping transport links and electricity supplies functioning during heavy snowfalls in the heavily populated german state of north rhine-westphalia following christmas . debate to continue at the same time , both the parties in the ruling grand coalition - the cdu as well as the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- plan to further thrash out the issue of domestic deployments for the german army . the coalition treaty signed by the two parties mentions that in light of new terror threats , foreign security can no longer be clearly separated from domestic security .
the topic is expected to involve legal and constitutional clarifications . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de in war on terror , how far is too far ?

in 2004 , the budget deficit reached 3.9 percent , and the commission predicts the 2005 deficit to reach 3.3 percent of gdp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrück finds himself between a rock and a hard place new german finance minister peer steinbrück , who finds himself in the unenviable position of explaining how germany could initiate loosening the pact and then promptly violate it again , has indicated that he plans to tread carefully . " all i want to say is that i am aware that german interests are in sync with the eu commission and we do n't want to allow a repeat of november 2003 , " steinbrück said recently . a franco-german scheme at that time , former german finance minister hans eichel together with his french counterpart torpedoed a decision by eu finance ministers to tighten disciplinary measures against eu stability and growth pact offenders . the european parliament later ruled that the procedure was , in important aspects , not entirely legal .
but , since the stability pact was then reformed by march 2005 under the leadership of luxembourg 's jean-claude juncker , the commission held back with taking further disciplinary measures against germany and other members . one of the reasons was also hans eichel 's insistence that germany would respect the three percent deficit ceiling - something that is not likely to happen even in 2006 . reform brings more flexibility juncker , who is eurogroup chairman , said he was hopeful that germany would finally manage to honor its promises . " in the meetings i have had with -lrb- new german chancellor -rrb- angela merkel , i have noted a genuine willingness to respect the pact , " juncker said last month .
" germany will manage to fulfill all conditions of the stability pact by the end of 2007 .
i 'm confident that the new government will manage it . " the german government however need not fear direct financial sanctions from brussels to start with , even when disciplinary measures are officially taken a step further in 2006 . the reformed stability and growth pact has created overall flexibility , particularly for member countries whose budgets , despite reforms , can only be consolidated gradually whether it 's because of weak economic growth or special financial burdens that hamper an economic upswing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans eichel managed to chew down the stability pact in march this year " we have achieved what i have always demanded : the pact is now more economically rational , growth-friendly and allows - what is also economically needed and what the pact itself aims for - a stronger case by case assessment , " eichel said in march this year after a marathon night of negotiations in which the original stability pact was fundamentally loosened . present government benefits from relaxed pact as the present grand coalition looks for ways to cut its public spending and rein in its budget deficit below the crucial three percent of gdp , one ca n't help wondering at the irony of things : the conservative-dominated government is profiting from the greater leeway afforded by the reformed pact though the conservatives had always , during their time in opposition , slammed hans eichel for watering down the pact . christopher plass -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de meet the eu 's deficit sinners although repeatedly cited for failure to rein in deficit spending , germany and france are by no means the only violaters of eu deficit guidelines .

today , the stars have been replaced by satellites . orbiting at a distance of some 23,000 kilometers above the earth ’ s surface , several dozen satellites , many sent up in the late 1950s and 1960s by the united states and the soviet union for military use , provide ships and planes with a global navigation system .
in the last 10 years , the number of satellites used for commercial purposes has increased rapidly , but the united states still dominates the field , and the pentagon controls access .
all that will change in the next few years with the launch of galileo , the european global satellite navigation system .
the giove-a satellite - the first in what will eventually become a constellation of 30 satellites encircling the globe - is scheduled for launch on wednesday morning .
a global service industry when galileo becomes fully operational , people anywhere in the world will be able to rely on the esa ’ s satellite technology for personal navigation .
in northern norway , for example , where there is no possibility of accessing global navigation systems because the current satellite network does not cover the region , a combination of galileo and special mobile phones will enable people to determine their exact position , down to the very meter , free of charge .

a transport company , for instance , will be able to keep track of where each one of its trucks is located , while the truck drivers themselves rely on galileo to help them navigate through foreign cities .
europe 's biggest infrastructure project ever , galileo is lead by the european space agency and the firm galileo industries , a germany-based consortium that includes european space industry giants like eads , alcatel and alenia spazio .
by the time operations of the 30-satellite constellation begin , the eu will have invested approximately 3.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.5 billion -rrb- in this ambitious project .
galileo creates employment opportunities global navigation is rapidly becoming a lucrative market .
the european states participating in the galileo project are expecting big returns on their investment .

today , the stars have been replaced by satellites . orbiting at a distance of some 23,000 kilometers above the earth ’ s surface , several dozen satellites , many sent up in the late 1950s and 1960s by the united states and the soviet union for military use , provide ships and planes with a global navigation system .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 28.12.2005 germany both reformer and violator of eu budgetary pact großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany and other eu members will be forced to rein in spending next year germany is set to breach the eu 's stability and growth pact for the fourth time in a row despite succeeding in loosening the guidelines earlier this year . the eu stability and growth pact , which sets a ceiling of 3 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- on member countries ' budget deficits , was all but declared dead earlier this year . but , now it 's meant to be revived and flex some new muscle if joaquin almunia gets his way . the eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner plans to doggedly force eu members to rein in spending even though the budgetary pact was reformed and relaxed in march this year . almunia has said that starting january next year , ongoing disciplinary measures against certain eu budgetary pact violators , including germany , will be toughened . germany a serial offender the move spells further bad news for germany , which despite pressurizing the eu to ease budgetary guidelines , looks likely to fall victim to its own scheme . every year since 2002 , germany has violated the stability pact rules .
in 2004 , the budget deficit reached 3.9 percent , and the commission predicts the 2005 deficit to reach 3.3 percent of gdp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrück finds himself between a rock and a hard place new german finance minister peer steinbrück , who finds himself in the unenviable position of explaining how germany could initiate loosening the pact and then promptly violate it again , has indicated that he plans to tread carefully . " all i want to say is that i am aware that german interests are in sync with the eu commission and we do n't want to allow a repeat of november 2003 , " steinbrück said recently . a franco-german scheme at that time , former german finance minister hans eichel together with his french counterpart torpedoed a decision by eu finance ministers to tighten disciplinary measures against eu stability and growth pact offenders . the european parliament later ruled that the procedure was , in important aspects , not entirely legal .
but , since the stability pact was then reformed by march 2005 under the leadership of luxembourg 's jean-claude juncker , the commission held back with taking further disciplinary measures against germany and other members . one of the reasons was also hans eichel 's insistence that germany would respect the three percent deficit ceiling - something that is not likely to happen even in 2006 . reform brings more flexibility juncker , who is eurogroup chairman , said he was hopeful that germany would finally manage to honor its promises . " in the meetings i have had with -lrb- new german chancellor -rrb- angela merkel , i have noted a genuine willingness to respect the pact , " juncker said last month .
" germany will manage to fulfill all conditions of the stability pact by the end of 2007 .
i 'm confident that the new government will manage it . " the german government however need not fear direct financial sanctions from brussels to start with , even when disciplinary measures are officially taken a step further in 2006 . the reformed stability and growth pact has created overall flexibility , particularly for member countries whose budgets , despite reforms , can only be consolidated gradually whether it 's because of weak economic growth or special financial burdens that hamper an economic upswing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans eichel managed to chew down the stability pact in march this year " we have achieved what i have always demanded : the pact is now more economically rational , growth-friendly and allows - what is also economically needed and what the pact itself aims for - a stronger case by case assessment , " eichel said in march this year after a marathon night of negotiations in which the original stability pact was fundamentally loosened . present government benefits from relaxed pact as the present grand coalition looks for ways to cut its public spending and rein in its budget deficit below the crucial three percent of gdp , one ca n't help wondering at the irony of things : the conservative-dominated government is profiting from the greater leeway afforded by the reformed pact though the conservatives had always , during their time in opposition , slammed hans eichel for watering down the pact . christopher plass -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de meet the eu 's deficit sinners although repeatedly cited for failure to rein in deficit spending , germany and france are by no means the only violaters of eu deficit guidelines .

in 2004 , the budget deficit reached 3.9 percent , and the commission predicts the 2005 deficit to reach 3.3 percent of gdp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrück finds himself between a rock and a hard place new german finance minister peer steinbrück , who finds himself in the unenviable position of explaining how germany could initiate loosening the pact and then promptly violate it again , has indicated that he plans to tread carefully . " all i want to say is that i am aware that german interests are in sync with the eu commission and we do n't want to allow a repeat of november 2003 , " steinbrück said recently . a franco-german scheme at that time , former german finance minister hans eichel together with his french counterpart torpedoed a decision by eu finance ministers to tighten disciplinary measures against eu stability and growth pact offenders . the european parliament later ruled that the procedure was , in important aspects , not entirely legal .
but , since the stability pact was then reformed by march 2005 under the leadership of luxembourg 's jean-claude juncker , the commission held back with taking further disciplinary measures against germany and other members . one of the reasons was also hans eichel 's insistence that germany would respect the three percent deficit ceiling - something that is not likely to happen even in 2006 . reform brings more flexibility juncker , who is eurogroup chairman , said he was hopeful that germany would finally manage to honor its promises . " in the meetings i have had with -lrb- new german chancellor -rrb- angela merkel , i have noted a genuine willingness to respect the pact , " juncker said last month .
" germany will manage to fulfill all conditions of the stability pact by the end of 2007 .
i 'm confident that the new government will manage it . " the german government however need not fear direct financial sanctions from brussels to start with , even when disciplinary measures are officially taken a step further in 2006 . the reformed stability and growth pact has created overall flexibility , particularly for member countries whose budgets , despite reforms , can only be consolidated gradually whether it 's because of weak economic growth or special financial burdens that hamper an economic upswing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans eichel managed to chew down the stability pact in march this year " we have achieved what i have always demanded : the pact is now more economically rational , growth-friendly and allows - what is also economically needed and what the pact itself aims for - a stronger case by case assessment , " eichel said in march this year after a marathon night of negotiations in which the original stability pact was fundamentally loosened . present government benefits from relaxed pact as the present grand coalition looks for ways to cut its public spending and rein in its budget deficit below the crucial three percent of gdp , one ca n't help wondering at the irony of things : the conservative-dominated government is profiting from the greater leeway afforded by the reformed pact though the conservatives had always , during their time in opposition , slammed hans eichel for watering down the pact . christopher plass -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de meet the eu 's deficit sinners although repeatedly cited for failure to rein in deficit spending , germany and france are by no means the only violaters of eu deficit guidelines .

in 2004 , the budget deficit reached 3.9 percent , and the commission predicts the 2005 deficit to reach 3.3 percent of gdp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrück finds himself between a rock and a hard place new german finance minister peer steinbrück , who finds himself in the unenviable position of explaining how germany could initiate loosening the pact and then promptly violate it again , has indicated that he plans to tread carefully . " all i want to say is that i am aware that german interests are in sync with the eu commission and we do n't want to allow a repeat of november 2003 , " steinbrück said recently . a franco-german scheme at that time , former german finance minister hans eichel together with his french counterpart torpedoed a decision by eu finance ministers to tighten disciplinary measures against eu stability and growth pact offenders . the european parliament later ruled that the procedure was , in important aspects , not entirely legal .
but , since the stability pact was then reformed by march 2005 under the leadership of luxembourg 's jean-claude juncker , the commission held back with taking further disciplinary measures against germany and other members . one of the reasons was also hans eichel 's insistence that germany would respect the three percent deficit ceiling - something that is not likely to happen even in 2006 . reform brings more flexibility juncker , who is eurogroup chairman , said he was hopeful that germany would finally manage to honor its promises . " in the meetings i have had with -lrb- new german chancellor -rrb- angela merkel , i have noted a genuine willingness to respect the pact , " juncker said last month .
" germany will manage to fulfill all conditions of the stability pact by the end of 2007 .
i 'm confident that the new government will manage it . " the german government however need not fear direct financial sanctions from brussels to start with , even when disciplinary measures are officially taken a step further in 2006 . the reformed stability and growth pact has created overall flexibility , particularly for member countries whose budgets , despite reforms , can only be consolidated gradually whether it 's because of weak economic growth or special financial burdens that hamper an economic upswing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans eichel managed to chew down the stability pact in march this year " we have achieved what i have always demanded : the pact is now more economically rational , growth-friendly and allows - what is also economically needed and what the pact itself aims for - a stronger case by case assessment , " eichel said in march this year after a marathon night of negotiations in which the original stability pact was fundamentally loosened . present government benefits from relaxed pact as the present grand coalition looks for ways to cut its public spending and rein in its budget deficit below the crucial three percent of gdp , one ca n't help wondering at the irony of things : the conservative-dominated government is profiting from the greater leeway afforded by the reformed pact though the conservatives had always , during their time in opposition , slammed hans eichel for watering down the pact . christopher plass -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de meet the eu 's deficit sinners although repeatedly cited for failure to rein in deficit spending , germany and france are by no means the only violaters of eu deficit guidelines .

in 2004 , the budget deficit reached 3.9 percent , and the commission predicts the 2005 deficit to reach 3.3 percent of gdp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrück finds himself between a rock and a hard place new german finance minister peer steinbrück , who finds himself in the unenviable position of explaining how germany could initiate loosening the pact and then promptly violate it again , has indicated that he plans to tread carefully . " all i want to say is that i am aware that german interests are in sync with the eu commission and we do n't want to allow a repeat of november 2003 , " steinbrück said recently . a franco-german scheme at that time , former german finance minister hans eichel together with his french counterpart torpedoed a decision by eu finance ministers to tighten disciplinary measures against eu stability and growth pact offenders . the european parliament later ruled that the procedure was , in important aspects , not entirely legal .
but , since the stability pact was then reformed by march 2005 under the leadership of luxembourg 's jean-claude juncker , the commission held back with taking further disciplinary measures against germany and other members . one of the reasons was also hans eichel 's insistence that germany would respect the three percent deficit ceiling - something that is not likely to happen even in 2006 . reform brings more flexibility juncker , who is eurogroup chairman , said he was hopeful that germany would finally manage to honor its promises . " in the meetings i have had with -lrb- new german chancellor -rrb- angela merkel , i have noted a genuine willingness to respect the pact , " juncker said last month .
" germany will manage to fulfill all conditions of the stability pact by the end of 2007 .
i 'm confident that the new government will manage it . " the german government however need not fear direct financial sanctions from brussels to start with , even when disciplinary measures are officially taken a step further in 2006 . the reformed stability and growth pact has created overall flexibility , particularly for member countries whose budgets , despite reforms , can only be consolidated gradually whether it 's because of weak economic growth or special financial burdens that hamper an economic upswing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans eichel managed to chew down the stability pact in march this year " we have achieved what i have always demanded : the pact is now more economically rational , growth-friendly and allows - what is also economically needed and what the pact itself aims for - a stronger case by case assessment , " eichel said in march this year after a marathon night of negotiations in which the original stability pact was fundamentally loosened . present government benefits from relaxed pact as the present grand coalition looks for ways to cut its public spending and rein in its budget deficit below the crucial three percent of gdp , one ca n't help wondering at the irony of things : the conservative-dominated government is profiting from the greater leeway afforded by the reformed pact though the conservatives had always , during their time in opposition , slammed hans eichel for watering down the pact . christopher plass -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de meet the eu 's deficit sinners although repeatedly cited for failure to rein in deficit spending , germany and france are by no means the only violaters of eu deficit guidelines .

but it remains unclear whether the german army will take over security duties during the mammoth event . the german army 's duties are unambiguously laid down in the constitution .
within germany , the armed forces are only allowed to be deployed for defense or to counter a looming threat to the democracy of the federal republic or a state . further , the army may be deployed to protect civilian objects to support police measures .
such deployments however , require the support of both houses of parliament . " relieving a stretched police force " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble has already raised an outcry with plans to tighten anti-terror measures but new german interior minister wolfgang schäuble of the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- wants to go a step further by pressing the army into service to secure next year 's soccer world cup . " during the world cup , for example , our federal and state police forces will be very stretched , " schäuble told daily süddeutsche zeitung earlier this month , suggesting the army could be deployed during the finals , which take place in 12 german cities from june 9 to july 9 . " why should n't we transfer security services temporarily to the armed forces from the police to relieve them , " he suggested . germany 's constitution , written in 1949 with the lessons of nazi rule in mind , establishes strict separation between police and military .
under the nazis , the line between the two became blurred , leading to a ruthless militarized police state . schäuble said armed forces could be used to guard stadiums , airports and team quarters . " no one wants to see tanks in front of train stations or stadiums , this is completely absurd … yet you can imagine what would happen if somewhere a bomb in a back pack would explode . " " not the army 's brief " however , schäuble 's comments to call on the army in " exceptional circumstances " have met with resistance .
german defense minister franz josef jung said on tuesday he would be opposed to the army being deployed during the world cup finals in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the presence of german soliders on the streets is viewed uneasily in germany " we should not have a discussion now about whether the army takes on police duties .
that is not their brief , " jung told the rheinische post newspaper . the military would , however , be pressed into service during the finals in the event of a catastrophe , jung added , pointing to the work of soldiers in keeping transport links and electricity supplies functioning during heavy snowfalls in the heavily populated german state of north rhine-westphalia following christmas . debate to continue at the same time , both the parties in the ruling grand coalition - the cdu as well as the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- plan to further thrash out the issue of domestic deployments for the german army . the coalition treaty signed by the two parties mentions that in light of new terror threats , foreign security can no longer be clearly separated from domestic security .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 28.12.2005 galileo : europe 's biggest infrastructure project großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : galileo will be a truly global navigation system five hundred years ago people looked to the stars for navigation , relying on their position in the hemisphere to guide them across the continents and oceans .
today , the stars have been replaced by satellites . orbiting at a distance of some 23,000 kilometers above the earth ’ s surface , several dozen satellites , many sent up in the late 1950s and 1960s by the united states and the soviet union for military use , provide ships and planes with a global navigation system .
in the last 10 years , the number of satellites used for commercial purposes has increased rapidly , but the united states still dominates the field , and the pentagon controls access .
all that will change in the next few years with the launch of galileo , the european global satellite navigation system .
the giove-a satellite - the first in what will eventually become a constellation of 30 satellites encircling the globe - is scheduled for launch on wednesday morning .
a global service industry when galileo becomes fully operational , people anywhere in the world will be able to rely on the esa ’ s satellite technology for personal navigation .
in northern norway , for example , where there is no possibility of accessing global navigation systems because the current satellite network does not cover the region , a combination of galileo and special mobile phones will enable people to determine their exact position , down to the very meter , free of charge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : personal navigation systems may change the way we travel commercial channels , on the other hand , will charge a fee for their use .
a transport company , for instance , will be able to keep track of where each one of its trucks is located , while the truck drivers themselves rely on galileo to help them navigate through foreign cities .
europe 's biggest infrastructure project ever , galileo is lead by the european space agency and the firm galileo industries , a germany-based consortium that includes european space industry giants like eads , alcatel and alenia spazio .
by the time operations of the 30-satellite constellation begin , the eu will have invested approximately 3.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.5 billion -rrb- in this ambitious project .
galileo creates employment opportunities global navigation is rapidly becoming a lucrative market .
the european states participating in the galileo project are expecting big returns on their investment .
supporters of the project predict that it will lead to the creation of some 140,000 jobs in the high-tech sector and generate € 74 billion in earnings over the next 20 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : returning to nature , aided by satellite navigation germany , as galileo ’ s largest financial investor hopes to profit the most from the system , and was a strong advocate in lobbying for esa approval .
after its completion , europe 's galileo navigation system will guide trucks carrying goods across european highways , it will help land planes at europe 's crowded airports , it will assist ships docking in its busy ports , and it will aid the blind in finding their way through city streets .
but to many europeans , the most important thing about galileo is that it will wean the eu of its technological dependence on the american global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- .
cutting a deal with washington europeans have long complained that gps is unreliable for critical use because , as a military system , it can and has been scrambled during times of crisis .
the system , which is under the control of the u.s. department of defense , can be downgraded or even switched off if the government believes it is being manipulated by an enemy state or a terrorist group .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european satellite navigation system was named after italian astronomer galileo galilei this happened , for instance , during the war in kosovo when the u.s. restricted european use of the gps .
that lack of reliability has made gps unfeasible for applications where a slight inaccuracy could result in deaths , like air traffic control .
for a number of years , galileo served as a serious thorn in the side of transatlantic relations .
officials in washington feared the spectrum used by galileo could interfere with the gps signal used by the military , making it difficult for the americans to scramble the signal in times of crisis .
others in the us argued that satellite navigation systems should be available for free , like gps , and there was no need for a commercial version .
but washington and brussels reached a deal in june 2004 that will make the two systems compatible and interoperable while at the same time maintaining autonomy over each system , effectively eliminating any remaining conflict over the project dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe keen to join russia in new spaceship project the russian plan to build a new spacecraft for manned missions has captured the attention of the european space agency .

the european giove-a test satellite was sent into orbit piggybacking on a russian soyuz rocket . the 600-kilo -lrb- 1,320 pound -rrb- british-built giove-a is scheduled to orbit at 23,000 kilometers -lrb- 14,500 miles -rrb- above the earth . a strategic step for europe " this is an essential step in the galileo project : going from theory to practice , " said dominique detain , a spokesman for esa on the galileo project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : galileo will be the first civilian-controlled satellite navigation system the giove-a satellite will test various technologies including an atomic clock that esa says is the most exact ever sent into space .

today , the stars have been replaced by satellites . orbiting at a distance of some 23,000 kilometers above the earth ’ s surface , several dozen satellites , many sent up in the late 1950s and 1960s by the united states and the soviet union for military use , provide ships and planes with a global navigation system .
in the last 10 years , the number of satellites used for commercial purposes has increased rapidly , but the united states still dominates the field , and the pentagon controls access .
all that will change in the next few years with the launch of galileo , the european global satellite navigation system .
the giove-a satellite - the first in what will eventually become a constellation of 30 satellites encircling the globe - is scheduled for launch on wednesday morning .
a global service industry when galileo becomes fully operational , people anywhere in the world will be able to rely on the esa ’ s satellite technology for personal navigation .
in northern norway , for example , where there is no possibility of accessing global navigation systems because the current satellite network does not cover the region , a combination of galileo and special mobile phones will enable people to determine their exact position , down to the very meter , free of charge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : personal navigation systems may change the way we travel commercial channels , on the other hand , will charge a fee for their use .
a transport company , for instance , will be able to keep track of where each one of its trucks is located , while the truck drivers themselves rely on galileo to help them navigate through foreign cities .
europe 's biggest infrastructure project ever , galileo is lead by the european space agency and the firm galileo industries , a germany-based consortium that includes european space industry giants like eads , alcatel and alenia spazio .
by the time operations of the 30-satellite constellation begin , the eu will have invested approximately 3.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.5 billion -rrb- in this ambitious project .
galileo creates employment opportunities global navigation is rapidly becoming a lucrative market .
the european states participating in the galileo project are expecting big returns on their investment .
supporters of the project predict that it will lead to the creation of some 140,000 jobs in the high-tech sector and generate € 74 billion in earnings over the next 20 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : returning to nature , aided by satellite navigation germany , as galileo ’ s largest financial investor hopes to profit the most from the system , and was a strong advocate in lobbying for esa approval .
after its completion , europe 's galileo navigation system will guide trucks carrying goods across european highways , it will help land planes at europe 's crowded airports , it will assist ships docking in its busy ports , and it will aid the blind in finding their way through city streets .
but to many europeans , the most important thing about galileo is that it will wean the eu of its technological dependence on the american global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- .
cutting a deal with washington europeans have long complained that gps is unreliable for critical use because , as a military system , it can and has been scrambled during times of crisis .
the system , which is under the control of the u.s. department of defense , can be downgraded or even switched off if the government believes it is being manipulated by an enemy state or a terrorist group .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european satellite navigation system was named after italian astronomer galileo galilei this happened , for instance , during the war in kosovo when the u.s. restricted european use of the gps .
that lack of reliability has made gps unfeasible for applications where a slight inaccuracy could result in deaths , like air traffic control .
for a number of years , galileo served as a serious thorn in the side of transatlantic relations .
officials in washington feared the spectrum used by galileo could interfere with the gps signal used by the military , making it difficult for the americans to scramble the signal in times of crisis .
others in the us argued that satellite navigation systems should be available for free , like gps , and there was no need for a commercial version .
but washington and brussels reached a deal in june 2004 that will make the two systems compatible and interoperable while at the same time maintaining autonomy over each system , effectively eliminating any remaining conflict over the project dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe keen to join russia in new spaceship project the russian plan to build a new spacecraft for manned missions has captured the attention of the european space agency .

the european giove-a test satellite was sent into orbit piggybacking on a russian soyuz rocket . the 600-kilo -lrb- 1,320 pound -rrb- british-built giove-a is scheduled to orbit at 23,000 kilometers -lrb- 14,500 miles -rrb- above the earth . a strategic step for europe " this is an essential step in the galileo project : going from theory to practice , " said dominique detain , a spokesman for esa on the galileo project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : galileo will be the first civilian-controlled satellite navigation system the giove-a satellite will test various technologies including an atomic clock that esa says is the most exact ever sent into space .
giove is an acronym standing for galileo in orbit validation element , but also the italian name for the planet jupiter whose moons were discovered by the famous renaissance astronomer galileo galilei . with the galileo project europe hopes to gain its independence in the strategic domain of navigating by satellite , which has become indispensable for managing traffic in the air , at sea , and even on motorways . the united states and the eu last year reached an accord on adopting common operating standards for the two systems , overcoming american concerns that the galileo system will compromise the security of gps , on which the us military is heavily dependent . an extraordinary level of precision according to esa , galileo , which will be under civilian control , is designed to deliver real-time positioning accuracy down to the meter range , which is unprecedented for a publicly available system . it will guarantee service under all but the most extreme circumstances and will inform users within seconds of a failure of any satellite , which will make it especially valuable where safety is crucial , such as running trains , guiding cars and landing aircraft . once in orbit , giove-a will be under the control of the surrey satellite systems operations center in the british city of guildford . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : galileo will consist of 30 satellites orbiting around the earth the project 's next phase will be the launch of a second giove-b test satellite in 2006 , followed with four working satellites by 2008 .
the ultimate goal remains a constellation of 30 satellites encircling the globe . the date for opening the network to commercial use has been pushed back two years to 2010 . to help cover the cost of the huge investment , the eu has sought other contributors to the project .
to date , agreements have been signed with china and israel , and negotiations are under way with about a dozen other nations including ukraine , india and morocco . between cooperation and competition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : urging russia to compete with both europe and the us : russian president vladimir putin galileo will also be compatible with glonass , the russian network of 24 geostationary satellites , which is not scheduled to be in operation before 2008 . according to the ria-novosti news agency , russian president vladimir putin urged his government on monday to speed up development of russia 's planned satellite navigation system . " we have to see what we can do in 2006 and 2007 to develop the commercial utilization of this system , " putin said . like the american network , glonass will be controlled by military operators that can not guarantee the maintenance of an uninterrupted service . russia has already launched 17 of the planned system satellites , including three placed into orbit on sunday , but putin warned that some of these may be out of date by the time the navigation system is inaugurated unless the development is hurried along . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe keen to join russia in new spaceship project the russian plan to build a new spacecraft for manned missions has captured the attention of the european space agency .

today , the stars have been replaced by satellites . orbiting at a distance of some 23,000 kilometers above the earth ’ s surface , several dozen satellites , many sent up in the late 1950s and 1960s by the united states and the soviet union for military use , provide ships and planes with a global navigation system .
in the last 10 years , the number of satellites used for commercial purposes has increased rapidly , but the united states still dominates the field , and the pentagon controls access .
all that will change in the next few years with the launch of galileo , the european global satellite navigation system .
the giove-a satellite - the first in what will eventually become a constellation of 30 satellites encircling the globe - is scheduled for launch on wednesday morning .
a global service industry when galileo becomes fully operational , people anywhere in the world will be able to rely on the esa ’ s satellite technology for personal navigation .
in northern norway , for example , where there is no possibility of accessing global navigation systems because the current satellite network does not cover the region , a combination of galileo and special mobile phones will enable people to determine their exact position , down to the very meter , free of charge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : personal navigation systems may change the way we travel commercial channels , on the other hand , will charge a fee for their use .
a transport company , for instance , will be able to keep track of where each one of its trucks is located , while the truck drivers themselves rely on galileo to help them navigate through foreign cities .
europe 's biggest infrastructure project ever , galileo is lead by the european space agency and the firm galileo industries , a germany-based consortium that includes european space industry giants like eads , alcatel and alenia spazio .
by the time operations of the 30-satellite constellation begin , the eu will have invested approximately 3.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.5 billion -rrb- in this ambitious project .
galileo creates employment opportunities global navigation is rapidly becoming a lucrative market .
the european states participating in the galileo project are expecting big returns on their investment .
supporters of the project predict that it will lead to the creation of some 140,000 jobs in the high-tech sector and generate € 74 billion in earnings over the next 20 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : returning to nature , aided by satellite navigation germany , as galileo ’ s largest financial investor hopes to profit the most from the system , and was a strong advocate in lobbying for esa approval .
after its completion , europe 's galileo navigation system will guide trucks carrying goods across european highways , it will help land planes at europe 's crowded airports , it will assist ships docking in its busy ports , and it will aid the blind in finding their way through city streets .
but to many europeans , the most important thing about galileo is that it will wean the eu of its technological dependence on the american global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- .
cutting a deal with washington europeans have long complained that gps is unreliable for critical use because , as a military system , it can and has been scrambled during times of crisis .
the system , which is under the control of the u.s. department of defense , can be downgraded or even switched off if the government believes it is being manipulated by an enemy state or a terrorist group .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european satellite navigation system was named after italian astronomer galileo galilei this happened , for instance , during the war in kosovo when the u.s. restricted european use of the gps .
that lack of reliability has made gps unfeasible for applications where a slight inaccuracy could result in deaths , like air traffic control .
for a number of years , galileo served as a serious thorn in the side of transatlantic relations .
officials in washington feared the spectrum used by galileo could interfere with the gps signal used by the military , making it difficult for the americans to scramble the signal in times of crisis .
others in the us argued that satellite navigation systems should be available for free , like gps , and there was no need for a commercial version .
but washington and brussels reached a deal in june 2004 that will make the two systems compatible and interoperable while at the same time maintaining autonomy over each system , effectively eliminating any remaining conflict over the project dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe keen to join russia in new spaceship project the russian plan to build a new spacecraft for manned missions has captured the attention of the european space agency .

a look at one of the geniuses of the german-speaking world . on jan .
27 , 1756 , musical wunderkind wolfgang amadeus mozart was born in salzburg , austria .
despite early success , the composer died in poverty in vienna on dec .
5 , 1791 .
only after his death was mozart celebrated as one of the greatest musical geniuses of all times . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world-famous mozart kugeln interest in the composer never seems to wane .
publishers continue to put out murder mysteries , audio books , novels , biographies , and new academic findings from the world of mozart research .
and if anyone had thought to secure the royalties for mozart-related products during the composer 's lifetime , he would be rich today .
probably the best known are mozart kugeln - the marzipan flavored chocolate balls wrapped in cellophane bearing his likeness . festivities in augsburg some facts of mozart 's life are well known .
for instance , he began showing extraordinary music talent at an exceptionally young age .
he wrote his first composition at age five ; at seven he is said to have taught himself how to play the violin and the organ .
by age eight he had composed piano sonatas , and at 12 he wrote his first opera .
his father leopold , himself a violin teacher , recognized his son 's talent and toured europe with wolfgang and his sister anna maria .
by 1766 , the siblings had been to paris , london and the hague , where they played before royalty and in public academies .
at first , though , mozart performed in munich and vienna , then in augsburg and frankfurt . augsburg was leopold mozart 's home town , and that is where germany 's " mozart year 2006 " will take place , under the patronage of german president horst köhler . the year gets under full swing during may , with two straight weeks of historically accurate performances of works by both father and son .
vienna will be hosting a similar festival . return to salzburg mozart is considered one of the first composers who was not dependent on the court ; he earned enough money in his child-star years to be financially independent .
as a teenager , he was temporarily named unpaid concert master of the salzburg court orchestra , but he asked to be let go in august .
he tried unsuccessfully to get jobs in munich , mannheim and paris before returning to be court organist in salzburg after his mother 's death in 1788 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ubiquitous in salzburg : the composer 's statue in mozart square today , salzburg is the epicenter of mozart studies .
in 2006 the town will host innumerable artistic projects , workshops and exhibits that aim to shed some light on the composer 's life , work and personality .
the head of the salzburg festival , peter ruzicka , has put all 22 mozart operas on the festival lineup . in 1782 , mozart married konstanze weber , and the two lived together in vienna .
he supported his family by giving piano lessons and found patronage from emperor joseph ii , for whom he wrote operas , including the marriage of figaro . not pleasing to the public but the public found his music too complex and critical of social mores , and mozart 's financial situation worsened steadily . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this oil portrait of mozart is said to be truest to his likeness although he was named royal chamber composer in 1787 , the pay was low .
he had a final success with his opera the magic flute in 1791 , but died at age 35 , impoverished , while working on his requiem . the exact cause of mozart 's death is debated , and speculations range from poisoning to syphillis .
he was given a pauper 's burial at the st. marx cemetary in vienna , which is being restored for the occasion . despite his short life , mozart composed more than 600 works ; a multifaceted repertoire of symphonies , concerts , sonatas , operas , and secular and religious vocal music .
even if recent research shows the genius was not above borrowing from his contemporaries -lrb- such as joseph haydn -rrb- , his oeuvre is still an important part of the western canon . the performances honoring mozart will go on throughout the year , but on jan .
27 , 2006 , mozart afficionados who want to be at the center of the action should travel to vienna .
there will be premieres , concerts and television shows broadast around the world , in honor of nearly a quarter-millennium of the maestro 's music . gaby reucher -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bringing bach to the mtv generation last year , 25-year-old martin stadtfeld shot to fame on a daring recording of bach 's goldberg variations .

today , the stars have been replaced by satellites . orbiting at a distance of some 23,000 kilometers above the earth ’ s surface , several dozen satellites , many sent up in the late 1950s and 1960s by the united states and the soviet union for military use , provide ships and planes with a global navigation system .
in the last 10 years , the number of satellites used for commercial purposes has increased rapidly , but the united states still dominates the field , and the pentagon controls access .
all that will change in the next few years with the launch of galileo , the european global satellite navigation system .
the giove-a satellite - the first in what will eventually become a constellation of 30 satellites encircling the globe - is scheduled for launch on wednesday morning .
a global service industry when galileo becomes fully operational , people anywhere in the world will be able to rely on the esa ’ s satellite technology for personal navigation .
in northern norway , for example , where there is no possibility of accessing global navigation systems because the current satellite network does not cover the region , a combination of galileo and special mobile phones will enable people to determine their exact position , down to the very meter , free of charge .

europe 's biggest infrastructure project ever , galileo is lead by the european space agency and the firm galileo industries , a germany-based consortium that includes european space industry giants like eads , alcatel and alenia spazio .
by the time operations of the 30-satellite constellation begin , the eu will have invested approximately 3.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.5 billion -rrb- in this ambitious project .
galileo creates employment opportunities global navigation is rapidly becoming a lucrative market .
the european states participating in the galileo project are expecting big returns on their investment .

but it remains unclear whether the german army will take over security duties during the mammoth event . the german army 's duties are unambiguously laid down in the constitution .
within germany , the armed forces are only allowed to be deployed for defense or to counter a looming threat to the democracy of the federal republic or a state . further , the army may be deployed to protect civilian objects to support police measures .
such deployments however , require the support of both houses of parliament . " relieving a stretched police force " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble has already raised an outcry with plans to tighten anti-terror measures but new german interior minister wolfgang schäuble of the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- wants to go a step further by pressing the army into service to secure next year 's soccer world cup . " during the world cup , for example , our federal and state police forces will be very stretched , " schäuble told daily süddeutsche zeitung earlier this month , suggesting the army could be deployed during the finals , which take place in 12 german cities from june 9 to july 9 . " why should n't we transfer security services temporarily to the armed forces from the police to relieve them , " he suggested . germany 's constitution , written in 1949 with the lessons of nazi rule in mind , establishes strict separation between police and military .
under the nazis , the line between the two became blurred , leading to a ruthless militarized police state . schäuble said armed forces could be used to guard stadiums , airports and team quarters . " no one wants to see tanks in front of train stations or stadiums , this is completely absurd … yet you can imagine what would happen if somewhere a bomb in a back pack would explode . " " not the army 's brief " however , schäuble 's comments to call on the army in " exceptional circumstances " have met with resistance .
german defense minister franz josef jung said on tuesday he would be opposed to the army being deployed during the world cup finals in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the presence of german soliders on the streets is viewed uneasily in germany " we should not have a discussion now about whether the army takes on police duties .
that is not their brief , " jung told the rheinische post newspaper . the military would , however , be pressed into service during the finals in the event of a catastrophe , jung added , pointing to the work of soldiers in keeping transport links and electricity supplies functioning during heavy snowfalls in the heavily populated german state of north rhine-westphalia following christmas . debate to continue at the same time , both the parties in the ruling grand coalition - the cdu as well as the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- plan to further thrash out the issue of domestic deployments for the german army . the coalition treaty signed by the two parties mentions that in light of new terror threats , foreign security can no longer be clearly separated from domestic security .

schröder prepares for a life in stand-up former german chancellor schröder certainly knows how to stay in the headlines .
his wildly lucrative business deals are not giving his critics a chance to even begin lowering their eyebrows . when asked what his plans were after leaving the white house , former president bill clinton responded - frankly and without any qualms - that he was interested in making money .
the enticing connection between politics and profit seems to have captured the imagination of former german chancellor gerhard schröder as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they have the same agent : gerhard schröder and former us president bill clinton schröder 's office announced on tuesday that the media-savvy former chancellor had landed another lucrative business contract , this time with new york-based public speaking booking agency . the harry walker agency , which already boasts a stable of prominent ex-politicians including former us presidents bill clinton and jimmy carter , reportedly commands up to $ 250,000 -lrb- 210,000 euros -rrb- per speech .
schröder 's office declined to comment on his rate for speaking engagements . the press is having a blast the mass-market german daily bild reprinted a promotional letter by the harry walker agency in which it announced its " exclusive representation of gerhard schröder , german chancellor 1998-2005 . " " the twice elected leader of germany , chancellor gerhard schröder , has been a major force on the world 's political stage for the past eight years , " the letter printed in bild and signed by a company executive said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder closed the russian-german pipeline deal while still in office " chancellor schröder is a leading world statesman and internationally recognized authority on global relations , economic development and social change .
i look forward to speaking with you about scheduling this charismatic and influential world leader for an upcoming event . " schröder 's swift career moves and his ability to turn his political experience into profitable business deals has been picked up in other european countries as well : " -lrb- schröder -rrb- made a name for himself with his opposition to the iraq war .
that increases the price of his fame , if not his weight as a statesman , " the italian daily corriere della sera commented on wednesday . same old story schröder already came under fire in german and european political circles this month for taking a job with a subsidiary of russian energy giant gazprom , which is building an ambitious gas pipeline from russia to germany , just after he left office in november . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what a ride it 's been !
russian president putin ended up as schröder 's best buddy the four-billion euro pipeline agreement was signed just 10 days before the german general elections in september , at a ceremony attended by schröder and russian president vladimir putin . the 61-year-old schröder , who is also setting up shop in berlin as a lawyer , has already accepted a position as a part-time adviser on international political affairs for the swiss publishing group ringier . to prepare for his new career in international business , schröder recently spent 12 days brushing up on his english skills in the welsh countryside . introduction of honor code unlikely members of the opposition green party in the german parliament - who used to be schröder 's coalition partners during both of his terms in office - are now toying with the idea of introducing a binding honor code for former politicians in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : constitutional court president hans-jürgen papier president of the german constitutional court hans-jürgen papier , however , seemed skeptical about the proposal . " i am not sure if such a code of honor could ever cover all the possible cases , " papier said . " in the end , leaders in high offices should be able to judge for themselves what is appropriate , morally acceptable and fair , " he said . parliamentary group leaders are expected to address the issue at a meeting on jan .

in 2004 , the budget deficit reached 3.9 percent , and the commission predicts the 2005 deficit to reach 3.3 percent of gdp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrück finds himself between a rock and a hard place new german finance minister peer steinbrück , who finds himself in the unenviable position of explaining how germany could initiate loosening the pact and then promptly violate it again , has indicated that he plans to tread carefully . " all i want to say is that i am aware that german interests are in sync with the eu commission and we do n't want to allow a repeat of november 2003 , " steinbrück said recently . a franco-german scheme at that time , former german finance minister hans eichel together with his french counterpart torpedoed a decision by eu finance ministers to tighten disciplinary measures against eu stability and growth pact offenders . the european parliament later ruled that the procedure was , in important aspects , not entirely legal .
but , since the stability pact was then reformed by march 2005 under the leadership of luxembourg 's jean-claude juncker , the commission held back with taking further disciplinary measures against germany and other members . one of the reasons was also hans eichel 's insistence that germany would respect the three percent deficit ceiling - something that is not likely to happen even in 2006 . reform brings more flexibility juncker , who is eurogroup chairman , said he was hopeful that germany would finally manage to honor its promises . " in the meetings i have had with -lrb- new german chancellor -rrb- angela merkel , i have noted a genuine willingness to respect the pact , " juncker said last month .
" germany will manage to fulfill all conditions of the stability pact by the end of 2007 .
i 'm confident that the new government will manage it .

but it remains unclear whether the german army will take over security duties during the mammoth event . the german army 's duties are unambiguously laid down in the constitution .
within germany , the armed forces are only allowed to be deployed for defense or to counter a looming threat to the democracy of the federal republic or a state . further , the army may be deployed to protect civilian objects to support police measures .
such deployments however , require the support of both houses of parliament .

" during the world cup , for example , our federal and state police forces will be very stretched , " schäuble told daily süddeutsche zeitung earlier this month , suggesting the army could be deployed during the finals , which take place in 12 german cities from june 9 to july 9 . " why should n't we transfer security services temporarily to the armed forces from the police to relieve them , " he suggested . germany 's constitution , written in 1949 with the lessons of nazi rule in mind , establishes strict separation between police and military .
under the nazis , the line between the two became blurred , leading to a ruthless militarized police state . schäuble said armed forces could be used to guard stadiums , airports and team quarters . " no one wants to see tanks in front of train stations or stadiums , this is completely absurd … yet you can imagine what would happen if somewhere a bomb in a back pack would explode . " " not the army 's brief " however , schäuble 's comments to call on the army in " exceptional circumstances " have met with resistance .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 28.12.2005 european space agency launches competition for us großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : galileo is the european answer to the american gps satellite network europe congratulated itself wednesday with the launch of the first test satellite of the galileo navigation system , designed to rival the us system and put global positioning into civilian hands . a joint initiative of the european union and the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- , the galileo satellite network will both compete with and complement the current us global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- , which was originally developed for military targeting and positioning and is still overseen by the pentagon . the european system was the first to be designed for strictly civilian use and will cost an estimated 3.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.5 billion -rrb- . after more than two years of delays , the galileo project blasted off wednesday morning in baikonur , kazakhstan .
the european giove-a test satellite was sent into orbit piggybacking on a russian soyuz rocket . the 600-kilo -lrb- 1,320 pound -rrb- british-built giove-a is scheduled to orbit at 23,000 kilometers -lrb- 14,500 miles -rrb- above the earth . a strategic step for europe " this is an essential step in the galileo project : going from theory to practice , " said dominique detain , a spokesman for esa on the galileo project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : galileo will be the first civilian-controlled satellite navigation system the giove-a satellite will test various technologies including an atomic clock that esa says is the most exact ever sent into space .
giove is an acronym standing for galileo in orbit validation element , but also the italian name for the planet jupiter whose moons were discovered by the famous renaissance astronomer galileo galilei . with the galileo project europe hopes to gain its independence in the strategic domain of navigating by satellite , which has become indispensable for managing traffic in the air , at sea , and even on motorways . the united states and the eu last year reached an accord on adopting common operating standards for the two systems , overcoming american concerns that the galileo system will compromise the security of gps , on which the us military is heavily dependent . an extraordinary level of precision according to esa , galileo , which will be under civilian control , is designed to deliver real-time positioning accuracy down to the meter range , which is unprecedented for a publicly available system . it will guarantee service under all but the most extreme circumstances and will inform users within seconds of a failure of any satellite , which will make it especially valuable where safety is crucial , such as running trains , guiding cars and landing aircraft . once in orbit , giove-a will be under the control of the surrey satellite systems operations center in the british city of guildford . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : galileo will consist of 30 satellites orbiting around the earth the project 's next phase will be the launch of a second giove-b test satellite in 2006 , followed with four working satellites by 2008 .
the ultimate goal remains a constellation of 30 satellites encircling the globe . the date for opening the network to commercial use has been pushed back two years to 2010 . to help cover the cost of the huge investment , the eu has sought other contributors to the project .
to date , agreements have been signed with china and israel , and negotiations are under way with about a dozen other nations including ukraine , india and morocco . between cooperation and competition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : urging russia to compete with both europe and the us : russian president vladimir putin galileo will also be compatible with glonass , the russian network of 24 geostationary satellites , which is not scheduled to be in operation before 2008 . according to the ria-novosti news agency , russian president vladimir putin urged his government on monday to speed up development of russia 's planned satellite navigation system . " we have to see what we can do in 2006 and 2007 to develop the commercial utilization of this system , " putin said . like the american network , glonass will be controlled by military operators that can not guarantee the maintenance of an uninterrupted service . russia has already launched 17 of the planned system satellites , including three placed into orbit on sunday , but putin warned that some of these may be out of date by the time the navigation system is inaugurated unless the development is hurried along . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : europe keen to join russia in new spaceship project the russian plan to build a new spacecraft for manned missions has captured the attention of the european space agency .

the chip-manufacturing plan would enable them to compete with industry giants such as intel and samsung .
the group is to invest 100bn yen -lrb- $ 851.6m ; £ 492m -rrb- to create a production line in japan , and reports say they will invite other chipmakers to join .
the aim is to produce small fast chips that use less power and will enable the further shrinking of electronics items .
in january the three chipmakers will set up the venture to assess the feasibility of the project .
it is understood the provisional plan would see a production line built at a toshiba or renesas factory with manufacturing starting in early 2007 , the nihon keizai business newspaper said .
global market according to reports in japan , the new venture hopes to make system lsi -lrb- large-scale integration -rrb- chips with a circuitry width of 65-nanometres or less .
most advanced semiconductor plants use circuitry of 90 nanometres .
a nanometre is one-billionth of a metre .
intel recently announced plans for a $ 3.5bn 45-nanometre semiconductor factory in israel .
it is the biggest global chipmaker , controlling about 15 % of a market worth more than $ 200bn a year .
japanese firms have been forming alliances for development of system chips to save costs .
hitachi revealed three months ago it was in talks with other japanese chipmakers on possible steps to cut costs and boost competitiveness , including the joint chipmaking plant .
