program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : passing of a pope pope 's funeral set for friday the question of succession a pope of unity but also division a life at odds with the germans europe -pipe- 06.04.2005 the long way to a new pope großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : white smoke is the signal catholics will be waiting for " habemus papam " - " we have a pope . "
catholics could hear these words as early as april 18 , as the cardinals will begin the highly regulated process of electing a new pontiff on that day . the so-called conclave will choose john paul ii 's successor .
it is made up of cardinals that have not yet turned 80 - there are currently 117 of them . while the cardinals already have a chance to discuss candidates since many of them arrived in rome ahead of the late pope 's funeral , the actual election can not begin any earlier than 15 days after john paul ii 's death nor later than 20 days after his passing .
vatican officials announced wednesday that cardinals have chosen april 18 as the day to begin deliberations . the late pope 's will will be published on thursday . simple requirements theoretically , there 's a huge number of people who qualify for the job of pontiff . " every catholic man , who fulfills the requirements to become a bishop or priest , can become pope , " said alfred hierold , a professor for church law at bamberg university . while the " servant of the servants of god " could therefore be a layman , he would quickly have to be made bishop as the pope is also always the bishop of rome .
that problem has n't arisen for centuries , however : since 1378 , every pope has been a cardinal before his election . gathering in rome , cardinals will stay at " domus sanctae marthae , " a spartan guest house behind st. peter 's cathedral in vatican city . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reporters stand in one of the cells in which the cardinals slept during the last 1978 conclave " the rooms have a metal bed , a large desk , a chair , a small bathroom and stone floors , " said hierold , who has stayed there himself . complete reclusion on the first day of the conclave , cardinals celebrate a special mass called " pro eligendo papa , " or " for the election of the pope . "
traditionally , they then retreat to the vatican 's sistine chapel to begin their deliberations .
however , this time the cardinals will not be confined to the chapel .
they 'll be permitted to roam about within the walls of the vatican , though they will still be banned from contact with the outside world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vatican 's sistine chapel with the " last judgement " fresco on the wall at the end " if a cardinal brings along his mobile phone , there 's nothing that can be done , " hierold said , adding that the ballot box is placed underneath michelangelo 's famous " last judgement " fresco .
" but it 's not allowed . " the chapel is even checked for listening devices and cardinals as well any support staff have to swear that they will remain silent about anything that takes place within and that they will not be influenced by others in their decision . bribes and intrigues there 's good reason for that as bribing and intrigues were not uncommon at previous papal elections .
until 1903 , european monarchs also played a role in electing the leader of the catholic church . the cardinals keep meeting until they have agreed on a new pope .
the longest conclave lasted three years .
in order to be elected pope , a candidate has to receive two thirds of the votes .
should he not receive them right away , four rounds of votes are cast each day , separated by prayers .
the first break will take place if a new pontiff has not been elected after three days . should cardinals fail to agree after 34 voting rounds , they can decide to elect a pope by majority . dark smoke , white smoke smoke is used to announce the result of each vote as the ballots are burned each time .
if the vote has been unsuccessful , wet straw is added to the fire , causing dark smoke to rise above the chapel .
once a pope has been chosen , dry straw is added and white smoke signals the beginning of a new pontificate .
i in addition to white smoke , the faithful will this time also hear the ringing of the bells of st peter 's cathedral to announce a decision . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinals congregated for the first day in the bologna hall at the vatican on monday inside , cardinals acknowledge their new supreme leader as well .
everyone except the new pontiff folds up the little canopy above his seat .
the new pope is then asked what name he chooses and officially becomes pope once a document has been drawn up that certifies his election . john paul ii 's successor will then put on the white papal clothes and accept a pledge of allegiance by the other cardinals .
only then will the dean of the college of cardinals , germany 's joseph ratzinger , step on the balcony of st. peter 's cathedral . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joseph ratzinger " annuntio vobis gaudium magnum , habemus papam , " he 'll tell the cheering crowd .
" i announce to you with great happiness : we have a pope . " this time , the latter might get a bit complicated , as ratzinger himself has good chances of becoming the next pope . rafael heiling -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the question of succession with the death of pope john paul ii , a chain of events laid down by centuries of papal tradition swung into action , but who will emerge as the next pontiff is a guess no one dares to hazard .

after the death of pope john paul ii , a strict procedure of events is set into motion leading to the burial and election of a successor .
dw-world looks at the key steps for the next several days .

one year before the big event in germany , analysts are already wondering just what the tournament can do for the economy . the way german soccer legend and world cup chief franz beckenbauer sees it , next year 's tournament has already resulted in one winner : german companies . " our economics minister estimated the economic advantages -lrb- brought by the tournament -rrb- at 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 12.8 billion -rrb- - and that 's only the economic part , " said beckenbauer -lrb- photo -rrb- .
" every participant will profit from a boost in image . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz beckenbauer , head of the world cup organizing committee postbank chief economist marco bargel is a bit more exact .
according to his figures , more than 6 billion euros have already been invested in upgrading and expanding infrastructure , the stadiums , and hotels and restaurants .
the demand for goods and services ahead of and during the world cup will bring in " two to three billion euros , " he said . reaping benefits years after in all , say experts , hosting the world cup will mean a growth of 0.5 percent in germany 's gross domestic product - welcome news at a time when the economy is sputtering .
the country has seen this before .
the 1972 olympics speeded up development in host city munich and the rest of germany " between 12 and 15 years , " said holger preuss , a sports economist at the university of mainz . the transit system , road projects and other infrastructure developed for the olympics also set munich on the road of transformation from a sleepy alpine city to a modern metropolis . demand for sporting goods - and security " they were able to take the investment needed for hosting an olympics and produce an increase in development , " preuss said . the german economy will benefit the most from the world cup in the early months of 2006 , before the tournament actually starts .
but the postbank analysis also projects some gains for the overall economic growth during the tournament as well .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soccer fans will be bringing plenty of spending cash with them electronics and sporting goods stores and companies will benefit from soccer fans ' spending sprees .
and if the athens olympics last august was any example , security services companies , as well , can expect a jump in business . tourists could bring in one billion euros though there is still a year to go before the referee whistles the start of the first match , germany 's tourism sector is already getting warmed up .
not only the 12 cities that will host matches - from hamburg to hanover to munich - but other german regions are also readying themselves for a storm of tourists .
organizers expect more than one million visitors - and lucrative times ahead . each visitor spends between 800 and 1,000 euros for a five-day visit according to rough estimates , said bargel .
" that means foreign visitors will bring in up to a billion euros , " he said . klaus feldkeller -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's rails , roads world cup ready when millions of soccer fans descend on germany in 2006 , the country 's railways and roads will be ready for them , government officials said this week .

"
catholics could hear these words as early as april 18 , as the cardinals will begin the highly regulated process of electing a new pontiff on that day . the so-called conclave will choose john paul ii 's successor .
it is made up of cardinals that have not yet turned 80 - there are currently 117 of them . while the cardinals already have a chance to discuss candidates since many of them arrived in rome ahead of the late pope 's funeral , the actual election can not begin any earlier than 15 days after john paul ii 's death nor later than 20 days after his passing .
vatican officials announced wednesday that cardinals have chosen april 18 as the day to begin deliberations . the late pope 's will will be published on thursday . simple requirements theoretically , there 's a huge number of people who qualify for the job of pontiff . " every catholic man , who fulfills the requirements to become a bishop or priest , can become pope , " said alfred hierold , a professor for church law at bamberg university . while the " servant of the servants of god " could therefore be a layman , he would quickly have to be made bishop as the pope is also always the bishop of rome .
that problem has n't arisen for centuries , however : since 1378 , every pope has been a cardinal before his election . gathering in rome , cardinals will stay at " domus sanctae marthae , " a spartan guest house behind st. peter 's cathedral in vatican city . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reporters stand in one of the cells in which the cardinals slept during the last 1978 conclave " the rooms have a metal bed , a large desk , a chair , a small bathroom and stone floors , " said hierold , who has stayed there himself . complete reclusion on the first day of the conclave , cardinals celebrate a special mass called " pro eligendo papa , " or " for the election of the pope . "
traditionally , they then retreat to the vatican 's sistine chapel to begin their deliberations .
however , this time the cardinals will not be confined to the chapel .
they 'll be permitted to roam about within the walls of the vatican , though they will still be banned from contact with the outside world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vatican 's sistine chapel with the " last judgement " fresco on the wall at the end " if a cardinal brings along his mobile phone , there 's nothing that can be done , " hierold said , adding that the ballot box is placed underneath michelangelo 's famous " last judgement " fresco .
" but it 's not allowed . " the chapel is even checked for listening devices and cardinals as well any support staff have to swear that they will remain silent about anything that takes place within and that they will not be influenced by others in their decision . bribes and intrigues there 's good reason for that as bribing and intrigues were not uncommon at previous papal elections .
until 1903 , european monarchs also played a role in electing the leader of the catholic church . the cardinals keep meeting until they have agreed on a new pope .
the longest conclave lasted three years .
in order to be elected pope , a candidate has to receive two thirds of the votes .
should he not receive them right away , four rounds of votes are cast each day , separated by prayers .
the first break will take place if a new pontiff has not been elected after three days . should cardinals fail to agree after 34 voting rounds , they can decide to elect a pope by majority . dark smoke , white smoke smoke is used to announce the result of each vote as the ballots are burned each time .
if the vote has been unsuccessful , wet straw is added to the fire , causing dark smoke to rise above the chapel .
once a pope has been chosen , dry straw is added and white smoke signals the beginning of a new pontificate .

everyone except the new pontiff folds up the little canopy above his seat .
the new pope is then asked what name he chooses and officially becomes pope once a document has been drawn up that certifies his election . john paul ii 's successor will then put on the white papal clothes and accept a pledge of allegiance by the other cardinals .
only then will the dean of the college of cardinals , germany 's joseph ratzinger , step on the balcony of st. peter 's cathedral . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joseph ratzinger " annuntio vobis gaudium magnum , habemus papam , " he 'll tell the cheering crowd .

one year before the big event in germany , analysts are already wondering just what the tournament can do for the economy . the way german soccer legend and world cup chief franz beckenbauer sees it , next year 's tournament has already resulted in one winner : german companies . " our economics minister estimated the economic advantages -lrb- brought by the tournament -rrb- at 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 12.8 billion -rrb- - and that 's only the economic part , " said beckenbauer -lrb- photo -rrb- .
" every participant will profit from a boost in image . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz beckenbauer , head of the world cup organizing committee postbank chief economist marco bargel is a bit more exact .
according to his figures , more than 6 billion euros have already been invested in upgrading and expanding infrastructure , the stadiums , and hotels and restaurants .
the demand for goods and services ahead of and during the world cup will bring in " two to three billion euros , " he said . reaping benefits years after in all , say experts , hosting the world cup will mean a growth of 0.5 percent in germany 's gross domestic product - welcome news at a time when the economy is sputtering .
the country has seen this before .
the 1972 olympics speeded up development in host city munich and the rest of germany " between 12 and 15 years , " said holger preuss , a sports economist at the university of mainz . the transit system , road projects and other infrastructure developed for the olympics also set munich on the road of transformation from a sleepy alpine city to a modern metropolis . demand for sporting goods - and security " they were able to take the investment needed for hosting an olympics and produce an increase in development , " preuss said . the german economy will benefit the most from the world cup in the early months of 2006 , before the tournament actually starts .
but the postbank analysis also projects some gains for the overall economic growth during the tournament as well .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soccer fans will be bringing plenty of spending cash with them electronics and sporting goods stores and companies will benefit from soccer fans ' spending sprees .
and if the athens olympics last august was any example , security services companies , as well , can expect a jump in business . tourists could bring in one billion euros though there is still a year to go before the referee whistles the start of the first match , germany 's tourism sector is already getting warmed up .
not only the 12 cities that will host matches - from hamburg to hanover to munich - but other german regions are also readying themselves for a storm of tourists .
organizers expect more than one million visitors - and lucrative times ahead . each visitor spends between 800 and 1,000 euros for a five-day visit according to rough estimates , said bargel .
" that means foreign visitors will bring in up to a billion euros , " he said . klaus feldkeller -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's rails , roads world cup ready when millions of soccer fans descend on germany in 2006 , the country 's railways and roads will be ready for them , government officials said this week .

conducted by the essen-based center for turkish studies -lrb- zft -rrb- , the study said that a further 35 percent lived just narrowly above the poverty level .
the researchers blamed the depressed economic situation in germany , in particular the closing down of traditional sectors such as coal and the steel industry , for the poor situation of people of turkish origin .
they pointed out that turks found it especially difficult to gain a footing in other economic branches due to their lack of education .
though the children of turkish immigrants to germany did do better than their parents at school , just about five percent of turkish students visited a high school that would lead to university , the study found .
the zft has appealed to politicians to do more to promote the importance of education and training among turkish immigrants . dw-world.de child poverty rises in germany the number of children in german living in poverty is rising faster than in most other industrialized nations , according to a new report .
children of single parents and immigrant families are especially threatened .

traditional german men are lamenting the loss of their hunter-gatherer identity and bemoaning the wilful ways of their contemporary wives , but is it really such a big deal ? apparently it is .
bookshelves across the nation are laden with a colorful array of do-it-yourself volumes on love and relationships , handy hints for dealing with wayward women and guidebooks which claim to have all the answers to making marriage work . perhaps the only surprising thing is just how much is written by men for men .
one such example is thirty-something german author jens schäfer , who recently published a book about the supposed last bastions of masculinity in an otherwise female-dominated world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are these the faces of real men ?
entitled " echte männer - ein leben im verborgenen " -lrb- real men - a secret life -rrb- , the book highlights the sad lot of the free-thinking german man , driven into darkness and despair at the hands of independently-minded women .
while it does n't pretend to be profound , the book does raise some issues about the male german psyche .
do men , for example , really harbor a desire to be captain of the domestic ship on which their first mate wives and girlfriends are to follow orders with a sweet salute ? your wish is my command ? rainer volz , a sociologist and researcher who specializes in gender issues says there are four types of men floating about in germany . " there are the traditionalists who want to turn back the process of emancipation , " he said .
" they are very insecure but hide behind their macho exterior .
then we have the modern men who do n't believe in competing with women , and who are genuinely happy to help with the kids and housework . " " it 's worth belonging to that group , because they are genuinely the happiest , " he added . then there are the 60 percent of german men who fall somewhere between the two stools , according to volz . " uncertain men are the ones who ca n't decide if tradition should outweigh modernity or vice versa , while pragmatic men say that women should go out to work , but really believe it would be better if they did n't bother . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : safety in numbers ?
so just how much resonance do books like schäfer 's , which look at the dying breed of " real men " - albeit with a degree of humor - have with the country 's male population ? " there has long been a debate on what should become of the classic male territory now that women are world soccer champions and drink beer from the bottle , " a spokeswoman for schäfer 's publisher , piper , said . " the issue is that men no longer always know who or how they are supposed to be , " she said . new norms uwe lohsa , psychotherapist who offers advice to men struggling to keep afloat in the modern world , says the situation in germany is in a state of flux . " the old norms are no longer acceptable and men are faced with the conflict of having to be softees at home and competitive men in the working world .
and that poses huge difficulties to some of them , " lohsa said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women in germany can stay home until their babies outgrow babyhood but the reality is that in the working world at least , men still rule the roost .
a recent study conducted by the federal statistics office shows that women are still under-represented in managerial positions , holding just 33 percent of the country 's top posts .
in addition , it is still widely regarded as acceptable in germany for women to take an extremely long maternity leave .
employers are bound by law to hold a new mother 's job for three years , and many women take full advantage of the generous offer . getting over it so if it is not the working world which is proving too much for the traditional man , what is ?
according to volz , it 's the challenge of defining new male role models , and the quandary of choosing among them . " there are some men who have already rejected the old image of the way a man should be , but then there are others who are hanging on bitterly , " said volz .
" thirty years ago there was only one model of a man , the traditional man .
but that is over once and for all . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the next generation of modern men ?
rather than a crisis-inducer , both he and lohsa see gender equality as a great opportunity for modern men to shrug off some of the responsibilities they have been carting around with them since their dawning day - the pressures of being the sole breadwinner , for example . in order to take advantage of such modern perks though , german men first need to get beyond their own insecurities . tamsin walker , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de it 's not a man 's world despite the german government 's efforts to make paternity leave an attractive option , men are working as much as ever .

traditional german men are lamenting the loss of their hunter-gatherer identity and bemoaning the wilful ways of their contemporary wives , but is it really such a big deal ? apparently it is .
bookshelves across the nation are laden with a colorful array of do-it-yourself volumes on love and relationships , handy hints for dealing with wayward women and guidebooks which claim to have all the answers to making marriage work . perhaps the only surprising thing is just how much is written by men for men .
one such example is thirty-something german author jens schäfer , who recently published a book about the supposed last bastions of masculinity in an otherwise female-dominated world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are these the faces of real men ?
entitled " echte männer - ein leben im verborgenen " -lrb- real men - a secret life -rrb- , the book highlights the sad lot of the free-thinking german man , driven into darkness and despair at the hands of independently-minded women .
while it does n't pretend to be profound , the book does raise some issues about the male german psyche .
do men , for example , really harbor a desire to be captain of the domestic ship on which their first mate wives and girlfriends are to follow orders with a sweet salute ? your wish is my command ? rainer volz , a sociologist and researcher who specializes in gender issues says there are four types of men floating about in germany . " there are the traditionalists who want to turn back the process of emancipation , " he said .
" they are very insecure but hide behind their macho exterior .
then we have the modern men who do n't believe in competing with women , and who are genuinely happy to help with the kids and housework . " " it 's worth belonging to that group , because they are genuinely the happiest , " he added . then there are the 60 percent of german men who fall somewhere between the two stools , according to volz . " uncertain men are the ones who ca n't decide if tradition should outweigh modernity or vice versa , while pragmatic men say that women should go out to work , but really believe it would be better if they did n't bother . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : safety in numbers ?
so just how much resonance do books like schäfer 's , which look at the dying breed of " real men " - albeit with a degree of humor - have with the country 's male population ? " there has long been a debate on what should become of the classic male territory now that women are world soccer champions and drink beer from the bottle , " a spokeswoman for schäfer 's publisher , piper , said . " the issue is that men no longer always know who or how they are supposed to be , " she said . new norms uwe lohsa , psychotherapist who offers advice to men struggling to keep afloat in the modern world , says the situation in germany is in a state of flux . " the old norms are no longer acceptable and men are faced with the conflict of having to be softees at home and competitive men in the working world .
and that poses huge difficulties to some of them , " lohsa said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women in germany can stay home until their babies outgrow babyhood but the reality is that in the working world at least , men still rule the roost .
a recent study conducted by the federal statistics office shows that women are still under-represented in managerial positions , holding just 33 percent of the country 's top posts .
in addition , it is still widely regarded as acceptable in germany for women to take an extremely long maternity leave .
employers are bound by law to hold a new mother 's job for three years , and many women take full advantage of the generous offer . getting over it so if it is not the working world which is proving too much for the traditional man , what is ?
according to volz , it 's the challenge of defining new male role models , and the quandary of choosing among them . " there are some men who have already rejected the old image of the way a man should be , but then there are others who are hanging on bitterly , " said volz .
" thirty years ago there was only one model of a man , the traditional man .
but that is over once and for all . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the next generation of modern men ?
rather than a crisis-inducer , both he and lohsa see gender equality as a great opportunity for modern men to shrug off some of the responsibilities they have been carting around with them since their dawning day - the pressures of being the sole breadwinner , for example . in order to take advantage of such modern perks though , german men first need to get beyond their own insecurities . tamsin walker , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de it 's not a man 's world despite the german government 's efforts to make paternity leave an attractive option , men are working as much as ever .

traditional german men are lamenting the loss of their hunter-gatherer identity and bemoaning the wilful ways of their contemporary wives , but is it really such a big deal ? apparently it is .
bookshelves across the nation are laden with a colorful array of do-it-yourself volumes on love and relationships , handy hints for dealing with wayward women and guidebooks which claim to have all the answers to making marriage work . perhaps the only surprising thing is just how much is written by men for men .
one such example is thirty-something german author jens schäfer , who recently published a book about the supposed last bastions of masculinity in an otherwise female-dominated world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are these the faces of real men ?
entitled " echte männer - ein leben im verborgenen " -lrb- real men - a secret life -rrb- , the book highlights the sad lot of the free-thinking german man , driven into darkness and despair at the hands of independently-minded women .
while it does n't pretend to be profound , the book does raise some issues about the male german psyche .
do men , for example , really harbor a desire to be captain of the domestic ship on which their first mate wives and girlfriends are to follow orders with a sweet salute ? your wish is my command ? rainer volz , a sociologist and researcher who specializes in gender issues says there are four types of men floating about in germany . " there are the traditionalists who want to turn back the process of emancipation , " he said .
" they are very insecure but hide behind their macho exterior .
then we have the modern men who do n't believe in competing with women , and who are genuinely happy to help with the kids and housework . " " it 's worth belonging to that group , because they are genuinely the happiest , " he added . then there are the 60 percent of german men who fall somewhere between the two stools , according to volz . " uncertain men are the ones who ca n't decide if tradition should outweigh modernity or vice versa , while pragmatic men say that women should go out to work , but really believe it would be better if they did n't bother . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : safety in numbers ?
so just how much resonance do books like schäfer 's , which look at the dying breed of " real men " - albeit with a degree of humor - have with the country 's male population ? " there has long been a debate on what should become of the classic male territory now that women are world soccer champions and drink beer from the bottle , " a spokeswoman for schäfer 's publisher , piper , said . " the issue is that men no longer always know who or how they are supposed to be , " she said . new norms uwe lohsa , psychotherapist who offers advice to men struggling to keep afloat in the modern world , says the situation in germany is in a state of flux . " the old norms are no longer acceptable and men are faced with the conflict of having to be softees at home and competitive men in the working world .
and that poses huge difficulties to some of them , " lohsa said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women in germany can stay home until their babies outgrow babyhood but the reality is that in the working world at least , men still rule the roost .
a recent study conducted by the federal statistics office shows that women are still under-represented in managerial positions , holding just 33 percent of the country 's top posts .
in addition , it is still widely regarded as acceptable in germany for women to take an extremely long maternity leave .
employers are bound by law to hold a new mother 's job for three years , and many women take full advantage of the generous offer . getting over it so if it is not the working world which is proving too much for the traditional man , what is ?
according to volz , it 's the challenge of defining new male role models , and the quandary of choosing among them . " there are some men who have already rejected the old image of the way a man should be , but then there are others who are hanging on bitterly , " said volz .
" thirty years ago there was only one model of a man , the traditional man .
but that is over once and for all . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the next generation of modern men ?
rather than a crisis-inducer , both he and lohsa see gender equality as a great opportunity for modern men to shrug off some of the responsibilities they have been carting around with them since their dawning day - the pressures of being the sole breadwinner , for example . in order to take advantage of such modern perks though , german men first need to get beyond their own insecurities . tamsin walker , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de it 's not a man 's world despite the german government 's efforts to make paternity leave an attractive option , men are working as much as ever .

german hooligans could be at the forefront of a " struggle for dominance " at the 2006 world cup , according to hooliganism expert professor eric dunning in an interview with dw-world . dw-world : how are german hooligan groups structured ? prof. dunning : those in the former east germany in particular have a neo-nazi core where the task of the organization is more a political one .
the political center of the group can have an agenda other than the one supported by the outer circle which could be along the lines of purely football rivalry .
german hooligan groups with neo-nazi influences within them may have a xenophobic or national pride aspect to their actions which forms a catalyst .
other hooligans may then get swept up in that and fight for what they see as team or national allegiance .
in terms of football violence , the germans are like many other hooligans in so much as some of the violence may be opportunist , spontaneous outbreaks while others can be meticulously organized .
some clashes can be politically motivated while others can be just for the pure adrenalin rush of fighting , something many hooligans have professed to being addictive , calling the buzz " better than sex and drugs . " as with many sophisticated hooligan elements in the modern game , especially within europe , german hooligans use technology in their organization .

german hooligan groups with neo-nazi influences within them may have a xenophobic or national pride aspect to their actions which forms a catalyst .
other hooligans may then get swept up in that and fight for what they see as team or national allegiance .
in terms of football violence , the germans are like many other hooligans in so much as some of the violence may be opportunist , spontaneous outbreaks while others can be meticulously organized .
some clashes can be politically motivated while others can be just for the pure adrenalin rush of fighting , something many hooligans have professed to being addictive , calling the buzz " better than sex and drugs . " as with many sophisticated hooligan elements in the modern game , especially within europe , german hooligans use technology in their organization .
mobile phones are used to establish contact , to arrange fights and locations while the internet plays a big role .
while a lot of the chatter is made up of younger hooligans ' bravado which does n't come to much , there is evidence that internet contact does lead to actual confrontations taking place . before the violence in slovenia in march , there had been little or no large scale violence involving german hooligans on the international stage .
what , in your opinion , has been happening in that time ? the problem has never gone away .
it is obviously less of a problem that it was in the 60 's , 70 's and 80 's but it has never been eradicated .
police forces have become more skilled at preventing hooliganism at stadiums and the immediate areas around them ; monitoring entry points to cities and countries and identifying ringleaders .
but hooligans have learnt to take their fighting away from the points where control measures are most efficiently executed .
the fighting has been moved away from stadiums into railway stations , motorway service stations , even towns nowhere near those hosting matches .
surface policing -lrb- visual shows of strength , applied techniques at points of entry and stadiums -rrb- has been successful in keeping violence away from the where the game is played but only undercover operations can truly root out the core of hooligan organizations and prevent violence .
in this respect , hooliganism has continued , only not as much in the public eye . is the 2006 world cup in germany destined to be tainted by hooliganism ? in my opinion , there will be a struggle for dominance at the world cup with the germans and the english at the forefront , with the dutch and the italians also involved .
the germans are perceived as one of the most violent groups in europe , at the 1998 world cup they also most beat a french police officer to death , and they will clearly have a home advantage .
at the world cups which offered little incentive for the hooligans , there was no violence .

german hooligans could be at the forefront of a " struggle for dominance " at the 2006 world cup , according to hooliganism expert professor eric dunning in an interview with dw-world . dw-world : how are german hooligan groups structured ? prof. dunning : those in the former east germany in particular have a neo-nazi core where the task of the organization is more a political one .
the political center of the group can have an agenda other than the one supported by the outer circle which could be along the lines of purely football rivalry .
german hooligan groups with neo-nazi influences within them may have a xenophobic or national pride aspect to their actions which forms a catalyst .
other hooligans may then get swept up in that and fight for what they see as team or national allegiance .
in terms of football violence , the germans are like many other hooligans in so much as some of the violence may be opportunist , spontaneous outbreaks while others can be meticulously organized .
some clashes can be politically motivated while others can be just for the pure adrenalin rush of fighting , something many hooligans have professed to being addictive , calling the buzz " better than sex and drugs . " as with many sophisticated hooligan elements in the modern game , especially within europe , german hooligans use technology in their organization .
mobile phones are used to establish contact , to arrange fights and locations while the internet plays a big role .
while a lot of the chatter is made up of younger hooligans ' bravado which does n't come to much , there is evidence that internet contact does lead to actual confrontations taking place . before the violence in slovenia in march , there had been little or no large scale violence involving german hooligans on the international stage .
what , in your opinion , has been happening in that time ? the problem has never gone away .
it is obviously less of a problem that it was in the 60 's , 70 's and 80 's but it has never been eradicated .
police forces have become more skilled at preventing hooliganism at stadiums and the immediate areas around them ; monitoring entry points to cities and countries and identifying ringleaders .
but hooligans have learnt to take their fighting away from the points where control measures are most efficiently executed .
the fighting has been moved away from stadiums into railway stations , motorway service stations , even towns nowhere near those hosting matches .
surface policing -lrb- visual shows of strength , applied techniques at points of entry and stadiums -rrb- has been successful in keeping violence away from the where the game is played but only undercover operations can truly root out the core of hooligan organizations and prevent violence .
in this respect , hooliganism has continued , only not as much in the public eye . is the 2006 world cup in germany destined to be tainted by hooliganism ? in my opinion , there will be a struggle for dominance at the world cup with the germans and the english at the forefront , with the dutch and the italians also involved .
the germans are perceived as one of the most violent groups in europe , at the 1998 world cup they also most beat a french police officer to death , and they will clearly have a home advantage .
at the world cups which offered little incentive for the hooligans , there was no violence .
in the united states in 1994 , the reputation of the armed us police did much to put hooligans off and the cultural differences in 2002 -lrb- in japan / korea -rrb- meant that very few traveled .
germany , with its proximity to many countries with rival hooligan groups , will not have that luxury . bildunterschrift : nick amies interviewed prof. eric dunning send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german hooligans taint slovenian friendly a " friendly " weekend soccer match between germany and slovenia quickly turned sour as before , during and after the game , german fans participated in racist violence , prompting fears of a revival of hooliganism .
-lrb- march 28 , 2005 -rrb- police gear up for euro 2004 the european soccer championships in portugal this summer will host the largest security operation ever in the history of the game .
german , english and portuguese police are already operational in and around the country .

conducted by the essen-based center for turkish studies -lrb- zft -rrb- , the study said that a further 35 percent lived just narrowly above the poverty level .
the researchers blamed the depressed economic situation in germany , in particular the closing down of traditional sectors such as coal and the steel industry , for the poor situation of people of turkish origin .
they pointed out that turks found it especially difficult to gain a footing in other economic branches due to their lack of education .
though the children of turkish immigrants to germany did do better than their parents at school , just about five percent of turkish students visited a high school that would lead to university , the study found .
the zft has appealed to politicians to do more to promote the importance of education and training among turkish immigrants . dw-world.de child poverty rises in germany the number of children in german living in poverty is rising faster than in most other industrialized nations , according to a new report .
children of single parents and immigrant families are especially threatened .

catholics could hear these words as early as april 18 , as the cardinals will begin the highly regulated process of electing a new pontiff on that day . the so-called conclave will choose john paul ii 's successor .
it is made up of cardinals that have not yet turned 80 - there are currently 117 of them . while the cardinals already have a chance to discuss candidates since many of them arrived in rome ahead of the late pope 's funeral , the actual election can not begin any earlier than 15 days after john paul ii 's death nor later than 20 days after his passing .
vatican officials announced wednesday that cardinals have chosen april 18 as the day to begin deliberations . the late pope 's will will be published on thursday . simple requirements theoretically , there 's a huge number of people who qualify for the job of pontiff .

"
catholics could hear these words as early as april 18 , as the cardinals will begin the highly regulated process of electing a new pontiff on that day . the so-called conclave will choose john paul ii 's successor .
it is made up of cardinals that have not yet turned 80 - there are currently 117 of them . while the cardinals already have a chance to discuss candidates since many of them arrived in rome ahead of the late pope 's funeral , the actual election can not begin any earlier than 15 days after john paul ii 's death nor later than 20 days after his passing .
vatican officials announced wednesday that cardinals have chosen april 18 as the day to begin deliberations . the late pope 's will will be published on thursday . simple requirements theoretically , there 's a huge number of people who qualify for the job of pontiff . " every catholic man , who fulfills the requirements to become a bishop or priest , can become pope , " said alfred hierold , a professor for church law at bamberg university . while the " servant of the servants of god " could therefore be a layman , he would quickly have to be made bishop as the pope is also always the bishop of rome .
that problem has n't arisen for centuries , however : since 1378 , every pope has been a cardinal before his election . gathering in rome , cardinals will stay at " domus sanctae marthae , " a spartan guest house behind st. peter 's cathedral in vatican city . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reporters stand in one of the cells in which the cardinals slept during the last 1978 conclave " the rooms have a metal bed , a large desk , a chair , a small bathroom and stone floors , " said hierold , who has stayed there himself . complete reclusion on the first day of the conclave , cardinals celebrate a special mass called " pro eligendo papa , " or " for the election of the pope . "
traditionally , they then retreat to the vatican 's sistine chapel to begin their deliberations .
however , this time the cardinals will not be confined to the chapel .
they 'll be permitted to roam about within the walls of the vatican , though they will still be banned from contact with the outside world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vatican 's sistine chapel with the " last judgement " fresco on the wall at the end " if a cardinal brings along his mobile phone , there 's nothing that can be done , " hierold said , adding that the ballot box is placed underneath michelangelo 's famous " last judgement " fresco .
" but it 's not allowed .

until 1903 , european monarchs also played a role in electing the leader of the catholic church . the cardinals keep meeting until they have agreed on a new pope .
the longest conclave lasted three years .
in order to be elected pope , a candidate has to receive two thirds of the votes .
should he not receive them right away , four rounds of votes are cast each day , separated by prayers .
the first break will take place if a new pontiff has not been elected after three days . should cardinals fail to agree after 34 voting rounds , they can decide to elect a pope by majority . dark smoke , white smoke smoke is used to announce the result of each vote as the ballots are burned each time .
if the vote has been unsuccessful , wet straw is added to the fire , causing dark smoke to rise above the chapel .
once a pope has been chosen , dry straw is added and white smoke signals the beginning of a new pontificate .

the embattled ceo defended his leadership , but will go from the meeting with a black eye . urged on by the repeated applause of attending shareholders , representative after representative of daimlerchrysler 's biggest investors tore into the company and its embattled chief .

in his address , he told the gathering of 8,000 that they would have to brace for six months of bad news due to the high oil prices , a weak dollar , recall costs and restructuring program in the smart division .
but he assured them that daimlerchrysler was still performing satisfactorily .

" we are seeing ceremonies which are worryingly similar to what we saw with the burial of ayatollah khomeini , " drewermann said in an interview with afp news agency this week .
" this is not how we should be preaching christianity . " a missed opportunity ? drewermann points to the brief , one-month reign of john paul i in 1978 as a missed opportunity for the catholic church . " with him we would have had someone who followed the concilium of the vatican ii , " which set out a reformist path for the church .
" in fact -lrb- under pope john paul ii -rrb- the opposite happened . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a young man prays in front of a sculpture portraying pope john paul ii next to the basilica della madonna del rosario , in pompei , italy one of the striking images of the mourning for the late pontiff has been the reaction of young people to a man they apparently held in great affection , but drewermann , 64 , attaches little importance to this . " he was like a replacement father figure for them , someone who banned any sexual experience outside of marriage , " drewermann said .
" they did n't really listen to what he said . " failing to counter aids ? he is especially outraged by the late pope 's refusal to back the use of condoms which he says helped aids to ravage africa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many african children have lost their parents to aids " he said condoms were forbidden and yet 25 million people in africa are facing aids , " drewermann said .

the company , say analysts , has never been more unstable . trips to the annual shareholders meeting are never much fun for daimlerchrysler ceo jürgen schrempp .
but with his company in a serious downward spiral of late , the meeting on wednesday should be especially agonizing .
daimlerchrysler 's operating profit has dropped , its expansion strategy in asia faltered and , at the beginning of the month , the mercedes division announced the biggest recall of cars in its history . the slip-ups will not only draw the ire of smaller shareholders this year , but the massive investment funds that hold as much as 10 percent of daimlerchrysler 's 1 billion shares .
union investment , which holds 15 million shares , drew up a list of complaints ahead of the meeting .
shadow over the brand among them , that daimlerchrysler top management has had to regularly revise its profit expectations in recent years and that their profit predictions for 2005 to 2007 have been too inexact .
the fund also targeted the recall of 1.3 million mercedes built in the last four years , which began on april 2 . " the shoddy quality of the cars throws a shadow over the value of the brand in the long run , " union investment wrote , according to reports . schrempp admitted as much in an interview with der spiegel newmagazine ahead of wednesday 's meeting .
the company made a mistake by outsourcing the entire electronic components for their navigation and motor management systems , said schrempp .
as he drove around stuttgart one day , the navigation system kept asking him to turn .
" by the third time , i realized that it was n't my fault , " he said in the interview .
" the discussion about quality , " he said later , " is not good for mercedes . " division is smart-ing neither is the money-losing smart brand .
though the two-seat half-size cars made a splash upon being introduced in 1998 , they have n't sold as well as anticipated .
the introduction of new models in recent years has failed to lift sales . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smart cars : not nearly as fast-moving off the sales floors after admitting losses of 2.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.3 billion -rrb- on smart , schrempp and his board announced a 1.2 billion euro restructuring program that will cut jobs and stop the introduction of further models . that likely wo n't stanch the cascade of criticism and uneasiness among shareholders - especially with an ongoing investigation by german prosecutors into several daimlerchrysler employees accused of misusing company resources . last year , schrempp 's management team won approval of 88.49 percent of its investors , around 10 percent less than the year before .
shareholders of companies in germany traditionally ratify a management 's actions over the previous year .
an investor only rarely refuses to give management approval . approval rating to sink but this time around , the number of angry shareholders will only increase .
union investment fund has flat out announced it will not give the management its vote of confidence .
analysts say the fund management company seb invest and germany 's largest fund company , dws investment , will also likely withhold their approval . " daimler has repeatedly disappointed over several years , " said thomas körfgen , the head of equity funds at seb .
" every year , there 's another division with a catastrophic development .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 06.04.2005 daimlerchrysler management steels itself großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not much to smile about at the moment daimlerchrysler chief schrempp is likely to get more than an earful at this year 's shareholder meeting .
the company , say analysts , has never been more unstable . trips to the annual shareholders meeting are never much fun for daimlerchrysler ceo jürgen schrempp .
but with his company in a serious downward spiral of late , the meeting on wednesday should be especially agonizing .
daimlerchrysler 's operating profit has dropped , its expansion strategy in asia faltered and , at the beginning of the month , the mercedes division announced the biggest recall of cars in its history . the slip-ups will not only draw the ire of smaller shareholders this year , but the massive investment funds that hold as much as 10 percent of daimlerchrysler 's 1 billion shares .
union investment , which holds 15 million shares , drew up a list of complaints ahead of the meeting .
shadow over the brand among them , that daimlerchrysler top management has had to regularly revise its profit expectations in recent years and that their profit predictions for 2005 to 2007 have been too inexact .
the fund also targeted the recall of 1.3 million mercedes built in the last four years , which began on april 2 . " the shoddy quality of the cars throws a shadow over the value of the brand in the long run , " union investment wrote , according to reports . schrempp admitted as much in an interview with der spiegel newmagazine ahead of wednesday 's meeting .
the company made a mistake by outsourcing the entire electronic components for their navigation and motor management systems , said schrempp .
as he drove around stuttgart one day , the navigation system kept asking him to turn .
" by the third time , i realized that it was n't my fault , " he said in the interview .
" the discussion about quality , " he said later , " is not good for mercedes . " division is smart-ing neither is the money-losing smart brand .
though the two-seat half-size cars made a splash upon being introduced in 1998 , they have n't sold as well as anticipated .
the introduction of new models in recent years has failed to lift sales . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smart cars : not nearly as fast-moving off the sales floors after admitting losses of 2.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.3 billion -rrb- on smart , schrempp and his board announced a 1.2 billion euro restructuring program that will cut jobs and stop the introduction of further models . that likely wo n't stanch the cascade of criticism and uneasiness among shareholders - especially with an ongoing investigation by german prosecutors into several daimlerchrysler employees accused of misusing company resources . last year , schrempp 's management team won approval of 88.49 percent of its investors , around 10 percent less than the year before .
shareholders of companies in germany traditionally ratify a management 's actions over the previous year .
an investor only rarely refuses to give management approval . approval rating to sink but this time around , the number of angry shareholders will only increase .
union investment fund has flat out announced it will not give the management its vote of confidence .
analysts say the fund management company seb invest and germany 's largest fund company , dws investment , will also likely withhold their approval . " daimler has repeatedly disappointed over several years , " said thomas körfgen , the head of equity funds at seb .
" every year , there 's another division with a catastrophic development .

conducted by the essen-based center for turkish studies -lrb- zft -rrb- , the study said that a further 35 percent lived just narrowly above the poverty level .
the researchers blamed the depressed economic situation in germany , in particular the closing down of traditional sectors such as coal and the steel industry , for the poor situation of people of turkish origin .
they pointed out that turks found it especially difficult to gain a footing in other economic branches due to their lack of education .
though the children of turkish immigrants to germany did do better than their parents at school , just about five percent of turkish students visited a high school that would lead to university , the study found .
the zft has appealed to politicians to do more to promote the importance of education and training among turkish immigrants . dw-world.de child poverty rises in germany the number of children in german living in poverty is rising faster than in most other industrialized nations , according to a new report .
children of single parents and immigrant families are especially threatened .

"
fischer was speaking after a meeting of western balkans foreign ministers in the town of durres , northwest of the capital tirana .
talks on the final status of kosovo , a serb province which has been administered by the united nations since the end of the 1998-99 conflict , may start in september if the international community finds that the province has met democratic standards .
ethnic albanians , who make up 90 percent of two-million strong population , want kosovo to become an independent state , a solution that belgrade categorically rejects .
all concerned parties should " be engaged in the process " of negotiations , fischer said .
kosovo " is one of the most important issues this year , " he added .
serbia-montenegro 's foreign minister vuk draskovic said kosovo should have " european status " that would ensure security for the serb minority in the province .
" we will instigate a constructive and intensive dialogue between belgrade and pristina , " he said . dw-world.de struck visits balkans to bolster troops german defense minister peter struck is on a two-day visit to meet german troops stationed in the balkans .

"
fischer was speaking after a meeting of western balkans foreign ministers in the town of durres , northwest of the capital tirana .
talks on the final status of kosovo , a serb province which has been administered by the united nations since the end of the 1998-99 conflict , may start in september if the international community finds that the province has met democratic standards .
ethnic albanians , who make up 90 percent of two-million strong population , want kosovo to become an independent state , a solution that belgrade categorically rejects .
all concerned parties should " be engaged in the process " of negotiations , fischer said .
kosovo " is one of the most important issues this year , " he added .
serbia-montenegro 's foreign minister vuk draskovic said kosovo should have " european status " that would ensure security for the serb minority in the province .
" we will instigate a constructive and intensive dialogue between belgrade and pristina , " he said . dw-world.de struck visits balkans to bolster troops german defense minister peter struck is on a two-day visit to meet german troops stationed in the balkans .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 06.04.2005 -pipe- 14:00 utc poverty threatening turks in germany a new study has found that every third of the 1.9 million turks in germany lives below the poverty level .
conducted by the essen-based center for turkish studies -lrb- zft -rrb- , the study said that a further 35 percent lived just narrowly above the poverty level .
the researchers blamed the depressed economic situation in germany , in particular the closing down of traditional sectors such as coal and the steel industry , for the poor situation of people of turkish origin .
they pointed out that turks found it especially difficult to gain a footing in other economic branches due to their lack of education .
though the children of turkish immigrants to germany did do better than their parents at school , just about five percent of turkish students visited a high school that would lead to university , the study found .
the zft has appealed to politicians to do more to promote the importance of education and training among turkish immigrants . dw-world.de child poverty rises in germany the number of children in german living in poverty is rising faster than in most other industrialized nations , according to a new report .
children of single parents and immigrant families are especially threatened .

our readers shared their views on the topics . un reform reform is definitely needed .
the security council must be expanded and the veto power abolished .
consensus within the security council is very important .
i strongly support a seat on the security council for germany .
rotating seats on the council are a good idea .
my suggestion is the formation of an advisory council from the remaining members of the general assembly capable of reviewing issues and calling the general assembly to action on specific issues .
this council and the general assembly should be able to join with the security council on specific issues and disputes . - thomas clark bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of the united nations general assembly the un will not be as effective as it wishes to be , because a strong country can by-pass un resolutions more easily than one with less impact , but the more countries have some say , the better for the world .
veto power should be scratched ! - elisabeth heptner as the world seems to be moving in a more global direction , i think the concept of the security council is a bit out of date - not to mention counter-productive , with respect to the veto powers .
better still would be a strengthened general assembly , of which germany is already a member , that uses a two thirds majority ruling .
in this way it puts the voice in the hands of the world community instead of the hands of a privileged few . - andy sporner , us citizen in germany queen camilla hell no ! no way . not only should she be kept away from the title of queen , but i am furious that she is being given the title of her royal highness after the wedding .

it 's bad enough that she is being given the accolade of marrying charles after the hurt and anguish that she caused diana , -lrb- who had a very unhappy life due to camilla -rrb- .
camilla should have bowed out and let them get on with it but no she did n't , she made diana and the boys ' lives miserable .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 06.04.2005 in search of the real man großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who is really on top in germany ?
traditional german men are lamenting the loss of their hunter-gatherer identity and bemoaning the wilful ways of their contemporary wives , but is it really such a big deal ? apparently it is .
bookshelves across the nation are laden with a colorful array of do-it-yourself volumes on love and relationships , handy hints for dealing with wayward women and guidebooks which claim to have all the answers to making marriage work . perhaps the only surprising thing is just how much is written by men for men .
one such example is thirty-something german author jens schäfer , who recently published a book about the supposed last bastions of masculinity in an otherwise female-dominated world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are these the faces of real men ?
entitled " echte männer - ein leben im verborgenen " -lrb- real men - a secret life -rrb- , the book highlights the sad lot of the free-thinking german man , driven into darkness and despair at the hands of independently-minded women .
while it does n't pretend to be profound , the book does raise some issues about the male german psyche .
do men , for example , really harbor a desire to be captain of the domestic ship on which their first mate wives and girlfriends are to follow orders with a sweet salute ? your wish is my command ? rainer volz , a sociologist and researcher who specializes in gender issues says there are four types of men floating about in germany . " there are the traditionalists who want to turn back the process of emancipation , " he said .
" they are very insecure but hide behind their macho exterior .
then we have the modern men who do n't believe in competing with women , and who are genuinely happy to help with the kids and housework . " " it 's worth belonging to that group , because they are genuinely the happiest , " he added . then there are the 60 percent of german men who fall somewhere between the two stools , according to volz . " uncertain men are the ones who ca n't decide if tradition should outweigh modernity or vice versa , while pragmatic men say that women should go out to work , but really believe it would be better if they did n't bother . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : safety in numbers ?
so just how much resonance do books like schäfer 's , which look at the dying breed of " real men " - albeit with a degree of humor - have with the country 's male population ? " there has long been a debate on what should become of the classic male territory now that women are world soccer champions and drink beer from the bottle , " a spokeswoman for schäfer 's publisher , piper , said . " the issue is that men no longer always know who or how they are supposed to be , " she said . new norms uwe lohsa , psychotherapist who offers advice to men struggling to keep afloat in the modern world , says the situation in germany is in a state of flux . " the old norms are no longer acceptable and men are faced with the conflict of having to be softees at home and competitive men in the working world .
and that poses huge difficulties to some of them , " lohsa said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women in germany can stay home until their babies outgrow babyhood but the reality is that in the working world at least , men still rule the roost .
a recent study conducted by the federal statistics office shows that women are still under-represented in managerial positions , holding just 33 percent of the country 's top posts .
in addition , it is still widely regarded as acceptable in germany for women to take an extremely long maternity leave .
employers are bound by law to hold a new mother 's job for three years , and many women take full advantage of the generous offer . getting over it so if it is not the working world which is proving too much for the traditional man , what is ?
according to volz , it 's the challenge of defining new male role models , and the quandary of choosing among them . " there are some men who have already rejected the old image of the way a man should be , but then there are others who are hanging on bitterly , " said volz .
" thirty years ago there was only one model of a man , the traditional man .
but that is over once and for all . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the next generation of modern men ?
rather than a crisis-inducer , both he and lohsa see gender equality as a great opportunity for modern men to shrug off some of the responsibilities they have been carting around with them since their dawning day - the pressures of being the sole breadwinner , for example . in order to take advantage of such modern perks though , german men first need to get beyond their own insecurities . tamsin walker , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de it 's not a man 's world despite the german government 's efforts to make paternity leave an attractive option , men are working as much as ever .
so what 's stopping them opting for stay-at-home fatherhood ?
-lrb- march 8 , 2005 -rrb- work-life balance gets boost in germany in germany , where kids are seen as career killers , over 40 percent of highly qualified women choose to remain childless .
but a competition to find the nation 's most family-friendly companies is hoping to change that .

the company , say analysts , has never been more unstable . trips to the annual shareholders meeting are never much fun for daimlerchrysler ceo jürgen schrempp .
but with his company in a serious downward spiral of late , the meeting on wednesday should be especially agonizing .
daimlerchrysler 's operating profit has dropped , its expansion strategy in asia faltered and , at the beginning of the month , the mercedes division announced the biggest recall of cars in its history . the slip-ups will not only draw the ire of smaller shareholders this year , but the massive investment funds that hold as much as 10 percent of daimlerchrysler 's 1 billion shares .

the service focused on the late pope 's achievements on the world stage . some 1,000 crowded into the cathedral , where the head of the german bishops ' conference , cardinal karl lehmann , praised the pope as an ambassador for peace and justice .
many in the basilica carried flowers or wore images of the deceased leader of the roman catholic church .
many were crying , the solemn ceremony was attended by high-ranking figures from german politics , including chancellor gerhard schröder , opposition leaders angela merkel and guido westerwelle , several cabinet members and former chancellor helmut kohl . bildunterschrift : german parliamentary president wolfgang thierse , doris schröder-köpf , chancellor gerhard schröder , dieter althaus , prime minister of german state of thuringia , health minister ulla schmidt and former chancellor helmut kohl , from left , attend a service in st. john 's basilica in berlin in memory of john paul ii . lehmann , who is considered a fairly liberal cardinal , admitted that the message of john paul ii , a man with conservative positions of many moral questions , was controversial to many germans . regarding critics ' view that the pope was too authoritarian , lehmann said the polish-born john paul came from a background , namely a dictatorship , which required that the church have " unity and discipline " in order to survive . " for us children of a pluralistic society which often leans toward individualism , it was not an easy message , " he said . focus on positive but lehmann focused primarily on john paul ii 's role in poland 's - and by extension , eastern europe 's - journey from communism to democracy .
he also touched on the pope 's critical stance on the development of modern capitalist societies and the holy father 's work on behalf of the weaker members of society . " john paul ii taught us that when we start thinking only about our own well-being while letting the fate of others out of sight , the freedom of all is at stake , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a large picture of john paul ii stood near the altar .
the basilica was decorated with flowers and incense wafted among the crowd .

the service focused on the late pope 's achievements on the world stage . some 1,000 crowded into the cathedral , where the head of the german bishops ' conference , cardinal karl lehmann , praised the pope as an ambassador for peace and justice .
many in the basilica carried flowers or wore images of the deceased leader of the roman catholic church .
many were crying , the solemn ceremony was attended by high-ranking figures from german politics , including chancellor gerhard schröder , opposition leaders angela merkel and guido westerwelle , several cabinet members and former chancellor helmut kohl . bildunterschrift : german parliamentary president wolfgang thierse , doris schröder-köpf , chancellor gerhard schröder , dieter althaus , prime minister of german state of thuringia , health minister ulla schmidt and former chancellor helmut kohl , from left , attend a service in st. john 's basilica in berlin in memory of john paul ii . lehmann , who is considered a fairly liberal cardinal , admitted that the message of john paul ii , a man with conservative positions of many moral questions , was controversial to many germans . regarding critics ' view that the pope was too authoritarian , lehmann said the polish-born john paul came from a background , namely a dictatorship , which required that the church have " unity and discipline " in order to survive . " for us children of a pluralistic society which often leans toward individualism , it was not an easy message , " he said . focus on positive but lehmann focused primarily on john paul ii 's role in poland 's - and by extension , eastern europe 's - journey from communism to democracy .
he also touched on the pope 's critical stance on the development of modern capitalist societies and the holy father 's work on behalf of the weaker members of society . " john paul ii taught us that when we start thinking only about our own well-being while letting the fate of others out of sight , the freedom of all is at stake , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a large picture of john paul ii stood near the altar .

" we are seeing ceremonies which are worryingly similar to what we saw with the burial of ayatollah khomeini , " drewermann said in an interview with afp news agency this week .
" this is not how we should be preaching christianity . " a missed opportunity ? drewermann points to the brief , one-month reign of john paul i in 1978 as a missed opportunity for the catholic church . " with him we would have had someone who followed the concilium of the vatican ii , " which set out a reformist path for the church .
" in fact -lrb- under pope john paul ii -rrb- the opposite happened . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a young man prays in front of a sculpture portraying pope john paul ii next to the basilica della madonna del rosario , in pompei , italy one of the striking images of the mourning for the late pontiff has been the reaction of young people to a man they apparently held in great affection , but drewermann , 64 , attaches little importance to this . " he was like a replacement father figure for them , someone who banned any sexual experience outside of marriage , " drewermann said .
" they did n't really listen to what he said . " failing to counter aids ? he is especially outraged by the late pope 's refusal to back the use of condoms which he says helped aids to ravage africa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many african children have lost their parents to aids " he said condoms were forbidden and yet 25 million people in africa are facing aids , " drewermann said .
" at the world population conference in cairo -lrb- in 1994 -rrb- the vatican blocked a sensible and effective birth control program , siding with the ayatollahs and the american fundamentalists . " under pope john paul ii , the catholic church turned its back on the possibility of a " spiritual opening , " drewermann said .
this , he said , prevented serious reflection on how to read and interpret the bible or , for example , how to interpret the symbols of the new testament such as the immaculate conception . a climate of psychological fear ? drewermann also alleged that the catholic church under the leadership of the late pontiff tacitly encouraged a climate of psychological fear among its followers - a popular theme of his books which have been translated into many languages . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian exorcist father gabriele nanni gives a lesson on satanism for clergy at rome 's regina apostolorum pontifical academy , in february " there were more than 30,000 exorcisms during his reign , " which shows " that there is a widespread belief that satan is within people 's souls , " he said . high hopes for the next pope the theologian also berated pope john paul ii for failing to take a more liberal stance on divorce and re-marriage and said that he " quite simply banned any discussion about the emancipation of women . " but drewermann , who now lives a reclusive life in the western german city of paderborn , without a phone , fax or computer , praises pope john paul ii 's efforts to reach out to third world countries , his opposition to the us-led invasion of iraq and his rejection of " the anti-social and harmful character of capitalism . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drewermann has high hopes for the next occupant of the papal apartment he said he fervently hopes that the next pope will seize the chance to throw open to discussion " issues that have been taboo for centuries " and allow catholics to debate freely with other christians . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans hope for progressive next pope as people in germany keep mourning john paul ii ’ s death , some politicians and church leaders have started thinking about what the next pontificate should be like .

traditional german men are lamenting the loss of their hunter-gatherer identity and bemoaning the wilful ways of their contemporary wives , but is it really such a big deal ? apparently it is .
bookshelves across the nation are laden with a colorful array of do-it-yourself volumes on love and relationships , handy hints for dealing with wayward women and guidebooks which claim to have all the answers to making marriage work . perhaps the only surprising thing is just how much is written by men for men .
one such example is thirty-something german author jens schäfer , who recently published a book about the supposed last bastions of masculinity in an otherwise female-dominated world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are these the faces of real men ?
entitled " echte männer - ein leben im verborgenen " -lrb- real men - a secret life -rrb- , the book highlights the sad lot of the free-thinking german man , driven into darkness and despair at the hands of independently-minded women .
while it does n't pretend to be profound , the book does raise some issues about the male german psyche .
do men , for example , really harbor a desire to be captain of the domestic ship on which their first mate wives and girlfriends are to follow orders with a sweet salute ? your wish is my command ? rainer volz , a sociologist and researcher who specializes in gender issues says there are four types of men floating about in germany . " there are the traditionalists who want to turn back the process of emancipation , " he said .
" they are very insecure but hide behind their macho exterior .
then we have the modern men who do n't believe in competing with women , and who are genuinely happy to help with the kids and housework . " " it 's worth belonging to that group , because they are genuinely the happiest , " he added . then there are the 60 percent of german men who fall somewhere between the two stools , according to volz . " uncertain men are the ones who ca n't decide if tradition should outweigh modernity or vice versa , while pragmatic men say that women should go out to work , but really believe it would be better if they did n't bother . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : safety in numbers ?
so just how much resonance do books like schäfer 's , which look at the dying breed of " real men " - albeit with a degree of humor - have with the country 's male population ? " there has long been a debate on what should become of the classic male territory now that women are world soccer champions and drink beer from the bottle , " a spokeswoman for schäfer 's publisher , piper , said . " the issue is that men no longer always know who or how they are supposed to be , " she said . new norms uwe lohsa , psychotherapist who offers advice to men struggling to keep afloat in the modern world , says the situation in germany is in a state of flux . " the old norms are no longer acceptable and men are faced with the conflict of having to be softees at home and competitive men in the working world .
and that poses huge difficulties to some of them , " lohsa said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women in germany can stay home until their babies outgrow babyhood but the reality is that in the working world at least , men still rule the roost .
a recent study conducted by the federal statistics office shows that women are still under-represented in managerial positions , holding just 33 percent of the country 's top posts .
in addition , it is still widely regarded as acceptable in germany for women to take an extremely long maternity leave .
employers are bound by law to hold a new mother 's job for three years , and many women take full advantage of the generous offer . getting over it so if it is not the working world which is proving too much for the traditional man , what is ?
according to volz , it 's the challenge of defining new male role models , and the quandary of choosing among them . " there are some men who have already rejected the old image of the way a man should be , but then there are others who are hanging on bitterly , " said volz .
" thirty years ago there was only one model of a man , the traditional man .
but that is over once and for all . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the next generation of modern men ?
rather than a crisis-inducer , both he and lohsa see gender equality as a great opportunity for modern men to shrug off some of the responsibilities they have been carting around with them since their dawning day - the pressures of being the sole breadwinner , for example . in order to take advantage of such modern perks though , german men first need to get beyond their own insecurities . tamsin walker , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de it 's not a man 's world despite the german government 's efforts to make paternity leave an attractive option , men are working as much as ever .

german hooligans could be at the forefront of a " struggle for dominance " at the 2006 world cup , according to hooliganism expert professor eric dunning in an interview with dw-world . dw-world : how are german hooligan groups structured ? prof. dunning : those in the former east germany in particular have a neo-nazi core where the task of the organization is more a political one .
the political center of the group can have an agenda other than the one supported by the outer circle which could be along the lines of purely football rivalry .
german hooligan groups with neo-nazi influences within them may have a xenophobic or national pride aspect to their actions which forms a catalyst .
other hooligans may then get swept up in that and fight for what they see as team or national allegiance .
in terms of football violence , the germans are like many other hooligans in so much as some of the violence may be opportunist , spontaneous outbreaks while others can be meticulously organized .
some clashes can be politically motivated while others can be just for the pure adrenalin rush of fighting , something many hooligans have professed to being addictive , calling the buzz " better than sex and drugs . " as with many sophisticated hooligan elements in the modern game , especially within europe , german hooligans use technology in their organization .
mobile phones are used to establish contact , to arrange fights and locations while the internet plays a big role .
while a lot of the chatter is made up of younger hooligans ' bravado which does n't come to much , there is evidence that internet contact does lead to actual confrontations taking place . before the violence in slovenia in march , there had been little or no large scale violence involving german hooligans on the international stage .
what , in your opinion , has been happening in that time ? the problem has never gone away .
it is obviously less of a problem that it was in the 60 's , 70 's and 80 's but it has never been eradicated .
police forces have become more skilled at preventing hooliganism at stadiums and the immediate areas around them ; monitoring entry points to cities and countries and identifying ringleaders .
but hooligans have learnt to take their fighting away from the points where control measures are most efficiently executed .
the fighting has been moved away from stadiums into railway stations , motorway service stations , even towns nowhere near those hosting matches .
surface policing -lrb- visual shows of strength , applied techniques at points of entry and stadiums -rrb- has been successful in keeping violence away from the where the game is played but only undercover operations can truly root out the core of hooligan organizations and prevent violence .
in this respect , hooliganism has continued , only not as much in the public eye . is the 2006 world cup in germany destined to be tainted by hooliganism ? in my opinion , there will be a struggle for dominance at the world cup with the germans and the english at the forefront , with the dutch and the italians also involved .
the germans are perceived as one of the most violent groups in europe , at the 1998 world cup they also most beat a french police officer to death , and they will clearly have a home advantage .
at the world cups which offered little incentive for the hooligans , there was no violence .
in the united states in 1994 , the reputation of the armed us police did much to put hooligans off and the cultural differences in 2002 -lrb- in japan / korea -rrb- meant that very few traveled .
germany , with its proximity to many countries with rival hooligan groups , will not have that luxury . bildunterschrift : nick amies interviewed prof. eric dunning send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german hooligans taint slovenian friendly a " friendly " weekend soccer match between germany and slovenia quickly turned sour as before , during and after the game , german fans participated in racist violence , prompting fears of a revival of hooliganism .
-lrb- march 28 , 2005 -rrb- police gear up for euro 2004 the european soccer championships in portugal this summer will host the largest security operation ever in the history of the game .
german , english and portuguese police are already operational in and around the country .
-lrb- may 21 , 2004 -rrb- fans , not hooligans the story of portugal soccer 's chronic plague , hooliganism , was little more than a footnote at the european soccer championships in portugal this year .
organizers say more effective measures and a new fan culture are the reasons .

" we are seeing ceremonies which are worryingly similar to what we saw with the burial of ayatollah khomeini , " drewermann said in an interview with afp news agency this week .
" this is not how we should be preaching christianity . " a missed opportunity ? drewermann points to the brief , one-month reign of john paul i in 1978 as a missed opportunity for the catholic church . " with him we would have had someone who followed the concilium of the vatican ii , " which set out a reformist path for the church .
" in fact -lrb- under pope john paul ii -rrb- the opposite happened . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a young man prays in front of a sculpture portraying pope john paul ii next to the basilica della madonna del rosario , in pompei , italy one of the striking images of the mourning for the late pontiff has been the reaction of young people to a man they apparently held in great affection , but drewermann , 64 , attaches little importance to this . " he was like a replacement father figure for them , someone who banned any sexual experience outside of marriage , " drewermann said .
" they did n't really listen to what he said . " failing to counter aids ? he is especially outraged by the late pope 's refusal to back the use of condoms which he says helped aids to ravage africa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many african children have lost their parents to aids " he said condoms were forbidden and yet 25 million people in africa are facing aids , " drewermann said .
" at the world population conference in cairo -lrb- in 1994 -rrb- the vatican blocked a sensible and effective birth control program , siding with the ayatollahs and the american fundamentalists . " under pope john paul ii , the catholic church turned its back on the possibility of a " spiritual opening , " drewermann said .
this , he said , prevented serious reflection on how to read and interpret the bible or , for example , how to interpret the symbols of the new testament such as the immaculate conception . a climate of psychological fear ? drewermann also alleged that the catholic church under the leadership of the late pontiff tacitly encouraged a climate of psychological fear among its followers - a popular theme of his books which have been translated into many languages . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian exorcist father gabriele nanni gives a lesson on satanism for clergy at rome 's regina apostolorum pontifical academy , in february " there were more than 30,000 exorcisms during his reign , " which shows " that there is a widespread belief that satan is within people 's souls , " he said . high hopes for the next pope the theologian also berated pope john paul ii for failing to take a more liberal stance on divorce and re-marriage and said that he " quite simply banned any discussion about the emancipation of women . " but drewermann , who now lives a reclusive life in the western german city of paderborn , without a phone , fax or computer , praises pope john paul ii 's efforts to reach out to third world countries , his opposition to the us-led invasion of iraq and his rejection of " the anti-social and harmful character of capitalism . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drewermann has high hopes for the next occupant of the papal apartment he said he fervently hopes that the next pope will seize the chance to throw open to discussion " issues that have been taboo for centuries " and allow catholics to debate freely with other christians . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans hope for progressive next pope as people in germany keep mourning john paul ii ’ s death , some politicians and church leaders have started thinking about what the next pontificate should be like .

the company , say analysts , has never been more unstable . trips to the annual shareholders meeting are never much fun for daimlerchrysler ceo jürgen schrempp .
but with his company in a serious downward spiral of late , the meeting on wednesday should be especially agonizing .
daimlerchrysler 's operating profit has dropped , its expansion strategy in asia faltered and , at the beginning of the month , the mercedes division announced the biggest recall of cars in its history . the slip-ups will not only draw the ire of smaller shareholders this year , but the massive investment funds that hold as much as 10 percent of daimlerchrysler 's 1 billion shares .
union investment , which holds 15 million shares , drew up a list of complaints ahead of the meeting .
shadow over the brand among them , that daimlerchrysler top management has had to regularly revise its profit expectations in recent years and that their profit predictions for 2005 to 2007 have been too inexact .
the fund also targeted the recall of 1.3 million mercedes built in the last four years , which began on april 2 . " the shoddy quality of the cars throws a shadow over the value of the brand in the long run , " union investment wrote , according to reports . schrempp admitted as much in an interview with der spiegel newmagazine ahead of wednesday 's meeting .
the company made a mistake by outsourcing the entire electronic components for their navigation and motor management systems , said schrempp .
as he drove around stuttgart one day , the navigation system kept asking him to turn .
" by the third time , i realized that it was n't my fault , " he said in the interview .
" the discussion about quality , " he said later , " is not good for mercedes . " division is smart-ing neither is the money-losing smart brand .
though the two-seat half-size cars made a splash upon being introduced in 1998 , they have n't sold as well as anticipated .
the introduction of new models in recent years has failed to lift sales . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smart cars : not nearly as fast-moving off the sales floors after admitting losses of 2.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.3 billion -rrb- on smart , schrempp and his board announced a 1.2 billion euro restructuring program that will cut jobs and stop the introduction of further models . that likely wo n't stanch the cascade of criticism and uneasiness among shareholders - especially with an ongoing investigation by german prosecutors into several daimlerchrysler employees accused of misusing company resources . last year , schrempp 's management team won approval of 88.49 percent of its investors , around 10 percent less than the year before .
shareholders of companies in germany traditionally ratify a management 's actions over the previous year .
an investor only rarely refuses to give management approval . approval rating to sink but this time around , the number of angry shareholders will only increase .
union investment fund has flat out announced it will not give the management its vote of confidence .
analysts say the fund management company seb invest and germany 's largest fund company , dws investment , will also likely withhold their approval . " daimler has repeatedly disappointed over several years , " said thomas körfgen , the head of equity funds at seb .
" every year , there 's another division with a catastrophic development .

the service focused on the late pope 's achievements on the world stage . some 1,000 crowded into the cathedral , where the head of the german bishops ' conference , cardinal karl lehmann , praised the pope as an ambassador for peace and justice .
many in the basilica carried flowers or wore images of the deceased leader of the roman catholic church .
many were crying , the solemn ceremony was attended by high-ranking figures from german politics , including chancellor gerhard schröder , opposition leaders angela merkel and guido westerwelle , several cabinet members and former chancellor helmut kohl . bildunterschrift : german parliamentary president wolfgang thierse , doris schröder-köpf , chancellor gerhard schröder , dieter althaus , prime minister of german state of thuringia , health minister ulla schmidt and former chancellor helmut kohl , from left , attend a service in st. john 's basilica in berlin in memory of john paul ii . lehmann , who is considered a fairly liberal cardinal , admitted that the message of john paul ii , a man with conservative positions of many moral questions , was controversial to many germans . regarding critics ' view that the pope was too authoritarian , lehmann said the polish-born john paul came from a background , namely a dictatorship , which required that the church have " unity and discipline " in order to survive . " for us children of a pluralistic society which often leans toward individualism , it was not an easy message , " he said . focus on positive but lehmann focused primarily on john paul ii 's role in poland 's - and by extension , eastern europe 's - journey from communism to democracy .
he also touched on the pope 's critical stance on the development of modern capitalist societies and the holy father 's work on behalf of the weaker members of society . " john paul ii taught us that when we start thinking only about our own well-being while letting the fate of others out of sight , the freedom of all is at stake , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a large picture of john paul ii stood near the altar .
the basilica was decorated with flowers and incense wafted among the crowd .
strains from the requiem of heinrich ignaz franz von biber , written in the 17th century , filled the cavernous space . anti-war pope wolfgang thierse , parliamentary speaker and a catholic himself , told reporters shortly before the ceremony that he admired the pope particularly for his rejection of war . " the pontiff ’ s efforts to promote peace and understanding are really unparalleled , " he said .
" he ’ ll also be remembered as a man who sought constructive dialogue with other religions , and he stood for reconciliation with the jews and muslims .

the embattled ceo defended his leadership , but will go from the meeting with a black eye . urged on by the repeated applause of attending shareholders , representative after representative of daimlerchrysler 's biggest investors tore into the company and its embattled chief . " mr. schrempp , the past five years have been marked by mismanagement , " said klaus kaldemorgen , whose investment fund dws owns 10 percent of daimlerchrysler stock .
" shareholder patience is over . " ceo on the defensive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mercedes ' image is taking a beating the us-german company and its veteran ceo have been reeling from a series of serious setbacks that have tarnished the car company 's glowing image in the past year .
the company 's operating profit had to be revised , the smart minicar division is undergoing a 1.3 billion euro -lrb- $ 1.68 billion -rrb- restructuring program , and the company began the biggest recall of cars in its history at the beginning of april . schrempp was well prepared for an onslaught of criticism at wednesday 's meeting in berlin .
in his address , he told the gathering of 8,000 that they would have to brace for six months of bad news due to the high oil prices , a weak dollar , recall costs and restructuring program in the smart division .
but he assured them that daimlerchrysler was still performing satisfactorily . " we reached our profit goals , " said schrempp , who has headed daimlerchrysler for 10 years . brand is endangered but it wasn ’ t the profit margin so much as the disturbing tendencies in important daimlerchrysler divisions that bothered majority shareholders .
thomas meier , the fund manager at union investment , drew applause when he criticized recent developments at mercedes-benz , daimler 's most valuable division . after discovering defects in electrical components of mercedes cars built after 2001 , daimlerchrysler launched a recall of 1.3 million cars at the beginning of april . the problems halved the division 's profit margin last year from 3.1 billion to 1.67 billion euros , said meier , whose fund owns 15 million shares . " the brand mercedes-benz is endangered , " he said . smart a " declaration of bankruptcy " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two-seat minicar smart the smart division , which has yet to bring a profit since the two-seat minicar was introduced in 1998 , came in for similar criticism .
fund managers took aim at the 3.8 billion euros in losses the division has posted .
recent efforts to revive the brand by expanding the selection of models have failed and analysts say daimler has not been able to find a market for the cars . the announced 1.3 billion restructuring program , which includes staff cuts , is a " declaration of bankruptcy , " said kaldemorgen . schrempp admitted to the failings .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juergen schrempp explains the annual business report as a display illustrates the decreasing profit trend at the beginning of the annual meeting in berlin on wednesday .
" mercedes-benz quality was not upheld , and smart needs to be brought back , " he said . witholding approval so does the share price .
compared to other automotive companies and the dax index on the frankfurt stock exchange , daimlerchrysler stock performed poorly over the past year . whereas the dax was in the black , daimlerchrysler stock dropped 0.6 percent in value , continuing a downwards trend in the past five years . last year , schrempp 's management team won approval of 88.49 percent of its investors , around 10 percent less than the year before .
shareholders of companies in germany traditionally ratify management 's actions over the previous year .
an investor only rarely refuses to give management approval . but union investment has already said that it will withhold its vote of confidence at the end of the meeting .

german hooligans could be at the forefront of a " struggle for dominance " at the 2006 world cup , according to hooliganism expert professor eric dunning in an interview with dw-world . dw-world : how are german hooligan groups structured ? prof. dunning : those in the former east germany in particular have a neo-nazi core where the task of the organization is more a political one .
the political center of the group can have an agenda other than the one supported by the outer circle which could be along the lines of purely football rivalry .
german hooligan groups with neo-nazi influences within them may have a xenophobic or national pride aspect to their actions which forms a catalyst .
other hooligans may then get swept up in that and fight for what they see as team or national allegiance .
in terms of football violence , the germans are like many other hooligans in so much as some of the violence may be opportunist , spontaneous outbreaks while others can be meticulously organized .
some clashes can be politically motivated while others can be just for the pure adrenalin rush of fighting , something many hooligans have professed to being addictive , calling the buzz " better than sex and drugs . " as with many sophisticated hooligan elements in the modern game , especially within europe , german hooligans use technology in their organization .
mobile phones are used to establish contact , to arrange fights and locations while the internet plays a big role .
while a lot of the chatter is made up of younger hooligans ' bravado which does n't come to much , there is evidence that internet contact does lead to actual confrontations taking place . before the violence in slovenia in march , there had been little or no large scale violence involving german hooligans on the international stage .
what , in your opinion , has been happening in that time ? the problem has never gone away .
it is obviously less of a problem that it was in the 60 's , 70 's and 80 's but it has never been eradicated .
police forces have become more skilled at preventing hooliganism at stadiums and the immediate areas around them ; monitoring entry points to cities and countries and identifying ringleaders .
but hooligans have learnt to take their fighting away from the points where control measures are most efficiently executed .
the fighting has been moved away from stadiums into railway stations , motorway service stations , even towns nowhere near those hosting matches .
surface policing -lrb- visual shows of strength , applied techniques at points of entry and stadiums -rrb- has been successful in keeping violence away from the where the game is played but only undercover operations can truly root out the core of hooligan organizations and prevent violence .
in this respect , hooliganism has continued , only not as much in the public eye . is the 2006 world cup in germany destined to be tainted by hooliganism ? in my opinion , there will be a struggle for dominance at the world cup with the germans and the english at the forefront , with the dutch and the italians also involved .
the germans are perceived as one of the most violent groups in europe , at the 1998 world cup they also most beat a french police officer to death , and they will clearly have a home advantage .
at the world cups which offered little incentive for the hooligans , there was no violence .
in the united states in 1994 , the reputation of the armed us police did much to put hooligans off and the cultural differences in 2002 -lrb- in japan / korea -rrb- meant that very few traveled .

rainier 's son , albert , has already assumed his father 's duties as monarch of the tiny state on the mediterranean coast . rainier iii , europe 's longest reigning monarch , was rushed into intensive care two weeks ago when his health took a dramatic turn for the worse .
the 81-year-old prince had been battling lung , heart and kidney problems . as rainier 's health worsened in recent days , the prince 's three children by his late wife , the us film star grace kelly , took turns at his bedside , and he also received visits from monaco 's archbishop and a parish priest . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prince rainier iii leaves the cathedral of monaco with his son , prince albert his only son , the bachelor prince albert , 47 , is his heir .
albert 's bachelor status had for a long time cast a question over the grimaldi family 's rule .
in 2002 , rainier changed monaco 's constitution to allow the offspring of his daughters , caroline , 48 , and stephanie , 40 , to enter the line of succession .
however , last week , albert assumed his father 's duties when hopes that rainier would recover faded . glamour quotient rainier came to the throne in the tiny mediterranean territory in 1949 , three years before britain 's queen elizabeth ii succeeded her father . after years as a jet-setting playboy , he boosted the glamour quotient of his little state when he married kelly in 1956 .
she died in a car crash in the principality in 1982 . monaco was founded when rainier 's grimaldi dynasty took control of the principality in 1297 .
the family was deposed after the french revolution when monaco was united with france , but restored by treaty in 1861 . the principality has a population of around 32,000 , many of them ultra-rich residents enjoying its tax-haven benefits .
much of its image and financial success of the second-smallest state in europe after the holy see has been credited to prince rainier , who oversaw building projects , brought in the formula one motor race , and fostered monaco 's reputation as an exclusive playground for the rich and famous . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de monaco 's prince albert assumes duties monaco 's prince albert is assuming the duties of his father , prince rainier , who is in intensive care in hospital , the palace announced thursday .

rainier 's son , albert , has already assumed his father 's duties as monarch of the tiny state on the mediterranean coast . rainier iii , europe 's longest reigning monarch , was rushed into intensive care two weeks ago when his health took a dramatic turn for the worse .
the 81-year-old prince had been battling lung , heart and kidney problems . as rainier 's health worsened in recent days , the prince 's three children by his late wife , the us film star grace kelly , took turns at his bedside , and he also received visits from monaco 's archbishop and a parish priest . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prince rainier iii leaves the cathedral of monaco with his son , prince albert his only son , the bachelor prince albert , 47 , is his heir .

german hooligans could be at the forefront of a " struggle for dominance " at the 2006 world cup , according to hooliganism expert professor eric dunning in an interview with dw-world . dw-world : how are german hooligan groups structured ? prof. dunning : those in the former east germany in particular have a neo-nazi core where the task of the organization is more a political one .
the political center of the group can have an agenda other than the one supported by the outer circle which could be along the lines of purely football rivalry .
german hooligan groups with neo-nazi influences within them may have a xenophobic or national pride aspect to their actions which forms a catalyst .
other hooligans may then get swept up in that and fight for what they see as team or national allegiance .
in terms of football violence , the germans are like many other hooligans in so much as some of the violence may be opportunist , spontaneous outbreaks while others can be meticulously organized .
some clashes can be politically motivated while others can be just for the pure adrenalin rush of fighting , something many hooligans have professed to being addictive , calling the buzz " better than sex and drugs . " as with many sophisticated hooligan elements in the modern game , especially within europe , german hooligans use technology in their organization .
mobile phones are used to establish contact , to arrange fights and locations while the internet plays a big role .
while a lot of the chatter is made up of younger hooligans ' bravado which does n't come to much , there is evidence that internet contact does lead to actual confrontations taking place . before the violence in slovenia in march , there had been little or no large scale violence involving german hooligans on the international stage .
what , in your opinion , has been happening in that time ? the problem has never gone away .
it is obviously less of a problem that it was in the 60 's , 70 's and 80 's but it has never been eradicated .
police forces have become more skilled at preventing hooliganism at stadiums and the immediate areas around them ; monitoring entry points to cities and countries and identifying ringleaders .
but hooligans have learnt to take their fighting away from the points where control measures are most efficiently executed .
the fighting has been moved away from stadiums into railway stations , motorway service stations , even towns nowhere near those hosting matches .

traditional german men are lamenting the loss of their hunter-gatherer identity and bemoaning the wilful ways of their contemporary wives , but is it really such a big deal ? apparently it is .
bookshelves across the nation are laden with a colorful array of do-it-yourself volumes on love and relationships , handy hints for dealing with wayward women and guidebooks which claim to have all the answers to making marriage work . perhaps the only surprising thing is just how much is written by men for men .
one such example is thirty-something german author jens schäfer , who recently published a book about the supposed last bastions of masculinity in an otherwise female-dominated world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are these the faces of real men ?
entitled " echte männer - ein leben im verborgenen " -lrb- real men - a secret life -rrb- , the book highlights the sad lot of the free-thinking german man , driven into darkness and despair at the hands of independently-minded women .
while it does n't pretend to be profound , the book does raise some issues about the male german psyche .
do men , for example , really harbor a desire to be captain of the domestic ship on which their first mate wives and girlfriends are to follow orders with a sweet salute ? your wish is my command ? rainer volz , a sociologist and researcher who specializes in gender issues says there are four types of men floating about in germany . " there are the traditionalists who want to turn back the process of emancipation , " he said .
" they are very insecure but hide behind their macho exterior .
then we have the modern men who do n't believe in competing with women , and who are genuinely happy to help with the kids and housework . " " it 's worth belonging to that group , because they are genuinely the happiest , " he added . then there are the 60 percent of german men who fall somewhere between the two stools , according to volz . " uncertain men are the ones who ca n't decide if tradition should outweigh modernity or vice versa , while pragmatic men say that women should go out to work , but really believe it would be better if they did n't bother . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : safety in numbers ?
so just how much resonance do books like schäfer 's , which look at the dying breed of " real men " - albeit with a degree of humor - have with the country 's male population ? " there has long been a debate on what should become of the classic male territory now that women are world soccer champions and drink beer from the bottle , " a spokeswoman for schäfer 's publisher , piper , said . " the issue is that men no longer always know who or how they are supposed to be , " she said . new norms uwe lohsa , psychotherapist who offers advice to men struggling to keep afloat in the modern world , says the situation in germany is in a state of flux . " the old norms are no longer acceptable and men are faced with the conflict of having to be softees at home and competitive men in the working world .
and that poses huge difficulties to some of them , " lohsa said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women in germany can stay home until their babies outgrow babyhood but the reality is that in the working world at least , men still rule the roost .
a recent study conducted by the federal statistics office shows that women are still under-represented in managerial positions , holding just 33 percent of the country 's top posts .
in addition , it is still widely regarded as acceptable in germany for women to take an extremely long maternity leave .
employers are bound by law to hold a new mother 's job for three years , and many women take full advantage of the generous offer . getting over it so if it is not the working world which is proving too much for the traditional man , what is ?
according to volz , it 's the challenge of defining new male role models , and the quandary of choosing among them . " there are some men who have already rejected the old image of the way a man should be , but then there are others who are hanging on bitterly , " said volz .
" thirty years ago there was only one model of a man , the traditional man .
but that is over once and for all . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the next generation of modern men ?
rather than a crisis-inducer , both he and lohsa see gender equality as a great opportunity for modern men to shrug off some of the responsibilities they have been carting around with them since their dawning day - the pressures of being the sole breadwinner , for example . in order to take advantage of such modern perks though , german men first need to get beyond their own insecurities . tamsin walker , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de it 's not a man 's world despite the german government 's efforts to make paternity leave an attractive option , men are working as much as ever .
so what 's stopping them opting for stay-at-home fatherhood ?
-lrb- march 8 , 2005 -rrb- work-life balance gets boost in germany in germany , where kids are seen as career killers , over 40 percent of highly qualified women choose to remain childless .

then we have the modern men who do n't believe in competing with women , and who are genuinely happy to help with the kids and housework . " " it 's worth belonging to that group , because they are genuinely the happiest , " he added . then there are the 60 percent of german men who fall somewhere between the two stools , according to volz . " uncertain men are the ones who ca n't decide if tradition should outweigh modernity or vice versa , while pragmatic men say that women should go out to work , but really believe it would be better if they did n't bother . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : safety in numbers ?
so just how much resonance do books like schäfer 's , which look at the dying breed of " real men " - albeit with a degree of humor - have with the country 's male population ? " there has long been a debate on what should become of the classic male territory now that women are world soccer champions and drink beer from the bottle , " a spokeswoman for schäfer 's publisher , piper , said . " the issue is that men no longer always know who or how they are supposed to be , " she said . new norms uwe lohsa , psychotherapist who offers advice to men struggling to keep afloat in the modern world , says the situation in germany is in a state of flux . " the old norms are no longer acceptable and men are faced with the conflict of having to be softees at home and competitive men in the working world .
and that poses huge difficulties to some of them , " lohsa said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women in germany can stay home until their babies outgrow babyhood but the reality is that in the working world at least , men still rule the roost .
a recent study conducted by the federal statistics office shows that women are still under-represented in managerial positions , holding just 33 percent of the country 's top posts .
in addition , it is still widely regarded as acceptable in germany for women to take an extremely long maternity leave .
employers are bound by law to hold a new mother 's job for three years , and many women take full advantage of the generous offer . getting over it so if it is not the working world which is proving too much for the traditional man , what is ?
according to volz , it 's the challenge of defining new male role models , and the quandary of choosing among them . " there are some men who have already rejected the old image of the way a man should be , but then there are others who are hanging on bitterly , " said volz .
" thirty years ago there was only one model of a man , the traditional man .
but that is over once and for all . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the next generation of modern men ?
rather than a crisis-inducer , both he and lohsa see gender equality as a great opportunity for modern men to shrug off some of the responsibilities they have been carting around with them since their dawning day - the pressures of being the sole breadwinner , for example . in order to take advantage of such modern perks though , german men first need to get beyond their own insecurities . tamsin walker , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de it 's not a man 's world despite the german government 's efforts to make paternity leave an attractive option , men are working as much as ever .
so what 's stopping them opting for stay-at-home fatherhood ?

german hooligans could be at the forefront of a " struggle for dominance " at the 2006 world cup , according to hooliganism expert professor eric dunning in an interview with dw-world . dw-world : how are german hooligan groups structured ? prof. dunning : those in the former east germany in particular have a neo-nazi core where the task of the organization is more a political one .
the political center of the group can have an agenda other than the one supported by the outer circle which could be along the lines of purely football rivalry .
german hooligan groups with neo-nazi influences within them may have a xenophobic or national pride aspect to their actions which forms a catalyst .
other hooligans may then get swept up in that and fight for what they see as team or national allegiance .
in terms of football violence , the germans are like many other hooligans in so much as some of the violence may be opportunist , spontaneous outbreaks while others can be meticulously organized .
some clashes can be politically motivated while others can be just for the pure adrenalin rush of fighting , something many hooligans have professed to being addictive , calling the buzz " better than sex and drugs . " as with many sophisticated hooligan elements in the modern game , especially within europe , german hooligans use technology in their organization .
mobile phones are used to establish contact , to arrange fights and locations while the internet plays a big role .
while a lot of the chatter is made up of younger hooligans ' bravado which does n't come to much , there is evidence that internet contact does lead to actual confrontations taking place . before the violence in slovenia in march , there had been little or no large scale violence involving german hooligans on the international stage .
what , in your opinion , has been happening in that time ? the problem has never gone away .
it is obviously less of a problem that it was in the 60 's , 70 's and 80 's but it has never been eradicated .
police forces have become more skilled at preventing hooliganism at stadiums and the immediate areas around them ; monitoring entry points to cities and countries and identifying ringleaders .
but hooligans have learnt to take their fighting away from the points where control measures are most efficiently executed .
the fighting has been moved away from stadiums into railway stations , motorway service stations , even towns nowhere near those hosting matches .
surface policing -lrb- visual shows of strength , applied techniques at points of entry and stadiums -rrb- has been successful in keeping violence away from the where the game is played but only undercover operations can truly root out the core of hooligan organizations and prevent violence .
in this respect , hooliganism has continued , only not as much in the public eye . is the 2006 world cup in germany destined to be tainted by hooliganism ? in my opinion , there will be a struggle for dominance at the world cup with the germans and the english at the forefront , with the dutch and the italians also involved .
the germans are perceived as one of the most violent groups in europe , at the 1998 world cup they also most beat a french police officer to death , and they will clearly have a home advantage .
at the world cups which offered little incentive for the hooligans , there was no violence .
in the united states in 1994 , the reputation of the armed us police did much to put hooligans off and the cultural differences in 2002 -lrb- in japan / korea -rrb- meant that very few traveled .
germany , with its proximity to many countries with rival hooligan groups , will not have that luxury . bildunterschrift : nick amies interviewed prof. eric dunning send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german hooligans taint slovenian friendly a " friendly " weekend soccer match between germany and slovenia quickly turned sour as before , during and after the game , german fans participated in racist violence , prompting fears of a revival of hooliganism .
-lrb- march 28 , 2005 -rrb- police gear up for euro 2004 the european soccer championships in portugal this summer will host the largest security operation ever in the history of the game .
german , english and portuguese police are already operational in and around the country .

organizers say more effective measures and a new fan culture are the reasons .

" we are seeing ceremonies which are worryingly similar to what we saw with the burial of ayatollah khomeini , " drewermann said in an interview with afp news agency this week .
" this is not how we should be preaching christianity . " a missed opportunity ? drewermann points to the brief , one-month reign of john paul i in 1978 as a missed opportunity for the catholic church . " with him we would have had someone who followed the concilium of the vatican ii , " which set out a reformist path for the church .
" in fact -lrb- under pope john paul ii -rrb- the opposite happened . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a young man prays in front of a sculpture portraying pope john paul ii next to the basilica della madonna del rosario , in pompei , italy one of the striking images of the mourning for the late pontiff has been the reaction of young people to a man they apparently held in great affection , but drewermann , 64 , attaches little importance to this . " he was like a replacement father figure for them , someone who banned any sexual experience outside of marriage , " drewermann said .
" they did n't really listen to what he said . " failing to counter aids ? he is especially outraged by the late pope 's refusal to back the use of condoms which he says helped aids to ravage africa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many african children have lost their parents to aids " he said condoms were forbidden and yet 25 million people in africa are facing aids , " drewermann said .
" at the world population conference in cairo -lrb- in 1994 -rrb- the vatican blocked a sensible and effective birth control program , siding with the ayatollahs and the american fundamentalists . " under pope john paul ii , the catholic church turned its back on the possibility of a " spiritual opening , " drewermann said .
this , he said , prevented serious reflection on how to read and interpret the bible or , for example , how to interpret the symbols of the new testament such as the immaculate conception . a climate of psychological fear ? drewermann also alleged that the catholic church under the leadership of the late pontiff tacitly encouraged a climate of psychological fear among its followers - a popular theme of his books which have been translated into many languages . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian exorcist father gabriele nanni gives a lesson on satanism for clergy at rome 's regina apostolorum pontifical academy , in february " there were more than 30,000 exorcisms during his reign , " which shows " that there is a widespread belief that satan is within people 's souls , " he said . high hopes for the next pope the theologian also berated pope john paul ii for failing to take a more liberal stance on divorce and re-marriage and said that he " quite simply banned any discussion about the emancipation of women . " but drewermann , who now lives a reclusive life in the western german city of paderborn , without a phone , fax or computer , praises pope john paul ii 's efforts to reach out to third world countries , his opposition to the us-led invasion of iraq and his rejection of " the anti-social and harmful character of capitalism . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drewermann has high hopes for the next occupant of the papal apartment he said he fervently hopes that the next pope will seize the chance to throw open to discussion " issues that have been taboo for centuries " and allow catholics to debate freely with other christians . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans hope for progressive next pope as people in germany keep mourning john paul ii ’ s death , some politicians and church leaders have started thinking about what the next pontificate should be like .

the embattled ceo defended his leadership , but will go from the meeting with a black eye . urged on by the repeated applause of attending shareholders , representative after representative of daimlerchrysler 's biggest investors tore into the company and its embattled chief . " mr. schrempp , the past five years have been marked by mismanagement , " said klaus kaldemorgen , whose investment fund dws owns 10 percent of daimlerchrysler stock .
" shareholder patience is over . " ceo on the defensive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mercedes ' image is taking a beating the us-german company and its veteran ceo have been reeling from a series of serious setbacks that have tarnished the car company 's glowing image in the past year .
the company 's operating profit had to be revised , the smart minicar division is undergoing a 1.3 billion euro -lrb- $ 1.68 billion -rrb- restructuring program , and the company began the biggest recall of cars in its history at the beginning of april . schrempp was well prepared for an onslaught of criticism at wednesday 's meeting in berlin .
in his address , he told the gathering of 8,000 that they would have to brace for six months of bad news due to the high oil prices , a weak dollar , recall costs and restructuring program in the smart division .
but he assured them that daimlerchrysler was still performing satisfactorily . " we reached our profit goals , " said schrempp , who has headed daimlerchrysler for 10 years . brand is endangered but it wasn ’ t the profit margin so much as the disturbing tendencies in important daimlerchrysler divisions that bothered majority shareholders .
thomas meier , the fund manager at union investment , drew applause when he criticized recent developments at mercedes-benz , daimler 's most valuable division . after discovering defects in electrical components of mercedes cars built after 2001 , daimlerchrysler launched a recall of 1.3 million cars at the beginning of april . the problems halved the division 's profit margin last year from 3.1 billion to 1.67 billion euros , said meier , whose fund owns 15 million shares . " the brand mercedes-benz is endangered , " he said . smart a " declaration of bankruptcy " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two-seat minicar smart the smart division , which has yet to bring a profit since the two-seat minicar was introduced in 1998 , came in for similar criticism .
fund managers took aim at the 3.8 billion euros in losses the division has posted .
recent efforts to revive the brand by expanding the selection of models have failed and analysts say daimler has not been able to find a market for the cars . the announced 1.3 billion restructuring program , which includes staff cuts , is a " declaration of bankruptcy , " said kaldemorgen . schrempp admitted to the failings .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juergen schrempp explains the annual business report as a display illustrates the decreasing profit trend at the beginning of the annual meeting in berlin on wednesday .
" mercedes-benz quality was not upheld , and smart needs to be brought back , " he said . witholding approval so does the share price .
compared to other automotive companies and the dax index on the frankfurt stock exchange , daimlerchrysler stock performed poorly over the past year . whereas the dax was in the black , daimlerchrysler stock dropped 0.6 percent in value , continuing a downwards trend in the past five years . last year , schrempp 's management team won approval of 88.49 percent of its investors , around 10 percent less than the year before .
shareholders of companies in germany traditionally ratify management 's actions over the previous year .
an investor only rarely refuses to give management approval . but union investment has already said that it will withhold its vote of confidence at the end of the meeting .
others are looking to follow . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de daimlerchrysler management steels itself daimlerchrysler chief schrempp is likely to get more than an earful at this year 's shareholder meeting .

traditional german men are lamenting the loss of their hunter-gatherer identity and bemoaning the wilful ways of their contemporary wives , but is it really such a big deal ? apparently it is .
bookshelves across the nation are laden with a colorful array of do-it-yourself volumes on love and relationships , handy hints for dealing with wayward women and guidebooks which claim to have all the answers to making marriage work . perhaps the only surprising thing is just how much is written by men for men .
one such example is thirty-something german author jens schäfer , who recently published a book about the supposed last bastions of masculinity in an otherwise female-dominated world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are these the faces of real men ?
entitled " echte männer - ein leben im verborgenen " -lrb- real men - a secret life -rrb- , the book highlights the sad lot of the free-thinking german man , driven into darkness and despair at the hands of independently-minded women .
while it does n't pretend to be profound , the book does raise some issues about the male german psyche .
do men , for example , really harbor a desire to be captain of the domestic ship on which their first mate wives and girlfriends are to follow orders with a sweet salute ? your wish is my command ? rainer volz , a sociologist and researcher who specializes in gender issues says there are four types of men floating about in germany . " there are the traditionalists who want to turn back the process of emancipation , " he said .
" they are very insecure but hide behind their macho exterior .
then we have the modern men who do n't believe in competing with women , and who are genuinely happy to help with the kids and housework . " " it 's worth belonging to that group , because they are genuinely the happiest , " he added . then there are the 60 percent of german men who fall somewhere between the two stools , according to volz . " uncertain men are the ones who ca n't decide if tradition should outweigh modernity or vice versa , while pragmatic men say that women should go out to work , but really believe it would be better if they did n't bother . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : safety in numbers ?
so just how much resonance do books like schäfer 's , which look at the dying breed of " real men " - albeit with a degree of humor - have with the country 's male population ? " there has long been a debate on what should become of the classic male territory now that women are world soccer champions and drink beer from the bottle , " a spokeswoman for schäfer 's publisher , piper , said . " the issue is that men no longer always know who or how they are supposed to be , " she said . new norms uwe lohsa , psychotherapist who offers advice to men struggling to keep afloat in the modern world , says the situation in germany is in a state of flux . " the old norms are no longer acceptable and men are faced with the conflict of having to be softees at home and competitive men in the working world .
and that poses huge difficulties to some of them , " lohsa said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women in germany can stay home until their babies outgrow babyhood but the reality is that in the working world at least , men still rule the roost .
a recent study conducted by the federal statistics office shows that women are still under-represented in managerial positions , holding just 33 percent of the country 's top posts .
in addition , it is still widely regarded as acceptable in germany for women to take an extremely long maternity leave .
employers are bound by law to hold a new mother 's job for three years , and many women take full advantage of the generous offer . getting over it so if it is not the working world which is proving too much for the traditional man , what is ?
according to volz , it 's the challenge of defining new male role models , and the quandary of choosing among them . " there are some men who have already rejected the old image of the way a man should be , but then there are others who are hanging on bitterly , " said volz .
" thirty years ago there was only one model of a man , the traditional man .
but that is over once and for all . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the next generation of modern men ?
rather than a crisis-inducer , both he and lohsa see gender equality as a great opportunity for modern men to shrug off some of the responsibilities they have been carting around with them since their dawning day - the pressures of being the sole breadwinner , for example . in order to take advantage of such modern perks though , german men first need to get beyond their own insecurities . tamsin walker , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de it 's not a man 's world despite the german government 's efforts to make paternity leave an attractive option , men are working as much as ever .

" we are seeing ceremonies which are worryingly similar to what we saw with the burial of ayatollah khomeini , " drewermann said in an interview with afp news agency this week .
" this is not how we should be preaching christianity . " a missed opportunity ? drewermann points to the brief , one-month reign of john paul i in 1978 as a missed opportunity for the catholic church . " with him we would have had someone who followed the concilium of the vatican ii , " which set out a reformist path for the church .
" in fact -lrb- under pope john paul ii -rrb- the opposite happened . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a young man prays in front of a sculpture portraying pope john paul ii next to the basilica della madonna del rosario , in pompei , italy one of the striking images of the mourning for the late pontiff has been the reaction of young people to a man they apparently held in great affection , but drewermann , 64 , attaches little importance to this . " he was like a replacement father figure for them , someone who banned any sexual experience outside of marriage , " drewermann said .
" they did n't really listen to what he said . " failing to counter aids ? he is especially outraged by the late pope 's refusal to back the use of condoms which he says helped aids to ravage africa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many african children have lost their parents to aids " he said condoms were forbidden and yet 25 million people in africa are facing aids , " drewermann said .
" at the world population conference in cairo -lrb- in 1994 -rrb- the vatican blocked a sensible and effective birth control program , siding with the ayatollahs and the american fundamentalists . " under pope john paul ii , the catholic church turned its back on the possibility of a " spiritual opening , " drewermann said .
this , he said , prevented serious reflection on how to read and interpret the bible or , for example , how to interpret the symbols of the new testament such as the immaculate conception . a climate of psychological fear ? drewermann also alleged that the catholic church under the leadership of the late pontiff tacitly encouraged a climate of psychological fear among its followers - a popular theme of his books which have been translated into many languages . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian exorcist father gabriele nanni gives a lesson on satanism for clergy at rome 's regina apostolorum pontifical academy , in february " there were more than 30,000 exorcisms during his reign , " which shows " that there is a widespread belief that satan is within people 's souls , " he said . high hopes for the next pope the theologian also berated pope john paul ii for failing to take a more liberal stance on divorce and re-marriage and said that he " quite simply banned any discussion about the emancipation of women . " but drewermann , who now lives a reclusive life in the western german city of paderborn , without a phone , fax or computer , praises pope john paul ii 's efforts to reach out to third world countries , his opposition to the us-led invasion of iraq and his rejection of " the anti-social and harmful character of capitalism . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drewermann has high hopes for the next occupant of the papal apartment he said he fervently hopes that the next pope will seize the chance to throw open to discussion " issues that have been taboo for centuries " and allow catholics to debate freely with other christians . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans hope for progressive next pope as people in germany keep mourning john paul ii ’ s death , some politicians and church leaders have started thinking about what the next pontificate should be like .

the embattled ceo defended his leadership , but will go from the meeting with a black eye . urged on by the repeated applause of attending shareholders , representative after representative of daimlerchrysler 's biggest investors tore into the company and its embattled chief . " mr. schrempp , the past five years have been marked by mismanagement , " said klaus kaldemorgen , whose investment fund dws owns 10 percent of daimlerchrysler stock .
" shareholder patience is over . " ceo on the defensive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mercedes ' image is taking a beating the us-german company and its veteran ceo have been reeling from a series of serious setbacks that have tarnished the car company 's glowing image in the past year .
the company 's operating profit had to be revised , the smart minicar division is undergoing a 1.3 billion euro -lrb- $ 1.68 billion -rrb- restructuring program , and the company began the biggest recall of cars in its history at the beginning of april . schrempp was well prepared for an onslaught of criticism at wednesday 's meeting in berlin .
in his address , he told the gathering of 8,000 that they would have to brace for six months of bad news due to the high oil prices , a weak dollar , recall costs and restructuring program in the smart division .
but he assured them that daimlerchrysler was still performing satisfactorily . " we reached our profit goals , " said schrempp , who has headed daimlerchrysler for 10 years . brand is endangered but it wasn ’ t the profit margin so much as the disturbing tendencies in important daimlerchrysler divisions that bothered majority shareholders .
thomas meier , the fund manager at union investment , drew applause when he criticized recent developments at mercedes-benz , daimler 's most valuable division . after discovering defects in electrical components of mercedes cars built after 2001 , daimlerchrysler launched a recall of 1.3 million cars at the beginning of april . the problems halved the division 's profit margin last year from 3.1 billion to 1.67 billion euros , said meier , whose fund owns 15 million shares . " the brand mercedes-benz is endangered , " he said . smart a " declaration of bankruptcy " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two-seat minicar smart the smart division , which has yet to bring a profit since the two-seat minicar was introduced in 1998 , came in for similar criticism .
fund managers took aim at the 3.8 billion euros in losses the division has posted .
recent efforts to revive the brand by expanding the selection of models have failed and analysts say daimler has not been able to find a market for the cars . the announced 1.3 billion restructuring program , which includes staff cuts , is a " declaration of bankruptcy , " said kaldemorgen . schrempp admitted to the failings .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juergen schrempp explains the annual business report as a display illustrates the decreasing profit trend at the beginning of the annual meeting in berlin on wednesday .
" mercedes-benz quality was not upheld , and smart needs to be brought back , " he said . witholding approval so does the share price .
compared to other automotive companies and the dax index on the frankfurt stock exchange , daimlerchrysler stock performed poorly over the past year . whereas the dax was in the black , daimlerchrysler stock dropped 0.6 percent in value , continuing a downwards trend in the past five years . last year , schrempp 's management team won approval of 88.49 percent of its investors , around 10 percent less than the year before .
shareholders of companies in germany traditionally ratify management 's actions over the previous year .
an investor only rarely refuses to give management approval . but union investment has already said that it will withhold its vote of confidence at the end of the meeting .

our readers shared their views on the topics . un reform reform is definitely needed .
the security council must be expanded and the veto power abolished .
consensus within the security council is very important .
i strongly support a seat on the security council for germany .
rotating seats on the council are a good idea .
my suggestion is the formation of an advisory council from the remaining members of the general assembly capable of reviewing issues and calling the general assembly to action on specific issues .
this council and the general assembly should be able to join with the security council on specific issues and disputes . - thomas clark bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of the united nations general assembly the un will not be as effective as it wishes to be , because a strong country can by-pass un resolutions more easily than one with less impact , but the more countries have some say , the better for the world .
veto power should be scratched ! - elisabeth heptner as the world seems to be moving in a more global direction , i think the concept of the security council is a bit out of date - not to mention counter-productive , with respect to the veto powers .
better still would be a strengthened general assembly , of which germany is already a member , that uses a two thirds majority ruling .
in this way it puts the voice in the hands of the world community instead of the hands of a privileged few . - andy sporner , us citizen in germany queen camilla hell no ! no way . not only should she be kept away from the title of queen , but i am furious that she is being given the title of her royal highness after the wedding .
diana was stripped of her rightful title hrh by a mean spirited and spiteful queen .
how dare camilla be given the hrh title by this same monarch , when the mother of the future king of england was demoted in the royal ranks . - susan belcher , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : camilla should definitely not be queen .
it 's bad enough that she is being given the accolade of marrying charles after the hurt and anguish that she caused diana , -lrb- who had a very unhappy life due to camilla -rrb- .
camilla should have bowed out and let them get on with it but no she did n't , she made diana and the boys ' lives miserable .
even on the day they married she was there with cufflinks with entwined c 's for charles and camilla .
diana was aware of this and it did n't give her and charles a chance to make a go of their marriage . - mrs robinson absolutely .
the entire world does what they want to .
charles has lived doing what is expected of him instead of what his heart tells him .
it 's time to leave him alone and let him find true happiness and let his wife become queen if and when charles becomes king .
we as human beings are not owned by other human beings . - marla and paul anderson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany welcomes annan 's call for action kofi annan 's ambitious reform plans for the united nations have met with a largely positive response in europe .
germany feels it 's inched closer to reaching its goal of a permanent seat on the un security council .
-lrb- march 22 , 2005 -rrb- queen camilla ?
no , thank you two weeks before their wedding , britain 's prince charles and bride-to-be camilla parker bowles have received some bad news .
a survey revealed that the vast majority of britons do n't want camilla to become queen .

our readers shared their views on the topics . un reform reform is definitely needed .
the security council must be expanded and the veto power abolished .
consensus within the security council is very important .
i strongly support a seat on the security council for germany .
rotating seats on the council are a good idea .
my suggestion is the formation of an advisory council from the remaining members of the general assembly capable of reviewing issues and calling the general assembly to action on specific issues .
this council and the general assembly should be able to join with the security council on specific issues and disputes . - thomas clark bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of the united nations general assembly the un will not be as effective as it wishes to be , because a strong country can by-pass un resolutions more easily than one with less impact , but the more countries have some say , the better for the world .
veto power should be scratched ! - elisabeth heptner as the world seems to be moving in a more global direction , i think the concept of the security council is a bit out of date - not to mention counter-productive , with respect to the veto powers .
better still would be a strengthened general assembly , of which germany is already a member , that uses a two thirds majority ruling .
in this way it puts the voice in the hands of the world community instead of the hands of a privileged few . - andy sporner , us citizen in germany queen camilla hell no ! no way . not only should she be kept away from the title of queen , but i am furious that she is being given the title of her royal highness after the wedding .
diana was stripped of her rightful title hrh by a mean spirited and spiteful queen .

it 's bad enough that she is being given the accolade of marrying charles after the hurt and anguish that she caused diana , -lrb- who had a very unhappy life due to camilla -rrb- .
camilla should have bowed out and let them get on with it but no she did n't , she made diana and the boys ' lives miserable .
even on the day they married she was there with cufflinks with entwined c 's for charles and camilla .
diana was aware of this and it did n't give her and charles a chance to make a go of their marriage . - mrs robinson absolutely .
the entire world does what they want to .
charles has lived doing what is expected of him instead of what his heart tells him .
it 's time to leave him alone and let him find true happiness and let his wife become queen if and when charles becomes king .
we as human beings are not owned by other human beings . - marla and paul anderson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany welcomes annan 's call for action kofi annan 's ambitious reform plans for the united nations have met with a largely positive response in europe .
germany feels it 's inched closer to reaching its goal of a permanent seat on the un security council .

" the brand mercedes-benz is endangered , " he said . smart a " declaration of bankruptcy " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two-seat minicar smart the smart division , which has yet to bring a profit since the two-seat minicar was introduced in 1998 , came in for similar criticism .
fund managers took aim at the 3.8 billion euros in losses the division has posted .
recent efforts to revive the brand by expanding the selection of models have failed and analysts say daimler has not been able to find a market for the cars . the announced 1.3 billion restructuring program , which includes staff cuts , is a " declaration of bankruptcy , " said kaldemorgen . schrempp admitted to the failings .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juergen schrempp explains the annual business report as a display illustrates the decreasing profit trend at the beginning of the annual meeting in berlin on wednesday .
" mercedes-benz quality was not upheld , and smart needs to be brought back , " he said . witholding approval so does the share price .
compared to other automotive companies and the dax index on the frankfurt stock exchange , daimlerchrysler stock performed poorly over the past year . whereas the dax was in the black , daimlerchrysler stock dropped 0.6 percent in value , continuing a downwards trend in the past five years . last year , schrempp 's management team won approval of 88.49 percent of its investors , around 10 percent less than the year before .
shareholders of companies in germany traditionally ratify management 's actions over the previous year .
an investor only rarely refuses to give management approval . but union investment has already said that it will withhold its vote of confidence at the end of the meeting .

the service focused on the late pope 's achievements on the world stage . some 1,000 crowded into the cathedral , where the head of the german bishops ' conference , cardinal karl lehmann , praised the pope as an ambassador for peace and justice .
many in the basilica carried flowers or wore images of the deceased leader of the roman catholic church .
many were crying , the solemn ceremony was attended by high-ranking figures from german politics , including chancellor gerhard schröder , opposition leaders angela merkel and guido westerwelle , several cabinet members and former chancellor helmut kohl . bildunterschrift : german parliamentary president wolfgang thierse , doris schröder-köpf , chancellor gerhard schröder , dieter althaus , prime minister of german state of thuringia , health minister ulla schmidt and former chancellor helmut kohl , from left , attend a service in st. john 's basilica in berlin in memory of john paul ii . lehmann , who is considered a fairly liberal cardinal , admitted that the message of john paul ii , a man with conservative positions of many moral questions , was controversial to many germans . regarding critics ' view that the pope was too authoritarian , lehmann said the polish-born john paul came from a background , namely a dictatorship , which required that the church have " unity and discipline " in order to survive . " for us children of a pluralistic society which often leans toward individualism , it was not an easy message , " he said . focus on positive but lehmann focused primarily on john paul ii 's role in poland 's - and by extension , eastern europe 's - journey from communism to democracy .
he also touched on the pope 's critical stance on the development of modern capitalist societies and the holy father 's work on behalf of the weaker members of society . " john paul ii taught us that when we start thinking only about our own well-being while letting the fate of others out of sight , the freedom of all is at stake , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a large picture of john paul ii stood near the altar .
the basilica was decorated with flowers and incense wafted among the crowd .
strains from the requiem of heinrich ignaz franz von biber , written in the 17th century , filled the cavernous space . anti-war pope wolfgang thierse , parliamentary speaker and a catholic himself , told reporters shortly before the ceremony that he admired the pope particularly for his rejection of war . " the pontiff ’ s efforts to promote peace and understanding are really unparalleled , " he said .
" he ’ ll also be remembered as a man who sought constructive dialogue with other religions , and he stood for reconciliation with the jews and muslims .

however , last week , albert assumed his father 's duties when hopes that rainier would recover faded . glamour quotient rainier came to the throne in the tiny mediterranean territory in 1949 , three years before britain 's queen elizabeth ii succeeded her father . after years as a jet-setting playboy , he boosted the glamour quotient of his little state when he married kelly in 1956 .
she died in a car crash in the principality in 1982 . monaco was founded when rainier 's grimaldi dynasty took control of the principality in 1297 .
the family was deposed after the french revolution when monaco was united with france , but restored by treaty in 1861 . the principality has a population of around 32,000 , many of them ultra-rich residents enjoying its tax-haven benefits .
much of its image and financial success of the second-smallest state in europe after the holy see has been credited to prince rainier , who oversaw building projects , brought in the formula one motor race , and fostered monaco 's reputation as an exclusive playground for the rich and famous . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de monaco 's prince albert assumes duties monaco 's prince albert is assuming the duties of his father , prince rainier , who is in intensive care in hospital , the palace announced thursday .

our readers shared their views on the topics . un reform reform is definitely needed .
the security council must be expanded and the veto power abolished .
consensus within the security council is very important .
i strongly support a seat on the security council for germany .
rotating seats on the council are a good idea .
my suggestion is the formation of an advisory council from the remaining members of the general assembly capable of reviewing issues and calling the general assembly to action on specific issues .
this council and the general assembly should be able to join with the security council on specific issues and disputes . - thomas clark bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of the united nations general assembly the un will not be as effective as it wishes to be , because a strong country can by-pass un resolutions more easily than one with less impact , but the more countries have some say , the better for the world .
veto power should be scratched ! - elisabeth heptner as the world seems to be moving in a more global direction , i think the concept of the security council is a bit out of date - not to mention counter-productive , with respect to the veto powers .
better still would be a strengthened general assembly , of which germany is already a member , that uses a two thirds majority ruling .
in this way it puts the voice in the hands of the world community instead of the hands of a privileged few . - andy sporner , us citizen in germany queen camilla hell no ! no way . not only should she be kept away from the title of queen , but i am furious that she is being given the title of her royal highness after the wedding .
diana was stripped of her rightful title hrh by a mean spirited and spiteful queen .
how dare camilla be given the hrh title by this same monarch , when the mother of the future king of england was demoted in the royal ranks . - susan belcher , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : camilla should definitely not be queen .
it 's bad enough that she is being given the accolade of marrying charles after the hurt and anguish that she caused diana , -lrb- who had a very unhappy life due to camilla -rrb- .
camilla should have bowed out and let them get on with it but no she did n't , she made diana and the boys ' lives miserable .
even on the day they married she was there with cufflinks with entwined c 's for charles and camilla .
diana was aware of this and it did n't give her and charles a chance to make a go of their marriage . - mrs robinson absolutely .
the entire world does what they want to .
charles has lived doing what is expected of him instead of what his heart tells him .
it 's time to leave him alone and let him find true happiness and let his wife become queen if and when charles becomes king .
we as human beings are not owned by other human beings . - marla and paul anderson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany welcomes annan 's call for action kofi annan 's ambitious reform plans for the united nations have met with a largely positive response in europe .
germany feels it 's inched closer to reaching its goal of a permanent seat on the un security council .
-lrb- march 22 , 2005 -rrb- queen camilla ?
no , thank you two weeks before their wedding , britain 's prince charles and bride-to-be camilla parker bowles have received some bad news .
a survey revealed that the vast majority of britons do n't want camilla to become queen .

german hooligans could be at the forefront of a " struggle for dominance " at the 2006 world cup , according to hooliganism expert professor eric dunning in an interview with dw-world . dw-world : how are german hooligan groups structured ? prof. dunning : those in the former east germany in particular have a neo-nazi core where the task of the organization is more a political one .
the political center of the group can have an agenda other than the one supported by the outer circle which could be along the lines of purely football rivalry .
german hooligan groups with neo-nazi influences within them may have a xenophobic or national pride aspect to their actions which forms a catalyst .
other hooligans may then get swept up in that and fight for what they see as team or national allegiance .
in terms of football violence , the germans are like many other hooligans in so much as some of the violence may be opportunist , spontaneous outbreaks while others can be meticulously organized .
some clashes can be politically motivated while others can be just for the pure adrenalin rush of fighting , something many hooligans have professed to being addictive , calling the buzz " better than sex and drugs . " as with many sophisticated hooligan elements in the modern game , especially within europe , german hooligans use technology in their organization .
mobile phones are used to establish contact , to arrange fights and locations while the internet plays a big role .
while a lot of the chatter is made up of younger hooligans ' bravado which does n't come to much , there is evidence that internet contact does lead to actual confrontations taking place . before the violence in slovenia in march , there had been little or no large scale violence involving german hooligans on the international stage .
what , in your opinion , has been happening in that time ? the problem has never gone away .
it is obviously less of a problem that it was in the 60 's , 70 's and 80 's but it has never been eradicated .
police forces have become more skilled at preventing hooliganism at stadiums and the immediate areas around them ; monitoring entry points to cities and countries and identifying ringleaders .
but hooligans have learnt to take their fighting away from the points where control measures are most efficiently executed .

surface policing -lrb- visual shows of strength , applied techniques at points of entry and stadiums -rrb- has been successful in keeping violence away from the where the game is played but only undercover operations can truly root out the core of hooligan organizations and prevent violence .

the germans are perceived as one of the most violent groups in europe , at the 1998 world cup they also most beat a french police officer to death , and they will clearly have a home advantage .

"
catholics could hear these words as early as april 18 , as the cardinals will begin the highly regulated process of electing a new pontiff on that day . the so-called conclave will choose john paul ii 's successor .
it is made up of cardinals that have not yet turned 80 - there are currently 117 of them . while the cardinals already have a chance to discuss candidates since many of them arrived in rome ahead of the late pope 's funeral , the actual election can not begin any earlier than 15 days after john paul ii 's death nor later than 20 days after his passing .
vatican officials announced wednesday that cardinals have chosen april 18 as the day to begin deliberations . the late pope 's will will be published on thursday . simple requirements theoretically , there 's a huge number of people who qualify for the job of pontiff . " every catholic man , who fulfills the requirements to become a bishop or priest , can become pope , " said alfred hierold , a professor for church law at bamberg university . while the " servant of the servants of god " could therefore be a layman , he would quickly have to be made bishop as the pope is also always the bishop of rome .
that problem has n't arisen for centuries , however : since 1378 , every pope has been a cardinal before his election . gathering in rome , cardinals will stay at " domus sanctae marthae , " a spartan guest house behind st. peter 's cathedral in vatican city . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reporters stand in one of the cells in which the cardinals slept during the last 1978 conclave " the rooms have a metal bed , a large desk , a chair , a small bathroom and stone floors , " said hierold , who has stayed there himself . complete reclusion on the first day of the conclave , cardinals celebrate a special mass called " pro eligendo papa , " or " for the election of the pope . "
traditionally , they then retreat to the vatican 's sistine chapel to begin their deliberations .
however , this time the cardinals will not be confined to the chapel .
they 'll be permitted to roam about within the walls of the vatican , though they will still be banned from contact with the outside world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vatican 's sistine chapel with the " last judgement " fresco on the wall at the end " if a cardinal brings along his mobile phone , there 's nothing that can be done , " hierold said , adding that the ballot box is placed underneath michelangelo 's famous " last judgement " fresco .
" but it 's not allowed . " the chapel is even checked for listening devices and cardinals as well any support staff have to swear that they will remain silent about anything that takes place within and that they will not be influenced by others in their decision . bribes and intrigues there 's good reason for that as bribing and intrigues were not uncommon at previous papal elections .
until 1903 , european monarchs also played a role in electing the leader of the catholic church . the cardinals keep meeting until they have agreed on a new pope .
the longest conclave lasted three years .
in order to be elected pope , a candidate has to receive two thirds of the votes .
should he not receive them right away , four rounds of votes are cast each day , separated by prayers .
the first break will take place if a new pontiff has not been elected after three days . should cardinals fail to agree after 34 voting rounds , they can decide to elect a pope by majority . dark smoke , white smoke smoke is used to announce the result of each vote as the ballots are burned each time .
if the vote has been unsuccessful , wet straw is added to the fire , causing dark smoke to rise above the chapel .
once a pope has been chosen , dry straw is added and white smoke signals the beginning of a new pontificate .
i in addition to white smoke , the faithful will this time also hear the ringing of the bells of st peter 's cathedral to announce a decision . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinals congregated for the first day in the bologna hall at the vatican on monday inside , cardinals acknowledge their new supreme leader as well .
everyone except the new pontiff folds up the little canopy above his seat .
the new pope is then asked what name he chooses and officially becomes pope once a document has been drawn up that certifies his election . john paul ii 's successor will then put on the white papal clothes and accept a pledge of allegiance by the other cardinals .

german hooligans could be at the forefront of a " struggle for dominance " at the 2006 world cup , according to hooliganism expert professor eric dunning in an interview with dw-world . dw-world : how are german hooligan groups structured ? prof. dunning : those in the former east germany in particular have a neo-nazi core where the task of the organization is more a political one .
the political center of the group can have an agenda other than the one supported by the outer circle which could be along the lines of purely football rivalry .
german hooligan groups with neo-nazi influences within them may have a xenophobic or national pride aspect to their actions which forms a catalyst .
other hooligans may then get swept up in that and fight for what they see as team or national allegiance .
in terms of football violence , the germans are like many other hooligans in so much as some of the violence may be opportunist , spontaneous outbreaks while others can be meticulously organized .
some clashes can be politically motivated while others can be just for the pure adrenalin rush of fighting , something many hooligans have professed to being addictive , calling the buzz " better than sex and drugs . " as with many sophisticated hooligan elements in the modern game , especially within europe , german hooligans use technology in their organization .
mobile phones are used to establish contact , to arrange fights and locations while the internet plays a big role .
while a lot of the chatter is made up of younger hooligans ' bravado which does n't come to much , there is evidence that internet contact does lead to actual confrontations taking place . before the violence in slovenia in march , there had been little or no large scale violence involving german hooligans on the international stage .
what , in your opinion , has been happening in that time ? the problem has never gone away .
it is obviously less of a problem that it was in the 60 's , 70 's and 80 's but it has never been eradicated .
police forces have become more skilled at preventing hooliganism at stadiums and the immediate areas around them ; monitoring entry points to cities and countries and identifying ringleaders .
but hooligans have learnt to take their fighting away from the points where control measures are most efficiently executed .
the fighting has been moved away from stadiums into railway stations , motorway service stations , even towns nowhere near those hosting matches .
surface policing -lrb- visual shows of strength , applied techniques at points of entry and stadiums -rrb- has been successful in keeping violence away from the where the game is played but only undercover operations can truly root out the core of hooligan organizations and prevent violence .
in this respect , hooliganism has continued , only not as much in the public eye . is the 2006 world cup in germany destined to be tainted by hooliganism ? in my opinion , there will be a struggle for dominance at the world cup with the germans and the english at the forefront , with the dutch and the italians also involved .
the germans are perceived as one of the most violent groups in europe , at the 1998 world cup they also most beat a french police officer to death , and they will clearly have a home advantage .
at the world cups which offered little incentive for the hooligans , there was no violence .
in the united states in 1994 , the reputation of the armed us police did much to put hooligans off and the cultural differences in 2002 -lrb- in japan / korea -rrb- meant that very few traveled .

traditional german men are lamenting the loss of their hunter-gatherer identity and bemoaning the wilful ways of their contemporary wives , but is it really such a big deal ? apparently it is .
bookshelves across the nation are laden with a colorful array of do-it-yourself volumes on love and relationships , handy hints for dealing with wayward women and guidebooks which claim to have all the answers to making marriage work . perhaps the only surprising thing is just how much is written by men for men .
one such example is thirty-something german author jens schäfer , who recently published a book about the supposed last bastions of masculinity in an otherwise female-dominated world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are these the faces of real men ?
entitled " echte männer - ein leben im verborgenen " -lrb- real men - a secret life -rrb- , the book highlights the sad lot of the free-thinking german man , driven into darkness and despair at the hands of independently-minded women .
while it does n't pretend to be profound , the book does raise some issues about the male german psyche .
do men , for example , really harbor a desire to be captain of the domestic ship on which their first mate wives and girlfriends are to follow orders with a sweet salute ? your wish is my command ? rainer volz , a sociologist and researcher who specializes in gender issues says there are four types of men floating about in germany . " there are the traditionalists who want to turn back the process of emancipation , " he said .
" they are very insecure but hide behind their macho exterior .
then we have the modern men who do n't believe in competing with women , and who are genuinely happy to help with the kids and housework . " " it 's worth belonging to that group , because they are genuinely the happiest , " he added . then there are the 60 percent of german men who fall somewhere between the two stools , according to volz . " uncertain men are the ones who ca n't decide if tradition should outweigh modernity or vice versa , while pragmatic men say that women should go out to work , but really believe it would be better if they did n't bother . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : safety in numbers ?
so just how much resonance do books like schäfer 's , which look at the dying breed of " real men " - albeit with a degree of humor - have with the country 's male population ? " there has long been a debate on what should become of the classic male territory now that women are world soccer champions and drink beer from the bottle , " a spokeswoman for schäfer 's publisher , piper , said . " the issue is that men no longer always know who or how they are supposed to be , " she said . new norms uwe lohsa , psychotherapist who offers advice to men struggling to keep afloat in the modern world , says the situation in germany is in a state of flux . " the old norms are no longer acceptable and men are faced with the conflict of having to be softees at home and competitive men in the working world .
and that poses huge difficulties to some of them , " lohsa said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women in germany can stay home until their babies outgrow babyhood but the reality is that in the working world at least , men still rule the roost .
a recent study conducted by the federal statistics office shows that women are still under-represented in managerial positions , holding just 33 percent of the country 's top posts .
in addition , it is still widely regarded as acceptable in germany for women to take an extremely long maternity leave .
employers are bound by law to hold a new mother 's job for three years , and many women take full advantage of the generous offer . getting over it so if it is not the working world which is proving too much for the traditional man , what is ?
according to volz , it 's the challenge of defining new male role models , and the quandary of choosing among them . " there are some men who have already rejected the old image of the way a man should be , but then there are others who are hanging on bitterly , " said volz .
" thirty years ago there was only one model of a man , the traditional man .
but that is over once and for all . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the next generation of modern men ?
rather than a crisis-inducer , both he and lohsa see gender equality as a great opportunity for modern men to shrug off some of the responsibilities they have been carting around with them since their dawning day - the pressures of being the sole breadwinner , for example . in order to take advantage of such modern perks though , german men first need to get beyond their own insecurities . tamsin walker , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de it 's not a man 's world despite the german government 's efforts to make paternity leave an attractive option , men are working as much as ever .

traditional german men are lamenting the loss of their hunter-gatherer identity and bemoaning the wilful ways of their contemporary wives , but is it really such a big deal ? apparently it is .
bookshelves across the nation are laden with a colorful array of do-it-yourself volumes on love and relationships , handy hints for dealing with wayward women and guidebooks which claim to have all the answers to making marriage work . perhaps the only surprising thing is just how much is written by men for men .
one such example is thirty-something german author jens schäfer , who recently published a book about the supposed last bastions of masculinity in an otherwise female-dominated world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are these the faces of real men ?
entitled " echte männer - ein leben im verborgenen " -lrb- real men - a secret life -rrb- , the book highlights the sad lot of the free-thinking german man , driven into darkness and despair at the hands of independently-minded women .
while it does n't pretend to be profound , the book does raise some issues about the male german psyche .
do men , for example , really harbor a desire to be captain of the domestic ship on which their first mate wives and girlfriends are to follow orders with a sweet salute ? your wish is my command ? rainer volz , a sociologist and researcher who specializes in gender issues says there are four types of men floating about in germany . " there are the traditionalists who want to turn back the process of emancipation , " he said .
" they are very insecure but hide behind their macho exterior .
then we have the modern men who do n't believe in competing with women , and who are genuinely happy to help with the kids and housework . " " it 's worth belonging to that group , because they are genuinely the happiest , " he added . then there are the 60 percent of german men who fall somewhere between the two stools , according to volz . " uncertain men are the ones who ca n't decide if tradition should outweigh modernity or vice versa , while pragmatic men say that women should go out to work , but really believe it would be better if they did n't bother . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : safety in numbers ?
so just how much resonance do books like schäfer 's , which look at the dying breed of " real men " - albeit with a degree of humor - have with the country 's male population ? " there has long been a debate on what should become of the classic male territory now that women are world soccer champions and drink beer from the bottle , " a spokeswoman for schäfer 's publisher , piper , said . " the issue is that men no longer always know who or how they are supposed to be , " she said . new norms uwe lohsa , psychotherapist who offers advice to men struggling to keep afloat in the modern world , says the situation in germany is in a state of flux . " the old norms are no longer acceptable and men are faced with the conflict of having to be softees at home and competitive men in the working world .
and that poses huge difficulties to some of them , " lohsa said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women in germany can stay home until their babies outgrow babyhood but the reality is that in the working world at least , men still rule the roost .
a recent study conducted by the federal statistics office shows that women are still under-represented in managerial positions , holding just 33 percent of the country 's top posts .
in addition , it is still widely regarded as acceptable in germany for women to take an extremely long maternity leave .
employers are bound by law to hold a new mother 's job for three years , and many women take full advantage of the generous offer . getting over it so if it is not the working world which is proving too much for the traditional man , what is ?
according to volz , it 's the challenge of defining new male role models , and the quandary of choosing among them . " there are some men who have already rejected the old image of the way a man should be , but then there are others who are hanging on bitterly , " said volz .
" thirty years ago there was only one model of a man , the traditional man .
but that is over once and for all . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the next generation of modern men ?
rather than a crisis-inducer , both he and lohsa see gender equality as a great opportunity for modern men to shrug off some of the responsibilities they have been carting around with them since their dawning day - the pressures of being the sole breadwinner , for example . in order to take advantage of such modern perks though , german men first need to get beyond their own insecurities . tamsin walker , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de it 's not a man 's world despite the german government 's efforts to make paternity leave an attractive option , men are working as much as ever .
so what 's stopping them opting for stay-at-home fatherhood ?

one year before the big event in germany , analysts are already wondering just what the tournament can do for the economy . the way german soccer legend and world cup chief franz beckenbauer sees it , next year 's tournament has already resulted in one winner : german companies . " our economics minister estimated the economic advantages -lrb- brought by the tournament -rrb- at 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 12.8 billion -rrb- - and that 's only the economic part , " said beckenbauer -lrb- photo -rrb- .
" every participant will profit from a boost in image . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz beckenbauer , head of the world cup organizing committee postbank chief economist marco bargel is a bit more exact .
according to his figures , more than 6 billion euros have already been invested in upgrading and expanding infrastructure , the stadiums , and hotels and restaurants .
the demand for goods and services ahead of and during the world cup will bring in " two to three billion euros , " he said . reaping benefits years after in all , say experts , hosting the world cup will mean a growth of 0.5 percent in germany 's gross domestic product - welcome news at a time when the economy is sputtering .
the country has seen this before .
the 1972 olympics speeded up development in host city munich and the rest of germany " between 12 and 15 years , " said holger preuss , a sports economist at the university of mainz . the transit system , road projects and other infrastructure developed for the olympics also set munich on the road of transformation from a sleepy alpine city to a modern metropolis . demand for sporting goods - and security " they were able to take the investment needed for hosting an olympics and produce an increase in development , " preuss said . the german economy will benefit the most from the world cup in the early months of 2006 , before the tournament actually starts .
but the postbank analysis also projects some gains for the overall economic growth during the tournament as well .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soccer fans will be bringing plenty of spending cash with them electronics and sporting goods stores and companies will benefit from soccer fans ' spending sprees .
and if the athens olympics last august was any example , security services companies , as well , can expect a jump in business . tourists could bring in one billion euros though there is still a year to go before the referee whistles the start of the first match , germany 's tourism sector is already getting warmed up .
not only the 12 cities that will host matches - from hamburg to hanover to munich - but other german regions are also readying themselves for a storm of tourists .
organizers expect more than one million visitors - and lucrative times ahead . each visitor spends between 800 and 1,000 euros for a five-day visit according to rough estimates , said bargel .
" that means foreign visitors will bring in up to a billion euros , " he said . klaus feldkeller -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's rails , roads world cup ready when millions of soccer fans descend on germany in 2006 , the country 's railways and roads will be ready for them , government officials said this week .

our readers shared their views on the topics . un reform reform is definitely needed .
the security council must be expanded and the veto power abolished .
consensus within the security council is very important .
i strongly support a seat on the security council for germany .
rotating seats on the council are a good idea .
my suggestion is the formation of an advisory council from the remaining members of the general assembly capable of reviewing issues and calling the general assembly to action on specific issues .
this council and the general assembly should be able to join with the security council on specific issues and disputes . - thomas clark bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of the united nations general assembly the un will not be as effective as it wishes to be , because a strong country can by-pass un resolutions more easily than one with less impact , but the more countries have some say , the better for the world .
veto power should be scratched ! - elisabeth heptner as the world seems to be moving in a more global direction , i think the concept of the security council is a bit out of date - not to mention counter-productive , with respect to the veto powers .
better still would be a strengthened general assembly , of which germany is already a member , that uses a two thirds majority ruling .
in this way it puts the voice in the hands of the world community instead of the hands of a privileged few . - andy sporner , us citizen in germany queen camilla hell no ! no way . not only should she be kept away from the title of queen , but i am furious that she is being given the title of her royal highness after the wedding .
diana was stripped of her rightful title hrh by a mean spirited and spiteful queen .

it 's bad enough that she is being given the accolade of marrying charles after the hurt and anguish that she caused diana , -lrb- who had a very unhappy life due to camilla -rrb- .
camilla should have bowed out and let them get on with it but no she did n't , she made diana and the boys ' lives miserable .
even on the day they married she was there with cufflinks with entwined c 's for charles and camilla .
diana was aware of this and it did n't give her and charles a chance to make a go of their marriage . - mrs robinson absolutely .
the entire world does what they want to .
charles has lived doing what is expected of him instead of what his heart tells him .
it 's time to leave him alone and let him find true happiness and let his wife become queen if and when charles becomes king .
we as human beings are not owned by other human beings . - marla and paul anderson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany welcomes annan 's call for action kofi annan 's ambitious reform plans for the united nations have met with a largely positive response in europe .
germany feels it 's inched closer to reaching its goal of a permanent seat on the un security council .

traditional german men are lamenting the loss of their hunter-gatherer identity and bemoaning the wilful ways of their contemporary wives , but is it really such a big deal ? apparently it is .
bookshelves across the nation are laden with a colorful array of do-it-yourself volumes on love and relationships , handy hints for dealing with wayward women and guidebooks which claim to have all the answers to making marriage work . perhaps the only surprising thing is just how much is written by men for men .
one such example is thirty-something german author jens schäfer , who recently published a book about the supposed last bastions of masculinity in an otherwise female-dominated world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are these the faces of real men ?
entitled " echte männer - ein leben im verborgenen " -lrb- real men - a secret life -rrb- , the book highlights the sad lot of the free-thinking german man , driven into darkness and despair at the hands of independently-minded women .
while it does n't pretend to be profound , the book does raise some issues about the male german psyche .
do men , for example , really harbor a desire to be captain of the domestic ship on which their first mate wives and girlfriends are to follow orders with a sweet salute ? your wish is my command ? rainer volz , a sociologist and researcher who specializes in gender issues says there are four types of men floating about in germany . " there are the traditionalists who want to turn back the process of emancipation , " he said .
" they are very insecure but hide behind their macho exterior .
then we have the modern men who do n't believe in competing with women , and who are genuinely happy to help with the kids and housework . " " it 's worth belonging to that group , because they are genuinely the happiest , " he added . then there are the 60 percent of german men who fall somewhere between the two stools , according to volz . " uncertain men are the ones who ca n't decide if tradition should outweigh modernity or vice versa , while pragmatic men say that women should go out to work , but really believe it would be better if they did n't bother . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : safety in numbers ?
so just how much resonance do books like schäfer 's , which look at the dying breed of " real men " - albeit with a degree of humor - have with the country 's male population ? " there has long been a debate on what should become of the classic male territory now that women are world soccer champions and drink beer from the bottle , " a spokeswoman for schäfer 's publisher , piper , said . " the issue is that men no longer always know who or how they are supposed to be , " she said . new norms uwe lohsa , psychotherapist who offers advice to men struggling to keep afloat in the modern world , says the situation in germany is in a state of flux . " the old norms are no longer acceptable and men are faced with the conflict of having to be softees at home and competitive men in the working world .
and that poses huge difficulties to some of them , " lohsa said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women in germany can stay home until their babies outgrow babyhood but the reality is that in the working world at least , men still rule the roost .
a recent study conducted by the federal statistics office shows that women are still under-represented in managerial positions , holding just 33 percent of the country 's top posts .
in addition , it is still widely regarded as acceptable in germany for women to take an extremely long maternity leave .
employers are bound by law to hold a new mother 's job for three years , and many women take full advantage of the generous offer . getting over it so if it is not the working world which is proving too much for the traditional man , what is ?
according to volz , it 's the challenge of defining new male role models , and the quandary of choosing among them . " there are some men who have already rejected the old image of the way a man should be , but then there are others who are hanging on bitterly , " said volz .
" thirty years ago there was only one model of a man , the traditional man .
but that is over once and for all . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the next generation of modern men ?
rather than a crisis-inducer , both he and lohsa see gender equality as a great opportunity for modern men to shrug off some of the responsibilities they have been carting around with them since their dawning day - the pressures of being the sole breadwinner , for example . in order to take advantage of such modern perks though , german men first need to get beyond their own insecurities . tamsin walker , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de it 's not a man 's world despite the german government 's efforts to make paternity leave an attractive option , men are working as much as ever .
so what 's stopping them opting for stay-at-home fatherhood ?
-lrb- march 8 , 2005 -rrb- work-life balance gets boost in germany in germany , where kids are seen as career killers , over 40 percent of highly qualified women choose to remain childless .
but a competition to find the nation 's most family-friendly companies is hoping to change that .
-lrb- april 4 , 2005 -rrb- working women face upward battle germany is lagging far behind when it comes to women in top managerial positions .
why is it so difficult for women to get ahead in europe 's largest economy ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : passing of a pope pope 's funeral set for friday the question of succession a pope of unity but also division a life at odds with the germans europe -pipe- 06.04.2005 the long way to a new pope großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : white smoke is the signal catholics will be waiting for " habemus papam " - " we have a pope . "
catholics could hear these words as early as april 18 , as the cardinals will begin the highly regulated process of electing a new pontiff on that day . the so-called conclave will choose john paul ii 's successor .
it is made up of cardinals that have not yet turned 80 - there are currently 117 of them . while the cardinals already have a chance to discuss candidates since many of them arrived in rome ahead of the late pope 's funeral , the actual election can not begin any earlier than 15 days after john paul ii 's death nor later than 20 days after his passing .
vatican officials announced wednesday that cardinals have chosen april 18 as the day to begin deliberations . the late pope 's will will be published on thursday . simple requirements theoretically , there 's a huge number of people who qualify for the job of pontiff . " every catholic man , who fulfills the requirements to become a bishop or priest , can become pope , " said alfred hierold , a professor for church law at bamberg university . while the " servant of the servants of god " could therefore be a layman , he would quickly have to be made bishop as the pope is also always the bishop of rome .
that problem has n't arisen for centuries , however : since 1378 , every pope has been a cardinal before his election . gathering in rome , cardinals will stay at " domus sanctae marthae , " a spartan guest house behind st. peter 's cathedral in vatican city . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reporters stand in one of the cells in which the cardinals slept during the last 1978 conclave " the rooms have a metal bed , a large desk , a chair , a small bathroom and stone floors , " said hierold , who has stayed there himself . complete reclusion on the first day of the conclave , cardinals celebrate a special mass called " pro eligendo papa , " or " for the election of the pope . "
traditionally , they then retreat to the vatican 's sistine chapel to begin their deliberations .
however , this time the cardinals will not be confined to the chapel .
they 'll be permitted to roam about within the walls of the vatican , though they will still be banned from contact with the outside world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vatican 's sistine chapel with the " last judgement " fresco on the wall at the end " if a cardinal brings along his mobile phone , there 's nothing that can be done , " hierold said , adding that the ballot box is placed underneath michelangelo 's famous " last judgement " fresco .
" but it 's not allowed . " the chapel is even checked for listening devices and cardinals as well any support staff have to swear that they will remain silent about anything that takes place within and that they will not be influenced by others in their decision . bribes and intrigues there 's good reason for that as bribing and intrigues were not uncommon at previous papal elections .
until 1903 , european monarchs also played a role in electing the leader of the catholic church . the cardinals keep meeting until they have agreed on a new pope .
the longest conclave lasted three years .
in order to be elected pope , a candidate has to receive two thirds of the votes .
should he not receive them right away , four rounds of votes are cast each day , separated by prayers .
the first break will take place if a new pontiff has not been elected after three days . should cardinals fail to agree after 34 voting rounds , they can decide to elect a pope by majority . dark smoke , white smoke smoke is used to announce the result of each vote as the ballots are burned each time .
if the vote has been unsuccessful , wet straw is added to the fire , causing dark smoke to rise above the chapel .
once a pope has been chosen , dry straw is added and white smoke signals the beginning of a new pontificate .
i in addition to white smoke , the faithful will this time also hear the ringing of the bells of st peter 's cathedral to announce a decision . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinals congregated for the first day in the bologna hall at the vatican on monday inside , cardinals acknowledge their new supreme leader as well .
everyone except the new pontiff folds up the little canopy above his seat .
the new pope is then asked what name he chooses and officially becomes pope once a document has been drawn up that certifies his election . john paul ii 's successor will then put on the white papal clothes and accept a pledge of allegiance by the other cardinals .
only then will the dean of the college of cardinals , germany 's joseph ratzinger , step on the balcony of st. peter 's cathedral . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joseph ratzinger " annuntio vobis gaudium magnum , habemus papam , " he 'll tell the cheering crowd .
" i announce to you with great happiness : we have a pope . " this time , the latter might get a bit complicated , as ratzinger himself has good chances of becoming the next pope . rafael heiling -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the question of succession with the death of pope john paul ii , a chain of events laid down by centuries of papal tradition swung into action , but who will emerge as the next pontiff is a guess no one dares to hazard .
-lrb- april 3 , 2005 -rrb- what happens after the pope dies ?
after the death of pope john paul ii , a strict procedure of events is set into motion leading to the burial and election of a successor .
dw-world looks at the key steps for the next several days .

the company , say analysts , has never been more unstable . trips to the annual shareholders meeting are never much fun for daimlerchrysler ceo jürgen schrempp .
but with his company in a serious downward spiral of late , the meeting on wednesday should be especially agonizing .
daimlerchrysler 's operating profit has dropped , its expansion strategy in asia faltered and , at the beginning of the month , the mercedes division announced the biggest recall of cars in its history . the slip-ups will not only draw the ire of smaller shareholders this year , but the massive investment funds that hold as much as 10 percent of daimlerchrysler 's 1 billion shares .
union investment , which holds 15 million shares , drew up a list of complaints ahead of the meeting .
shadow over the brand among them , that daimlerchrysler top management has had to regularly revise its profit expectations in recent years and that their profit predictions for 2005 to 2007 have been too inexact .
the fund also targeted the recall of 1.3 million mercedes built in the last four years , which began on april 2 . " the shoddy quality of the cars throws a shadow over the value of the brand in the long run , " union investment wrote , according to reports . schrempp admitted as much in an interview with der spiegel newmagazine ahead of wednesday 's meeting .
the company made a mistake by outsourcing the entire electronic components for their navigation and motor management systems , said schrempp .
as he drove around stuttgart one day , the navigation system kept asking him to turn .
" by the third time , i realized that it was n't my fault , " he said in the interview .
" the discussion about quality , " he said later , " is not good for mercedes . " division is smart-ing neither is the money-losing smart brand .
though the two-seat half-size cars made a splash upon being introduced in 1998 , they have n't sold as well as anticipated .
the introduction of new models in recent years has failed to lift sales . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smart cars : not nearly as fast-moving off the sales floors after admitting losses of 2.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.3 billion -rrb- on smart , schrempp and his board announced a 1.2 billion euro restructuring program that will cut jobs and stop the introduction of further models . that likely wo n't stanch the cascade of criticism and uneasiness among shareholders - especially with an ongoing investigation by german prosecutors into several daimlerchrysler employees accused of misusing company resources . last year , schrempp 's management team won approval of 88.49 percent of its investors , around 10 percent less than the year before .
shareholders of companies in germany traditionally ratify a management 's actions over the previous year .
an investor only rarely refuses to give management approval . approval rating to sink but this time around , the number of angry shareholders will only increase .
union investment fund has flat out announced it will not give the management its vote of confidence .
analysts say the fund management company seb invest and germany 's largest fund company , dws investment , will also likely withhold their approval . " daimler has repeatedly disappointed over several years , " said thomas körfgen , the head of equity funds at seb .

the company , say analysts , has never been more unstable . trips to the annual shareholders meeting are never much fun for daimlerchrysler ceo jürgen schrempp .
but with his company in a serious downward spiral of late , the meeting on wednesday should be especially agonizing .
daimlerchrysler 's operating profit has dropped , its expansion strategy in asia faltered and , at the beginning of the month , the mercedes division announced the biggest recall of cars in its history . the slip-ups will not only draw the ire of smaller shareholders this year , but the massive investment funds that hold as much as 10 percent of daimlerchrysler 's 1 billion shares .
union investment , which holds 15 million shares , drew up a list of complaints ahead of the meeting .
shadow over the brand among them , that daimlerchrysler top management has had to regularly revise its profit expectations in recent years and that their profit predictions for 2005 to 2007 have been too inexact .
the fund also targeted the recall of 1.3 million mercedes built in the last four years , which began on april 2 . " the shoddy quality of the cars throws a shadow over the value of the brand in the long run , " union investment wrote , according to reports . schrempp admitted as much in an interview with der spiegel newmagazine ahead of wednesday 's meeting .
the company made a mistake by outsourcing the entire electronic components for their navigation and motor management systems , said schrempp .
as he drove around stuttgart one day , the navigation system kept asking him to turn .
" by the third time , i realized that it was n't my fault , " he said in the interview .
" the discussion about quality , " he said later , " is not good for mercedes . " division is smart-ing neither is the money-losing smart brand .
though the two-seat half-size cars made a splash upon being introduced in 1998 , they have n't sold as well as anticipated .

"
catholics could hear these words as early as april 18 , as the cardinals will begin the highly regulated process of electing a new pontiff on that day . the so-called conclave will choose john paul ii 's successor .
it is made up of cardinals that have not yet turned 80 - there are currently 117 of them . while the cardinals already have a chance to discuss candidates since many of them arrived in rome ahead of the late pope 's funeral , the actual election can not begin any earlier than 15 days after john paul ii 's death nor later than 20 days after his passing .
vatican officials announced wednesday that cardinals have chosen april 18 as the day to begin deliberations . the late pope 's will will be published on thursday . simple requirements theoretically , there 's a huge number of people who qualify for the job of pontiff . " every catholic man , who fulfills the requirements to become a bishop or priest , can become pope , " said alfred hierold , a professor for church law at bamberg university . while the " servant of the servants of god " could therefore be a layman , he would quickly have to be made bishop as the pope is also always the bishop of rome .
that problem has n't arisen for centuries , however : since 1378 , every pope has been a cardinal before his election . gathering in rome , cardinals will stay at " domus sanctae marthae , " a spartan guest house behind st. peter 's cathedral in vatican city . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reporters stand in one of the cells in which the cardinals slept during the last 1978 conclave " the rooms have a metal bed , a large desk , a chair , a small bathroom and stone floors , " said hierold , who has stayed there himself . complete reclusion on the first day of the conclave , cardinals celebrate a special mass called " pro eligendo papa , " or " for the election of the pope . "
traditionally , they then retreat to the vatican 's sistine chapel to begin their deliberations .
however , this time the cardinals will not be confined to the chapel .
they 'll be permitted to roam about within the walls of the vatican , though they will still be banned from contact with the outside world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vatican 's sistine chapel with the " last judgement " fresco on the wall at the end " if a cardinal brings along his mobile phone , there 's nothing that can be done , " hierold said , adding that the ballot box is placed underneath michelangelo 's famous " last judgement " fresco .
" but it 's not allowed . " the chapel is even checked for listening devices and cardinals as well any support staff have to swear that they will remain silent about anything that takes place within and that they will not be influenced by others in their decision . bribes and intrigues there 's good reason for that as bribing and intrigues were not uncommon at previous papal elections .
until 1903 , european monarchs also played a role in electing the leader of the catholic church . the cardinals keep meeting until they have agreed on a new pope .
the longest conclave lasted three years .
in order to be elected pope , a candidate has to receive two thirds of the votes .
should he not receive them right away , four rounds of votes are cast each day , separated by prayers .
the first break will take place if a new pontiff has not been elected after three days . should cardinals fail to agree after 34 voting rounds , they can decide to elect a pope by majority . dark smoke , white smoke smoke is used to announce the result of each vote as the ballots are burned each time .
if the vote has been unsuccessful , wet straw is added to the fire , causing dark smoke to rise above the chapel .
once a pope has been chosen , dry straw is added and white smoke signals the beginning of a new pontificate .
i in addition to white smoke , the faithful will this time also hear the ringing of the bells of st peter 's cathedral to announce a decision . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinals congregated for the first day in the bologna hall at the vatican on monday inside , cardinals acknowledge their new supreme leader as well .
everyone except the new pontiff folds up the little canopy above his seat .
the new pope is then asked what name he chooses and officially becomes pope once a document has been drawn up that certifies his election . john paul ii 's successor will then put on the white papal clothes and accept a pledge of allegiance by the other cardinals .
only then will the dean of the college of cardinals , germany 's joseph ratzinger , step on the balcony of st. peter 's cathedral . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joseph ratzinger " annuntio vobis gaudium magnum , habemus papam , " he 'll tell the cheering crowd .
" i announce to you with great happiness : we have a pope . " this time , the latter might get a bit complicated , as ratzinger himself has good chances of becoming the next pope . rafael heiling -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the question of succession with the death of pope john paul ii , a chain of events laid down by centuries of papal tradition swung into action , but who will emerge as the next pontiff is a guess no one dares to hazard .

" we are seeing ceremonies which are worryingly similar to what we saw with the burial of ayatollah khomeini , " drewermann said in an interview with afp news agency this week .
" this is not how we should be preaching christianity . " a missed opportunity ? drewermann points to the brief , one-month reign of john paul i in 1978 as a missed opportunity for the catholic church .

the company , say analysts , has never been more unstable . trips to the annual shareholders meeting are never much fun for daimlerchrysler ceo jürgen schrempp .
but with his company in a serious downward spiral of late , the meeting on wednesday should be especially agonizing .
daimlerchrysler 's operating profit has dropped , its expansion strategy in asia faltered and , at the beginning of the month , the mercedes division announced the biggest recall of cars in its history . the slip-ups will not only draw the ire of smaller shareholders this year , but the massive investment funds that hold as much as 10 percent of daimlerchrysler 's 1 billion shares .
union investment , which holds 15 million shares , drew up a list of complaints ahead of the meeting .
shadow over the brand among them , that daimlerchrysler top management has had to regularly revise its profit expectations in recent years and that their profit predictions for 2005 to 2007 have been too inexact .
the fund also targeted the recall of 1.3 million mercedes built in the last four years , which began on april 2 . " the shoddy quality of the cars throws a shadow over the value of the brand in the long run , " union investment wrote , according to reports . schrempp admitted as much in an interview with der spiegel newmagazine ahead of wednesday 's meeting .
the company made a mistake by outsourcing the entire electronic components for their navigation and motor management systems , said schrempp .
as he drove around stuttgart one day , the navigation system kept asking him to turn .
" by the third time , i realized that it was n't my fault , " he said in the interview .
" the discussion about quality , " he said later , " is not good for mercedes . " division is smart-ing neither is the money-losing smart brand .
though the two-seat half-size cars made a splash upon being introduced in 1998 , they have n't sold as well as anticipated .
the introduction of new models in recent years has failed to lift sales . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smart cars : not nearly as fast-moving off the sales floors after admitting losses of 2.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.3 billion -rrb- on smart , schrempp and his board announced a 1.2 billion euro restructuring program that will cut jobs and stop the introduction of further models . that likely wo n't stanch the cascade of criticism and uneasiness among shareholders - especially with an ongoing investigation by german prosecutors into several daimlerchrysler employees accused of misusing company resources . last year , schrempp 's management team won approval of 88.49 percent of its investors , around 10 percent less than the year before .
shareholders of companies in germany traditionally ratify a management 's actions over the previous year .
an investor only rarely refuses to give management approval . approval rating to sink but this time around , the number of angry shareholders will only increase .
union investment fund has flat out announced it will not give the management its vote of confidence .
analysts say the fund management company seb invest and germany 's largest fund company , dws investment , will also likely withhold their approval . " daimler has repeatedly disappointed over several years , " said thomas körfgen , the head of equity funds at seb .

the company , say analysts , has never been more unstable . trips to the annual shareholders meeting are never much fun for daimlerchrysler ceo jürgen schrempp .
but with his company in a serious downward spiral of late , the meeting on wednesday should be especially agonizing .
daimlerchrysler 's operating profit has dropped , its expansion strategy in asia faltered and , at the beginning of the month , the mercedes division announced the biggest recall of cars in its history . the slip-ups will not only draw the ire of smaller shareholders this year , but the massive investment funds that hold as much as 10 percent of daimlerchrysler 's 1 billion shares .
union investment , which holds 15 million shares , drew up a list of complaints ahead of the meeting .
shadow over the brand among them , that daimlerchrysler top management has had to regularly revise its profit expectations in recent years and that their profit predictions for 2005 to 2007 have been too inexact .
the fund also targeted the recall of 1.3 million mercedes built in the last four years , which began on april 2 . " the shoddy quality of the cars throws a shadow over the value of the brand in the long run , " union investment wrote , according to reports . schrempp admitted as much in an interview with der spiegel newmagazine ahead of wednesday 's meeting .
the company made a mistake by outsourcing the entire electronic components for their navigation and motor management systems , said schrempp .
as he drove around stuttgart one day , the navigation system kept asking him to turn .
" by the third time , i realized that it was n't my fault , " he said in the interview .
" the discussion about quality , " he said later , " is not good for mercedes . " division is smart-ing neither is the money-losing smart brand .
though the two-seat half-size cars made a splash upon being introduced in 1998 , they have n't sold as well as anticipated .
the introduction of new models in recent years has failed to lift sales . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smart cars : not nearly as fast-moving off the sales floors after admitting losses of 2.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.3 billion -rrb- on smart , schrempp and his board announced a 1.2 billion euro restructuring program that will cut jobs and stop the introduction of further models . that likely wo n't stanch the cascade of criticism and uneasiness among shareholders - especially with an ongoing investigation by german prosecutors into several daimlerchrysler employees accused of misusing company resources . last year , schrempp 's management team won approval of 88.49 percent of its investors , around 10 percent less than the year before .
shareholders of companies in germany traditionally ratify a management 's actions over the previous year .
an investor only rarely refuses to give management approval . approval rating to sink but this time around , the number of angry shareholders will only increase .
union investment fund has flat out announced it will not give the management its vote of confidence .
analysts say the fund management company seb invest and germany 's largest fund company , dws investment , will also likely withhold their approval . " daimler has repeatedly disappointed over several years , " said thomas körfgen , the head of equity funds at seb .
" every year , there 's another division with a catastrophic development .

german hooligans could be at the forefront of a " struggle for dominance " at the 2006 world cup , according to hooliganism expert professor eric dunning in an interview with dw-world . dw-world : how are german hooligan groups structured ? prof. dunning : those in the former east germany in particular have a neo-nazi core where the task of the organization is more a political one .
the political center of the group can have an agenda other than the one supported by the outer circle which could be along the lines of purely football rivalry .
german hooligan groups with neo-nazi influences within them may have a xenophobic or national pride aspect to their actions which forms a catalyst .
other hooligans may then get swept up in that and fight for what they see as team or national allegiance .
in terms of football violence , the germans are like many other hooligans in so much as some of the violence may be opportunist , spontaneous outbreaks while others can be meticulously organized .
some clashes can be politically motivated while others can be just for the pure adrenalin rush of fighting , something many hooligans have professed to being addictive , calling the buzz " better than sex and drugs . " as with many sophisticated hooligan elements in the modern game , especially within europe , german hooligans use technology in their organization .
mobile phones are used to establish contact , to arrange fights and locations while the internet plays a big role .
while a lot of the chatter is made up of younger hooligans ' bravado which does n't come to much , there is evidence that internet contact does lead to actual confrontations taking place . before the violence in slovenia in march , there had been little or no large scale violence involving german hooligans on the international stage .
what , in your opinion , has been happening in that time ? the problem has never gone away .
it is obviously less of a problem that it was in the 60 's , 70 's and 80 's but it has never been eradicated .
police forces have become more skilled at preventing hooliganism at stadiums and the immediate areas around them ; monitoring entry points to cities and countries and identifying ringleaders .
but hooligans have learnt to take their fighting away from the points where control measures are most efficiently executed .
the fighting has been moved away from stadiums into railway stations , motorway service stations , even towns nowhere near those hosting matches .
surface policing -lrb- visual shows of strength , applied techniques at points of entry and stadiums -rrb- has been successful in keeping violence away from the where the game is played but only undercover operations can truly root out the core of hooligan organizations and prevent violence .
in this respect , hooliganism has continued , only not as much in the public eye . is the 2006 world cup in germany destined to be tainted by hooliganism ? in my opinion , there will be a struggle for dominance at the world cup with the germans and the english at the forefront , with the dutch and the italians also involved .
the germans are perceived as one of the most violent groups in europe , at the 1998 world cup they also most beat a french police officer to death , and they will clearly have a home advantage .
at the world cups which offered little incentive for the hooligans , there was no violence .
in the united states in 1994 , the reputation of the armed us police did much to put hooligans off and the cultural differences in 2002 -lrb- in japan / korea -rrb- meant that very few traveled .

german hooligans could be at the forefront of a " struggle for dominance " at the 2006 world cup , according to hooliganism expert professor eric dunning in an interview with dw-world . dw-world : how are german hooligan groups structured ? prof. dunning : those in the former east germany in particular have a neo-nazi core where the task of the organization is more a political one .
the political center of the group can have an agenda other than the one supported by the outer circle which could be along the lines of purely football rivalry .
german hooligan groups with neo-nazi influences within them may have a xenophobic or national pride aspect to their actions which forms a catalyst .
other hooligans may then get swept up in that and fight for what they see as team or national allegiance .
in terms of football violence , the germans are like many other hooligans in so much as some of the violence may be opportunist , spontaneous outbreaks while others can be meticulously organized .
some clashes can be politically motivated while others can be just for the pure adrenalin rush of fighting , something many hooligans have professed to being addictive , calling the buzz " better than sex and drugs .

it is obviously less of a problem that it was in the 60 's , 70 's and 80 's but it has never been eradicated .
police forces have become more skilled at preventing hooliganism at stadiums and the immediate areas around them ; monitoring entry points to cities and countries and identifying ringleaders .

the company , say analysts , has never been more unstable . trips to the annual shareholders meeting are never much fun for daimlerchrysler ceo jürgen schrempp .
but with his company in a serious downward spiral of late , the meeting on wednesday should be especially agonizing .
daimlerchrysler 's operating profit has dropped , its expansion strategy in asia faltered and , at the beginning of the month , the mercedes division announced the biggest recall of cars in its history . the slip-ups will not only draw the ire of smaller shareholders this year , but the massive investment funds that hold as much as 10 percent of daimlerchrysler 's 1 billion shares .
union investment , which holds 15 million shares , drew up a list of complaints ahead of the meeting .
shadow over the brand among them , that daimlerchrysler top management has had to regularly revise its profit expectations in recent years and that their profit predictions for 2005 to 2007 have been too inexact .
the fund also targeted the recall of 1.3 million mercedes built in the last four years , which began on april 2 . " the shoddy quality of the cars throws a shadow over the value of the brand in the long run , " union investment wrote , according to reports . schrempp admitted as much in an interview with der spiegel newmagazine ahead of wednesday 's meeting .
the company made a mistake by outsourcing the entire electronic components for their navigation and motor management systems , said schrempp .
as he drove around stuttgart one day , the navigation system kept asking him to turn .
" by the third time , i realized that it was n't my fault , " he said in the interview .
" the discussion about quality , " he said later , " is not good for mercedes . " division is smart-ing neither is the money-losing smart brand .
though the two-seat half-size cars made a splash upon being introduced in 1998 , they have n't sold as well as anticipated .
the introduction of new models in recent years has failed to lift sales . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smart cars : not nearly as fast-moving off the sales floors after admitting losses of 2.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.3 billion -rrb- on smart , schrempp and his board announced a 1.2 billion euro restructuring program that will cut jobs and stop the introduction of further models . that likely wo n't stanch the cascade of criticism and uneasiness among shareholders - especially with an ongoing investigation by german prosecutors into several daimlerchrysler employees accused of misusing company resources . last year , schrempp 's management team won approval of 88.49 percent of its investors , around 10 percent less than the year before .
shareholders of companies in germany traditionally ratify a management 's actions over the previous year .
an investor only rarely refuses to give management approval . approval rating to sink but this time around , the number of angry shareholders will only increase .
union investment fund has flat out announced it will not give the management its vote of confidence .
analysts say the fund management company seb invest and germany 's largest fund company , dws investment , will also likely withhold their approval . " daimler has repeatedly disappointed over several years , " said thomas körfgen , the head of equity funds at seb .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 06.04.2005 in search of the real man großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who is really on top in germany ?
traditional german men are lamenting the loss of their hunter-gatherer identity and bemoaning the wilful ways of their contemporary wives , but is it really such a big deal ? apparently it is .
bookshelves across the nation are laden with a colorful array of do-it-yourself volumes on love and relationships , handy hints for dealing with wayward women and guidebooks which claim to have all the answers to making marriage work . perhaps the only surprising thing is just how much is written by men for men .
one such example is thirty-something german author jens schäfer , who recently published a book about the supposed last bastions of masculinity in an otherwise female-dominated world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are these the faces of real men ?
entitled " echte männer - ein leben im verborgenen " -lrb- real men - a secret life -rrb- , the book highlights the sad lot of the free-thinking german man , driven into darkness and despair at the hands of independently-minded women .
while it does n't pretend to be profound , the book does raise some issues about the male german psyche .
do men , for example , really harbor a desire to be captain of the domestic ship on which their first mate wives and girlfriends are to follow orders with a sweet salute ? your wish is my command ? rainer volz , a sociologist and researcher who specializes in gender issues says there are four types of men floating about in germany . " there are the traditionalists who want to turn back the process of emancipation , " he said .
" they are very insecure but hide behind their macho exterior .
then we have the modern men who do n't believe in competing with women , and who are genuinely happy to help with the kids and housework . " " it 's worth belonging to that group , because they are genuinely the happiest , " he added . then there are the 60 percent of german men who fall somewhere between the two stools , according to volz . " uncertain men are the ones who ca n't decide if tradition should outweigh modernity or vice versa , while pragmatic men say that women should go out to work , but really believe it would be better if they did n't bother . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : safety in numbers ?
so just how much resonance do books like schäfer 's , which look at the dying breed of " real men " - albeit with a degree of humor - have with the country 's male population ? " there has long been a debate on what should become of the classic male territory now that women are world soccer champions and drink beer from the bottle , " a spokeswoman for schäfer 's publisher , piper , said . " the issue is that men no longer always know who or how they are supposed to be , " she said . new norms uwe lohsa , psychotherapist who offers advice to men struggling to keep afloat in the modern world , says the situation in germany is in a state of flux . " the old norms are no longer acceptable and men are faced with the conflict of having to be softees at home and competitive men in the working world .
and that poses huge difficulties to some of them , " lohsa said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women in germany can stay home until their babies outgrow babyhood but the reality is that in the working world at least , men still rule the roost .
a recent study conducted by the federal statistics office shows that women are still under-represented in managerial positions , holding just 33 percent of the country 's top posts .
in addition , it is still widely regarded as acceptable in germany for women to take an extremely long maternity leave .
employers are bound by law to hold a new mother 's job for three years , and many women take full advantage of the generous offer . getting over it so if it is not the working world which is proving too much for the traditional man , what is ?
according to volz , it 's the challenge of defining new male role models , and the quandary of choosing among them . " there are some men who have already rejected the old image of the way a man should be , but then there are others who are hanging on bitterly , " said volz .
" thirty years ago there was only one model of a man , the traditional man .
but that is over once and for all . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the next generation of modern men ?
rather than a crisis-inducer , both he and lohsa see gender equality as a great opportunity for modern men to shrug off some of the responsibilities they have been carting around with them since their dawning day - the pressures of being the sole breadwinner , for example . in order to take advantage of such modern perks though , german men first need to get beyond their own insecurities . tamsin walker , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de it 's not a man 's world despite the german government 's efforts to make paternity leave an attractive option , men are working as much as ever .

" a missed opportunity ? drewermann points to the brief , one-month reign of john paul i in 1978 as a missed opportunity for the catholic church . " with him we would have had someone who followed the concilium of the vatican ii , " which set out a reformist path for the church .
" in fact -lrb- under pope john paul ii -rrb- the opposite happened . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a young man prays in front of a sculpture portraying pope john paul ii next to the basilica della madonna del rosario , in pompei , italy one of the striking images of the mourning for the late pontiff has been the reaction of young people to a man they apparently held in great affection , but drewermann , 64 , attaches little importance to this . " he was like a replacement father figure for them , someone who banned any sexual experience outside of marriage , " drewermann said .
" they did n't really listen to what he said . " failing to counter aids ? he is especially outraged by the late pope 's refusal to back the use of condoms which he says helped aids to ravage africa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many african children have lost their parents to aids " he said condoms were forbidden and yet 25 million people in africa are facing aids , " drewermann said .
" at the world population conference in cairo -lrb- in 1994 -rrb- the vatican blocked a sensible and effective birth control program , siding with the ayatollahs and the american fundamentalists . " under pope john paul ii , the catholic church turned its back on the possibility of a " spiritual opening , " drewermann said .
this , he said , prevented serious reflection on how to read and interpret the bible or , for example , how to interpret the symbols of the new testament such as the immaculate conception . a climate of psychological fear ? drewermann also alleged that the catholic church under the leadership of the late pontiff tacitly encouraged a climate of psychological fear among its followers - a popular theme of his books which have been translated into many languages . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian exorcist father gabriele nanni gives a lesson on satanism for clergy at rome 's regina apostolorum pontifical academy , in february " there were more than 30,000 exorcisms during his reign , " which shows " that there is a widespread belief that satan is within people 's souls , " he said . high hopes for the next pope the theologian also berated pope john paul ii for failing to take a more liberal stance on divorce and re-marriage and said that he " quite simply banned any discussion about the emancipation of women . " but drewermann , who now lives a reclusive life in the western german city of paderborn , without a phone , fax or computer , praises pope john paul ii 's efforts to reach out to third world countries , his opposition to the us-led invasion of iraq and his rejection of " the anti-social and harmful character of capitalism . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drewermann has high hopes for the next occupant of the papal apartment he said he fervently hopes that the next pope will seize the chance to throw open to discussion " issues that have been taboo for centuries " and allow catholics to debate freely with other christians . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans hope for progressive next pope as people in germany keep mourning john paul ii ’ s death , some politicians and church leaders have started thinking about what the next pontificate should be like .

traditional german men are lamenting the loss of their hunter-gatherer identity and bemoaning the wilful ways of their contemporary wives , but is it really such a big deal ? apparently it is .
bookshelves across the nation are laden with a colorful array of do-it-yourself volumes on love and relationships , handy hints for dealing with wayward women and guidebooks which claim to have all the answers to making marriage work . perhaps the only surprising thing is just how much is written by men for men .
one such example is thirty-something german author jens schäfer , who recently published a book about the supposed last bastions of masculinity in an otherwise female-dominated world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are these the faces of real men ?
entitled " echte männer - ein leben im verborgenen " -lrb- real men - a secret life -rrb- , the book highlights the sad lot of the free-thinking german man , driven into darkness and despair at the hands of independently-minded women .
while it does n't pretend to be profound , the book does raise some issues about the male german psyche .
do men , for example , really harbor a desire to be captain of the domestic ship on which their first mate wives and girlfriends are to follow orders with a sweet salute ? your wish is my command ? rainer volz , a sociologist and researcher who specializes in gender issues says there are four types of men floating about in germany . " there are the traditionalists who want to turn back the process of emancipation , " he said .
" they are very insecure but hide behind their macho exterior .
then we have the modern men who do n't believe in competing with women , and who are genuinely happy to help with the kids and housework . " " it 's worth belonging to that group , because they are genuinely the happiest , " he added . then there are the 60 percent of german men who fall somewhere between the two stools , according to volz . " uncertain men are the ones who ca n't decide if tradition should outweigh modernity or vice versa , while pragmatic men say that women should go out to work , but really believe it would be better if they did n't bother . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : safety in numbers ?
so just how much resonance do books like schäfer 's , which look at the dying breed of " real men " - albeit with a degree of humor - have with the country 's male population ? " there has long been a debate on what should become of the classic male territory now that women are world soccer champions and drink beer from the bottle , " a spokeswoman for schäfer 's publisher , piper , said . " the issue is that men no longer always know who or how they are supposed to be , " she said . new norms uwe lohsa , psychotherapist who offers advice to men struggling to keep afloat in the modern world , says the situation in germany is in a state of flux . " the old norms are no longer acceptable and men are faced with the conflict of having to be softees at home and competitive men in the working world .
and that poses huge difficulties to some of them , " lohsa said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women in germany can stay home until their babies outgrow babyhood but the reality is that in the working world at least , men still rule the roost .
a recent study conducted by the federal statistics office shows that women are still under-represented in managerial positions , holding just 33 percent of the country 's top posts .
in addition , it is still widely regarded as acceptable in germany for women to take an extremely long maternity leave .
employers are bound by law to hold a new mother 's job for three years , and many women take full advantage of the generous offer . getting over it so if it is not the working world which is proving too much for the traditional man , what is ?
according to volz , it 's the challenge of defining new male role models , and the quandary of choosing among them . " there are some men who have already rejected the old image of the way a man should be , but then there are others who are hanging on bitterly , " said volz .

many in the basilica carried flowers or wore images of the deceased leader of the roman catholic church .

" for us children of a pluralistic society which often leans toward individualism , it was not an easy message , " he said . focus on positive but lehmann focused primarily on john paul ii 's role in poland 's - and by extension , eastern europe 's - journey from communism to democracy .

the embattled ceo defended his leadership , but will go from the meeting with a black eye . urged on by the repeated applause of attending shareholders , representative after representative of daimlerchrysler 's biggest investors tore into the company and its embattled chief . " mr. schrempp , the past five years have been marked by mismanagement , " said klaus kaldemorgen , whose investment fund dws owns 10 percent of daimlerchrysler stock .
" shareholder patience is over . " ceo on the defensive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mercedes ' image is taking a beating the us-german company and its veteran ceo have been reeling from a series of serious setbacks that have tarnished the car company 's glowing image in the past year .
the company 's operating profit had to be revised , the smart minicar division is undergoing a 1.3 billion euro -lrb- $ 1.68 billion -rrb- restructuring program , and the company began the biggest recall of cars in its history at the beginning of april . schrempp was well prepared for an onslaught of criticism at wednesday 's meeting in berlin .
in his address , he told the gathering of 8,000 that they would have to brace for six months of bad news due to the high oil prices , a weak dollar , recall costs and restructuring program in the smart division .
but he assured them that daimlerchrysler was still performing satisfactorily . " we reached our profit goals , " said schrempp , who has headed daimlerchrysler for 10 years . brand is endangered but it wasn ’ t the profit margin so much as the disturbing tendencies in important daimlerchrysler divisions that bothered majority shareholders .
thomas meier , the fund manager at union investment , drew applause when he criticized recent developments at mercedes-benz , daimler 's most valuable division . after discovering defects in electrical components of mercedes cars built after 2001 , daimlerchrysler launched a recall of 1.3 million cars at the beginning of april . the problems halved the division 's profit margin last year from 3.1 billion to 1.67 billion euros , said meier , whose fund owns 15 million shares . " the brand mercedes-benz is endangered , " he said . smart a " declaration of bankruptcy " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two-seat minicar smart the smart division , which has yet to bring a profit since the two-seat minicar was introduced in 1998 , came in for similar criticism .
fund managers took aim at the 3.8 billion euros in losses the division has posted .
recent efforts to revive the brand by expanding the selection of models have failed and analysts say daimler has not been able to find a market for the cars . the announced 1.3 billion restructuring program , which includes staff cuts , is a " declaration of bankruptcy , " said kaldemorgen . schrempp admitted to the failings .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juergen schrempp explains the annual business report as a display illustrates the decreasing profit trend at the beginning of the annual meeting in berlin on wednesday .
" mercedes-benz quality was not upheld , and smart needs to be brought back , " he said . witholding approval so does the share price .
compared to other automotive companies and the dax index on the frankfurt stock exchange , daimlerchrysler stock performed poorly over the past year . whereas the dax was in the black , daimlerchrysler stock dropped 0.6 percent in value , continuing a downwards trend in the past five years . last year , schrempp 's management team won approval of 88.49 percent of its investors , around 10 percent less than the year before .
shareholders of companies in germany traditionally ratify management 's actions over the previous year .
an investor only rarely refuses to give management approval . but union investment has already said that it will withhold its vote of confidence at the end of the meeting .

rainier 's son , albert , has already assumed his father 's duties as monarch of the tiny state on the mediterranean coast . rainier iii , europe 's longest reigning monarch , was rushed into intensive care two weeks ago when his health took a dramatic turn for the worse .
the 81-year-old prince had been battling lung , heart and kidney problems . as rainier 's health worsened in recent days , the prince 's three children by his late wife , the us film star grace kelly , took turns at his bedside , and he also received visits from monaco 's archbishop and a parish priest . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prince rainier iii leaves the cathedral of monaco with his son , prince albert his only son , the bachelor prince albert , 47 , is his heir .
albert 's bachelor status had for a long time cast a question over the grimaldi family 's rule .
in 2002 , rainier changed monaco 's constitution to allow the offspring of his daughters , caroline , 48 , and stephanie , 40 , to enter the line of succession .

our readers shared their views on the topics . un reform reform is definitely needed .
the security council must be expanded and the veto power abolished .
consensus within the security council is very important .
i strongly support a seat on the security council for germany .
rotating seats on the council are a good idea .
my suggestion is the formation of an advisory council from the remaining members of the general assembly capable of reviewing issues and calling the general assembly to action on specific issues .
this council and the general assembly should be able to join with the security council on specific issues and disputes . - thomas clark bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of the united nations general assembly the un will not be as effective as it wishes to be , because a strong country can by-pass un resolutions more easily than one with less impact , but the more countries have some say , the better for the world .
veto power should be scratched ! - elisabeth heptner as the world seems to be moving in a more global direction , i think the concept of the security council is a bit out of date - not to mention counter-productive , with respect to the veto powers .
better still would be a strengthened general assembly , of which germany is already a member , that uses a two thirds majority ruling .
in this way it puts the voice in the hands of the world community instead of the hands of a privileged few . - andy sporner , us citizen in germany queen camilla hell no ! no way . not only should she be kept away from the title of queen , but i am furious that she is being given the title of her royal highness after the wedding .
diana was stripped of her rightful title hrh by a mean spirited and spiteful queen .
how dare camilla be given the hrh title by this same monarch , when the mother of the future king of england was demoted in the royal ranks . - susan belcher , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : camilla should definitely not be queen .
it 's bad enough that she is being given the accolade of marrying charles after the hurt and anguish that she caused diana , -lrb- who had a very unhappy life due to camilla -rrb- .
camilla should have bowed out and let them get on with it but no she did n't , she made diana and the boys ' lives miserable .
even on the day they married she was there with cufflinks with entwined c 's for charles and camilla .
diana was aware of this and it did n't give her and charles a chance to make a go of their marriage . - mrs robinson absolutely .
the entire world does what they want to .

the security council must be expanded and the veto power abolished .
consensus within the security council is very important .
i strongly support a seat on the security council for germany .
rotating seats on the council are a good idea .

" ceo on the defensive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mercedes ' image is taking a beating the us-german company and its veteran ceo have been reeling from a series of serious setbacks that have tarnished the car company 's glowing image in the past year .
the company 's operating profit had to be revised , the smart minicar division is undergoing a 1.3 billion euro -lrb- $ 1.68 billion -rrb- restructuring program , and the company began the biggest recall of cars in its history at the beginning of april . schrempp was well prepared for an onslaught of criticism at wednesday 's meeting in berlin .
in his address , he told the gathering of 8,000 that they would have to brace for six months of bad news due to the high oil prices , a weak dollar , recall costs and restructuring program in the smart division .
but he assured them that daimlerchrysler was still performing satisfactorily . " we reached our profit goals , " said schrempp , who has headed daimlerchrysler for 10 years . brand is endangered but it wasn ’ t the profit margin so much as the disturbing tendencies in important daimlerchrysler divisions that bothered majority shareholders .
thomas meier , the fund manager at union investment , drew applause when he criticized recent developments at mercedes-benz , daimler 's most valuable division . after discovering defects in electrical components of mercedes cars built after 2001 , daimlerchrysler launched a recall of 1.3 million cars at the beginning of april . the problems halved the division 's profit margin last year from 3.1 billion to 1.67 billion euros , said meier , whose fund owns 15 million shares . " the brand mercedes-benz is endangered , " he said . smart a " declaration of bankruptcy " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two-seat minicar smart the smart division , which has yet to bring a profit since the two-seat minicar was introduced in 1998 , came in for similar criticism .
fund managers took aim at the 3.8 billion euros in losses the division has posted .
recent efforts to revive the brand by expanding the selection of models have failed and analysts say daimler has not been able to find a market for the cars . the announced 1.3 billion restructuring program , which includes staff cuts , is a " declaration of bankruptcy , " said kaldemorgen . schrempp admitted to the failings .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juergen schrempp explains the annual business report as a display illustrates the decreasing profit trend at the beginning of the annual meeting in berlin on wednesday .
" mercedes-benz quality was not upheld , and smart needs to be brought back , " he said . witholding approval so does the share price .
compared to other automotive companies and the dax index on the frankfurt stock exchange , daimlerchrysler stock performed poorly over the past year . whereas the dax was in the black , daimlerchrysler stock dropped 0.6 percent in value , continuing a downwards trend in the past five years . last year , schrempp 's management team won approval of 88.49 percent of its investors , around 10 percent less than the year before .
shareholders of companies in germany traditionally ratify management 's actions over the previous year .
an investor only rarely refuses to give management approval . but union investment has already said that it will withhold its vote of confidence at the end of the meeting .

but the postbank analysis also projects some gains for the overall economic growth during the tournament as well .

not only the 12 cities that will host matches - from hamburg to hanover to munich - but other german regions are also readying themselves for a storm of tourists .

our readers shared their views on the topics . un reform reform is definitely needed .
the security council must be expanded and the veto power abolished .
consensus within the security council is very important .
i strongly support a seat on the security council for germany .
rotating seats on the council are a good idea .
my suggestion is the formation of an advisory council from the remaining members of the general assembly capable of reviewing issues and calling the general assembly to action on specific issues .
this council and the general assembly should be able to join with the security council on specific issues and disputes . - thomas clark bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of the united nations general assembly the un will not be as effective as it wishes to be , because a strong country can by-pass un resolutions more easily than one with less impact , but the more countries have some say , the better for the world .
veto power should be scratched ! - elisabeth heptner as the world seems to be moving in a more global direction , i think the concept of the security council is a bit out of date - not to mention counter-productive , with respect to the veto powers .
better still would be a strengthened general assembly , of which germany is already a member , that uses a two thirds majority ruling .
in this way it puts the voice in the hands of the world community instead of the hands of a privileged few . - andy sporner , us citizen in germany queen camilla hell no ! no way . not only should she be kept away from the title of queen , but i am furious that she is being given the title of her royal highness after the wedding .
diana was stripped of her rightful title hrh by a mean spirited and spiteful queen .
how dare camilla be given the hrh title by this same monarch , when the mother of the future king of england was demoted in the royal ranks . - susan belcher , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : camilla should definitely not be queen .
it 's bad enough that she is being given the accolade of marrying charles after the hurt and anguish that she caused diana , -lrb- who had a very unhappy life due to camilla -rrb- .
camilla should have bowed out and let them get on with it but no she did n't , she made diana and the boys ' lives miserable .
even on the day they married she was there with cufflinks with entwined c 's for charles and camilla .
diana was aware of this and it did n't give her and charles a chance to make a go of their marriage . - mrs robinson absolutely .
the entire world does what they want to .
charles has lived doing what is expected of him instead of what his heart tells him .
it 's time to leave him alone and let him find true happiness and let his wife become queen if and when charles becomes king .
we as human beings are not owned by other human beings . - marla and paul anderson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany welcomes annan 's call for action kofi annan 's ambitious reform plans for the united nations have met with a largely positive response in europe .
germany feels it 's inched closer to reaching its goal of a permanent seat on the un security council .
-lrb- march 22 , 2005 -rrb- queen camilla ?
no , thank you two weeks before their wedding , britain 's prince charles and bride-to-be camilla parker bowles have received some bad news .
a survey revealed that the vast majority of britons do n't want camilla to become queen .

catholics could hear these words as early as april 18 , as the cardinals will begin the highly regulated process of electing a new pontiff on that day . the so-called conclave will choose john paul ii 's successor .
it is made up of cardinals that have not yet turned 80 - there are currently 117 of them . while the cardinals already have a chance to discuss candidates since many of them arrived in rome ahead of the late pope 's funeral , the actual election can not begin any earlier than 15 days after john paul ii 's death nor later than 20 days after his passing .
vatican officials announced wednesday that cardinals have chosen april 18 as the day to begin deliberations . the late pope 's will will be published on thursday . simple requirements theoretically , there 's a huge number of people who qualify for the job of pontiff .

catholics could hear these words as early as april 18 , as the cardinals will begin the highly regulated process of electing a new pontiff on that day . the so-called conclave will choose john paul ii 's successor .
it is made up of cardinals that have not yet turned 80 - there are currently 117 of them . while the cardinals already have a chance to discuss candidates since many of them arrived in rome ahead of the late pope 's funeral , the actual election can not begin any earlier than 15 days after john paul ii 's death nor later than 20 days after his passing .
vatican officials announced wednesday that cardinals have chosen april 18 as the day to begin deliberations . the late pope 's will will be published on thursday . simple requirements theoretically , there 's a huge number of people who qualify for the job of pontiff .

german hooligans could be at the forefront of a " struggle for dominance " at the 2006 world cup , according to hooliganism expert professor eric dunning in an interview with dw-world . dw-world : how are german hooligan groups structured ? prof. dunning : those in the former east germany in particular have a neo-nazi core where the task of the organization is more a political one .
the political center of the group can have an agenda other than the one supported by the outer circle which could be along the lines of purely football rivalry .
german hooligan groups with neo-nazi influences within them may have a xenophobic or national pride aspect to their actions which forms a catalyst .
other hooligans may then get swept up in that and fight for what they see as team or national allegiance .
in terms of football violence , the germans are like many other hooligans in so much as some of the violence may be opportunist , spontaneous outbreaks while others can be meticulously organized .
some clashes can be politically motivated while others can be just for the pure adrenalin rush of fighting , something many hooligans have professed to being addictive , calling the buzz " better than sex and drugs . " as with many sophisticated hooligan elements in the modern game , especially within europe , german hooligans use technology in their organization .
mobile phones are used to establish contact , to arrange fights and locations while the internet plays a big role .
while a lot of the chatter is made up of younger hooligans ' bravado which does n't come to much , there is evidence that internet contact does lead to actual confrontations taking place . before the violence in slovenia in march , there had been little or no large scale violence involving german hooligans on the international stage .
what , in your opinion , has been happening in that time ? the problem has never gone away .
it is obviously less of a problem that it was in the 60 's , 70 's and 80 's but it has never been eradicated .
police forces have become more skilled at preventing hooliganism at stadiums and the immediate areas around them ; monitoring entry points to cities and countries and identifying ringleaders .
but hooligans have learnt to take their fighting away from the points where control measures are most efficiently executed .
the fighting has been moved away from stadiums into railway stations , motorway service stations , even towns nowhere near those hosting matches .
surface policing -lrb- visual shows of strength , applied techniques at points of entry and stadiums -rrb- has been successful in keeping violence away from the where the game is played but only undercover operations can truly root out the core of hooligan organizations and prevent violence .
in this respect , hooliganism has continued , only not as much in the public eye . is the 2006 world cup in germany destined to be tainted by hooliganism ? in my opinion , there will be a struggle for dominance at the world cup with the germans and the english at the forefront , with the dutch and the italians also involved .
the germans are perceived as one of the most violent groups in europe , at the 1998 world cup they also most beat a french police officer to death , and they will clearly have a home advantage .
at the world cups which offered little incentive for the hooligans , there was no violence .
in the united states in 1994 , the reputation of the armed us police did much to put hooligans off and the cultural differences in 2002 -lrb- in japan / korea -rrb- meant that very few traveled .
germany , with its proximity to many countries with rival hooligan groups , will not have that luxury . bildunterschrift : nick amies interviewed prof. eric dunning send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german hooligans taint slovenian friendly a " friendly " weekend soccer match between germany and slovenia quickly turned sour as before , during and after the game , german fans participated in racist violence , prompting fears of a revival of hooliganism .

german hooligans could be at the forefront of a " struggle for dominance " at the 2006 world cup , according to hooliganism expert professor eric dunning in an interview with dw-world . dw-world : how are german hooligan groups structured ? prof. dunning : those in the former east germany in particular have a neo-nazi core where the task of the organization is more a political one .
the political center of the group can have an agenda other than the one supported by the outer circle which could be along the lines of purely football rivalry .
german hooligan groups with neo-nazi influences within them may have a xenophobic or national pride aspect to their actions which forms a catalyst .
other hooligans may then get swept up in that and fight for what they see as team or national allegiance .
in terms of football violence , the germans are like many other hooligans in so much as some of the violence may be opportunist , spontaneous outbreaks while others can be meticulously organized .
some clashes can be politically motivated while others can be just for the pure adrenalin rush of fighting , something many hooligans have professed to being addictive , calling the buzz " better than sex and drugs . " as with many sophisticated hooligan elements in the modern game , especially within europe , german hooligans use technology in their organization .
mobile phones are used to establish contact , to arrange fights and locations while the internet plays a big role .
while a lot of the chatter is made up of younger hooligans ' bravado which does n't come to much , there is evidence that internet contact does lead to actual confrontations taking place . before the violence in slovenia in march , there had been little or no large scale violence involving german hooligans on the international stage .
what , in your opinion , has been happening in that time ? the problem has never gone away .
it is obviously less of a problem that it was in the 60 's , 70 's and 80 's but it has never been eradicated .
police forces have become more skilled at preventing hooliganism at stadiums and the immediate areas around them ; monitoring entry points to cities and countries and identifying ringleaders .
but hooligans have learnt to take their fighting away from the points where control measures are most efficiently executed .
the fighting has been moved away from stadiums into railway stations , motorway service stations , even towns nowhere near those hosting matches .
surface policing -lrb- visual shows of strength , applied techniques at points of entry and stadiums -rrb- has been successful in keeping violence away from the where the game is played but only undercover operations can truly root out the core of hooligan organizations and prevent violence .
in this respect , hooliganism has continued , only not as much in the public eye . is the 2006 world cup in germany destined to be tainted by hooliganism ? in my opinion , there will be a struggle for dominance at the world cup with the germans and the english at the forefront , with the dutch and the italians also involved .
the germans are perceived as one of the most violent groups in europe , at the 1998 world cup they also most beat a french police officer to death , and they will clearly have a home advantage .

" we are seeing ceremonies which are worryingly similar to what we saw with the burial of ayatollah khomeini , " drewermann said in an interview with afp news agency this week .
" this is not how we should be preaching christianity .

" we are seeing ceremonies which are worryingly similar to what we saw with the burial of ayatollah khomeini , " drewermann said in an interview with afp news agency this week .
" this is not how we should be preaching christianity . " a missed opportunity ? drewermann points to the brief , one-month reign of john paul i in 1978 as a missed opportunity for the catholic church . " with him we would have had someone who followed the concilium of the vatican ii , " which set out a reformist path for the church .
" in fact -lrb- under pope john paul ii -rrb- the opposite happened . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a young man prays in front of a sculpture portraying pope john paul ii next to the basilica della madonna del rosario , in pompei , italy one of the striking images of the mourning for the late pontiff has been the reaction of young people to a man they apparently held in great affection , but drewermann , 64 , attaches little importance to this . " he was like a replacement father figure for them , someone who banned any sexual experience outside of marriage , " drewermann said .
" they did n't really listen to what he said . " failing to counter aids ? he is especially outraged by the late pope 's refusal to back the use of condoms which he says helped aids to ravage africa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many african children have lost their parents to aids " he said condoms were forbidden and yet 25 million people in africa are facing aids , " drewermann said .
" at the world population conference in cairo -lrb- in 1994 -rrb- the vatican blocked a sensible and effective birth control program , siding with the ayatollahs and the american fundamentalists . " under pope john paul ii , the catholic church turned its back on the possibility of a " spiritual opening , " drewermann said .
this , he said , prevented serious reflection on how to read and interpret the bible or , for example , how to interpret the symbols of the new testament such as the immaculate conception . a climate of psychological fear ? drewermann also alleged that the catholic church under the leadership of the late pontiff tacitly encouraged a climate of psychological fear among its followers - a popular theme of his books which have been translated into many languages . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian exorcist father gabriele nanni gives a lesson on satanism for clergy at rome 's regina apostolorum pontifical academy , in february " there were more than 30,000 exorcisms during his reign , " which shows " that there is a widespread belief that satan is within people 's souls , " he said . high hopes for the next pope the theologian also berated pope john paul ii for failing to take a more liberal stance on divorce and re-marriage and said that he " quite simply banned any discussion about the emancipation of women . " but drewermann , who now lives a reclusive life in the western german city of paderborn , without a phone , fax or computer , praises pope john paul ii 's efforts to reach out to third world countries , his opposition to the us-led invasion of iraq and his rejection of " the anti-social and harmful character of capitalism . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drewermann has high hopes for the next occupant of the papal apartment he said he fervently hopes that the next pope will seize the chance to throw open to discussion " issues that have been taboo for centuries " and allow catholics to debate freely with other christians . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans hope for progressive next pope as people in germany keep mourning john paul ii ’ s death , some politicians and church leaders have started thinking about what the next pontificate should be like .

traditional german men are lamenting the loss of their hunter-gatherer identity and bemoaning the wilful ways of their contemporary wives , but is it really such a big deal ? apparently it is .
bookshelves across the nation are laden with a colorful array of do-it-yourself volumes on love and relationships , handy hints for dealing with wayward women and guidebooks which claim to have all the answers to making marriage work . perhaps the only surprising thing is just how much is written by men for men .
one such example is thirty-something german author jens schäfer , who recently published a book about the supposed last bastions of masculinity in an otherwise female-dominated world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are these the faces of real men ?
entitled " echte männer - ein leben im verborgenen " -lrb- real men - a secret life -rrb- , the book highlights the sad lot of the free-thinking german man , driven into darkness and despair at the hands of independently-minded women .
while it does n't pretend to be profound , the book does raise some issues about the male german psyche .
do men , for example , really harbor a desire to be captain of the domestic ship on which their first mate wives and girlfriends are to follow orders with a sweet salute ? your wish is my command ? rainer volz , a sociologist and researcher who specializes in gender issues says there are four types of men floating about in germany . " there are the traditionalists who want to turn back the process of emancipation , " he said .
" they are very insecure but hide behind their macho exterior .
then we have the modern men who do n't believe in competing with women , and who are genuinely happy to help with the kids and housework . " " it 's worth belonging to that group , because they are genuinely the happiest , " he added . then there are the 60 percent of german men who fall somewhere between the two stools , according to volz . " uncertain men are the ones who ca n't decide if tradition should outweigh modernity or vice versa , while pragmatic men say that women should go out to work , but really believe it would be better if they did n't bother . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : safety in numbers ?
so just how much resonance do books like schäfer 's , which look at the dying breed of " real men " - albeit with a degree of humor - have with the country 's male population ? " there has long been a debate on what should become of the classic male territory now that women are world soccer champions and drink beer from the bottle , " a spokeswoman for schäfer 's publisher , piper , said . " the issue is that men no longer always know who or how they are supposed to be , " she said . new norms uwe lohsa , psychotherapist who offers advice to men struggling to keep afloat in the modern world , says the situation in germany is in a state of flux . " the old norms are no longer acceptable and men are faced with the conflict of having to be softees at home and competitive men in the working world .
and that poses huge difficulties to some of them , " lohsa said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women in germany can stay home until their babies outgrow babyhood but the reality is that in the working world at least , men still rule the roost .
a recent study conducted by the federal statistics office shows that women are still under-represented in managerial positions , holding just 33 percent of the country 's top posts .
in addition , it is still widely regarded as acceptable in germany for women to take an extremely long maternity leave .
employers are bound by law to hold a new mother 's job for three years , and many women take full advantage of the generous offer . getting over it so if it is not the working world which is proving too much for the traditional man , what is ?
according to volz , it 's the challenge of defining new male role models , and the quandary of choosing among them . " there are some men who have already rejected the old image of the way a man should be , but then there are others who are hanging on bitterly , " said volz .
" thirty years ago there was only one model of a man , the traditional man .
but that is over once and for all . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the next generation of modern men ?
rather than a crisis-inducer , both he and lohsa see gender equality as a great opportunity for modern men to shrug off some of the responsibilities they have been carting around with them since their dawning day - the pressures of being the sole breadwinner , for example . in order to take advantage of such modern perks though , german men first need to get beyond their own insecurities . tamsin walker , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de it 's not a man 's world despite the german government 's efforts to make paternity leave an attractive option , men are working as much as ever .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 06.04.2005 daimlerchrysler management steels itself großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not much to smile about at the moment daimlerchrysler chief schrempp is likely to get more than an earful at this year 's shareholder meeting .
the company , say analysts , has never been more unstable . trips to the annual shareholders meeting are never much fun for daimlerchrysler ceo jürgen schrempp .
but with his company in a serious downward spiral of late , the meeting on wednesday should be especially agonizing .
daimlerchrysler 's operating profit has dropped , its expansion strategy in asia faltered and , at the beginning of the month , the mercedes division announced the biggest recall of cars in its history . the slip-ups will not only draw the ire of smaller shareholders this year , but the massive investment funds that hold as much as 10 percent of daimlerchrysler 's 1 billion shares .
union investment , which holds 15 million shares , drew up a list of complaints ahead of the meeting .
shadow over the brand among them , that daimlerchrysler top management has had to regularly revise its profit expectations in recent years and that their profit predictions for 2005 to 2007 have been too inexact .
the fund also targeted the recall of 1.3 million mercedes built in the last four years , which began on april 2 . " the shoddy quality of the cars throws a shadow over the value of the brand in the long run , " union investment wrote , according to reports . schrempp admitted as much in an interview with der spiegel newmagazine ahead of wednesday 's meeting .
the company made a mistake by outsourcing the entire electronic components for their navigation and motor management systems , said schrempp .
as he drove around stuttgart one day , the navigation system kept asking him to turn .
" by the third time , i realized that it was n't my fault , " he said in the interview .
" the discussion about quality , " he said later , " is not good for mercedes . " division is smart-ing neither is the money-losing smart brand .
though the two-seat half-size cars made a splash upon being introduced in 1998 , they have n't sold as well as anticipated .
the introduction of new models in recent years has failed to lift sales . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smart cars : not nearly as fast-moving off the sales floors after admitting losses of 2.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.3 billion -rrb- on smart , schrempp and his board announced a 1.2 billion euro restructuring program that will cut jobs and stop the introduction of further models . that likely wo n't stanch the cascade of criticism and uneasiness among shareholders - especially with an ongoing investigation by german prosecutors into several daimlerchrysler employees accused of misusing company resources . last year , schrempp 's management team won approval of 88.49 percent of its investors , around 10 percent less than the year before .
shareholders of companies in germany traditionally ratify a management 's actions over the previous year .
an investor only rarely refuses to give management approval . approval rating to sink but this time around , the number of angry shareholders will only increase .
union investment fund has flat out announced it will not give the management its vote of confidence .

the embattled ceo defended his leadership , but will go from the meeting with a black eye . urged on by the repeated applause of attending shareholders , representative after representative of daimlerchrysler 's biggest investors tore into the company and its embattled chief . " mr. schrempp , the past five years have been marked by mismanagement , " said klaus kaldemorgen , whose investment fund dws owns 10 percent of daimlerchrysler stock .
" shareholder patience is over . " ceo on the defensive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mercedes ' image is taking a beating the us-german company and its veteran ceo have been reeling from a series of serious setbacks that have tarnished the car company 's glowing image in the past year .
the company 's operating profit had to be revised , the smart minicar division is undergoing a 1.3 billion euro -lrb- $ 1.68 billion -rrb- restructuring program , and the company began the biggest recall of cars in its history at the beginning of april . schrempp was well prepared for an onslaught of criticism at wednesday 's meeting in berlin .
in his address , he told the gathering of 8,000 that they would have to brace for six months of bad news due to the high oil prices , a weak dollar , recall costs and restructuring program in the smart division .

thomas meier , the fund manager at union investment , drew applause when he criticized recent developments at mercedes-benz , daimler 's most valuable division . after discovering defects in electrical components of mercedes cars built after 2001 , daimlerchrysler launched a recall of 1.3 million cars at the beginning of april . the problems halved the division 's profit margin last year from 3.1 billion to 1.67 billion euros , said meier , whose fund owns 15 million shares .

compared to other automotive companies and the dax index on the frankfurt stock exchange , daimlerchrysler stock performed poorly over the past year . whereas the dax was in the black , daimlerchrysler stock dropped 0.6 percent in value , continuing a downwards trend in the past five years . last year , schrempp 's management team won approval of 88.49 percent of its investors , around 10 percent less than the year before .
shareholders of companies in germany traditionally ratify management 's actions over the previous year .

german hooligans could be at the forefront of a " struggle for dominance " at the 2006 world cup , according to hooliganism expert professor eric dunning in an interview with dw-world . dw-world : how are german hooligan groups structured ? prof. dunning : those in the former east germany in particular have a neo-nazi core where the task of the organization is more a political one .
the political center of the group can have an agenda other than the one supported by the outer circle which could be along the lines of purely football rivalry .
german hooligan groups with neo-nazi influences within them may have a xenophobic or national pride aspect to their actions which forms a catalyst .
other hooligans may then get swept up in that and fight for what they see as team or national allegiance .
in terms of football violence , the germans are like many other hooligans in so much as some of the violence may be opportunist , spontaneous outbreaks while others can be meticulously organized .
some clashes can be politically motivated while others can be just for the pure adrenalin rush of fighting , something many hooligans have professed to being addictive , calling the buzz " better than sex and drugs . " as with many sophisticated hooligan elements in the modern game , especially within europe , german hooligans use technology in their organization .
mobile phones are used to establish contact , to arrange fights and locations while the internet plays a big role .
while a lot of the chatter is made up of younger hooligans ' bravado which does n't come to much , there is evidence that internet contact does lead to actual confrontations taking place . before the violence in slovenia in march , there had been little or no large scale violence involving german hooligans on the international stage .
what , in your opinion , has been happening in that time ? the problem has never gone away .
it is obviously less of a problem that it was in the 60 's , 70 's and 80 's but it has never been eradicated .
police forces have become more skilled at preventing hooliganism at stadiums and the immediate areas around them ; monitoring entry points to cities and countries and identifying ringleaders .
but hooligans have learnt to take their fighting away from the points where control measures are most efficiently executed .
the fighting has been moved away from stadiums into railway stations , motorway service stations , even towns nowhere near those hosting matches .
surface policing -lrb- visual shows of strength , applied techniques at points of entry and stadiums -rrb- has been successful in keeping violence away from the where the game is played but only undercover operations can truly root out the core of hooligan organizations and prevent violence .
in this respect , hooliganism has continued , only not as much in the public eye . is the 2006 world cup in germany destined to be tainted by hooliganism ? in my opinion , there will be a struggle for dominance at the world cup with the germans and the english at the forefront , with the dutch and the italians also involved .
the germans are perceived as one of the most violent groups in europe , at the 1998 world cup they also most beat a french police officer to death , and they will clearly have a home advantage .
at the world cups which offered little incentive for the hooligans , there was no violence .
in the united states in 1994 , the reputation of the armed us police did much to put hooligans off and the cultural differences in 2002 -lrb- in japan / korea -rrb- meant that very few traveled .
germany , with its proximity to many countries with rival hooligan groups , will not have that luxury . bildunterschrift : nick amies interviewed prof. eric dunning send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german hooligans taint slovenian friendly a " friendly " weekend soccer match between germany and slovenia quickly turned sour as before , during and after the game , german fans participated in racist violence , prompting fears of a revival of hooliganism .

german hooligans could be at the forefront of a " struggle for dominance " at the 2006 world cup , according to hooliganism expert professor eric dunning in an interview with dw-world . dw-world : how are german hooligan groups structured ? prof. dunning : those in the former east germany in particular have a neo-nazi core where the task of the organization is more a political one .
the political center of the group can have an agenda other than the one supported by the outer circle which could be along the lines of purely football rivalry .
german hooligan groups with neo-nazi influences within them may have a xenophobic or national pride aspect to their actions which forms a catalyst .
other hooligans may then get swept up in that and fight for what they see as team or national allegiance .
in terms of football violence , the germans are like many other hooligans in so much as some of the violence may be opportunist , spontaneous outbreaks while others can be meticulously organized .
some clashes can be politically motivated while others can be just for the pure adrenalin rush of fighting , something many hooligans have professed to being addictive , calling the buzz " better than sex and drugs . " as with many sophisticated hooligan elements in the modern game , especially within europe , german hooligans use technology in their organization .
mobile phones are used to establish contact , to arrange fights and locations while the internet plays a big role .
while a lot of the chatter is made up of younger hooligans ' bravado which does n't come to much , there is evidence that internet contact does lead to actual confrontations taking place . before the violence in slovenia in march , there had been little or no large scale violence involving german hooligans on the international stage .
what , in your opinion , has been happening in that time ? the problem has never gone away .
it is obviously less of a problem that it was in the 60 's , 70 's and 80 's but it has never been eradicated .
police forces have become more skilled at preventing hooliganism at stadiums and the immediate areas around them ; monitoring entry points to cities and countries and identifying ringleaders .
but hooligans have learnt to take their fighting away from the points where control measures are most efficiently executed .
the fighting has been moved away from stadiums into railway stations , motorway service stations , even towns nowhere near those hosting matches .

traditional german men are lamenting the loss of their hunter-gatherer identity and bemoaning the wilful ways of their contemporary wives , but is it really such a big deal ? apparently it is .
bookshelves across the nation are laden with a colorful array of do-it-yourself volumes on love and relationships , handy hints for dealing with wayward women and guidebooks which claim to have all the answers to making marriage work . perhaps the only surprising thing is just how much is written by men for men .
one such example is thirty-something german author jens schäfer , who recently published a book about the supposed last bastions of masculinity in an otherwise female-dominated world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are these the faces of real men ?
entitled " echte männer - ein leben im verborgenen " -lrb- real men - a secret life -rrb- , the book highlights the sad lot of the free-thinking german man , driven into darkness and despair at the hands of independently-minded women .
while it does n't pretend to be profound , the book does raise some issues about the male german psyche .
do men , for example , really harbor a desire to be captain of the domestic ship on which their first mate wives and girlfriends are to follow orders with a sweet salute ? your wish is my command ? rainer volz , a sociologist and researcher who specializes in gender issues says there are four types of men floating about in germany . " there are the traditionalists who want to turn back the process of emancipation , " he said .
" they are very insecure but hide behind their macho exterior .
then we have the modern men who do n't believe in competing with women , and who are genuinely happy to help with the kids and housework . " " it 's worth belonging to that group , because they are genuinely the happiest , " he added . then there are the 60 percent of german men who fall somewhere between the two stools , according to volz . " uncertain men are the ones who ca n't decide if tradition should outweigh modernity or vice versa , while pragmatic men say that women should go out to work , but really believe it would be better if they did n't bother . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : safety in numbers ?
so just how much resonance do books like schäfer 's , which look at the dying breed of " real men " - albeit with a degree of humor - have with the country 's male population ? " there has long been a debate on what should become of the classic male territory now that women are world soccer champions and drink beer from the bottle , " a spokeswoman for schäfer 's publisher , piper , said . " the issue is that men no longer always know who or how they are supposed to be , " she said . new norms uwe lohsa , psychotherapist who offers advice to men struggling to keep afloat in the modern world , says the situation in germany is in a state of flux . " the old norms are no longer acceptable and men are faced with the conflict of having to be softees at home and competitive men in the working world .
and that poses huge difficulties to some of them , " lohsa said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women in germany can stay home until their babies outgrow babyhood but the reality is that in the working world at least , men still rule the roost .
a recent study conducted by the federal statistics office shows that women are still under-represented in managerial positions , holding just 33 percent of the country 's top posts .
in addition , it is still widely regarded as acceptable in germany for women to take an extremely long maternity leave .
employers are bound by law to hold a new mother 's job for three years , and many women take full advantage of the generous offer . getting over it so if it is not the working world which is proving too much for the traditional man , what is ?
according to volz , it 's the challenge of defining new male role models , and the quandary of choosing among them . " there are some men who have already rejected the old image of the way a man should be , but then there are others who are hanging on bitterly , " said volz .
" thirty years ago there was only one model of a man , the traditional man .
but that is over once and for all . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the next generation of modern men ?
rather than a crisis-inducer , both he and lohsa see gender equality as a great opportunity for modern men to shrug off some of the responsibilities they have been carting around with them since their dawning day - the pressures of being the sole breadwinner , for example . in order to take advantage of such modern perks though , german men first need to get beyond their own insecurities . tamsin walker , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de it 's not a man 's world despite the german government 's efforts to make paternity leave an attractive option , men are working as much as ever .
so what 's stopping them opting for stay-at-home fatherhood ?
-lrb- march 8 , 2005 -rrb- work-life balance gets boost in germany in germany , where kids are seen as career killers , over 40 percent of highly qualified women choose to remain childless .
but a competition to find the nation 's most family-friendly companies is hoping to change that .
-lrb- april 4 , 2005 -rrb- working women face upward battle germany is lagging far behind when it comes to women in top managerial positions .

the service focused on the late pope 's achievements on the world stage . some 1,000 crowded into the cathedral , where the head of the german bishops ' conference , cardinal karl lehmann , praised the pope as an ambassador for peace and justice .
many in the basilica carried flowers or wore images of the deceased leader of the roman catholic church .
many were crying , the solemn ceremony was attended by high-ranking figures from german politics , including chancellor gerhard schröder , opposition leaders angela merkel and guido westerwelle , several cabinet members and former chancellor helmut kohl . bildunterschrift : german parliamentary president wolfgang thierse , doris schröder-köpf , chancellor gerhard schröder , dieter althaus , prime minister of german state of thuringia , health minister ulla schmidt and former chancellor helmut kohl , from left , attend a service in st. john 's basilica in berlin in memory of john paul ii . lehmann , who is considered a fairly liberal cardinal , admitted that the message of john paul ii , a man with conservative positions of many moral questions , was controversial to many germans . regarding critics ' view that the pope was too authoritarian , lehmann said the polish-born john paul came from a background , namely a dictatorship , which required that the church have " unity and discipline " in order to survive . " for us children of a pluralistic society which often leans toward individualism , it was not an easy message , " he said . focus on positive but lehmann focused primarily on john paul ii 's role in poland 's - and by extension , eastern europe 's - journey from communism to democracy .
he also touched on the pope 's critical stance on the development of modern capitalist societies and the holy father 's work on behalf of the weaker members of society .

rainier 's son , albert , has already assumed his father 's duties as monarch of the tiny state on the mediterranean coast . rainier iii , europe 's longest reigning monarch , was rushed into intensive care two weeks ago when his health took a dramatic turn for the worse .
the 81-year-old prince had been battling lung , heart and kidney problems . as rainier 's health worsened in recent days , the prince 's three children by his late wife , the us film star grace kelly , took turns at his bedside , and he also received visits from monaco 's archbishop and a parish priest . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prince rainier iii leaves the cathedral of monaco with his son , prince albert his only son , the bachelor prince albert , 47 , is his heir .
albert 's bachelor status had for a long time cast a question over the grimaldi family 's rule .
in 2002 , rainier changed monaco 's constitution to allow the offspring of his daughters , caroline , 48 , and stephanie , 40 , to enter the line of succession .
however , last week , albert assumed his father 's duties when hopes that rainier would recover faded . glamour quotient rainier came to the throne in the tiny mediterranean territory in 1949 , three years before britain 's queen elizabeth ii succeeded her father . after years as a jet-setting playboy , he boosted the glamour quotient of his little state when he married kelly in 1956 .
she died in a car crash in the principality in 1982 . monaco was founded when rainier 's grimaldi dynasty took control of the principality in 1297 .
the family was deposed after the french revolution when monaco was united with france , but restored by treaty in 1861 . the principality has a population of around 32,000 , many of them ultra-rich residents enjoying its tax-haven benefits .
much of its image and financial success of the second-smallest state in europe after the holy see has been credited to prince rainier , who oversaw building projects , brought in the formula one motor race , and fostered monaco 's reputation as an exclusive playground for the rich and famous . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de monaco 's prince albert assumes duties monaco 's prince albert is assuming the duties of his father , prince rainier , who is in intensive care in hospital , the palace announced thursday .

the service focused on the late pope 's achievements on the world stage . some 1,000 crowded into the cathedral , where the head of the german bishops ' conference , cardinal karl lehmann , praised the pope as an ambassador for peace and justice .
many in the basilica carried flowers or wore images of the deceased leader of the roman catholic church .
many were crying , the solemn ceremony was attended by high-ranking figures from german politics , including chancellor gerhard schröder , opposition leaders angela merkel and guido westerwelle , several cabinet members and former chancellor helmut kohl . bildunterschrift : german parliamentary president wolfgang thierse , doris schröder-köpf , chancellor gerhard schröder , dieter althaus , prime minister of german state of thuringia , health minister ulla schmidt and former chancellor helmut kohl , from left , attend a service in st. john 's basilica in berlin in memory of john paul ii . lehmann , who is considered a fairly liberal cardinal , admitted that the message of john paul ii , a man with conservative positions of many moral questions , was controversial to many germans . regarding critics ' view that the pope was too authoritarian , lehmann said the polish-born john paul came from a background , namely a dictatorship , which required that the church have " unity and discipline " in order to survive . " for us children of a pluralistic society which often leans toward individualism , it was not an easy message , " he said . focus on positive but lehmann focused primarily on john paul ii 's role in poland 's - and by extension , eastern europe 's - journey from communism to democracy .
he also touched on the pope 's critical stance on the development of modern capitalist societies and the holy father 's work on behalf of the weaker members of society . " john paul ii taught us that when we start thinking only about our own well-being while letting the fate of others out of sight , the freedom of all is at stake , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a large picture of john paul ii stood near the altar .
the basilica was decorated with flowers and incense wafted among the crowd .
strains from the requiem of heinrich ignaz franz von biber , written in the 17th century , filled the cavernous space . anti-war pope wolfgang thierse , parliamentary speaker and a catholic himself , told reporters shortly before the ceremony that he admired the pope particularly for his rejection of war . " the pontiff ’ s efforts to promote peace and understanding are really unparalleled , " he said .
" he ’ ll also be remembered as a man who sought constructive dialogue with other religions , and he stood for reconciliation with the jews and muslims .

the company , say analysts , has never been more unstable . trips to the annual shareholders meeting are never much fun for daimlerchrysler ceo jürgen schrempp .
but with his company in a serious downward spiral of late , the meeting on wednesday should be especially agonizing .
daimlerchrysler 's operating profit has dropped , its expansion strategy in asia faltered and , at the beginning of the month , the mercedes division announced the biggest recall of cars in its history . the slip-ups will not only draw the ire of smaller shareholders this year , but the massive investment funds that hold as much as 10 percent of daimlerchrysler 's 1 billion shares .
union investment , which holds 15 million shares , drew up a list of complaints ahead of the meeting .
shadow over the brand among them , that daimlerchrysler top management has had to regularly revise its profit expectations in recent years and that their profit predictions for 2005 to 2007 have been too inexact .
the fund also targeted the recall of 1.3 million mercedes built in the last four years , which began on april 2 . " the shoddy quality of the cars throws a shadow over the value of the brand in the long run , " union investment wrote , according to reports . schrempp admitted as much in an interview with der spiegel newmagazine ahead of wednesday 's meeting .
the company made a mistake by outsourcing the entire electronic components for their navigation and motor management systems , said schrempp .
as he drove around stuttgart one day , the navigation system kept asking him to turn .
" by the third time , i realized that it was n't my fault , " he said in the interview .
" the discussion about quality , " he said later , " is not good for mercedes . " division is smart-ing neither is the money-losing smart brand .
though the two-seat half-size cars made a splash upon being introduced in 1998 , they have n't sold as well as anticipated .
the introduction of new models in recent years has failed to lift sales . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smart cars : not nearly as fast-moving off the sales floors after admitting losses of 2.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.3 billion -rrb- on smart , schrempp and his board announced a 1.2 billion euro restructuring program that will cut jobs and stop the introduction of further models . that likely wo n't stanch the cascade of criticism and uneasiness among shareholders - especially with an ongoing investigation by german prosecutors into several daimlerchrysler employees accused of misusing company resources . last year , schrempp 's management team won approval of 88.49 percent of its investors , around 10 percent less than the year before .
shareholders of companies in germany traditionally ratify a management 's actions over the previous year .
an investor only rarely refuses to give management approval . approval rating to sink but this time around , the number of angry shareholders will only increase .
union investment fund has flat out announced it will not give the management its vote of confidence .
analysts say the fund management company seb invest and germany 's largest fund company , dws investment , will also likely withhold their approval . " daimler has repeatedly disappointed over several years , " said thomas körfgen , the head of equity funds at seb .

german hooligans could be at the forefront of a " struggle for dominance " at the 2006 world cup , according to hooliganism expert professor eric dunning in an interview with dw-world . dw-world : how are german hooligan groups structured ? prof. dunning : those in the former east germany in particular have a neo-nazi core where the task of the organization is more a political one .
the political center of the group can have an agenda other than the one supported by the outer circle which could be along the lines of purely football rivalry .
german hooligan groups with neo-nazi influences within them may have a xenophobic or national pride aspect to their actions which forms a catalyst .
other hooligans may then get swept up in that and fight for what they see as team or national allegiance .
in terms of football violence , the germans are like many other hooligans in so much as some of the violence may be opportunist , spontaneous outbreaks while others can be meticulously organized .
some clashes can be politically motivated while others can be just for the pure adrenalin rush of fighting , something many hooligans have professed to being addictive , calling the buzz " better than sex and drugs . " as with many sophisticated hooligan elements in the modern game , especially within europe , german hooligans use technology in their organization .
mobile phones are used to establish contact , to arrange fights and locations while the internet plays a big role .
while a lot of the chatter is made up of younger hooligans ' bravado which does n't come to much , there is evidence that internet contact does lead to actual confrontations taking place . before the violence in slovenia in march , there had been little or no large scale violence involving german hooligans on the international stage .
what , in your opinion , has been happening in that time ? the problem has never gone away .
it is obviously less of a problem that it was in the 60 's , 70 's and 80 's but it has never been eradicated .
police forces have become more skilled at preventing hooliganism at stadiums and the immediate areas around them ; monitoring entry points to cities and countries and identifying ringleaders .
but hooligans have learnt to take their fighting away from the points where control measures are most efficiently executed .
the fighting has been moved away from stadiums into railway stations , motorway service stations , even towns nowhere near those hosting matches .
surface policing -lrb- visual shows of strength , applied techniques at points of entry and stadiums -rrb- has been successful in keeping violence away from the where the game is played but only undercover operations can truly root out the core of hooligan organizations and prevent violence .
in this respect , hooliganism has continued , only not as much in the public eye . is the 2006 world cup in germany destined to be tainted by hooliganism ? in my opinion , there will be a struggle for dominance at the world cup with the germans and the english at the forefront , with the dutch and the italians also involved .
the germans are perceived as one of the most violent groups in europe , at the 1998 world cup they also most beat a french police officer to death , and they will clearly have a home advantage .
at the world cups which offered little incentive for the hooligans , there was no violence .
in the united states in 1994 , the reputation of the armed us police did much to put hooligans off and the cultural differences in 2002 -lrb- in japan / korea -rrb- meant that very few traveled .
germany , with its proximity to many countries with rival hooligan groups , will not have that luxury . bildunterschrift : nick amies interviewed prof. eric dunning send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german hooligans taint slovenian friendly a " friendly " weekend soccer match between germany and slovenia quickly turned sour as before , during and after the game , german fans participated in racist violence , prompting fears of a revival of hooliganism .
-lrb- march 28 , 2005 -rrb- police gear up for euro 2004 the european soccer championships in portugal this summer will host the largest security operation ever in the history of the game .
german , english and portuguese police are already operational in and around the country .

our readers shared their views on the topics . un reform reform is definitely needed .
the security council must be expanded and the veto power abolished .
consensus within the security council is very important .
i strongly support a seat on the security council for germany .
rotating seats on the council are a good idea .
my suggestion is the formation of an advisory council from the remaining members of the general assembly capable of reviewing issues and calling the general assembly to action on specific issues .
this council and the general assembly should be able to join with the security council on specific issues and disputes . - thomas clark bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of the united nations general assembly the un will not be as effective as it wishes to be , because a strong country can by-pass un resolutions more easily than one with less impact , but the more countries have some say , the better for the world .
veto power should be scratched ! - elisabeth heptner as the world seems to be moving in a more global direction , i think the concept of the security council is a bit out of date - not to mention counter-productive , with respect to the veto powers .
better still would be a strengthened general assembly , of which germany is already a member , that uses a two thirds majority ruling .
in this way it puts the voice in the hands of the world community instead of the hands of a privileged few . - andy sporner , us citizen in germany queen camilla hell no ! no way . not only should she be kept away from the title of queen , but i am furious that she is being given the title of her royal highness after the wedding .
diana was stripped of her rightful title hrh by a mean spirited and spiteful queen .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : passing of a pope pope 's funeral set for friday the question of succession a pope of unity but also division a life at odds with the germans europe -pipe- 06.04.2005 the long way to a new pope großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : white smoke is the signal catholics will be waiting for " habemus papam " - " we have a pope . "
catholics could hear these words as early as april 18 , as the cardinals will begin the highly regulated process of electing a new pontiff on that day . the so-called conclave will choose john paul ii 's successor .
it is made up of cardinals that have not yet turned 80 - there are currently 117 of them . while the cardinals already have a chance to discuss candidates since many of them arrived in rome ahead of the late pope 's funeral , the actual election can not begin any earlier than 15 days after john paul ii 's death nor later than 20 days after his passing .
vatican officials announced wednesday that cardinals have chosen april 18 as the day to begin deliberations . the late pope 's will will be published on thursday . simple requirements theoretically , there 's a huge number of people who qualify for the job of pontiff . " every catholic man , who fulfills the requirements to become a bishop or priest , can become pope , " said alfred hierold , a professor for church law at bamberg university . while the " servant of the servants of god " could therefore be a layman , he would quickly have to be made bishop as the pope is also always the bishop of rome .
that problem has n't arisen for centuries , however : since 1378 , every pope has been a cardinal before his election . gathering in rome , cardinals will stay at " domus sanctae marthae , " a spartan guest house behind st. peter 's cathedral in vatican city . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reporters stand in one of the cells in which the cardinals slept during the last 1978 conclave " the rooms have a metal bed , a large desk , a chair , a small bathroom and stone floors , " said hierold , who has stayed there himself . complete reclusion on the first day of the conclave , cardinals celebrate a special mass called " pro eligendo papa , " or " for the election of the pope . "
traditionally , they then retreat to the vatican 's sistine chapel to begin their deliberations .
however , this time the cardinals will not be confined to the chapel .
they 'll be permitted to roam about within the walls of the vatican , though they will still be banned from contact with the outside world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vatican 's sistine chapel with the " last judgement " fresco on the wall at the end " if a cardinal brings along his mobile phone , there 's nothing that can be done , " hierold said , adding that the ballot box is placed underneath michelangelo 's famous " last judgement " fresco .
" but it 's not allowed . " the chapel is even checked for listening devices and cardinals as well any support staff have to swear that they will remain silent about anything that takes place within and that they will not be influenced by others in their decision . bribes and intrigues there 's good reason for that as bribing and intrigues were not uncommon at previous papal elections .
until 1903 , european monarchs also played a role in electing the leader of the catholic church . the cardinals keep meeting until they have agreed on a new pope .
the longest conclave lasted three years .
in order to be elected pope , a candidate has to receive two thirds of the votes .
should he not receive them right away , four rounds of votes are cast each day , separated by prayers .
the first break will take place if a new pontiff has not been elected after three days . should cardinals fail to agree after 34 voting rounds , they can decide to elect a pope by majority . dark smoke , white smoke smoke is used to announce the result of each vote as the ballots are burned each time .
if the vote has been unsuccessful , wet straw is added to the fire , causing dark smoke to rise above the chapel .
once a pope has been chosen , dry straw is added and white smoke signals the beginning of a new pontificate .
i in addition to white smoke , the faithful will this time also hear the ringing of the bells of st peter 's cathedral to announce a decision . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinals congregated for the first day in the bologna hall at the vatican on monday inside , cardinals acknowledge their new supreme leader as well .
everyone except the new pontiff folds up the little canopy above his seat .
the new pope is then asked what name he chooses and officially becomes pope once a document has been drawn up that certifies his election . john paul ii 's successor will then put on the white papal clothes and accept a pledge of allegiance by the other cardinals .
only then will the dean of the college of cardinals , germany 's joseph ratzinger , step on the balcony of st. peter 's cathedral . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joseph ratzinger " annuntio vobis gaudium magnum , habemus papam , " he 'll tell the cheering crowd .
" i announce to you with great happiness : we have a pope . " this time , the latter might get a bit complicated , as ratzinger himself has good chances of becoming the next pope . rafael heiling -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the question of succession with the death of pope john paul ii , a chain of events laid down by centuries of papal tradition swung into action , but who will emerge as the next pontiff is a guess no one dares to hazard .
-lrb- april 3 , 2005 -rrb- what happens after the pope dies ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : passing of a pope pope 's funeral set for friday the question of succession a pope of unity but also division a life at odds with the germans europe -pipe- 06.04.2005 the long way to a new pope großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : white smoke is the signal catholics will be waiting for " habemus papam " - " we have a pope . "
catholics could hear these words as early as april 18 , as the cardinals will begin the highly regulated process of electing a new pontiff on that day . the so-called conclave will choose john paul ii 's successor .
it is made up of cardinals that have not yet turned 80 - there are currently 117 of them . while the cardinals already have a chance to discuss candidates since many of them arrived in rome ahead of the late pope 's funeral , the actual election can not begin any earlier than 15 days after john paul ii 's death nor later than 20 days after his passing .
vatican officials announced wednesday that cardinals have chosen april 18 as the day to begin deliberations . the late pope 's will will be published on thursday . simple requirements theoretically , there 's a huge number of people who qualify for the job of pontiff . " every catholic man , who fulfills the requirements to become a bishop or priest , can become pope , " said alfred hierold , a professor for church law at bamberg university . while the " servant of the servants of god " could therefore be a layman , he would quickly have to be made bishop as the pope is also always the bishop of rome .
that problem has n't arisen for centuries , however : since 1378 , every pope has been a cardinal before his election . gathering in rome , cardinals will stay at " domus sanctae marthae , " a spartan guest house behind st. peter 's cathedral in vatican city . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reporters stand in one of the cells in which the cardinals slept during the last 1978 conclave " the rooms have a metal bed , a large desk , a chair , a small bathroom and stone floors , " said hierold , who has stayed there himself . complete reclusion on the first day of the conclave , cardinals celebrate a special mass called " pro eligendo papa , " or " for the election of the pope . "
traditionally , they then retreat to the vatican 's sistine chapel to begin their deliberations .
however , this time the cardinals will not be confined to the chapel .
they 'll be permitted to roam about within the walls of the vatican , though they will still be banned from contact with the outside world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vatican 's sistine chapel with the " last judgement " fresco on the wall at the end " if a cardinal brings along his mobile phone , there 's nothing that can be done , " hierold said , adding that the ballot box is placed underneath michelangelo 's famous " last judgement " fresco .
" but it 's not allowed . " the chapel is even checked for listening devices and cardinals as well any support staff have to swear that they will remain silent about anything that takes place within and that they will not be influenced by others in their decision . bribes and intrigues there 's good reason for that as bribing and intrigues were not uncommon at previous papal elections .
until 1903 , european monarchs also played a role in electing the leader of the catholic church . the cardinals keep meeting until they have agreed on a new pope .
the longest conclave lasted three years .
in order to be elected pope , a candidate has to receive two thirds of the votes .
should he not receive them right away , four rounds of votes are cast each day , separated by prayers .
the first break will take place if a new pontiff has not been elected after three days . should cardinals fail to agree after 34 voting rounds , they can decide to elect a pope by majority . dark smoke , white smoke smoke is used to announce the result of each vote as the ballots are burned each time .
if the vote has been unsuccessful , wet straw is added to the fire , causing dark smoke to rise above the chapel .
once a pope has been chosen , dry straw is added and white smoke signals the beginning of a new pontificate .
i in addition to white smoke , the faithful will this time also hear the ringing of the bells of st peter 's cathedral to announce a decision . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinals congregated for the first day in the bologna hall at the vatican on monday inside , cardinals acknowledge their new supreme leader as well .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 06.04.2005 in search of the real man großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who is really on top in germany ?
traditional german men are lamenting the loss of their hunter-gatherer identity and bemoaning the wilful ways of their contemporary wives , but is it really such a big deal ? apparently it is .
bookshelves across the nation are laden with a colorful array of do-it-yourself volumes on love and relationships , handy hints for dealing with wayward women and guidebooks which claim to have all the answers to making marriage work . perhaps the only surprising thing is just how much is written by men for men .
one such example is thirty-something german author jens schäfer , who recently published a book about the supposed last bastions of masculinity in an otherwise female-dominated world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are these the faces of real men ?
entitled " echte männer - ein leben im verborgenen " -lrb- real men - a secret life -rrb- , the book highlights the sad lot of the free-thinking german man , driven into darkness and despair at the hands of independently-minded women .
while it does n't pretend to be profound , the book does raise some issues about the male german psyche .
do men , for example , really harbor a desire to be captain of the domestic ship on which their first mate wives and girlfriends are to follow orders with a sweet salute ? your wish is my command ? rainer volz , a sociologist and researcher who specializes in gender issues says there are four types of men floating about in germany . " there are the traditionalists who want to turn back the process of emancipation , " he said .
" they are very insecure but hide behind their macho exterior .
then we have the modern men who do n't believe in competing with women , and who are genuinely happy to help with the kids and housework . " " it 's worth belonging to that group , because they are genuinely the happiest , " he added . then there are the 60 percent of german men who fall somewhere between the two stools , according to volz . " uncertain men are the ones who ca n't decide if tradition should outweigh modernity or vice versa , while pragmatic men say that women should go out to work , but really believe it would be better if they did n't bother . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : safety in numbers ?
so just how much resonance do books like schäfer 's , which look at the dying breed of " real men " - albeit with a degree of humor - have with the country 's male population ? " there has long been a debate on what should become of the classic male territory now that women are world soccer champions and drink beer from the bottle , " a spokeswoman for schäfer 's publisher , piper , said . " the issue is that men no longer always know who or how they are supposed to be , " she said . new norms uwe lohsa , psychotherapist who offers advice to men struggling to keep afloat in the modern world , says the situation in germany is in a state of flux . " the old norms are no longer acceptable and men are faced with the conflict of having to be softees at home and competitive men in the working world .
and that poses huge difficulties to some of them , " lohsa said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women in germany can stay home until their babies outgrow babyhood but the reality is that in the working world at least , men still rule the roost .
a recent study conducted by the federal statistics office shows that women are still under-represented in managerial positions , holding just 33 percent of the country 's top posts .
in addition , it is still widely regarded as acceptable in germany for women to take an extremely long maternity leave .
employers are bound by law to hold a new mother 's job for three years , and many women take full advantage of the generous offer . getting over it so if it is not the working world which is proving too much for the traditional man , what is ?
according to volz , it 's the challenge of defining new male role models , and the quandary of choosing among them . " there are some men who have already rejected the old image of the way a man should be , but then there are others who are hanging on bitterly , " said volz .
" thirty years ago there was only one model of a man , the traditional man .
but that is over once and for all . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the next generation of modern men ?
rather than a crisis-inducer , both he and lohsa see gender equality as a great opportunity for modern men to shrug off some of the responsibilities they have been carting around with them since their dawning day - the pressures of being the sole breadwinner , for example . in order to take advantage of such modern perks though , german men first need to get beyond their own insecurities . tamsin walker , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : it 's not a man 's world despite the german government 's efforts to make paternity leave an attractive option , men are working as much as ever .
so what 's stopping them opting for stay-at-home fatherhood ?

if something is not done , two of the city 's largest cemeteries could be full within five years , it said .
the 50-year-old crematorium at thornhill is also in a poor condition and in need of modernisation .
proposals including upgrading the crematorium and developing new burial areas will go before the council 's executive later this week .
the report into council bereavement services is the result of a study by the community and adult services scrutiny committee .
the committee concluded that the current situation created a negative impression of cardiff and the council to the thousands of people attending funerals each year .
it also made the continued delivery of high-quality funeral services difficult for both the staff and the other professionals involved , it said .
it has been estimated that thornhill cemetery could be full within three to four years , followed by western cemetery in ely in five years .
the report , which goes to the council on thursday , contains recommendations including : implementing the full programme of improvements for thornhill crematorium development of new areas for burial and the range of burial options raising the profile of the service internally by ensuring bereavement services are considered fully in any new policies developing new areas for burial at the two main cemeteries and creating a new cemetery .
committee chair councillor brian finn , labour , said : " providing quality services for the bereaved is critically important but often does n't get the profile it deserves .
the council is being urged to take action " in an era of huge demands on resources and land , bereavement must not be allowed to slip down our list of priorities . "
cardiff council deals with over 4,000 funerals each year and more than 700,000 people visit its cemeteries and crematorium .
more than 2,500 cremations take place each year .
the city is ranked 22 out of 82 in the institute of cemetery and crematorium management 's league table of authorities providing burial and cremation services .
the report says burial space capacity has " reached a near-critical point " - a situation made worse by the increase in the population of cardiff by 95,000 since the last cemetery - at thornhill - was opened in 1953 .
it points out that , although the council 's unitary development plan -lrb- udp -rrb- makes reference to the need for additional cemetery space , it makes no commitment to build one .
at present , cardiff council does not allow the re-use of old graves , though other authorities have had to do so to cope with demands .
conservative councillor jon burns said : " it is very clear the current situation is unsustainable as the report has highlighted .
" the council will need to think long and hard about viable alternatives for burial sites . "
plaid councillor delme bowen said : " the upgrading at thornhill is long overdue both in respect of the improvement of quality and capacity . "
the liberal democrats were not immediately available for comment .
