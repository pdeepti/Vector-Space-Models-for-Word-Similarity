here dw-world answers some frequently asked questions . the world cup 2006 in germany is one of the hottest events on the horizon in the world of sport .
unfortunately , however , ticket allocation for the upcoming games is a potentially heart-breaking process .
with millions of fans wanting to get a piece of the live action , dw-world offers its readers an insight into the minefield that is buying a world cup ticket . q : where do i get the tickets ? a : well , officially , on the fifa website - www.fifaworldcup.com - and only there .
fifa is warning that offers of tickets combined with travel arrangements which are not affiliated with supporters ' organizations or the world soccer governing body itself can not be taken seriously .
there are less credible and less legal ways to get tickets -lrb- see below -rrb- that dw-world does not advocate . q : how do i get a ticket ? a : applications must be completed online and paid for by credit card .
in germany , you can pay via bank transfer or debit card as long as you hold a german bank account . q : can one also order by telephone ? a. yes .
after the conditions for ticket sales were announced in january , a phone line was set up offering automated instruction in german , english , french and spanish .
individual questions can not be answered .
telephone : 00 49 -lrb- 0 -rrb- 180 526 2006 q : how many tickets can i order ? a : four tickets per household per game - from the qualifying round up to the final and only seven tickets per customer . q : when can i start buying tickets ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a : the first phase of official sales begins on feb .
1 , 2005 exclusively on the fifa website .
an important point to note is that the precise date of ordering within the first sales phase is immaterial .
applications will not be processed chronologically , but rather via a lottery at the end of the first phase .
there should be a second round of ticket sales in summer 2005 . q : how many tickets are going on sale ? a : too few , we 're afraid .
to get tickets for the world cup , one must not be quick but be lucky .
officially there are 3.2 million tickets for the world cup in germany with 800,000 available in the host country itself .
and remember , not all of them will go on sale at the same time .
just half will become available form the opening date of sales .
and as with all sporting events , not all the tickets are allocated to the everyday fan . q : what happens to the other tickets then ?
a : tickets are held back not only for the associations contesting the 2006 finals but also for the associations which fail to qualify .
blocks of tickets are also set aside for the official partners , official suppliers and the tv partners .
in total , that could represent a good 450,000 tickets for sponsors and the fifa organizations .
it should be borne in mind that many of these tickets are then used in promotional activity and prize competitions , so that a substantial number of tickets does return to the ordinary fans .
then there are those that are not claimed and returned for sale .
these will also eventually make their way into the public domain .
q : how much can i expect to pay ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a : match ticket prices were announced in december 2003 , ranging from € 35 for category 4 seats at the 47 group matches to € 600 , the most expensive category 1 ticket for the final .
vip 's tickets , of course , can totally eclipse these prices with the added extras that come along with them .
possibly the premium package for berlin includes tickets for five games plus the final for four people with additional private parking space , separate entrance to the stadium and gourmet food all for a princely € 48,000 . q : can i get tickets through any other channels ? a : in principle , yes .
fifa are very strict on the flow of tickets and tickets allocated by name must be presented by the bearer whose name appears on the card .
those who can not prove that they are the bearer will be ejected from the ground or barred entry .
fifa is also trying its best to control the flow of black market tickets on internet auction sites like ebay and similar punishments for holders of tickets bought this way can be expected . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but , if you have a strong nerve , and good luck , there are always tickets to be had outside the stadiums on match day .
touts will , however , be more than aware of the demand and tickets will be extortionate in comparison to those garnered through legitimate channels .
it is unlikely to be a buyer 's market like the european championships where semi-final tickets were reportedly passing hands for as little as € 5 . q : does anyone know which team will play when and where ? a : only the german team has an itinerary at the moment because , as hosts , they are the only ones who are guaranteed to be there come summer 2006 .
germany opens the tournament in the first game on the june 9 in munich , and plays its other group games on june 14 in dortmund and june 20 in berlin .
all other teams must still qualify .
the draw for the group stages for the finals will take place in december in leipzig once all the qualifiers are known . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world cup tickets scarce before sales start the coming weeks are sure to see some disgruntled soccer fans .
organizers for the 2006 world cup announced monday that only a third of the tournament tickets will be up for sale to the general public .
-lrb- jan .
25 , 2005 -rrb- everything still to play for the line-up for the world cup in germany in 2006 is looking a little bare at the moment .
only the hosts are guaranteed a place which means 52 nations are still battling it out in the qualification stages .
-lrb- jan .
31 , 2005 -rrb- opinion : a shadow over german soccer german soccer has struggled recently .
as bundesliga teams flounder in europe , the national side is trying to rebuild after a devastating euro 2004 .

but this week the show , with its people-next-door characters , aired its 1,000th episode . many of them are n't all that sexy , hardly any are rich , and they 're usually never confronted with amnesia , alien abductions , evil twins or any of the other outlandish situations that have become part and parcel of many of the world 's serial dramas . instead , up and down lindenstrasse , the fictional street in a munich suburb where the series of the same name is set , fairly ordinary people meet the triumphs and tragedies that many experience in real life : infidelity , failing marriages , first love , parental disapproval , new careers or youth violence .
the characters are like the neighbors next door and the german public has been tuning in faithfully to find out where their on-screen lives are taking them for 20 years or 1,000 episodes . for many germans , sunday evening from 6:40 to 7:10 p.m. is " lindenstrasse " time , and woe to the person who calls or shows up unannounced at the door of a fan during that period . borrowed from the brits the show 's premise was borrowed from the bbc 's " coronation street , " britain 's longest-running television soap opera , which is set in a gritty industrial suburb of manchester .
the " lindenstrasse " crowd has less coal dust to contend with , but like their british cousins , the characters on the outskirts of munich are overwhelmingly midway or slightly lower on the socio-economic scale .
instead of super models , oil barons or jet-setting cosmetic company heads , the folks who live or work on lindenstrasse are housewives , taxi drivers , travel agents or hair stylists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lindenstrasse street sign the concerns of the beimer , kling , zenker or sarikaki families are generally the concerns of average people .
they complain about high taxes , unemployment or like to share the latest gossip about the super 's wife .
frau beimer 's husband has left her for a younger woman .
a greek family is thrown into turmoil when the oldest son wants to marry a german woman . controversial issues but lindenstrasse has not been afraid to tackle more controversial issues and has been on the forefront regarding several topics other shows have been reluctant to touch .
the daughter of one of the central families once suffered from bulimia ; another son was born with down 's syndrome . an hiv-positive woman passed on the virus to her son and a gay couple took care of the boy after his mother 's death from the disease .
lesbian storylines have been running for years and , in 1990 , the show featured the first gay kiss on german primetime tv . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actress marie-luise marjan and hans w. geißendörfer , the series producer the characters ' responses to many controversial issues have led some to complain that the creator and producer of the show , hans geissendörfer -lrb- photo -rrb- , uses the show to present his own left-of-center political opinions .
critics say other views are represented as being odd or out of touch with the times .
that , they say , is problematic since the show airs on german public broadcasting and , due to its station 's charter , has a duty to remain politically neutral . millions watch every week for the 1,000th episode , more than seven million tuned in for a special 45-minute broadcast .
while " lindenstrasse " has lost some its audience to " younger " shows with a strong teen element , such as " good times and bad " and " forbidden love , " the show still attracts on average 4.8 million viewers on sunday evenings . its current contract with west german broadcasting , which produces the show in a suburb of cologne , runs through 2008 and fans are guaranteed at least another 219 episodes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : annemarie wendl as else kling what fans wo n't be seeing much more of is likely germany 's most famous concierge , else kling , who has been a feature on the show since the beginning .
annemarie wendl , the 90-year-old actress who has played the part for 20 years , says she will step down sometime in 2005 .
but she does n't want to die peacefully in her sleep surrounded by loved ones and flowers .
" i want to be murdered , not have some boring death in bed , " she told germany 's bild am sonntag newspaper .

27 german president host köhler on tuesday began an official four-day state visit to israel .
the highlight of his visit will a be a controversial speech before the israeli parliament on wednesday . köhler , the former head of the international monetary fund , has made a name for himself as a man who hates small talk and likes to get down to business right away .
his talks with high-ranking israeli leaders later on tuesdy will provide him with another opportunity to do just that . but for several reasons , the visit is anything but a routine job for germany 's president , said manfred lahnstein , the head of the hamburg-based german-israeli society . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we have encouraging developments in the middle east and that is a good background for the visit , " lahnstein said , adding that it marks the 40th anniversary of diplomatic relations between germany and israel .
" we have had the celebrations marking the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the auschwitz annihilation camp .
so you have our ongoing historic responsibility , the fostering and strengthening of excellent albeit not normal relations between the two countries and some political processes , which look promising . " german speech sparks protests on wednesday , köhler is due to deliver a speech on german-israeli relations before parliament , the knesset .
his plan to hold his speech in german has already provoked protests among a small number of israeli deputies who are poised to leave the hall when köhler starts his speech . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knesset in jerusalem israel ’ s minister of health dani naveh said he plans to boycott president köhler ’ s speech .
he told the right-wing israeli daily newspaper maariv that as long as holocaust survivors are still alive , german should not be spoken in israel 's parliament . his comment echoed the feelings of a number of parliamentary deputies .
the acting president of the knesset , hemi doron , said he would ask his superiors either to cancel the speech or to ask köhler to hold it in english .
doron , whose grandfather was killed in the holocaust , said his feet had never touched german soil and he never bought german products .
so he could not allow the german language to be spoken in the jewish people ’ s house of parliament . " a normal procedure " but lahnstein said köhler 's decision to speak in german was nothing unusual nor unprecendented . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former president johannes rau -lrb- right -rrb- and his israeli counterpart , moshe katzav -lrb- left -rrb- in germany in 2002 .
" that is a normal procedure that a president of a country who visits the parliament of another country and delivers a speech does so in his own tongue , " he said , adding that former german president johannes rau -lrb- photo -rrb- was the first to do so five years ago .
" on the other hand we have to understand that there are some members of the knesset , which for very personal reasons can not live with it and they will leave the hall of the knesset .
this happened five years ago as well and we have to understand it , and the rest should be dignity on both sides and it will be dignity on both sides . " some jewish public figures have spoken out in favor of köhler using his native german .
knesset speaker reuven rivlin , who was instrumental in the decision to allow the visiting president to deliver his speech in german , insisted it would be better not to extend an invitation than to demand that the guest speak in a different language .
and israel ’ s former ambassador to germany , avi primor -lrb- photo below -rrb- , also said he thinks there is no reason why köhler should not speak in german . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : avi primor " first of all , the relations between israel and germany are such that this kind of a question should n't arise at all , " he said .
" and secondly , the german language is not only the language of the nazis , but was a very important language before the nazis and is a very important language after the nazis .
it was a very important language for the jewish people . " german far-right overshadows visit but political observers in germany are also afraid that köhler ’ s trip to israel may be overshadowed by a recent scandal surrounding the far-right national party -lrb- npd -rrb- in saxony ’ s regional assembly .
npd leaders there had likened the end-of-wwii allied bombings on german towns to the holocaust , giving rise to a fresh debate about anti-semitism in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a yellow star of david that jews were forced to wear by the nazis is on display at yad vashem manfred lahnstein said the german president will have no way of dodging the issue , but is confident that the incident will not mar köhler ’ s talks with israeli leaders . during his trip , the german president will also take out time to visit the yad vashem holocaust memorial where he ’ s due to honor the six million jews murdered by the nazis . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de remembering germany 's darkest place commemorative events marking the 60th anniversary of the liberation of auschwitz continued throughout thursday as world leaders spoke of an evil that must never be allowed to surface again .

croats , serbs and albanians are hacking into each others ' web sites and leaving nationalistic slogans .
on online forums , bitter political debates have been ignited . in december , albanian internet enthusiasts hacked into the kosovo-based site of the serbian orthodox church .
instead of the usual pictures of the monastery found there , the words " kosovo will gain its independence " popped up on web browsers . in response , serb hackers attacked the online offering of the albanian capital tirana and posted a stream of curses on the page .
over the past four weeks , some 100 web sites from serbia as well as about a dozen albanian ones were illegally altered . virtual attacks the trigger for these virtual attacks between serbs and croats in the second part of december was an incident in which a nationally minded serb basketball player was refused entry to croatia .
croatian hackers let their dissatisfaction over the athlete 's political stance be widely known by launching a virtual attack on the homepage of serbia 's largest private broadcaster , " pink . "
the hackers posted the words " greetings to greater serbia " on the site , accompanied by the croatian flag and emblem . that did n't please serbian hackers and they in turn gained access to the official site of the croatian world ski champion janica kostelic , leaving their own message of " greetings to croatia " behind , along with photographs of the serbian national team .
in the following two weeks , more than 80 croatian and serbian web sites were manipulated , with each side posting more and less explicit nationalistic slogans on " enemy " sites . why and to what end ? the offenders from both countries told media outlets that there were n't any nationalistic motives behind their actions , but that they simply wanted to draw attention to their hacking abilities .
" it does n't matter to me whether i hack into a serbian , croatian , albanian or whatever kind of site , " one notorious serbian hacker who calls himself " acid cookie " said in a radio interview . another one , who goes under the code name " dtm , " explains that he was only interested in pointing out the security lapses in online networks in the balkans .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 01.02.2005 reinventing german innovation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an originial idea is hardly enough to power innovation in germany a recent study into the " to be or not to be " of self-employment revealed a national reluctance among germans to go it alone .
but inventors are crying out for a chance to give the country a cutting-edge status . the study , conducted in the eu and the us over a period of five years , was conclusive proof that entrepreneurial spirit does not run through the veins of german society the same way as the desire for steady and secure work .
while more than 61 percent of americans expressed a desire to run their own show , the same percentage of germans said they were put off the idea because of a fear of failure .
yet , there is undoubtedly more to the picture than that , and given the current blot which unemployment is smudging over germany 's social and economic landscape , embracing the lesser known devil and striking out alone could be the answer to some people 's problems .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting innovation taken seriously is a painstaking process heino hanisch , a berlin-based inventor and jack of many trades , has been out of work for several years .
his continued attempts to get a foot back onto the employment ladder have been repeatedly thwarted by his age - he 's in his mid-40 's - and long-term jobless status .
he is realistic rather than pessimistic when he says he may never again be gainfully employed .
" i see self-employment as the only way forward , but that 's not easy either , because you encounter so many hurdles , financial and otherwise , to get there , " hanisch said .
a question of cash for german inventors , the problem with getting out there and turning their innovative dreams into reality is intrinsically linked to a lack of funding .
" as an inventor , you need more than just an idea .
you need money to register the patent , ideally also money to employ a patent lawyer .
you have to create a prototype which can be shown at exhibitions or trade fairs , and then , most importantly , you need money for advertising , " inventor and engineer peter stepina said .
essentially it all boils down to cash .
and germany 's banks are not champing at the bit to hurl their money at independent creative minds .
" there 's no point in even applying for support from the bank unless you have a lot of your own capital , " hanisch added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : banks keep inventors at arms ' length since very few do , many potentially lucrative inventions are stopped in their tracks .
" of course it makes a difference to us if an inventor is prepared to invest his own money into his idea , but we also want to see a thorough business plan and be sure that the inventor has done his market analysis , " christian hotz , a spokesman for deutsche bank said .
again , that 's a process which the average inventor can not afford .
" it 's a case of the cat biting itself in the tail , " hanisch lamented .
but one new initiative set up by the chamber for trade and industry -lrb- ihk -rrb- in the german city of duisburg is blowing some fresh wind into the stagnant world of independent invention .
a new " idea " the project , aptly entitled " idea " is an original attempt to help inventors towards their ultimate goal of turning their models into money .
a pool of some 80 experts from all fields and walks of life work on a voluntary basis to assess the viability of designs and ideas submitted to them from the innovator on the street .
" the problem at the moment is that there is no financial backing available for individuals .
if an inventor wants to access funding , the only way to go about it is to team up with a company .
even the government initiative for patent funding is out of bounds to the individual , " ihk innovations consultant rolf berenz said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new invention for pasta on the go berenz hopes the project will establish a network of people who work together to promote innovation within germany - not only technological innovation but also in the realms of service and management .
he calls it a one-stop shop in which clever ideas are analyzed , assessed and , where appropriate , the inventor gets feedback from a panel of experts .
what about " me incorporated ? "
it 's certainly a step in the right direction and a more structured move to support an often marginalized profession .
at the moment , the only other possibility inventors have at securing external support is through a government-funded program called " me incorporated , " which is designed to encourage the unemployed to start their own businesses .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dog-walking machine has n't yet taken off but getting into the program requires more than a brilliant idea .
" candidates have to get their ideas analyzed by an expert to assess the likelihood of success , " ellen queisser , spokeswoman for the labor office in berlin said .
it 's a vicious circle for the likes of heino hanisch , who believes it takes imagination to see just how a new product might succeed .
" the experts who are supposed to check for viability are long-term employees who have no idea about being self-employed and no idea about what will or will not work . "
whether that is true or not , it remains a fact that german inventors are out there and feeling frustrated about being prevented from adding some dynamism to the entrepreneurial face of the nation . tamsin walker , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de protecting patents at a snail 's pace in the age of globalization , international patents are needed to protect intellectual property .

27 german president host köhler on tuesday began an official four-day state visit to israel .
the highlight of his visit will a be a controversial speech before the israeli parliament on wednesday . köhler , the former head of the international monetary fund , has made a name for himself as a man who hates small talk and likes to get down to business right away .
his talks with high-ranking israeli leaders later on tuesdy will provide him with another opportunity to do just that . but for several reasons , the visit is anything but a routine job for germany 's president , said manfred lahnstein , the head of the hamburg-based german-israeli society . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we have encouraging developments in the middle east and that is a good background for the visit , " lahnstein said , adding that it marks the 40th anniversary of diplomatic relations between germany and israel .
" we have had the celebrations marking the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the auschwitz annihilation camp .
so you have our ongoing historic responsibility , the fostering and strengthening of excellent albeit not normal relations between the two countries and some political processes , which look promising . " german speech sparks protests on wednesday , köhler is due to deliver a speech on german-israeli relations before parliament , the knesset .
his plan to hold his speech in german has already provoked protests among a small number of israeli deputies who are poised to leave the hall when köhler starts his speech . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knesset in jerusalem israel ’ s minister of health dani naveh said he plans to boycott president köhler ’ s speech .
he told the right-wing israeli daily newspaper maariv that as long as holocaust survivors are still alive , german should not be spoken in israel 's parliament . his comment echoed the feelings of a number of parliamentary deputies .
the acting president of the knesset , hemi doron , said he would ask his superiors either to cancel the speech or to ask köhler to hold it in english .
doron , whose grandfather was killed in the holocaust , said his feet had never touched german soil and he never bought german products .
so he could not allow the german language to be spoken in the jewish people ’ s house of parliament . " a normal procedure " but lahnstein said köhler 's decision to speak in german was nothing unusual nor unprecendented . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former president johannes rau -lrb- right -rrb- and his israeli counterpart , moshe katzav -lrb- left -rrb- in germany in 2002 .
" that is a normal procedure that a president of a country who visits the parliament of another country and delivers a speech does so in his own tongue , " he said , adding that former german president johannes rau -lrb- photo -rrb- was the first to do so five years ago .
" on the other hand we have to understand that there are some members of the knesset , which for very personal reasons can not live with it and they will leave the hall of the knesset .
this happened five years ago as well and we have to understand it , and the rest should be dignity on both sides and it will be dignity on both sides . " some jewish public figures have spoken out in favor of köhler using his native german .
knesset speaker reuven rivlin , who was instrumental in the decision to allow the visiting president to deliver his speech in german , insisted it would be better not to extend an invitation than to demand that the guest speak in a different language .
and israel ’ s former ambassador to germany , avi primor -lrb- photo below -rrb- , also said he thinks there is no reason why köhler should not speak in german . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : avi primor " first of all , the relations between israel and germany are such that this kind of a question should n't arise at all , " he said .
" and secondly , the german language is not only the language of the nazis , but was a very important language before the nazis and is a very important language after the nazis .
it was a very important language for the jewish people . " german far-right overshadows visit but political observers in germany are also afraid that köhler ’ s trip to israel may be overshadowed by a recent scandal surrounding the far-right national party -lrb- npd -rrb- in saxony ’ s regional assembly .
npd leaders there had likened the end-of-wwii allied bombings on german towns to the holocaust , giving rise to a fresh debate about anti-semitism in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a yellow star of david that jews were forced to wear by the nazis is on display at yad vashem manfred lahnstein said the german president will have no way of dodging the issue , but is confident that the incident will not mar köhler ’ s talks with israeli leaders . during his trip , the german president will also take out time to visit the yad vashem holocaust memorial where he ’ s due to honor the six million jews murdered by the nazis . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de remembering germany 's darkest place commemorative events marking the 60th anniversary of the liberation of auschwitz continued throughout thursday as world leaders spoke of an evil that must never be allowed to surface again .

27 german president host köhler on tuesday began an official four-day state visit to israel .
the highlight of his visit will a be a controversial speech before the israeli parliament on wednesday . köhler , the former head of the international monetary fund , has made a name for himself as a man who hates small talk and likes to get down to business right away .
his talks with high-ranking israeli leaders later on tuesdy will provide him with another opportunity to do just that . but for several reasons , the visit is anything but a routine job for germany 's president , said manfred lahnstein , the head of the hamburg-based german-israeli society . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we have encouraging developments in the middle east and that is a good background for the visit , " lahnstein said , adding that it marks the 40th anniversary of diplomatic relations between germany and israel .
" we have had the celebrations marking the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the auschwitz annihilation camp .
so you have our ongoing historic responsibility , the fostering and strengthening of excellent albeit not normal relations between the two countries and some political processes , which look promising . " german speech sparks protests on wednesday , köhler is due to deliver a speech on german-israeli relations before parliament , the knesset .
his plan to hold his speech in german has already provoked protests among a small number of israeli deputies who are poised to leave the hall when köhler starts his speech . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knesset in jerusalem israel ’ s minister of health dani naveh said he plans to boycott president köhler ’ s speech .
he told the right-wing israeli daily newspaper maariv that as long as holocaust survivors are still alive , german should not be spoken in israel 's parliament . his comment echoed the feelings of a number of parliamentary deputies .
the acting president of the knesset , hemi doron , said he would ask his superiors either to cancel the speech or to ask köhler to hold it in english .
doron , whose grandfather was killed in the holocaust , said his feet had never touched german soil and he never bought german products .
so he could not allow the german language to be spoken in the jewish people ’ s house of parliament . " a normal procedure " but lahnstein said köhler 's decision to speak in german was nothing unusual nor unprecendented . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former president johannes rau -lrb- right -rrb- and his israeli counterpart , moshe katzav -lrb- left -rrb- in germany in 2002 .
" that is a normal procedure that a president of a country who visits the parliament of another country and delivers a speech does so in his own tongue , " he said , adding that former german president johannes rau -lrb- photo -rrb- was the first to do so five years ago .
" on the other hand we have to understand that there are some members of the knesset , which for very personal reasons can not live with it and they will leave the hall of the knesset .
this happened five years ago as well and we have to understand it , and the rest should be dignity on both sides and it will be dignity on both sides . " some jewish public figures have spoken out in favor of köhler using his native german .
knesset speaker reuven rivlin , who was instrumental in the decision to allow the visiting president to deliver his speech in german , insisted it would be better not to extend an invitation than to demand that the guest speak in a different language .
and israel ’ s former ambassador to germany , avi primor -lrb- photo below -rrb- , also said he thinks there is no reason why köhler should not speak in german . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : avi primor " first of all , the relations between israel and germany are such that this kind of a question should n't arise at all , " he said .
" and secondly , the german language is not only the language of the nazis , but was a very important language before the nazis and is a very important language after the nazis .
it was a very important language for the jewish people . " german far-right overshadows visit but political observers in germany are also afraid that köhler ’ s trip to israel may be overshadowed by a recent scandal surrounding the far-right national party -lrb- npd -rrb- in saxony ’ s regional assembly .
npd leaders there had likened the end-of-wwii allied bombings on german towns to the holocaust , giving rise to a fresh debate about anti-semitism in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a yellow star of david that jews were forced to wear by the nazis is on display at yad vashem manfred lahnstein said the german president will have no way of dodging the issue , but is confident that the incident will not mar köhler ’ s talks with israeli leaders . during his trip , the german president will also take out time to visit the yad vashem holocaust memorial where he ’ s due to honor the six million jews murdered by the nazis . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de remembering germany 's darkest place commemorative events marking the 60th anniversary of the liberation of auschwitz continued throughout thursday as world leaders spoke of an evil that must never be allowed to surface again .

but much hinges on whether ante gotovina is produced to face war-crimes charges at the hague . rehn issued his starkest warning yet that the eu would postpone a march date to launch entry talks with zagreb if the retired general is not delivered to the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- . the finnish commissioner said he was " convinced that if the croatian government had the political will to locate and transfer general gotovina , it could do so . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olli rehn rehn -lrb- photo -rrb- said that based on information from un chief prosecutor carla del ponte and other " very informed sources , " croatia and gotovina have discussed a " possible voluntary surrender of general gotovina which did not materialize . " gotovina was also most probably sheltering in croatia or croatian areas of bosnia-hercegovina , " in any case within the reach of the croatian government , " he added . croatian premier surprised croatian prime minister ivo sanader voiced surprise over the threat to postpone the start of entry talks , rejecting the allegation that the government had had contacts with gotovina . " i am not worried but surprised , " sanader told croatian national radio speaking from luxembourg .
" croatia is fully cooperating with the un war crimes tribunal at the hague . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ivo sanader information that the government had held talks with gotovina was " not true , " said the prime minister -lrb- photo -rrb- , adding he was confident accession talks would begin as scheduled on march 17 . gotovina 's lawyer luka misetic said earlier this month that his client would surrender if his case was transferred to a croatian court , a deal immediately dismissed by un prosecutors and by zagreb . eu ready to postpone talks releasing the eu executive 's proposed plan of accession negotiations with croatia , rehn said that zagreb would not today be considered as deserving of eu talks . " if the commission were to give its recommendation on the basis of today 's information , i could not recommend opening negotiations with croatia , " he told a news conference .
" if there is no progress from the croatian side -lrb- on gotovina -rrb- , we are ready to postpone the start of talks . " at a december summit , eu leaders said the bloc would start accession talks with croatia on march 17 - provided it cooperates fully with the icty . that means finding and handing over gotovina , who went into hiding in 2001 when the un court charged him with war crimes against ethnic serbs at the end of croatia 's 1991-95 war of independence from the former yugoslavia . luxembourg foreign minister jean asselborn of the eu 's current presidency said the bloc 's decision on whether to proceed with talks from march 17 would depend in large part on the icty 's appraisal . " every step must go perfectly " confirming the receipt of a letter " from an individual claiming to be mr gotovina 's lawyer , " he said the issue of croatia would be discussed when us secretary of state condoleezza rice visits luxembourg on feb .
9 and 10 . " if tomorrow mr gotovina turns up in the hague , that 's that and we can start earlier , " asselborn said after a meeting of eu foreign ministers .
" but until that happens , march 17 is a buffer date for the start of the negotiations with croatia . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cathedral square in croatia 's capital , zagreb like any other eu candidate , croatia will have to strive hard to transpose the 80,000 pages of eu legislation and standards known as the " acquis communautaire .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 01.02.2005 reinventing german innovation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an originial idea is hardly enough to power innovation in germany a recent study into the " to be or not to be " of self-employment revealed a national reluctance among germans to go it alone .
but inventors are crying out for a chance to give the country a cutting-edge status . the study , conducted in the eu and the us over a period of five years , was conclusive proof that entrepreneurial spirit does not run through the veins of german society the same way as the desire for steady and secure work .
while more than 61 percent of americans expressed a desire to run their own show , the same percentage of germans said they were put off the idea because of a fear of failure .
yet , there is undoubtedly more to the picture than that , and given the current blot which unemployment is smudging over germany 's social and economic landscape , embracing the lesser known devil and striking out alone could be the answer to some people 's problems .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting innovation taken seriously is a painstaking process heino hanisch , a berlin-based inventor and jack of many trades , has been out of work for several years .
his continued attempts to get a foot back onto the employment ladder have been repeatedly thwarted by his age - he 's in his mid-40 's - and long-term jobless status .
he is realistic rather than pessimistic when he says he may never again be gainfully employed .
" i see self-employment as the only way forward , but that 's not easy either , because you encounter so many hurdles , financial and otherwise , to get there , " hanisch said .
a question of cash for german inventors , the problem with getting out there and turning their innovative dreams into reality is intrinsically linked to a lack of funding .
" as an inventor , you need more than just an idea .
you need money to register the patent , ideally also money to employ a patent lawyer .
you have to create a prototype which can be shown at exhibitions or trade fairs , and then , most importantly , you need money for advertising , " inventor and engineer peter stepina said .
essentially it all boils down to cash .
and germany 's banks are not champing at the bit to hurl their money at independent creative minds .
" there 's no point in even applying for support from the bank unless you have a lot of your own capital , " hanisch added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : banks keep inventors at arms ' length since very few do , many potentially lucrative inventions are stopped in their tracks .
" of course it makes a difference to us if an inventor is prepared to invest his own money into his idea , but we also want to see a thorough business plan and be sure that the inventor has done his market analysis , " christian hotz , a spokesman for deutsche bank said .
again , that 's a process which the average inventor can not afford .
" it 's a case of the cat biting itself in the tail , " hanisch lamented .
but one new initiative set up by the chamber for trade and industry -lrb- ihk -rrb- in the german city of duisburg is blowing some fresh wind into the stagnant world of independent invention .
a new " idea " the project , aptly entitled " idea " is an original attempt to help inventors towards their ultimate goal of turning their models into money .
a pool of some 80 experts from all fields and walks of life work on a voluntary basis to assess the viability of designs and ideas submitted to them from the innovator on the street .
" the problem at the moment is that there is no financial backing available for individuals .
if an inventor wants to access funding , the only way to go about it is to team up with a company .
even the government initiative for patent funding is out of bounds to the individual , " ihk innovations consultant rolf berenz said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new invention for pasta on the go berenz hopes the project will establish a network of people who work together to promote innovation within germany - not only technological innovation but also in the realms of service and management .
he calls it a one-stop shop in which clever ideas are analyzed , assessed and , where appropriate , the inventor gets feedback from a panel of experts .
what about " me incorporated ? "
it 's certainly a step in the right direction and a more structured move to support an often marginalized profession .
at the moment , the only other possibility inventors have at securing external support is through a government-funded program called " me incorporated , " which is designed to encourage the unemployed to start their own businesses .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dog-walking machine has n't yet taken off but getting into the program requires more than a brilliant idea .
" candidates have to get their ideas analyzed by an expert to assess the likelihood of success , " ellen queisser , spokeswoman for the labor office in berlin said .
it 's a vicious circle for the likes of heino hanisch , who believes it takes imagination to see just how a new product might succeed .
" the experts who are supposed to check for viability are long-term employees who have no idea about being self-employed and no idea about what will or will not work . "
whether that is true or not , it remains a fact that german inventors are out there and feeling frustrated about being prevented from adding some dynamism to the entrepreneurial face of the nation . tamsin walker , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de protecting patents at a snail 's pace in the age of globalization , international patents are needed to protect intellectual property .

revelations on monday named players accused of receiving cash incentives in disputed games . the corruption scandal engulfing german soccer shows no sign of dying down with the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- investigation claiming another scalp on monday . it has been revealed that the sc paderborn captain , thijs waterink , received € 10,000 -lrb- $ 13,000 -rrb- from an anonymous backer as an incentive to defeat hamburg in the german cup tie , one of the four matches shamed referee robert hoyzer has since admitted to manipulating for a € 70,000 purse " i did not know before the game that the players would be receiving this bonus , " paderborn president wilfried finke told the n24 television channel .
" a man from southern europe phoned team captain waterink and said , ' there is € 10,000 as a team bonus if you win against hamburg .
if you do not , we want the money back . " ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : referee robert hoyzer during hamburg-paderborn game paderborn won the game 4-2 after hoyzer awarded two controversial penalty kicks and sent off hamburg 's belgian international emile mpenza .
dutchman waterink split the unrecorded bonus among his victorious team-mates . he has since been suspended as part of the escalating investigation which has already seen the end of hoyzer 's career while four men were arrested last week and three have been charged with fraud in connection with the case . fears of a scandal to rival 1971 the widening scandal has ominous similarities to the one that plunged german soccer into its darkest hour 34 years ago .
match-fixing and bribes engulfed the bundesliga in 1971 when more than 50 players , a number of coaches and officials plus the clubs arminia bielefeld and kickers offenbach were found guilty of offering bribes and fixing bundesliga games , prompting the dfb to dish out hefty fines and suspensions . revelations of coercion between parties will no doubt bring the nightmares back for the dfb - and it is likely to get worse .
the news that both paderborn and hoyzer were directly involved has caused a further shock and finke claims it is highly likely that hamburg also have a role to play . hamburg players suspected of complicity " this is just the tip of the iceberg , " explained finke .
" since the referee and paderborn players are involved i would also suggest that the hamburg players are looked at too .
to ensure a bet comes off you need all three parties involved - the winners , the losers and the referee . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg sv hamburg are furious at the implication and club president bernd hoffmann admitted legal action was being considered .
" the comments are a disgrace , " raged hoffmann .
" we will speak with our lawyer about these claims and think about taking legal action . " hertha berlin are another bundesliga side implicated in the scandal with three of their players - alexander madlung , nando rafael and josip simunic - named in connection with a second round cup match between hertha and eintracht braunschweig on sept .
22 of last year . regional side braunschweig won 3-2 with defender madlung scoring an own goal in the 80th minute to seal hertha 's defeat .
the capital club have denied that their players were involved and the trio have pleaded their innocence . more clubs and players to be probed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dfb investigation hopes to move swiftly to close the case .
two other lower division clubs dresden and chemnitz have also been mentioned in connection with match-fixing while referee jurgen jansen is also being investigated after he was named by hoyzer . jansen was due to referee werder bremen 's match against hansa rostock on sunday but the dfb chose to remove him before kick-off .
the dfb described jansen 's removal as a " purely precautionary measure , " saying he was n't suspected of fixing matches .
jansen gave a sworn statement on monday denying any connection to the affair . meanwhile , bookmaker oddset has accused the dfb of failing to heed a tip-off they gave on august 23 of last year in regard to the hamburg-paderborn game .
oddset maintained they sent a fax to the dfb 48 hours after the cup match but dfb president gerhard mayer-vorfelder denied the bookmaker 's claim . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : a shadow over german soccer german soccer has struggled recently .

fifa are very strict on the flow of tickets and tickets allocated by name must be presented by the bearer whose name appears on the card .

the dfb described jansen 's removal as a " purely precautionary measure , " saying he was n't suspected of fixing matches .

but this week the show , with its people-next-door characters , aired its 1,000th episode . many of them are n't all that sexy , hardly any are rich , and they 're usually never confronted with amnesia , alien abductions , evil twins or any of the other outlandish situations that have become part and parcel of many of the world 's serial dramas . instead , up and down lindenstrasse , the fictional street in a munich suburb where the series of the same name is set , fairly ordinary people meet the triumphs and tragedies that many experience in real life : infidelity , failing marriages , first love , parental disapproval , new careers or youth violence .
the characters are like the neighbors next door and the german public has been tuning in faithfully to find out where their on-screen lives are taking them for 20 years or 1,000 episodes . for many germans , sunday evening from 6:40 to 7:10 p.m. is " lindenstrasse " time , and woe to the person who calls or shows up unannounced at the door of a fan during that period . borrowed from the brits the show 's premise was borrowed from the bbc 's " coronation street , " britain 's longest-running television soap opera , which is set in a gritty industrial suburb of manchester .
the " lindenstrasse " crowd has less coal dust to contend with , but like their british cousins , the characters on the outskirts of munich are overwhelmingly midway or slightly lower on the socio-economic scale .
instead of super models , oil barons or jet-setting cosmetic company heads , the folks who live or work on lindenstrasse are housewives , taxi drivers , travel agents or hair stylists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lindenstrasse street sign the concerns of the beimer , kling , zenker or sarikaki families are generally the concerns of average people .

critics say other views are represented as being odd or out of touch with the times .
that , they say , is problematic since the show airs on german public broadcasting and , due to its station 's charter , has a duty to remain politically neutral . millions watch every week for the 1,000th episode , more than seven million tuned in for a special 45-minute broadcast .
while " lindenstrasse " has lost some its audience to " younger " shows with a strong teen element , such as " good times and bad " and " forbidden love , " the show still attracts on average 4.8 million viewers on sunday evenings . its current contract with west german broadcasting , which produces the show in a suburb of cologne , runs through 2008 and fans are guaranteed at least another 219 episodes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : annemarie wendl as else kling what fans wo n't be seeing much more of is likely germany 's most famous concierge , else kling , who has been a feature on the show since the beginning .

the characters are like the neighbors next door and the german public has been tuning in faithfully to find out where their on-screen lives are taking them for 20 years or 1,000 episodes . for many germans , sunday evening from 6:40 to 7:10 p.m. is " lindenstrasse " time , and woe to the person who calls or shows up unannounced at the door of a fan during that period . borrowed from the brits the show 's premise was borrowed from the bbc 's " coronation street , " britain 's longest-running television soap opera , which is set in a gritty industrial suburb of manchester .
the " lindenstrasse " crowd has less coal dust to contend with , but like their british cousins , the characters on the outskirts of munich are overwhelmingly midway or slightly lower on the socio-economic scale .

while " lindenstrasse " has lost some its audience to " younger " shows with a strong teen element , such as " good times and bad " and " forbidden love , " the show still attracts on average 4.8 million viewers on sunday evenings . its current contract with west german broadcasting , which produces the show in a suburb of cologne , runs through 2008 and fans are guaranteed at least another 219 episodes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : annemarie wendl as else kling what fans wo n't be seeing much more of is likely germany 's most famous concierge , else kling , who has been a feature on the show since the beginning .

his talks with high-ranking israeli leaders later on tuesdy will provide him with another opportunity to do just that . but for several reasons , the visit is anything but a routine job for germany 's president , said manfred lahnstein , the head of the hamburg-based german-israeli society . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we have encouraging developments in the middle east and that is a good background for the visit , " lahnstein said , adding that it marks the 40th anniversary of diplomatic relations between germany and israel .

the acting president of the knesset , hemi doron , said he would ask his superiors either to cancel the speech or to ask köhler to hold it in english .
doron , whose grandfather was killed in the holocaust , said his feet had never touched german soil and he never bought german products .

" on the other hand we have to understand that there are some members of the knesset , which for very personal reasons can not live with it and they will leave the hall of the knesset .
this happened five years ago as well and we have to understand it , and the rest should be dignity on both sides and it will be dignity on both sides . " some jewish public figures have spoken out in favor of köhler using his native german .
knesset speaker reuven rivlin , who was instrumental in the decision to allow the visiting president to deliver his speech in german , insisted it would be better not to extend an invitation than to demand that the guest speak in a different language .
and israel ’ s former ambassador to germany , avi primor -lrb- photo below -rrb- , also said he thinks there is no reason why köhler should not speak in german . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : avi primor " first of all , the relations between israel and germany are such that this kind of a question should n't arise at all , " he said .

here dw-world answers some frequently asked questions . the world cup 2006 in germany is one of the hottest events on the horizon in the world of sport .
unfortunately , however , ticket allocation for the upcoming games is a potentially heart-breaking process .
with millions of fans wanting to get a piece of the live action , dw-world offers its readers an insight into the minefield that is buying a world cup ticket . q : where do i get the tickets ? a : well , officially , on the fifa website - www.fifaworldcup.com - and only there .
fifa is warning that offers of tickets combined with travel arrangements which are not affiliated with supporters ' organizations or the world soccer governing body itself can not be taken seriously .
there are less credible and less legal ways to get tickets -lrb- see below -rrb- that dw-world does not advocate . q : how do i get a ticket ? a : applications must be completed online and paid for by credit card .
in germany , you can pay via bank transfer or debit card as long as you hold a german bank account . q : can one also order by telephone ? a. yes .
after the conditions for ticket sales were announced in january , a phone line was set up offering automated instruction in german , english , french and spanish .
individual questions can not be answered .
telephone : 00 49 -lrb- 0 -rrb- 180 526 2006 q : how many tickets can i order ? a : four tickets per household per game - from the qualifying round up to the final and only seven tickets per customer . q : when can i start buying tickets ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a : the first phase of official sales begins on feb .
1 , 2005 exclusively on the fifa website .
an important point to note is that the precise date of ordering within the first sales phase is immaterial .
applications will not be processed chronologically , but rather via a lottery at the end of the first phase .
there should be a second round of ticket sales in summer 2005 . q : how many tickets are going on sale ? a : too few , we 're afraid .
to get tickets for the world cup , one must not be quick but be lucky .
officially there are 3.2 million tickets for the world cup in germany with 800,000 available in the host country itself .
and remember , not all of them will go on sale at the same time .
just half will become available form the opening date of sales .
and as with all sporting events , not all the tickets are allocated to the everyday fan . q : what happens to the other tickets then ?
a : tickets are held back not only for the associations contesting the 2006 finals but also for the associations which fail to qualify .
blocks of tickets are also set aside for the official partners , official suppliers and the tv partners .
in total , that could represent a good 450,000 tickets for sponsors and the fifa organizations .
it should be borne in mind that many of these tickets are then used in promotional activity and prize competitions , so that a substantial number of tickets does return to the ordinary fans .
then there are those that are not claimed and returned for sale .
these will also eventually make their way into the public domain .
q : how much can i expect to pay ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a : match ticket prices were announced in december 2003 , ranging from € 35 for category 4 seats at the 47 group matches to € 600 , the most expensive category 1 ticket for the final .
vip 's tickets , of course , can totally eclipse these prices with the added extras that come along with them .
possibly the premium package for berlin includes tickets for five games plus the final for four people with additional private parking space , separate entrance to the stadium and gourmet food all for a princely € 48,000 . q : can i get tickets through any other channels ? a : in principle , yes .
fifa are very strict on the flow of tickets and tickets allocated by name must be presented by the bearer whose name appears on the card .
those who can not prove that they are the bearer will be ejected from the ground or barred entry .
fifa is also trying its best to control the flow of black market tickets on internet auction sites like ebay and similar punishments for holders of tickets bought this way can be expected . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but , if you have a strong nerve , and good luck , there are always tickets to be had outside the stadiums on match day .
touts will , however , be more than aware of the demand and tickets will be extortionate in comparison to those garnered through legitimate channels .
it is unlikely to be a buyer 's market like the european championships where semi-final tickets were reportedly passing hands for as little as € 5 . q : does anyone know which team will play when and where ? a : only the german team has an itinerary at the moment because , as hosts , they are the only ones who are guaranteed to be there come summer 2006 .
germany opens the tournament in the first game on the june 9 in munich , and plays its other group games on june 14 in dortmund and june 20 in berlin .
all other teams must still qualify .
the draw for the group stages for the finals will take place in december in leipzig once all the qualifiers are known . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world cup tickets scarce before sales start the coming weeks are sure to see some disgruntled soccer fans .
organizers for the 2006 world cup announced monday that only a third of the tournament tickets will be up for sale to the general public .
-lrb- jan .
25 , 2005 -rrb- everything still to play for the line-up for the world cup in germany in 2006 is looking a little bare at the moment .
only the hosts are guaranteed a place which means 52 nations are still battling it out in the qualification stages .
-lrb- jan .
31 , 2005 -rrb- opinion : a shadow over german soccer german soccer has struggled recently .
as bundesliga teams flounder in europe , the national side is trying to rebuild after a devastating euro 2004 .
german referees were the only thing considered world class .
not anymore .

while more than 61 percent of americans expressed a desire to run their own show , the same percentage of germans said they were put off the idea because of a fear of failure .
yet , there is undoubtedly more to the picture than that , and given the current blot which unemployment is smudging over germany 's social and economic landscape , embracing the lesser known devil and striking out alone could be the answer to some people 's problems .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting innovation taken seriously is a painstaking process heino hanisch , a berlin-based inventor and jack of many trades , has been out of work for several years .

a question of cash for german inventors , the problem with getting out there and turning their innovative dreams into reality is intrinsically linked to a lack of funding .
" as an inventor , you need more than just an idea .

here dw-world answers some frequently asked questions . the world cup 2006 in germany is one of the hottest events on the horizon in the world of sport .
unfortunately , however , ticket allocation for the upcoming games is a potentially heart-breaking process .
with millions of fans wanting to get a piece of the live action , dw-world offers its readers an insight into the minefield that is buying a world cup ticket . q : where do i get the tickets ? a : well , officially , on the fifa website - www.fifaworldcup.com - and only there .
fifa is warning that offers of tickets combined with travel arrangements which are not affiliated with supporters ' organizations or the world soccer governing body itself can not be taken seriously .
there are less credible and less legal ways to get tickets -lrb- see below -rrb- that dw-world does not advocate . q : how do i get a ticket ? a : applications must be completed online and paid for by credit card .
in germany , you can pay via bank transfer or debit card as long as you hold a german bank account . q : can one also order by telephone ? a. yes .
after the conditions for ticket sales were announced in january , a phone line was set up offering automated instruction in german , english , french and spanish .
individual questions can not be answered .
telephone : 00 49 -lrb- 0 -rrb- 180 526 2006 q : how many tickets can i order ? a : four tickets per household per game - from the qualifying round up to the final and only seven tickets per customer . q : when can i start buying tickets ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a : the first phase of official sales begins on feb .
1 , 2005 exclusively on the fifa website .
an important point to note is that the precise date of ordering within the first sales phase is immaterial .
applications will not be processed chronologically , but rather via a lottery at the end of the first phase .
there should be a second round of ticket sales in summer 2005 . q : how many tickets are going on sale ? a : too few , we 're afraid .
to get tickets for the world cup , one must not be quick but be lucky .
officially there are 3.2 million tickets for the world cup in germany with 800,000 available in the host country itself .
and remember , not all of them will go on sale at the same time .
just half will become available form the opening date of sales .
and as with all sporting events , not all the tickets are allocated to the everyday fan . q : what happens to the other tickets then ?
a : tickets are held back not only for the associations contesting the 2006 finals but also for the associations which fail to qualify .
blocks of tickets are also set aside for the official partners , official suppliers and the tv partners .
in total , that could represent a good 450,000 tickets for sponsors and the fifa organizations .
it should be borne in mind that many of these tickets are then used in promotional activity and prize competitions , so that a substantial number of tickets does return to the ordinary fans .
then there are those that are not claimed and returned for sale .
these will also eventually make their way into the public domain .
q : how much can i expect to pay ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a : match ticket prices were announced in december 2003 , ranging from € 35 for category 4 seats at the 47 group matches to € 600 , the most expensive category 1 ticket for the final .
vip 's tickets , of course , can totally eclipse these prices with the added extras that come along with them .
possibly the premium package for berlin includes tickets for five games plus the final for four people with additional private parking space , separate entrance to the stadium and gourmet food all for a princely € 48,000 . q : can i get tickets through any other channels ? a : in principle , yes .
fifa are very strict on the flow of tickets and tickets allocated by name must be presented by the bearer whose name appears on the card .
those who can not prove that they are the bearer will be ejected from the ground or barred entry .
fifa is also trying its best to control the flow of black market tickets on internet auction sites like ebay and similar punishments for holders of tickets bought this way can be expected . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but , if you have a strong nerve , and good luck , there are always tickets to be had outside the stadiums on match day .
touts will , however , be more than aware of the demand and tickets will be extortionate in comparison to those garnered through legitimate channels .
it is unlikely to be a buyer 's market like the european championships where semi-final tickets were reportedly passing hands for as little as € 5 . q : does anyone know which team will play when and where ? a : only the german team has an itinerary at the moment because , as hosts , they are the only ones who are guaranteed to be there come summer 2006 .
germany opens the tournament in the first game on the june 9 in munich , and plays its other group games on june 14 in dortmund and june 20 in berlin .
all other teams must still qualify .
the draw for the group stages for the finals will take place in december in leipzig once all the qualifiers are known . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world cup tickets scarce before sales start the coming weeks are sure to see some disgruntled soccer fans .

25 , 2005 -rrb- everything still to play for the line-up for the world cup in germany in 2006 is looking a little bare at the moment .
only the hosts are guaranteed a place which means 52 nations are still battling it out in the qualification stages .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : a stain on the soul of german soccer key man in match rigging scandal released soccer chiefs debate betting post-hoyzer referee scandal rears its ugly head former dortmund player admits to bribe sports -pipe- 01.02.2005 german soccer scandal envelops players großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german football federation blows the whistle on referee and players it now appears that disgraced referee robert hoyzer 's match-rigging is the tip of the iceberg in the german soccer scandal .
revelations on monday named players accused of receiving cash incentives in disputed games . the corruption scandal engulfing german soccer shows no sign of dying down with the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- investigation claiming another scalp on monday . it has been revealed that the sc paderborn captain , thijs waterink , received € 10,000 -lrb- $ 13,000 -rrb- from an anonymous backer as an incentive to defeat hamburg in the german cup tie , one of the four matches shamed referee robert hoyzer has since admitted to manipulating for a € 70,000 purse " i did not know before the game that the players would be receiving this bonus , " paderborn president wilfried finke told the n24 television channel .
" a man from southern europe phoned team captain waterink and said , ' there is € 10,000 as a team bonus if you win against hamburg .
if you do not , we want the money back . " ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : referee robert hoyzer during hamburg-paderborn game paderborn won the game 4-2 after hoyzer awarded two controversial penalty kicks and sent off hamburg 's belgian international emile mpenza .
dutchman waterink split the unrecorded bonus among his victorious team-mates . he has since been suspended as part of the escalating investigation which has already seen the end of hoyzer 's career while four men were arrested last week and three have been charged with fraud in connection with the case . fears of a scandal to rival 1971 the widening scandal has ominous similarities to the one that plunged german soccer into its darkest hour 34 years ago .
match-fixing and bribes engulfed the bundesliga in 1971 when more than 50 players , a number of coaches and officials plus the clubs arminia bielefeld and kickers offenbach were found guilty of offering bribes and fixing bundesliga games , prompting the dfb to dish out hefty fines and suspensions . revelations of coercion between parties will no doubt bring the nightmares back for the dfb - and it is likely to get worse .
the news that both paderborn and hoyzer were directly involved has caused a further shock and finke claims it is highly likely that hamburg also have a role to play . hamburg players suspected of complicity " this is just the tip of the iceberg , " explained finke .
" since the referee and paderborn players are involved i would also suggest that the hamburg players are looked at too .
to ensure a bet comes off you need all three parties involved - the winners , the losers and the referee . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg sv hamburg are furious at the implication and club president bernd hoffmann admitted legal action was being considered .

revelations on monday named players accused of receiving cash incentives in disputed games . the corruption scandal engulfing german soccer shows no sign of dying down with the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- investigation claiming another scalp on monday . it has been revealed that the sc paderborn captain , thijs waterink , received € 10,000 -lrb- $ 13,000 -rrb- from an anonymous backer as an incentive to defeat hamburg in the german cup tie , one of the four matches shamed referee robert hoyzer has since admitted to manipulating for a € 70,000 purse " i did not know before the game that the players would be receiving this bonus , " paderborn president wilfried finke told the n24 television channel .
" a man from southern europe phoned team captain waterink and said , ' there is € 10,000 as a team bonus if you win against hamburg .
if you do not , we want the money back . " ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : referee robert hoyzer during hamburg-paderborn game paderborn won the game 4-2 after hoyzer awarded two controversial penalty kicks and sent off hamburg 's belgian international emile mpenza .
dutchman waterink split the unrecorded bonus among his victorious team-mates . he has since been suspended as part of the escalating investigation which has already seen the end of hoyzer 's career while four men were arrested last week and three have been charged with fraud in connection with the case . fears of a scandal to rival 1971 the widening scandal has ominous similarities to the one that plunged german soccer into its darkest hour 34 years ago .
match-fixing and bribes engulfed the bundesliga in 1971 when more than 50 players , a number of coaches and officials plus the clubs arminia bielefeld and kickers offenbach were found guilty of offering bribes and fixing bundesliga games , prompting the dfb to dish out hefty fines and suspensions . revelations of coercion between parties will no doubt bring the nightmares back for the dfb - and it is likely to get worse .
the news that both paderborn and hoyzer were directly involved has caused a further shock and finke claims it is highly likely that hamburg also have a role to play . hamburg players suspected of complicity " this is just the tip of the iceberg , " explained finke .
" since the referee and paderborn players are involved i would also suggest that the hamburg players are looked at too .
to ensure a bet comes off you need all three parties involved - the winners , the losers and the referee . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg sv hamburg are furious at the implication and club president bernd hoffmann admitted legal action was being considered .

here dw-world answers some frequently asked questions . the world cup 2006 in germany is one of the hottest events on the horizon in the world of sport .
unfortunately , however , ticket allocation for the upcoming games is a potentially heart-breaking process .
with millions of fans wanting to get a piece of the live action , dw-world offers its readers an insight into the minefield that is buying a world cup ticket . q : where do i get the tickets ? a : well , officially , on the fifa website - www.fifaworldcup.com - and only there .
fifa is warning that offers of tickets combined with travel arrangements which are not affiliated with supporters ' organizations or the world soccer governing body itself can not be taken seriously .
there are less credible and less legal ways to get tickets -lrb- see below -rrb- that dw-world does not advocate . q : how do i get a ticket ? a : applications must be completed online and paid for by credit card .
in germany , you can pay via bank transfer or debit card as long as you hold a german bank account . q : can one also order by telephone ? a. yes .
after the conditions for ticket sales were announced in january , a phone line was set up offering automated instruction in german , english , french and spanish .
individual questions can not be answered .
telephone : 00 49 -lrb- 0 -rrb- 180 526 2006 q : how many tickets can i order ? a : four tickets per household per game - from the qualifying round up to the final and only seven tickets per customer . q : when can i start buying tickets ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a : the first phase of official sales begins on feb .
1 , 2005 exclusively on the fifa website .
an important point to note is that the precise date of ordering within the first sales phase is immaterial .
applications will not be processed chronologically , but rather via a lottery at the end of the first phase .
there should be a second round of ticket sales in summer 2005 . q : how many tickets are going on sale ? a : too few , we 're afraid .
to get tickets for the world cup , one must not be quick but be lucky .
officially there are 3.2 million tickets for the world cup in germany with 800,000 available in the host country itself .
and remember , not all of them will go on sale at the same time .
just half will become available form the opening date of sales .
and as with all sporting events , not all the tickets are allocated to the everyday fan . q : what happens to the other tickets then ?
a : tickets are held back not only for the associations contesting the 2006 finals but also for the associations which fail to qualify .
blocks of tickets are also set aside for the official partners , official suppliers and the tv partners .
in total , that could represent a good 450,000 tickets for sponsors and the fifa organizations .
it should be borne in mind that many of these tickets are then used in promotional activity and prize competitions , so that a substantial number of tickets does return to the ordinary fans .
then there are those that are not claimed and returned for sale .
these will also eventually make their way into the public domain .
q : how much can i expect to pay ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a : match ticket prices were announced in december 2003 , ranging from € 35 for category 4 seats at the 47 group matches to € 600 , the most expensive category 1 ticket for the final .
vip 's tickets , of course , can totally eclipse these prices with the added extras that come along with them .
possibly the premium package for berlin includes tickets for five games plus the final for four people with additional private parking space , separate entrance to the stadium and gourmet food all for a princely € 48,000 . q : can i get tickets through any other channels ? a : in principle , yes .
fifa are very strict on the flow of tickets and tickets allocated by name must be presented by the bearer whose name appears on the card .
those who can not prove that they are the bearer will be ejected from the ground or barred entry .
fifa is also trying its best to control the flow of black market tickets on internet auction sites like ebay and similar punishments for holders of tickets bought this way can be expected . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but , if you have a strong nerve , and good luck , there are always tickets to be had outside the stadiums on match day .
touts will , however , be more than aware of the demand and tickets will be extortionate in comparison to those garnered through legitimate channels .
it is unlikely to be a buyer 's market like the european championships where semi-final tickets were reportedly passing hands for as little as € 5 . q : does anyone know which team will play when and where ? a : only the german team has an itinerary at the moment because , as hosts , they are the only ones who are guaranteed to be there come summer 2006 .
germany opens the tournament in the first game on the june 9 in munich , and plays its other group games on june 14 in dortmund and june 20 in berlin .
all other teams must still qualify .
the draw for the group stages for the finals will take place in december in leipzig once all the qualifiers are known . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world cup tickets scarce before sales start the coming weeks are sure to see some disgruntled soccer fans .

but much hinges on whether ante gotovina is produced to face war-crimes charges at the hague . rehn issued his starkest warning yet that the eu would postpone a march date to launch entry talks with zagreb if the retired general is not delivered to the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- . the finnish commissioner said he was " convinced that if the croatian government had the political will to locate and transfer general gotovina , it could do so . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olli rehn rehn -lrb- photo -rrb- said that based on information from un chief prosecutor carla del ponte and other " very informed sources , " croatia and gotovina have discussed a " possible voluntary surrender of general gotovina which did not materialize . " gotovina was also most probably sheltering in croatia or croatian areas of bosnia-hercegovina , " in any case within the reach of the croatian government , " he added . croatian premier surprised croatian prime minister ivo sanader voiced surprise over the threat to postpone the start of entry talks , rejecting the allegation that the government had had contacts with gotovina . " i am not worried but surprised , " sanader told croatian national radio speaking from luxembourg .
" croatia is fully cooperating with the un war crimes tribunal at the hague . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ivo sanader information that the government had held talks with gotovina was " not true , " said the prime minister -lrb- photo -rrb- , adding he was confident accession talks would begin as scheduled on march 17 . gotovina 's lawyer luka misetic said earlier this month that his client would surrender if his case was transferred to a croatian court , a deal immediately dismissed by un prosecutors and by zagreb . eu ready to postpone talks releasing the eu executive 's proposed plan of accession negotiations with croatia , rehn said that zagreb would not today be considered as deserving of eu talks . " if the commission were to give its recommendation on the basis of today 's information , i could not recommend opening negotiations with croatia , " he told a news conference .
" if there is no progress from the croatian side -lrb- on gotovina -rrb- , we are ready to postpone the start of talks . " at a december summit , eu leaders said the bloc would start accession talks with croatia on march 17 - provided it cooperates fully with the icty . that means finding and handing over gotovina , who went into hiding in 2001 when the un court charged him with war crimes against ethnic serbs at the end of croatia 's 1991-95 war of independence from the former yugoslavia . luxembourg foreign minister jean asselborn of the eu 's current presidency said the bloc 's decision on whether to proceed with talks from march 17 would depend in large part on the icty 's appraisal . " every step must go perfectly " confirming the receipt of a letter " from an individual claiming to be mr gotovina 's lawyer , " he said the issue of croatia would be discussed when us secretary of state condoleezza rice visits luxembourg on feb .
9 and 10 . " if tomorrow mr gotovina turns up in the hague , that 's that and we can start earlier , " asselborn said after a meeting of eu foreign ministers .

27 german president host köhler on tuesday began an official four-day state visit to israel .
the highlight of his visit will a be a controversial speech before the israeli parliament on wednesday . köhler , the former head of the international monetary fund , has made a name for himself as a man who hates small talk and likes to get down to business right away .
his talks with high-ranking israeli leaders later on tuesdy will provide him with another opportunity to do just that . but for several reasons , the visit is anything but a routine job for germany 's president , said manfred lahnstein , the head of the hamburg-based german-israeli society . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we have encouraging developments in the middle east and that is a good background for the visit , " lahnstein said , adding that it marks the 40th anniversary of diplomatic relations between germany and israel .
" we have had the celebrations marking the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the auschwitz annihilation camp .
so you have our ongoing historic responsibility , the fostering and strengthening of excellent albeit not normal relations between the two countries and some political processes , which look promising . " german speech sparks protests on wednesday , köhler is due to deliver a speech on german-israeli relations before parliament , the knesset .
his plan to hold his speech in german has already provoked protests among a small number of israeli deputies who are poised to leave the hall when köhler starts his speech . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knesset in jerusalem israel ’ s minister of health dani naveh said he plans to boycott president köhler ’ s speech .
he told the right-wing israeli daily newspaper maariv that as long as holocaust survivors are still alive , german should not be spoken in israel 's parliament . his comment echoed the feelings of a number of parliamentary deputies .
the acting president of the knesset , hemi doron , said he would ask his superiors either to cancel the speech or to ask köhler to hold it in english .
doron , whose grandfather was killed in the holocaust , said his feet had never touched german soil and he never bought german products .
so he could not allow the german language to be spoken in the jewish people ’ s house of parliament . " a normal procedure " but lahnstein said köhler 's decision to speak in german was nothing unusual nor unprecendented . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former president johannes rau -lrb- right -rrb- and his israeli counterpart , moshe katzav -lrb- left -rrb- in germany in 2002 .
" that is a normal procedure that a president of a country who visits the parliament of another country and delivers a speech does so in his own tongue , " he said , adding that former german president johannes rau -lrb- photo -rrb- was the first to do so five years ago .
" on the other hand we have to understand that there are some members of the knesset , which for very personal reasons can not live with it and they will leave the hall of the knesset .
this happened five years ago as well and we have to understand it , and the rest should be dignity on both sides and it will be dignity on both sides . " some jewish public figures have spoken out in favor of köhler using his native german .
knesset speaker reuven rivlin , who was instrumental in the decision to allow the visiting president to deliver his speech in german , insisted it would be better not to extend an invitation than to demand that the guest speak in a different language .
and israel ’ s former ambassador to germany , avi primor -lrb- photo below -rrb- , also said he thinks there is no reason why köhler should not speak in german . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : avi primor " first of all , the relations between israel and germany are such that this kind of a question should n't arise at all , " he said .

here dw-world answers some frequently asked questions . the world cup 2006 in germany is one of the hottest events on the horizon in the world of sport .
unfortunately , however , ticket allocation for the upcoming games is a potentially heart-breaking process .
with millions of fans wanting to get a piece of the live action , dw-world offers its readers an insight into the minefield that is buying a world cup ticket . q : where do i get the tickets ? a : well , officially , on the fifa website - www.fifaworldcup.com - and only there .
fifa is warning that offers of tickets combined with travel arrangements which are not affiliated with supporters ' organizations or the world soccer governing body itself can not be taken seriously .
there are less credible and less legal ways to get tickets -lrb- see below -rrb- that dw-world does not advocate . q : how do i get a ticket ? a : applications must be completed online and paid for by credit card .
in germany , you can pay via bank transfer or debit card as long as you hold a german bank account . q : can one also order by telephone ? a. yes .
after the conditions for ticket sales were announced in january , a phone line was set up offering automated instruction in german , english , french and spanish .
individual questions can not be answered .
telephone : 00 49 -lrb- 0 -rrb- 180 526 2006 q : how many tickets can i order ? a : four tickets per household per game - from the qualifying round up to the final and only seven tickets per customer . q : when can i start buying tickets ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a : the first phase of official sales begins on feb .
1 , 2005 exclusively on the fifa website .
an important point to note is that the precise date of ordering within the first sales phase is immaterial .
applications will not be processed chronologically , but rather via a lottery at the end of the first phase .
there should be a second round of ticket sales in summer 2005 . q : how many tickets are going on sale ? a : too few , we 're afraid .
to get tickets for the world cup , one must not be quick but be lucky .
officially there are 3.2 million tickets for the world cup in germany with 800,000 available in the host country itself .
and remember , not all of them will go on sale at the same time .
just half will become available form the opening date of sales .
and as with all sporting events , not all the tickets are allocated to the everyday fan . q : what happens to the other tickets then ?
a : tickets are held back not only for the associations contesting the 2006 finals but also for the associations which fail to qualify .
blocks of tickets are also set aside for the official partners , official suppliers and the tv partners .
in total , that could represent a good 450,000 tickets for sponsors and the fifa organizations .
it should be borne in mind that many of these tickets are then used in promotional activity and prize competitions , so that a substantial number of tickets does return to the ordinary fans .
then there are those that are not claimed and returned for sale .
these will also eventually make their way into the public domain .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting innovation taken seriously is a painstaking process heino hanisch , a berlin-based inventor and jack of many trades , has been out of work for several years .
his continued attempts to get a foot back onto the employment ladder have been repeatedly thwarted by his age - he 's in his mid-40 's - and long-term jobless status .
he is realistic rather than pessimistic when he says he may never again be gainfully employed .
" i see self-employment as the only way forward , but that 's not easy either , because you encounter so many hurdles , financial and otherwise , to get there , " hanisch said .
a question of cash for german inventors , the problem with getting out there and turning their innovative dreams into reality is intrinsically linked to a lack of funding .
" as an inventor , you need more than just an idea .
you need money to register the patent , ideally also money to employ a patent lawyer .
you have to create a prototype which can be shown at exhibitions or trade fairs , and then , most importantly , you need money for advertising , " inventor and engineer peter stepina said .
essentially it all boils down to cash .
and germany 's banks are not champing at the bit to hurl their money at independent creative minds .
" there 's no point in even applying for support from the bank unless you have a lot of your own capital , " hanisch added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : banks keep inventors at arms ' length since very few do , many potentially lucrative inventions are stopped in their tracks .
" of course it makes a difference to us if an inventor is prepared to invest his own money into his idea , but we also want to see a thorough business plan and be sure that the inventor has done his market analysis , " christian hotz , a spokesman for deutsche bank said .
again , that 's a process which the average inventor can not afford .
" it 's a case of the cat biting itself in the tail , " hanisch lamented .
but one new initiative set up by the chamber for trade and industry -lrb- ihk -rrb- in the german city of duisburg is blowing some fresh wind into the stagnant world of independent invention .
a new " idea " the project , aptly entitled " idea " is an original attempt to help inventors towards their ultimate goal of turning their models into money .
a pool of some 80 experts from all fields and walks of life work on a voluntary basis to assess the viability of designs and ideas submitted to them from the innovator on the street .
" the problem at the moment is that there is no financial backing available for individuals .
if an inventor wants to access funding , the only way to go about it is to team up with a company .
even the government initiative for patent funding is out of bounds to the individual , " ihk innovations consultant rolf berenz said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new invention for pasta on the go berenz hopes the project will establish a network of people who work together to promote innovation within germany - not only technological innovation but also in the realms of service and management .
he calls it a one-stop shop in which clever ideas are analyzed , assessed and , where appropriate , the inventor gets feedback from a panel of experts .
what about " me incorporated ? "
it 's certainly a step in the right direction and a more structured move to support an often marginalized profession .
at the moment , the only other possibility inventors have at securing external support is through a government-funded program called " me incorporated , " which is designed to encourage the unemployed to start their own businesses .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dog-walking machine has n't yet taken off but getting into the program requires more than a brilliant idea .
" candidates have to get their ideas analyzed by an expert to assess the likelihood of success , " ellen queisser , spokeswoman for the labor office in berlin said .
it 's a vicious circle for the likes of heino hanisch , who believes it takes imagination to see just how a new product might succeed .
" the experts who are supposed to check for viability are long-term employees who have no idea about being self-employed and no idea about what will or will not work . "
whether that is true or not , it remains a fact that german inventors are out there and feeling frustrated about being prevented from adding some dynamism to the entrepreneurial face of the nation . tamsin walker , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de protecting patents at a snail 's pace in the age of globalization , international patents are needed to protect intellectual property .
the european patent office in munich is charged with clearing patents for most european countries .
-lrb- april , 12 , 2004 -rrb- german innovation stalled at home internet calling , the biggest innovation in communications since the invention of the telephone , was " made in germany . "

the 26-year-old suspect , who has not been named , had already admitted to giving fatal injections to 16 people in his care , most of them elderly , in what he said were mercy killings .
toxicological analyses of the bodies of 42 deceased former patients of the suspect revealed that an additional 13 showed signs of an overdose of medication , authorities in the southern german town of kempten said .
the accused now faces charges of murder , manslaughter , killing on demand as well as attempted grievous bodily harm .
the alleged victims include 17 women and 12 men between the ages of 40 and 94 who died in the period from february 2003 to july 2004 .
the prosecutor 's office said the health of the deceased just before they died would play a significant role in the case because of the nurse 's claims he was alleviating their suffering .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 01.02.2005 croatia 's eu bid threatened großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gotovina 's arrest is crucial for croatia 's eu membership talks the european union has accused croatia of deliberately failing to act to arrest a fugitive general whose fate is central to the country 's eu membership bid . eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn said that croatia could , if all went well , join the eu in 2009 .
but much hinges on whether ante gotovina is produced to face war-crimes charges at the hague . rehn issued his starkest warning yet that the eu would postpone a march date to launch entry talks with zagreb if the retired general is not delivered to the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- . the finnish commissioner said he was " convinced that if the croatian government had the political will to locate and transfer general gotovina , it could do so . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olli rehn rehn -lrb- photo -rrb- said that based on information from un chief prosecutor carla del ponte and other " very informed sources , " croatia and gotovina have discussed a " possible voluntary surrender of general gotovina which did not materialize . " gotovina was also most probably sheltering in croatia or croatian areas of bosnia-hercegovina , " in any case within the reach of the croatian government , " he added . croatian premier surprised croatian prime minister ivo sanader voiced surprise over the threat to postpone the start of entry talks , rejecting the allegation that the government had had contacts with gotovina . " i am not worried but surprised , " sanader told croatian national radio speaking from luxembourg .
" croatia is fully cooperating with the un war crimes tribunal at the hague . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ivo sanader information that the government had held talks with gotovina was " not true , " said the prime minister -lrb- photo -rrb- , adding he was confident accession talks would begin as scheduled on march 17 . gotovina 's lawyer luka misetic said earlier this month that his client would surrender if his case was transferred to a croatian court , a deal immediately dismissed by un prosecutors and by zagreb . eu ready to postpone talks releasing the eu executive 's proposed plan of accession negotiations with croatia , rehn said that zagreb would not today be considered as deserving of eu talks . " if the commission were to give its recommendation on the basis of today 's information , i could not recommend opening negotiations with croatia , " he told a news conference .
" if there is no progress from the croatian side -lrb- on gotovina -rrb- , we are ready to postpone the start of talks . " at a december summit , eu leaders said the bloc would start accession talks with croatia on march 17 - provided it cooperates fully with the icty . that means finding and handing over gotovina , who went into hiding in 2001 when the un court charged him with war crimes against ethnic serbs at the end of croatia 's 1991-95 war of independence from the former yugoslavia . luxembourg foreign minister jean asselborn of the eu 's current presidency said the bloc 's decision on whether to proceed with talks from march 17 would depend in large part on the icty 's appraisal . " every step must go perfectly " confirming the receipt of a letter " from an individual claiming to be mr gotovina 's lawyer , " he said the issue of croatia would be discussed when us secretary of state condoleezza rice visits luxembourg on feb .
9 and 10 . " if tomorrow mr gotovina turns up in the hague , that 's that and we can start earlier , " asselborn said after a meeting of eu foreign ministers .
" but until that happens , march 17 is a buffer date for the start of the negotiations with croatia . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cathedral square in croatia 's capital , zagreb like any other eu candidate , croatia will have to strive hard to transpose the 80,000 pages of eu legislation and standards known as the " acquis communautaire . " rehn proposed to eu member states that the accession negotiations be broken down into 35 chapters and the talks be conducted chapter by chapter . " to meet 2009 , every step must go perfectly , " he said . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de croatian president wins reelection croatian president stipe mesic beat his ruling conservative party rival in sunday 's election , securing a second five-year term and promising to lead the former yugoslav republic into the european union .

but much hinges on whether ante gotovina is produced to face war-crimes charges at the hague . rehn issued his starkest warning yet that the eu would postpone a march date to launch entry talks with zagreb if the retired general is not delivered to the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- . the finnish commissioner said he was " convinced that if the croatian government had the political will to locate and transfer general gotovina , it could do so . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olli rehn rehn -lrb- photo -rrb- said that based on information from un chief prosecutor carla del ponte and other " very informed sources , " croatia and gotovina have discussed a " possible voluntary surrender of general gotovina which did not materialize . " gotovina was also most probably sheltering in croatia or croatian areas of bosnia-hercegovina , " in any case within the reach of the croatian government , " he added . croatian premier surprised croatian prime minister ivo sanader voiced surprise over the threat to postpone the start of entry talks , rejecting the allegation that the government had had contacts with gotovina . " i am not worried but surprised , " sanader told croatian national radio speaking from luxembourg .
" croatia is fully cooperating with the un war crimes tribunal at the hague . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ivo sanader information that the government had held talks with gotovina was " not true , " said the prime minister -lrb- photo -rrb- , adding he was confident accession talks would begin as scheduled on march 17 . gotovina 's lawyer luka misetic said earlier this month that his client would surrender if his case was transferred to a croatian court , a deal immediately dismissed by un prosecutors and by zagreb . eu ready to postpone talks releasing the eu executive 's proposed plan of accession negotiations with croatia , rehn said that zagreb would not today be considered as deserving of eu talks . " if the commission were to give its recommendation on the basis of today 's information , i could not recommend opening negotiations with croatia , " he told a news conference .
" if there is no progress from the croatian side -lrb- on gotovina -rrb- , we are ready to postpone the start of talks . " at a december summit , eu leaders said the bloc would start accession talks with croatia on march 17 - provided it cooperates fully with the icty . that means finding and handing over gotovina , who went into hiding in 2001 when the un court charged him with war crimes against ethnic serbs at the end of croatia 's 1991-95 war of independence from the former yugoslavia . luxembourg foreign minister jean asselborn of the eu 's current presidency said the bloc 's decision on whether to proceed with talks from march 17 would depend in large part on the icty 's appraisal . " every step must go perfectly " confirming the receipt of a letter " from an individual claiming to be mr gotovina 's lawyer , " he said the issue of croatia would be discussed when us secretary of state condoleezza rice visits luxembourg on feb .
9 and 10 . " if tomorrow mr gotovina turns up in the hague , that 's that and we can start earlier , " asselborn said after a meeting of eu foreign ministers .
" but until that happens , march 17 is a buffer date for the start of the negotiations with croatia . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cathedral square in croatia 's capital , zagreb like any other eu candidate , croatia will have to strive hard to transpose the 80,000 pages of eu legislation and standards known as the " acquis communautaire . " rehn proposed to eu member states that the accession negotiations be broken down into 35 chapters and the talks be conducted chapter by chapter .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 01.02.2005 croatia 's eu bid threatened großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gotovina 's arrest is crucial for croatia 's eu membership talks the european union has accused croatia of deliberately failing to act to arrest a fugitive general whose fate is central to the country 's eu membership bid . eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn said that croatia could , if all went well , join the eu in 2009 .
but much hinges on whether ante gotovina is produced to face war-crimes charges at the hague . rehn issued his starkest warning yet that the eu would postpone a march date to launch entry talks with zagreb if the retired general is not delivered to the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- . the finnish commissioner said he was " convinced that if the croatian government had the political will to locate and transfer general gotovina , it could do so . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olli rehn rehn -lrb- photo -rrb- said that based on information from un chief prosecutor carla del ponte and other " very informed sources , " croatia and gotovina have discussed a " possible voluntary surrender of general gotovina which did not materialize . " gotovina was also most probably sheltering in croatia or croatian areas of bosnia-hercegovina , " in any case within the reach of the croatian government , " he added . croatian premier surprised croatian prime minister ivo sanader voiced surprise over the threat to postpone the start of entry talks , rejecting the allegation that the government had had contacts with gotovina . " i am not worried but surprised , " sanader told croatian national radio speaking from luxembourg .
" croatia is fully cooperating with the un war crimes tribunal at the hague . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ivo sanader information that the government had held talks with gotovina was " not true , " said the prime minister -lrb- photo -rrb- , adding he was confident accession talks would begin as scheduled on march 17 . gotovina 's lawyer luka misetic said earlier this month that his client would surrender if his case was transferred to a croatian court , a deal immediately dismissed by un prosecutors and by zagreb . eu ready to postpone talks releasing the eu executive 's proposed plan of accession negotiations with croatia , rehn said that zagreb would not today be considered as deserving of eu talks . " if the commission were to give its recommendation on the basis of today 's information , i could not recommend opening negotiations with croatia , " he told a news conference .
" if there is no progress from the croatian side -lrb- on gotovina -rrb- , we are ready to postpone the start of talks . " at a december summit , eu leaders said the bloc would start accession talks with croatia on march 17 - provided it cooperates fully with the icty . that means finding and handing over gotovina , who went into hiding in 2001 when the un court charged him with war crimes against ethnic serbs at the end of croatia 's 1991-95 war of independence from the former yugoslavia . luxembourg foreign minister jean asselborn of the eu 's current presidency said the bloc 's decision on whether to proceed with talks from march 17 would depend in large part on the icty 's appraisal . " every step must go perfectly " confirming the receipt of a letter " from an individual claiming to be mr gotovina 's lawyer , " he said the issue of croatia would be discussed when us secretary of state condoleezza rice visits luxembourg on feb .
9 and 10 . " if tomorrow mr gotovina turns up in the hague , that 's that and we can start earlier , " asselborn said after a meeting of eu foreign ministers .
" but until that happens , march 17 is a buffer date for the start of the negotiations with croatia . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cathedral square in croatia 's capital , zagreb like any other eu candidate , croatia will have to strive hard to transpose the 80,000 pages of eu legislation and standards known as the " acquis communautaire .

but much hinges on whether ante gotovina is produced to face war-crimes charges at the hague . rehn issued his starkest warning yet that the eu would postpone a march date to launch entry talks with zagreb if the retired general is not delivered to the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- . the finnish commissioner said he was " convinced that if the croatian government had the political will to locate and transfer general gotovina , it could do so . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olli rehn rehn -lrb- photo -rrb- said that based on information from un chief prosecutor carla del ponte and other " very informed sources , " croatia and gotovina have discussed a " possible voluntary surrender of general gotovina which did not materialize . " gotovina was also most probably sheltering in croatia or croatian areas of bosnia-hercegovina , " in any case within the reach of the croatian government , " he added . croatian premier surprised croatian prime minister ivo sanader voiced surprise over the threat to postpone the start of entry talks , rejecting the allegation that the government had had contacts with gotovina . " i am not worried but surprised , " sanader told croatian national radio speaking from luxembourg .
" croatia is fully cooperating with the un war crimes tribunal at the hague . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ivo sanader information that the government had held talks with gotovina was " not true , " said the prime minister -lrb- photo -rrb- , adding he was confident accession talks would begin as scheduled on march 17 . gotovina 's lawyer luka misetic said earlier this month that his client would surrender if his case was transferred to a croatian court , a deal immediately dismissed by un prosecutors and by zagreb . eu ready to postpone talks releasing the eu executive 's proposed plan of accession negotiations with croatia , rehn said that zagreb would not today be considered as deserving of eu talks . " if the commission were to give its recommendation on the basis of today 's information , i could not recommend opening negotiations with croatia , " he told a news conference .
" if there is no progress from the croatian side -lrb- on gotovina -rrb- , we are ready to postpone the start of talks . " at a december summit , eu leaders said the bloc would start accession talks with croatia on march 17 - provided it cooperates fully with the icty . that means finding and handing over gotovina , who went into hiding in 2001 when the un court charged him with war crimes against ethnic serbs at the end of croatia 's 1991-95 war of independence from the former yugoslavia . luxembourg foreign minister jean asselborn of the eu 's current presidency said the bloc 's decision on whether to proceed with talks from march 17 would depend in large part on the icty 's appraisal . " every step must go perfectly " confirming the receipt of a letter " from an individual claiming to be mr gotovina 's lawyer , " he said the issue of croatia would be discussed when us secretary of state condoleezza rice visits luxembourg on feb .
9 and 10 . " if tomorrow mr gotovina turns up in the hague , that 's that and we can start earlier , " asselborn said after a meeting of eu foreign ministers .
" but until that happens , march 17 is a buffer date for the start of the negotiations with croatia . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cathedral square in croatia 's capital , zagreb like any other eu candidate , croatia will have to strive hard to transpose the 80,000 pages of eu legislation and standards known as the " acquis communautaire . " rehn proposed to eu member states that the accession negotiations be broken down into 35 chapters and the talks be conducted chapter by chapter . " to meet 2009 , every step must go perfectly , " he said . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de croatian president wins reelection croatian president stipe mesic beat his ruling conservative party rival in sunday 's election , securing a second five-year term and promising to lead the former yugoslav republic into the european union .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 01.02.2005 virtual battle between serbs and croats großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : digital hostilities have broken out in the balkans hackers in the former yugoslavia have been going at it .
croats , serbs and albanians are hacking into each others ' web sites and leaving nationalistic slogans .
on online forums , bitter political debates have been ignited . in december , albanian internet enthusiasts hacked into the kosovo-based site of the serbian orthodox church .
instead of the usual pictures of the monastery found there , the words " kosovo will gain its independence " popped up on web browsers . in response , serb hackers attacked the online offering of the albanian capital tirana and posted a stream of curses on the page .
over the past four weeks , some 100 web sites from serbia as well as about a dozen albanian ones were illegally altered . virtual attacks the trigger for these virtual attacks between serbs and croats in the second part of december was an incident in which a nationally minded serb basketball player was refused entry to croatia .
croatian hackers let their dissatisfaction over the athlete 's political stance be widely known by launching a virtual attack on the homepage of serbia 's largest private broadcaster , " pink . "
the hackers posted the words " greetings to greater serbia " on the site , accompanied by the croatian flag and emblem . that did n't please serbian hackers and they in turn gained access to the official site of the croatian world ski champion janica kostelic , leaving their own message of " greetings to croatia " behind , along with photographs of the serbian national team .
in the following two weeks , more than 80 croatian and serbian web sites were manipulated , with each side posting more and less explicit nationalistic slogans on " enemy " sites . why and to what end ? the offenders from both countries told media outlets that there were n't any nationalistic motives behind their actions , but that they simply wanted to draw attention to their hacking abilities .
" it does n't matter to me whether i hack into a serbian , croatian , albanian or whatever kind of site , " one notorious serbian hacker who calls himself " acid cookie " said in a radio interview . another one , who goes under the code name " dtm , " explains that he was only interested in pointing out the security lapses in online networks in the balkans .
he said it " is a lot of fun when you can publish your own opinion on a site that has a million visitors a day . " crossing borders but an exchange of opinion between the two peoples of the former yugoslavia , who within the last decade and a half were engaged in a bloody civil war , can take forms besides illegal web site changes .
popular sites such as that operated by the belgrade broadcaster " b92 " or the croatian portal " index.hr " maintain forums in which current political affairs are discussed , even beyond national borders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : veran matic , head of belgrade radio station b-92 , in 1999 on the " b92 " site , many albanians have left messages arguing for the independence of kosovo or against a division of the province which is currently under un administration .
on " index.hr " numerous serbs , montenegrins and bosnians have become engaged participants in discussions about war crimes and coming to terms with the region 's recent past . precursor for real meetings such internet forums , according to lorenz graf , a sociologist who studies the internet at the university of cologne , are an important way in which opinions are formed these days .
but they are n't without risks . " i think that these forums present ways to inform political opinions , " he said .
" but when they are too general , they do n't have a great deal of influence , because they are n't specific enough . " cross-border internet contacts between young computer users in the region also often serve as substitutes for real-time travel .
almost 10 years after the balkans war , tourists from serbia are seldom seen on the croatian coast , just as one would be hard to find a croat in belgrade .

croats , serbs and albanians are hacking into each others ' web sites and leaving nationalistic slogans .
on online forums , bitter political debates have been ignited . in december , albanian internet enthusiasts hacked into the kosovo-based site of the serbian orthodox church .
instead of the usual pictures of the monastery found there , the words " kosovo will gain its independence " popped up on web browsers . in response , serb hackers attacked the online offering of the albanian capital tirana and posted a stream of curses on the page .
over the past four weeks , some 100 web sites from serbia as well as about a dozen albanian ones were illegally altered . virtual attacks the trigger for these virtual attacks between serbs and croats in the second part of december was an incident in which a nationally minded serb basketball player was refused entry to croatia .
croatian hackers let their dissatisfaction over the athlete 's political stance be widely known by launching a virtual attack on the homepage of serbia 's largest private broadcaster , " pink . "
the hackers posted the words " greetings to greater serbia " on the site , accompanied by the croatian flag and emblem . that did n't please serbian hackers and they in turn gained access to the official site of the croatian world ski champion janica kostelic , leaving their own message of " greetings to croatia " behind , along with photographs of the serbian national team .
in the following two weeks , more than 80 croatian and serbian web sites were manipulated , with each side posting more and less explicit nationalistic slogans on " enemy " sites . why and to what end ? the offenders from both countries told media outlets that there were n't any nationalistic motives behind their actions , but that they simply wanted to draw attention to their hacking abilities .
" it does n't matter to me whether i hack into a serbian , croatian , albanian or whatever kind of site , " one notorious serbian hacker who calls himself " acid cookie " said in a radio interview . another one , who goes under the code name " dtm , " explains that he was only interested in pointing out the security lapses in online networks in the balkans .
he said it " is a lot of fun when you can publish your own opinion on a site that has a million visitors a day . " crossing borders but an exchange of opinion between the two peoples of the former yugoslavia , who within the last decade and a half were engaged in a bloody civil war , can take forms besides illegal web site changes .
popular sites such as that operated by the belgrade broadcaster " b92 " or the croatian portal " index.hr " maintain forums in which current political affairs are discussed , even beyond national borders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : veran matic , head of belgrade radio station b-92 , in 1999 on the " b92 " site , many albanians have left messages arguing for the independence of kosovo or against a division of the province which is currently under un administration .
on " index.hr " numerous serbs , montenegrins and bosnians have become engaged participants in discussions about war crimes and coming to terms with the region 's recent past . precursor for real meetings such internet forums , according to lorenz graf , a sociologist who studies the internet at the university of cologne , are an important way in which opinions are formed these days .
but they are n't without risks . " i think that these forums present ways to inform political opinions , " he said .
" but when they are too general , they do n't have a great deal of influence , because they are n't specific enough . " cross-border internet contacts between young computer users in the region also often serve as substitutes for real-time travel .
almost 10 years after the balkans war , tourists from serbia are seldom seen on the croatian coast , just as one would be hard to find a croat in belgrade .
but the brisk reporting in the region from several countries on the internet means that many there have already formed a mental picture of their neighbors . " i can well imagine that such forums can actually bring people closer together , " said graf .
" maybe the participants will say to each other one day , ' you seem nice , why do n't we meet up ' .

now , help is at hand thanks to the slightly macabre " phone angel . " a german inventor has come up with a novel way for relatives coping with the grief of losing a loved one to convey their feelings to the departed .
the " phone angel , " a long-life battery powered cell phone device , allows those in mourning to have contact with the deceased when personal pain , distance or disability prevents them from attending the final resting place . not to be confused with a seance or ouija board , the phone angel does n't promise to put you in touch with the spirit world but intends to provide comfort for those coming to terms with their loss by opening the airwaves .

the phone angel clicks on and allows communication as if someone on the other end had picked up the receiver .
unlike the recipient of the call , the line is very rarely dead . once the battery has run down , the temptation would be to just cut the losses and leave the device in the ground .

revelations on monday named players accused of receiving cash incentives in disputed games . the corruption scandal engulfing german soccer shows no sign of dying down with the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- investigation claiming another scalp on monday . it has been revealed that the sc paderborn captain , thijs waterink , received € 10,000 -lrb- $ 13,000 -rrb- from an anonymous backer as an incentive to defeat hamburg in the german cup tie , one of the four matches shamed referee robert hoyzer has since admitted to manipulating for a € 70,000 purse " i did not know before the game that the players would be receiving this bonus , " paderborn president wilfried finke told the n24 television channel .
" a man from southern europe phoned team captain waterink and said , ' there is € 10,000 as a team bonus if you win against hamburg .
if you do not , we want the money back . " ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : referee robert hoyzer during hamburg-paderborn game paderborn won the game 4-2 after hoyzer awarded two controversial penalty kicks and sent off hamburg 's belgian international emile mpenza .
dutchman waterink split the unrecorded bonus among his victorious team-mates . he has since been suspended as part of the escalating investigation which has already seen the end of hoyzer 's career while four men were arrested last week and three have been charged with fraud in connection with the case . fears of a scandal to rival 1971 the widening scandal has ominous similarities to the one that plunged german soccer into its darkest hour 34 years ago .
match-fixing and bribes engulfed the bundesliga in 1971 when more than 50 players , a number of coaches and officials plus the clubs arminia bielefeld and kickers offenbach were found guilty of offering bribes and fixing bundesliga games , prompting the dfb to dish out hefty fines and suspensions . revelations of coercion between parties will no doubt bring the nightmares back for the dfb - and it is likely to get worse .
the news that both paderborn and hoyzer were directly involved has caused a further shock and finke claims it is highly likely that hamburg also have a role to play . hamburg players suspected of complicity " this is just the tip of the iceberg , " explained finke .
" since the referee and paderborn players are involved i would also suggest that the hamburg players are looked at too .
to ensure a bet comes off you need all three parties involved - the winners , the losers and the referee . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg sv hamburg are furious at the implication and club president bernd hoffmann admitted legal action was being considered .
" the comments are a disgrace , " raged hoffmann .
" we will speak with our lawyer about these claims and think about taking legal action . " hertha berlin are another bundesliga side implicated in the scandal with three of their players - alexander madlung , nando rafael and josip simunic - named in connection with a second round cup match between hertha and eintracht braunschweig on sept .
22 of last year . regional side braunschweig won 3-2 with defender madlung scoring an own goal in the 80th minute to seal hertha 's defeat .
the capital club have denied that their players were involved and the trio have pleaded their innocence . more clubs and players to be probed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dfb investigation hopes to move swiftly to close the case .
two other lower division clubs dresden and chemnitz have also been mentioned in connection with match-fixing while referee jurgen jansen is also being investigated after he was named by hoyzer . jansen was due to referee werder bremen 's match against hansa rostock on sunday but the dfb chose to remove him before kick-off .
the dfb described jansen 's removal as a " purely precautionary measure , " saying he was n't suspected of fixing matches .
jansen gave a sworn statement on monday denying any connection to the affair . meanwhile , bookmaker oddset has accused the dfb of failing to heed a tip-off they gave on august 23 of last year in regard to the hamburg-paderborn game .
oddset maintained they sent a fax to the dfb 48 hours after the cup match but dfb president gerhard mayer-vorfelder denied the bookmaker 's claim . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : a shadow over german soccer german soccer has struggled recently .

the controversial vehicles are not deemed safe by everyone but eu officials required germany to allow teens to drive them anyway . unlike their contemporaries in many other countries , german teenagers have so far had to wait until turning 18 before being able to drive a car .
that 's no longer the case as 16-year-olds can now get a driver 's license for " be up , " " albizia " or mc1 , " as some of the mini cars are called . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : minicar mc1 at first sight , the vehicles almost look like normal cars , but they only weigh around 350 kilograms -lrb- about 700 pounds -rrb- and can not go faster than 45 kilometers per hour -lrb- 28 miles per hour -rrb- . the lightweight automobiles have raised the eyebrows of car experts , who are concerned about their safety . " these cars do n't offer any active or passive security measures for the driver , " said otto saalmann of germany 's largest automobile club , adac , which has conducted a crash test with a mini car .

the controversial vehicles are not deemed safe by everyone but eu officials required germany to allow teens to drive them anyway . unlike their contemporaries in many other countries , german teenagers have so far had to wait until turning 18 before being able to drive a car .
that 's no longer the case as 16-year-olds can now get a driver 's license for " be up , " " albizia " or mc1 , " as some of the mini cars are called . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : minicar mc1 at first sight , the vehicles almost look like normal cars , but they only weigh around 350 kilograms -lrb- about 700 pounds -rrb- and can not go faster than 45 kilometers per hour -lrb- 28 miles per hour -rrb- . the lightweight automobiles have raised the eyebrows of car experts , who are concerned about their safety . " these cars do n't offer any active or passive security measures for the driver , " said otto saalmann of germany 's largest automobile club , adac , which has conducted a crash test with a mini car . " the drivers ' crumple zone is pretty much his own body , " saalmann added , saying that the risk of injury was extremely high and that during the test , major parts broke and the transmission was pushed inside the car .
apart from security problems with the vehicle , saalmann also said mini cars posed a risk on streets as they slow down traffic . " they can drive on countryside highways , leading to congestion , accidents and risky overtake maneuvers , " he said . eu pushes for teen license bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mini cars are also more common on japanese streets but eu competition regulations brought about the driver 's licenses for 16-year-olds .
germany did have stricter rules than other union members - only people aged 18 and over who had a regular driver 's license where allowed to drive mini cars .
few dealers sold the mainly french products and they were rarely seen on german roads . eu commissioners saw this as a competitive disadvantage for mini car makers on the german market and pressured germany 's federal government to lower the age requirement to allow teens to drive before turning 18 . mathieu grosch , a belgian eu parliamentarian , said he agreed with the commission 's assessment that german law violated competition rules . " clearly there are market tendencies where some people say that they do n't want to sell this product in favor of another , " he said .
" but that 's a form of protectionism which can not be tolerated . " german compromise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the model of a " quad " bike on a german driver 's license as a compromise , germany decided to introduce a new class of driver 's licences that can be obtained at 16 years of age .
the so-called " s " license allows teens to drive mini cars and ride " trikes " and " quads " - motor bikes with three and four wheels .
to get licensed , applicants have to pass a written and practical exam . by introducing the " s " license , germany complied with eu demands but still sets the bar much higher than its neighboring countries .
government officials said they believed the new license represented the best possible compromise between eu and national law . " the only question that 's important here is : ' what kind of license do i need to safely drive such a car ' ? " said christian weibrecht , a spokesman for the german transportation ministry .
" the question is n't whether such cars are safe or not .
it 's important to remember that these vehicles have been legal in other eu countries for years and that according to eu law , we can not prevent that they are sold and driven in germany . " experts are not waiting to see whether teenagers will actually end up applying for the " s " license and starting a boom of mini cars on german streets .
if nothing else , the costs might keep them from doing so : a license will set them back between € 800 and € 1,000 and mini cars come with an average price tag of € 10,000 . and when the young drivers are ready to switch to the real thing two years later , they will have to start from scratch again to get a " real " driver 's license . christiane wolters -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a little high 's ok on german highways cannabis might still be illegal in germany , but police officers have long ignored the occasional joint smoker .

27 german president host köhler on tuesday began an official four-day state visit to israel .
the highlight of his visit will a be a controversial speech before the israeli parliament on wednesday . köhler , the former head of the international monetary fund , has made a name for himself as a man who hates small talk and likes to get down to business right away .
his talks with high-ranking israeli leaders later on tuesdy will provide him with another opportunity to do just that . but for several reasons , the visit is anything but a routine job for germany 's president , said manfred lahnstein , the head of the hamburg-based german-israeli society . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we have encouraging developments in the middle east and that is a good background for the visit , " lahnstein said , adding that it marks the 40th anniversary of diplomatic relations between germany and israel .
" we have had the celebrations marking the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the auschwitz annihilation camp .
so you have our ongoing historic responsibility , the fostering and strengthening of excellent albeit not normal relations between the two countries and some political processes , which look promising . " german speech sparks protests on wednesday , köhler is due to deliver a speech on german-israeli relations before parliament , the knesset .
his plan to hold his speech in german has already provoked protests among a small number of israeli deputies who are poised to leave the hall when köhler starts his speech . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knesset in jerusalem israel ’ s minister of health dani naveh said he plans to boycott president köhler ’ s speech .
he told the right-wing israeli daily newspaper maariv that as long as holocaust survivors are still alive , german should not be spoken in israel 's parliament . his comment echoed the feelings of a number of parliamentary deputies .
the acting president of the knesset , hemi doron , said he would ask his superiors either to cancel the speech or to ask köhler to hold it in english .
doron , whose grandfather was killed in the holocaust , said his feet had never touched german soil and he never bought german products .
so he could not allow the german language to be spoken in the jewish people ’ s house of parliament . " a normal procedure " but lahnstein said köhler 's decision to speak in german was nothing unusual nor unprecendented . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former president johannes rau -lrb- right -rrb- and his israeli counterpart , moshe katzav -lrb- left -rrb- in germany in 2002 .
" that is a normal procedure that a president of a country who visits the parliament of another country and delivers a speech does so in his own tongue , " he said , adding that former german president johannes rau -lrb- photo -rrb- was the first to do so five years ago .
" on the other hand we have to understand that there are some members of the knesset , which for very personal reasons can not live with it and they will leave the hall of the knesset .
this happened five years ago as well and we have to understand it , and the rest should be dignity on both sides and it will be dignity on both sides . " some jewish public figures have spoken out in favor of köhler using his native german .
knesset speaker reuven rivlin , who was instrumental in the decision to allow the visiting president to deliver his speech in german , insisted it would be better not to extend an invitation than to demand that the guest speak in a different language .
and israel ’ s former ambassador to germany , avi primor -lrb- photo below -rrb- , also said he thinks there is no reason why köhler should not speak in german . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : avi primor " first of all , the relations between israel and germany are such that this kind of a question should n't arise at all , " he said .
" and secondly , the german language is not only the language of the nazis , but was a very important language before the nazis and is a very important language after the nazis .
it was a very important language for the jewish people . " german far-right overshadows visit but political observers in germany are also afraid that köhler ’ s trip to israel may be overshadowed by a recent scandal surrounding the far-right national party -lrb- npd -rrb- in saxony ’ s regional assembly .
npd leaders there had likened the end-of-wwii allied bombings on german towns to the holocaust , giving rise to a fresh debate about anti-semitism in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a yellow star of david that jews were forced to wear by the nazis is on display at yad vashem manfred lahnstein said the german president will have no way of dodging the issue , but is confident that the incident will not mar köhler ’ s talks with israeli leaders . during his trip , the german president will also take out time to visit the yad vashem holocaust memorial where he ’ s due to honor the six million jews murdered by the nazis . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de remembering germany 's darkest place commemorative events marking the 60th anniversary of the liberation of auschwitz continued throughout thursday as world leaders spoke of an evil that must never be allowed to surface again .

revelations on monday named players accused of receiving cash incentives in disputed games . the corruption scandal engulfing german soccer shows no sign of dying down with the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- investigation claiming another scalp on monday . it has been revealed that the sc paderborn captain , thijs waterink , received € 10,000 -lrb- $ 13,000 -rrb- from an anonymous backer as an incentive to defeat hamburg in the german cup tie , one of the four matches shamed referee robert hoyzer has since admitted to manipulating for a € 70,000 purse " i did not know before the game that the players would be receiving this bonus , " paderborn president wilfried finke told the n24 television channel .
" a man from southern europe phoned team captain waterink and said , ' there is € 10,000 as a team bonus if you win against hamburg .
if you do not , we want the money back . " ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : referee robert hoyzer during hamburg-paderborn game paderborn won the game 4-2 after hoyzer awarded two controversial penalty kicks and sent off hamburg 's belgian international emile mpenza .
dutchman waterink split the unrecorded bonus among his victorious team-mates . he has since been suspended as part of the escalating investigation which has already seen the end of hoyzer 's career while four men were arrested last week and three have been charged with fraud in connection with the case . fears of a scandal to rival 1971 the widening scandal has ominous similarities to the one that plunged german soccer into its darkest hour 34 years ago .
match-fixing and bribes engulfed the bundesliga in 1971 when more than 50 players , a number of coaches and officials plus the clubs arminia bielefeld and kickers offenbach were found guilty of offering bribes and fixing bundesliga games , prompting the dfb to dish out hefty fines and suspensions . revelations of coercion between parties will no doubt bring the nightmares back for the dfb - and it is likely to get worse .
the news that both paderborn and hoyzer were directly involved has caused a further shock and finke claims it is highly likely that hamburg also have a role to play . hamburg players suspected of complicity " this is just the tip of the iceberg , " explained finke .
" since the referee and paderborn players are involved i would also suggest that the hamburg players are looked at too .
to ensure a bet comes off you need all three parties involved - the winners , the losers and the referee . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg sv hamburg are furious at the implication and club president bernd hoffmann admitted legal action was being considered .
" the comments are a disgrace , " raged hoffmann .
" we will speak with our lawyer about these claims and think about taking legal action .

the capital club have denied that their players were involved and the trio have pleaded their innocence . more clubs and players to be probed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dfb investigation hopes to move swiftly to close the case .
two other lower division clubs dresden and chemnitz have also been mentioned in connection with match-fixing while referee jurgen jansen is also being investigated after he was named by hoyzer . jansen was due to referee werder bremen 's match against hansa rostock on sunday but the dfb chose to remove him before kick-off .
the dfb described jansen 's removal as a " purely precautionary measure , " saying he was n't suspected of fixing matches .
jansen gave a sworn statement on monday denying any connection to the affair . meanwhile , bookmaker oddset has accused the dfb of failing to heed a tip-off they gave on august 23 of last year in regard to the hamburg-paderborn game .
oddset maintained they sent a fax to the dfb 48 hours after the cup match but dfb president gerhard mayer-vorfelder denied the bookmaker 's claim . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : a shadow over german soccer german soccer has struggled recently .

croats , serbs and albanians are hacking into each others ' web sites and leaving nationalistic slogans .
on online forums , bitter political debates have been ignited . in december , albanian internet enthusiasts hacked into the kosovo-based site of the serbian orthodox church .
instead of the usual pictures of the monastery found there , the words " kosovo will gain its independence " popped up on web browsers . in response , serb hackers attacked the online offering of the albanian capital tirana and posted a stream of curses on the page .
over the past four weeks , some 100 web sites from serbia as well as about a dozen albanian ones were illegally altered . virtual attacks the trigger for these virtual attacks between serbs and croats in the second part of december was an incident in which a nationally minded serb basketball player was refused entry to croatia .
croatian hackers let their dissatisfaction over the athlete 's political stance be widely known by launching a virtual attack on the homepage of serbia 's largest private broadcaster , " pink . "
the hackers posted the words " greetings to greater serbia " on the site , accompanied by the croatian flag and emblem . that did n't please serbian hackers and they in turn gained access to the official site of the croatian world ski champion janica kostelic , leaving their own message of " greetings to croatia " behind , along with photographs of the serbian national team .
in the following two weeks , more than 80 croatian and serbian web sites were manipulated , with each side posting more and less explicit nationalistic slogans on " enemy " sites . why and to what end ? the offenders from both countries told media outlets that there were n't any nationalistic motives behind their actions , but that they simply wanted to draw attention to their hacking abilities .
" it does n't matter to me whether i hack into a serbian , croatian , albanian or whatever kind of site , " one notorious serbian hacker who calls himself " acid cookie " said in a radio interview . another one , who goes under the code name " dtm , " explains that he was only interested in pointing out the security lapses in online networks in the balkans .
he said it " is a lot of fun when you can publish your own opinion on a site that has a million visitors a day . " crossing borders but an exchange of opinion between the two peoples of the former yugoslavia , who within the last decade and a half were engaged in a bloody civil war , can take forms besides illegal web site changes .
popular sites such as that operated by the belgrade broadcaster " b92 " or the croatian portal " index.hr " maintain forums in which current political affairs are discussed , even beyond national borders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : veran matic , head of belgrade radio station b-92 , in 1999 on the " b92 " site , many albanians have left messages arguing for the independence of kosovo or against a division of the province which is currently under un administration .
on " index.hr " numerous serbs , montenegrins and bosnians have become engaged participants in discussions about war crimes and coming to terms with the region 's recent past . precursor for real meetings such internet forums , according to lorenz graf , a sociologist who studies the internet at the university of cologne , are an important way in which opinions are formed these days .
but they are n't without risks . " i think that these forums present ways to inform political opinions , " he said .
" but when they are too general , they do n't have a great deal of influence , because they are n't specific enough . " cross-border internet contacts between young computer users in the region also often serve as substitutes for real-time travel .
almost 10 years after the balkans war , tourists from serbia are seldom seen on the croatian coast , just as one would be hard to find a croat in belgrade .
but the brisk reporting in the region from several countries on the internet means that many there have already formed a mental picture of their neighbors . " i can well imagine that such forums can actually bring people closer together , " said graf .
" maybe the participants will say to each other one day , ' you seem nice , why do n't we meet up ' . " internet abuse but it 's not only the tolerant and open-minded who are posting in internet forums , xenophobes have also found a platform there for their own opinions , although their entries are often quickly deleted by forum moderators .
still , these kinds of forums are increasingly becoming targets of hostile attacks because the computer programs that run them are easy prey for experts . using the internet to spread hateful political messages is nothing new .
during the nato bombing campaign against serbia in spring 1999 , the central computers of the allied forces and the pentagon were attacked and anti-war messages were posted on many web sites . however , in the balkans , it is illegal to manipulate web sites belonging to other people or organizations .
xenophobic pronouncements are also against the law , even in internet forums .
but to take action , authorities have to first learn the real name and physical address of the usually anonymous poster .

croats , serbs and albanians are hacking into each others ' web sites and leaving nationalistic slogans .
on online forums , bitter political debates have been ignited . in december , albanian internet enthusiasts hacked into the kosovo-based site of the serbian orthodox church .
instead of the usual pictures of the monastery found there , the words " kosovo will gain its independence " popped up on web browsers . in response , serb hackers attacked the online offering of the albanian capital tirana and posted a stream of curses on the page .
over the past four weeks , some 100 web sites from serbia as well as about a dozen albanian ones were illegally altered . virtual attacks the trigger for these virtual attacks between serbs and croats in the second part of december was an incident in which a nationally minded serb basketball player was refused entry to croatia .
croatian hackers let their dissatisfaction over the athlete 's political stance be widely known by launching a virtual attack on the homepage of serbia 's largest private broadcaster , " pink . "
the hackers posted the words " greetings to greater serbia " on the site , accompanied by the croatian flag and emblem . that did n't please serbian hackers and they in turn gained access to the official site of the croatian world ski champion janica kostelic , leaving their own message of " greetings to croatia " behind , along with photographs of the serbian national team .
in the following two weeks , more than 80 croatian and serbian web sites were manipulated , with each side posting more and less explicit nationalistic slogans on " enemy " sites . why and to what end ? the offenders from both countries told media outlets that there were n't any nationalistic motives behind their actions , but that they simply wanted to draw attention to their hacking abilities .
" it does n't matter to me whether i hack into a serbian , croatian , albanian or whatever kind of site , " one notorious serbian hacker who calls himself " acid cookie " said in a radio interview . another one , who goes under the code name " dtm , " explains that he was only interested in pointing out the security lapses in online networks in the balkans .
he said it " is a lot of fun when you can publish your own opinion on a site that has a million visitors a day . " crossing borders but an exchange of opinion between the two peoples of the former yugoslavia , who within the last decade and a half were engaged in a bloody civil war , can take forms besides illegal web site changes .
popular sites such as that operated by the belgrade broadcaster " b92 " or the croatian portal " index.hr " maintain forums in which current political affairs are discussed , even beyond national borders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : veran matic , head of belgrade radio station b-92 , in 1999 on the " b92 " site , many albanians have left messages arguing for the independence of kosovo or against a division of the province which is currently under un administration .
on " index.hr " numerous serbs , montenegrins and bosnians have become engaged participants in discussions about war crimes and coming to terms with the region 's recent past . precursor for real meetings such internet forums , according to lorenz graf , a sociologist who studies the internet at the university of cologne , are an important way in which opinions are formed these days .
but they are n't without risks . " i think that these forums present ways to inform political opinions , " he said .
" but when they are too general , they do n't have a great deal of influence , because they are n't specific enough . " cross-border internet contacts between young computer users in the region also often serve as substitutes for real-time travel .
almost 10 years after the balkans war , tourists from serbia are seldom seen on the croatian coast , just as one would be hard to find a croat in belgrade .
but the brisk reporting in the region from several countries on the internet means that many there have already formed a mental picture of their neighbors . " i can well imagine that such forums can actually bring people closer together , " said graf .
" maybe the participants will say to each other one day , ' you seem nice , why do n't we meet up ' . " internet abuse but it 's not only the tolerant and open-minded who are posting in internet forums , xenophobes have also found a platform there for their own opinions , although their entries are often quickly deleted by forum moderators .
still , these kinds of forums are increasingly becoming targets of hostile attacks because the computer programs that run them are easy prey for experts . using the internet to spread hateful political messages is nothing new .
during the nato bombing campaign against serbia in spring 1999 , the central computers of the allied forces and the pentagon were attacked and anti-war messages were posted on many web sites . however , in the balkans , it is illegal to manipulate web sites belonging to other people or organizations .
xenophobic pronouncements are also against the law , even in internet forums .

27 german president host köhler on tuesday began an official four-day state visit to israel .
the highlight of his visit will a be a controversial speech before the israeli parliament on wednesday . köhler , the former head of the international monetary fund , has made a name for himself as a man who hates small talk and likes to get down to business right away .
his talks with high-ranking israeli leaders later on tuesdy will provide him with another opportunity to do just that . but for several reasons , the visit is anything but a routine job for germany 's president , said manfred lahnstein , the head of the hamburg-based german-israeli society . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we have encouraging developments in the middle east and that is a good background for the visit , " lahnstein said , adding that it marks the 40th anniversary of diplomatic relations between germany and israel .
" we have had the celebrations marking the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the auschwitz annihilation camp .
so you have our ongoing historic responsibility , the fostering and strengthening of excellent albeit not normal relations between the two countries and some political processes , which look promising . " german speech sparks protests on wednesday , köhler is due to deliver a speech on german-israeli relations before parliament , the knesset .
his plan to hold his speech in german has already provoked protests among a small number of israeli deputies who are poised to leave the hall when köhler starts his speech . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knesset in jerusalem israel ’ s minister of health dani naveh said he plans to boycott president köhler ’ s speech .
he told the right-wing israeli daily newspaper maariv that as long as holocaust survivors are still alive , german should not be spoken in israel 's parliament . his comment echoed the feelings of a number of parliamentary deputies .
the acting president of the knesset , hemi doron , said he would ask his superiors either to cancel the speech or to ask köhler to hold it in english .
doron , whose grandfather was killed in the holocaust , said his feet had never touched german soil and he never bought german products .
so he could not allow the german language to be spoken in the jewish people ’ s house of parliament . " a normal procedure " but lahnstein said köhler 's decision to speak in german was nothing unusual nor unprecendented . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former president johannes rau -lrb- right -rrb- and his israeli counterpart , moshe katzav -lrb- left -rrb- in germany in 2002 .
" that is a normal procedure that a president of a country who visits the parliament of another country and delivers a speech does so in his own tongue , " he said , adding that former german president johannes rau -lrb- photo -rrb- was the first to do so five years ago .
" on the other hand we have to understand that there are some members of the knesset , which for very personal reasons can not live with it and they will leave the hall of the knesset .
this happened five years ago as well and we have to understand it , and the rest should be dignity on both sides and it will be dignity on both sides . " some jewish public figures have spoken out in favor of köhler using his native german .
knesset speaker reuven rivlin , who was instrumental in the decision to allow the visiting president to deliver his speech in german , insisted it would be better not to extend an invitation than to demand that the guest speak in a different language .
and israel ’ s former ambassador to germany , avi primor -lrb- photo below -rrb- , also said he thinks there is no reason why köhler should not speak in german . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : avi primor " first of all , the relations between israel and germany are such that this kind of a question should n't arise at all , " he said .
" and secondly , the german language is not only the language of the nazis , but was a very important language before the nazis and is a very important language after the nazis .

27 german president host köhler on tuesday began an official four-day state visit to israel .
the highlight of his visit will a be a controversial speech before the israeli parliament on wednesday . köhler , the former head of the international monetary fund , has made a name for himself as a man who hates small talk and likes to get down to business right away .
his talks with high-ranking israeli leaders later on tuesdy will provide him with another opportunity to do just that . but for several reasons , the visit is anything but a routine job for germany 's president , said manfred lahnstein , the head of the hamburg-based german-israeli society . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we have encouraging developments in the middle east and that is a good background for the visit , " lahnstein said , adding that it marks the 40th anniversary of diplomatic relations between germany and israel .
" we have had the celebrations marking the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the auschwitz annihilation camp .
so you have our ongoing historic responsibility , the fostering and strengthening of excellent albeit not normal relations between the two countries and some political processes , which look promising . " german speech sparks protests on wednesday , köhler is due to deliver a speech on german-israeli relations before parliament , the knesset .
his plan to hold his speech in german has already provoked protests among a small number of israeli deputies who are poised to leave the hall when köhler starts his speech . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knesset in jerusalem israel ’ s minister of health dani naveh said he plans to boycott president köhler ’ s speech .
he told the right-wing israeli daily newspaper maariv that as long as holocaust survivors are still alive , german should not be spoken in israel 's parliament . his comment echoed the feelings of a number of parliamentary deputies .
the acting president of the knesset , hemi doron , said he would ask his superiors either to cancel the speech or to ask köhler to hold it in english .
doron , whose grandfather was killed in the holocaust , said his feet had never touched german soil and he never bought german products .
so he could not allow the german language to be spoken in the jewish people ’ s house of parliament . " a normal procedure " but lahnstein said köhler 's decision to speak in german was nothing unusual nor unprecendented . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former president johannes rau -lrb- right -rrb- and his israeli counterpart , moshe katzav -lrb- left -rrb- in germany in 2002 .
" that is a normal procedure that a president of a country who visits the parliament of another country and delivers a speech does so in his own tongue , " he said , adding that former german president johannes rau -lrb- photo -rrb- was the first to do so five years ago .
" on the other hand we have to understand that there are some members of the knesset , which for very personal reasons can not live with it and they will leave the hall of the knesset .
this happened five years ago as well and we have to understand it , and the rest should be dignity on both sides and it will be dignity on both sides . " some jewish public figures have spoken out in favor of köhler using his native german .
knesset speaker reuven rivlin , who was instrumental in the decision to allow the visiting president to deliver his speech in german , insisted it would be better not to extend an invitation than to demand that the guest speak in a different language .
and israel ’ s former ambassador to germany , avi primor -lrb- photo below -rrb- , also said he thinks there is no reason why köhler should not speak in german . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : avi primor " first of all , the relations between israel and germany are such that this kind of a question should n't arise at all , " he said .
" and secondly , the german language is not only the language of the nazis , but was a very important language before the nazis and is a very important language after the nazis .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 01.02.2005 german president visits israel großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst köhler -lrb- center , with hat -rrb- at auschwitz death camp on jan .
27 german president host köhler on tuesday began an official four-day state visit to israel .
the highlight of his visit will a be a controversial speech before the israeli parliament on wednesday . köhler , the former head of the international monetary fund , has made a name for himself as a man who hates small talk and likes to get down to business right away .
his talks with high-ranking israeli leaders later on tuesdy will provide him with another opportunity to do just that . but for several reasons , the visit is anything but a routine job for germany 's president , said manfred lahnstein , the head of the hamburg-based german-israeli society . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we have encouraging developments in the middle east and that is a good background for the visit , " lahnstein said , adding that it marks the 40th anniversary of diplomatic relations between germany and israel .
" we have had the celebrations marking the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the auschwitz annihilation camp .
so you have our ongoing historic responsibility , the fostering and strengthening of excellent albeit not normal relations between the two countries and some political processes , which look promising . " german speech sparks protests on wednesday , köhler is due to deliver a speech on german-israeli relations before parliament , the knesset .
his plan to hold his speech in german has already provoked protests among a small number of israeli deputies who are poised to leave the hall when köhler starts his speech . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knesset in jerusalem israel ’ s minister of health dani naveh said he plans to boycott president köhler ’ s speech .
he told the right-wing israeli daily newspaper maariv that as long as holocaust survivors are still alive , german should not be spoken in israel 's parliament . his comment echoed the feelings of a number of parliamentary deputies .
the acting president of the knesset , hemi doron , said he would ask his superiors either to cancel the speech or to ask köhler to hold it in english .
doron , whose grandfather was killed in the holocaust , said his feet had never touched german soil and he never bought german products .
so he could not allow the german language to be spoken in the jewish people ’ s house of parliament . " a normal procedure " but lahnstein said köhler 's decision to speak in german was nothing unusual nor unprecendented . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former president johannes rau -lrb- right -rrb- and his israeli counterpart , moshe katzav -lrb- left -rrb- in germany in 2002 .
" that is a normal procedure that a president of a country who visits the parliament of another country and delivers a speech does so in his own tongue , " he said , adding that former german president johannes rau -lrb- photo -rrb- was the first to do so five years ago .
" on the other hand we have to understand that there are some members of the knesset , which for very personal reasons can not live with it and they will leave the hall of the knesset .
this happened five years ago as well and we have to understand it , and the rest should be dignity on both sides and it will be dignity on both sides . " some jewish public figures have spoken out in favor of köhler using his native german .
knesset speaker reuven rivlin , who was instrumental in the decision to allow the visiting president to deliver his speech in german , insisted it would be better not to extend an invitation than to demand that the guest speak in a different language .
and israel ’ s former ambassador to germany , avi primor -lrb- photo below -rrb- , also said he thinks there is no reason why köhler should not speak in german . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : avi primor " first of all , the relations between israel and germany are such that this kind of a question should n't arise at all , " he said .
" and secondly , the german language is not only the language of the nazis , but was a very important language before the nazis and is a very important language after the nazis .
it was a very important language for the jewish people . " german far-right overshadows visit but political observers in germany are also afraid that köhler ’ s trip to israel may be overshadowed by a recent scandal surrounding the far-right national party -lrb- npd -rrb- in saxony ’ s regional assembly .
npd leaders there had likened the end-of-wwii allied bombings on german towns to the holocaust , giving rise to a fresh debate about anti-semitism in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a yellow star of david that jews were forced to wear by the nazis is on display at yad vashem manfred lahnstein said the german president will have no way of dodging the issue , but is confident that the incident will not mar köhler ’ s talks with israeli leaders . during his trip , the german president will also take out time to visit the yad vashem holocaust memorial where he ’ s due to honor the six million jews murdered by the nazis . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de remembering germany 's darkest place commemorative events marking the 60th anniversary of the liberation of auschwitz continued throughout thursday as world leaders spoke of an evil that must never be allowed to surface again .

" that is a normal procedure that a president of a country who visits the parliament of another country and delivers a speech does so in his own tongue , " he said , adding that former german president johannes rau -lrb- photo -rrb- was the first to do so five years ago .
" on the other hand we have to understand that there are some members of the knesset , which for very personal reasons can not live with it and they will leave the hall of the knesset .
this happened five years ago as well and we have to understand it , and the rest should be dignity on both sides and it will be dignity on both sides . " some jewish public figures have spoken out in favor of köhler using his native german .
knesset speaker reuven rivlin , who was instrumental in the decision to allow the visiting president to deliver his speech in german , insisted it would be better not to extend an invitation than to demand that the guest speak in a different language .
and israel ’ s former ambassador to germany , avi primor -lrb- photo below -rrb- , also said he thinks there is no reason why köhler should not speak in german . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : avi primor " first of all , the relations between israel and germany are such that this kind of a question should n't arise at all , " he said .
" and secondly , the german language is not only the language of the nazis , but was a very important language before the nazis and is a very important language after the nazis .
it was a very important language for the jewish people . " german far-right overshadows visit but political observers in germany are also afraid that köhler ’ s trip to israel may be overshadowed by a recent scandal surrounding the far-right national party -lrb- npd -rrb- in saxony ’ s regional assembly .

but much hinges on whether ante gotovina is produced to face war-crimes charges at the hague . rehn issued his starkest warning yet that the eu would postpone a march date to launch entry talks with zagreb if the retired general is not delivered to the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- . the finnish commissioner said he was " convinced that if the croatian government had the political will to locate and transfer general gotovina , it could do so . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olli rehn rehn -lrb- photo -rrb- said that based on information from un chief prosecutor carla del ponte and other " very informed sources , " croatia and gotovina have discussed a " possible voluntary surrender of general gotovina which did not materialize . " gotovina was also most probably sheltering in croatia or croatian areas of bosnia-hercegovina , " in any case within the reach of the croatian government , " he added . croatian premier surprised croatian prime minister ivo sanader voiced surprise over the threat to postpone the start of entry talks , rejecting the allegation that the government had had contacts with gotovina . " i am not worried but surprised , " sanader told croatian national radio speaking from luxembourg .
" croatia is fully cooperating with the un war crimes tribunal at the hague . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ivo sanader information that the government had held talks with gotovina was " not true , " said the prime minister -lrb- photo -rrb- , adding he was confident accession talks would begin as scheduled on march 17 . gotovina 's lawyer luka misetic said earlier this month that his client would surrender if his case was transferred to a croatian court , a deal immediately dismissed by un prosecutors and by zagreb . eu ready to postpone talks releasing the eu executive 's proposed plan of accession negotiations with croatia , rehn said that zagreb would not today be considered as deserving of eu talks . " if the commission were to give its recommendation on the basis of today 's information , i could not recommend opening negotiations with croatia , " he told a news conference .
" if there is no progress from the croatian side -lrb- on gotovina -rrb- , we are ready to postpone the start of talks . " at a december summit , eu leaders said the bloc would start accession talks with croatia on march 17 - provided it cooperates fully with the icty . that means finding and handing over gotovina , who went into hiding in 2001 when the un court charged him with war crimes against ethnic serbs at the end of croatia 's 1991-95 war of independence from the former yugoslavia . luxembourg foreign minister jean asselborn of the eu 's current presidency said the bloc 's decision on whether to proceed with talks from march 17 would depend in large part on the icty 's appraisal . " every step must go perfectly " confirming the receipt of a letter " from an individual claiming to be mr gotovina 's lawyer , " he said the issue of croatia would be discussed when us secretary of state condoleezza rice visits luxembourg on feb .
9 and 10 . " if tomorrow mr gotovina turns up in the hague , that 's that and we can start earlier , " asselborn said after a meeting of eu foreign ministers .
" but until that happens , march 17 is a buffer date for the start of the negotiations with croatia . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cathedral square in croatia 's capital , zagreb like any other eu candidate , croatia will have to strive hard to transpose the 80,000 pages of eu legislation and standards known as the " acquis communautaire .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 01.02.2005 virtual battle between serbs and croats großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : digital hostilities have broken out in the balkans hackers in the former yugoslavia have been going at it .
croats , serbs and albanians are hacking into each others ' web sites and leaving nationalistic slogans .
on online forums , bitter political debates have been ignited . in december , albanian internet enthusiasts hacked into the kosovo-based site of the serbian orthodox church .
instead of the usual pictures of the monastery found there , the words " kosovo will gain its independence " popped up on web browsers . in response , serb hackers attacked the online offering of the albanian capital tirana and posted a stream of curses on the page .
over the past four weeks , some 100 web sites from serbia as well as about a dozen albanian ones were illegally altered . virtual attacks the trigger for these virtual attacks between serbs and croats in the second part of december was an incident in which a nationally minded serb basketball player was refused entry to croatia .
croatian hackers let their dissatisfaction over the athlete 's political stance be widely known by launching a virtual attack on the homepage of serbia 's largest private broadcaster , " pink . "
the hackers posted the words " greetings to greater serbia " on the site , accompanied by the croatian flag and emblem . that did n't please serbian hackers and they in turn gained access to the official site of the croatian world ski champion janica kostelic , leaving their own message of " greetings to croatia " behind , along with photographs of the serbian national team .
in the following two weeks , more than 80 croatian and serbian web sites were manipulated , with each side posting more and less explicit nationalistic slogans on " enemy " sites . why and to what end ? the offenders from both countries told media outlets that there were n't any nationalistic motives behind their actions , but that they simply wanted to draw attention to their hacking abilities .
" it does n't matter to me whether i hack into a serbian , croatian , albanian or whatever kind of site , " one notorious serbian hacker who calls himself " acid cookie " said in a radio interview . another one , who goes under the code name " dtm , " explains that he was only interested in pointing out the security lapses in online networks in the balkans .
he said it " is a lot of fun when you can publish your own opinion on a site that has a million visitors a day . " crossing borders but an exchange of opinion between the two peoples of the former yugoslavia , who within the last decade and a half were engaged in a bloody civil war , can take forms besides illegal web site changes .
popular sites such as that operated by the belgrade broadcaster " b92 " or the croatian portal " index.hr " maintain forums in which current political affairs are discussed , even beyond national borders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : veran matic , head of belgrade radio station b-92 , in 1999 on the " b92 " site , many albanians have left messages arguing for the independence of kosovo or against a division of the province which is currently under un administration .
on " index.hr " numerous serbs , montenegrins and bosnians have become engaged participants in discussions about war crimes and coming to terms with the region 's recent past . precursor for real meetings such internet forums , according to lorenz graf , a sociologist who studies the internet at the university of cologne , are an important way in which opinions are formed these days .
but they are n't without risks . " i think that these forums present ways to inform political opinions , " he said .
" but when they are too general , they do n't have a great deal of influence , because they are n't specific enough . " cross-border internet contacts between young computer users in the region also often serve as substitutes for real-time travel .
almost 10 years after the balkans war , tourists from serbia are seldom seen on the croatian coast , just as one would be hard to find a croat in belgrade .
but the brisk reporting in the region from several countries on the internet means that many there have already formed a mental picture of their neighbors . " i can well imagine that such forums can actually bring people closer together , " said graf .
" maybe the participants will say to each other one day , ' you seem nice , why do n't we meet up ' . " internet abuse but it 's not only the tolerant and open-minded who are posting in internet forums , xenophobes have also found a platform there for their own opinions , although their entries are often quickly deleted by forum moderators .
still , these kinds of forums are increasingly becoming targets of hostile attacks because the computer programs that run them are easy prey for experts . using the internet to spread hateful political messages is nothing new .
during the nato bombing campaign against serbia in spring 1999 , the central computers of the allied forces and the pentagon were attacked and anti-war messages were posted on many web sites . however , in the balkans , it is illegal to manipulate web sites belonging to other people or organizations .
xenophobic pronouncements are also against the law , even in internet forums .
but to take action , authorities have to first learn the real name and physical address of the usually anonymous poster .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 01.02.2005 virtual battle between serbs and croats großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : digital hostilities have broken out in the balkans hackers in the former yugoslavia have been going at it .
croats , serbs and albanians are hacking into each others ' web sites and leaving nationalistic slogans .
on online forums , bitter political debates have been ignited . in december , albanian internet enthusiasts hacked into the kosovo-based site of the serbian orthodox church .
instead of the usual pictures of the monastery found there , the words " kosovo will gain its independence " popped up on web browsers . in response , serb hackers attacked the online offering of the albanian capital tirana and posted a stream of curses on the page .
over the past four weeks , some 100 web sites from serbia as well as about a dozen albanian ones were illegally altered . virtual attacks the trigger for these virtual attacks between serbs and croats in the second part of december was an incident in which a nationally minded serb basketball player was refused entry to croatia .
croatian hackers let their dissatisfaction over the athlete 's political stance be widely known by launching a virtual attack on the homepage of serbia 's largest private broadcaster , " pink . "
the hackers posted the words " greetings to greater serbia " on the site , accompanied by the croatian flag and emblem . that did n't please serbian hackers and they in turn gained access to the official site of the croatian world ski champion janica kostelic , leaving their own message of " greetings to croatia " behind , along with photographs of the serbian national team .
in the following two weeks , more than 80 croatian and serbian web sites were manipulated , with each side posting more and less explicit nationalistic slogans on " enemy " sites . why and to what end ? the offenders from both countries told media outlets that there were n't any nationalistic motives behind their actions , but that they simply wanted to draw attention to their hacking abilities .
" it does n't matter to me whether i hack into a serbian , croatian , albanian or whatever kind of site , " one notorious serbian hacker who calls himself " acid cookie " said in a radio interview . another one , who goes under the code name " dtm , " explains that he was only interested in pointing out the security lapses in online networks in the balkans .
he said it " is a lot of fun when you can publish your own opinion on a site that has a million visitors a day . " crossing borders but an exchange of opinion between the two peoples of the former yugoslavia , who within the last decade and a half were engaged in a bloody civil war , can take forms besides illegal web site changes .
popular sites such as that operated by the belgrade broadcaster " b92 " or the croatian portal " index.hr " maintain forums in which current political affairs are discussed , even beyond national borders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : veran matic , head of belgrade radio station b-92 , in 1999 on the " b92 " site , many albanians have left messages arguing for the independence of kosovo or against a division of the province which is currently under un administration .
on " index.hr " numerous serbs , montenegrins and bosnians have become engaged participants in discussions about war crimes and coming to terms with the region 's recent past . precursor for real meetings such internet forums , according to lorenz graf , a sociologist who studies the internet at the university of cologne , are an important way in which opinions are formed these days .
but they are n't without risks . " i think that these forums present ways to inform political opinions , " he said .
" but when they are too general , they do n't have a great deal of influence , because they are n't specific enough . " cross-border internet contacts between young computer users in the region also often serve as substitutes for real-time travel .
almost 10 years after the balkans war , tourists from serbia are seldom seen on the croatian coast , just as one would be hard to find a croat in belgrade .
but the brisk reporting in the region from several countries on the internet means that many there have already formed a mental picture of their neighbors . " i can well imagine that such forums can actually bring people closer together , " said graf .
" maybe the participants will say to each other one day , ' you seem nice , why do n't we meet up ' . " internet abuse but it 's not only the tolerant and open-minded who are posting in internet forums , xenophobes have also found a platform there for their own opinions , although their entries are often quickly deleted by forum moderators .
still , these kinds of forums are increasingly becoming targets of hostile attacks because the computer programs that run them are easy prey for experts . using the internet to spread hateful political messages is nothing new .
during the nato bombing campaign against serbia in spring 1999 , the central computers of the allied forces and the pentagon were attacked and anti-war messages were posted on many web sites . however , in the balkans , it is illegal to manipulate web sites belonging to other people or organizations .
xenophobic pronouncements are also against the law , even in internet forums .
but to take action , authorities have to first learn the real name and physical address of the usually anonymous poster .

but inventors are crying out for a chance to give the country a cutting-edge status . the study , conducted in the eu and the us over a period of five years , was conclusive proof that entrepreneurial spirit does not run through the veins of german society the same way as the desire for steady and secure work .
while more than 61 percent of americans expressed a desire to run their own show , the same percentage of germans said they were put off the idea because of a fear of failure .
yet , there is undoubtedly more to the picture than that , and given the current blot which unemployment is smudging over germany 's social and economic landscape , embracing the lesser known devil and striking out alone could be the answer to some people 's problems .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting innovation taken seriously is a painstaking process heino hanisch , a berlin-based inventor and jack of many trades , has been out of work for several years .
his continued attempts to get a foot back onto the employment ladder have been repeatedly thwarted by his age - he 's in his mid-40 's - and long-term jobless status .
he is realistic rather than pessimistic when he says he may never again be gainfully employed .
" i see self-employment as the only way forward , but that 's not easy either , because you encounter so many hurdles , financial and otherwise , to get there , " hanisch said .
a question of cash for german inventors , the problem with getting out there and turning their innovative dreams into reality is intrinsically linked to a lack of funding .
" as an inventor , you need more than just an idea .
you need money to register the patent , ideally also money to employ a patent lawyer .
you have to create a prototype which can be shown at exhibitions or trade fairs , and then , most importantly , you need money for advertising , " inventor and engineer peter stepina said .
essentially it all boils down to cash .
and germany 's banks are not champing at the bit to hurl their money at independent creative minds .
" there 's no point in even applying for support from the bank unless you have a lot of your own capital , " hanisch added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : banks keep inventors at arms ' length since very few do , many potentially lucrative inventions are stopped in their tracks .
" of course it makes a difference to us if an inventor is prepared to invest his own money into his idea , but we also want to see a thorough business plan and be sure that the inventor has done his market analysis , " christian hotz , a spokesman for deutsche bank said .
again , that 's a process which the average inventor can not afford .
" it 's a case of the cat biting itself in the tail , " hanisch lamented .
but one new initiative set up by the chamber for trade and industry -lrb- ihk -rrb- in the german city of duisburg is blowing some fresh wind into the stagnant world of independent invention .
a new " idea " the project , aptly entitled " idea " is an original attempt to help inventors towards their ultimate goal of turning their models into money .
a pool of some 80 experts from all fields and walks of life work on a voluntary basis to assess the viability of designs and ideas submitted to them from the innovator on the street .
" the problem at the moment is that there is no financial backing available for individuals .
if an inventor wants to access funding , the only way to go about it is to team up with a company .
even the government initiative for patent funding is out of bounds to the individual , " ihk innovations consultant rolf berenz said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new invention for pasta on the go berenz hopes the project will establish a network of people who work together to promote innovation within germany - not only technological innovation but also in the realms of service and management .
he calls it a one-stop shop in which clever ideas are analyzed , assessed and , where appropriate , the inventor gets feedback from a panel of experts .
what about " me incorporated ? "
it 's certainly a step in the right direction and a more structured move to support an often marginalized profession .
at the moment , the only other possibility inventors have at securing external support is through a government-funded program called " me incorporated , " which is designed to encourage the unemployed to start their own businesses .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dog-walking machine has n't yet taken off but getting into the program requires more than a brilliant idea .
" candidates have to get their ideas analyzed by an expert to assess the likelihood of success , " ellen queisser , spokeswoman for the labor office in berlin said .
it 's a vicious circle for the likes of heino hanisch , who believes it takes imagination to see just how a new product might succeed .
" the experts who are supposed to check for viability are long-term employees who have no idea about being self-employed and no idea about what will or will not work . "
whether that is true or not , it remains a fact that german inventors are out there and feeling frustrated about being prevented from adding some dynamism to the entrepreneurial face of the nation . tamsin walker , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de protecting patents at a snail 's pace in the age of globalization , international patents are needed to protect intellectual property .

27 german president host köhler on tuesday began an official four-day state visit to israel .
the highlight of his visit will a be a controversial speech before the israeli parliament on wednesday . köhler , the former head of the international monetary fund , has made a name for himself as a man who hates small talk and likes to get down to business right away .
his talks with high-ranking israeli leaders later on tuesdy will provide him with another opportunity to do just that . but for several reasons , the visit is anything but a routine job for germany 's president , said manfred lahnstein , the head of the hamburg-based german-israeli society . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we have encouraging developments in the middle east and that is a good background for the visit , " lahnstein said , adding that it marks the 40th anniversary of diplomatic relations between germany and israel .
" we have had the celebrations marking the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the auschwitz annihilation camp .
so you have our ongoing historic responsibility , the fostering and strengthening of excellent albeit not normal relations between the two countries and some political processes , which look promising . " german speech sparks protests on wednesday , köhler is due to deliver a speech on german-israeli relations before parliament , the knesset .
his plan to hold his speech in german has already provoked protests among a small number of israeli deputies who are poised to leave the hall when köhler starts his speech . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knesset in jerusalem israel ’ s minister of health dani naveh said he plans to boycott president köhler ’ s speech .
he told the right-wing israeli daily newspaper maariv that as long as holocaust survivors are still alive , german should not be spoken in israel 's parliament . his comment echoed the feelings of a number of parliamentary deputies .
the acting president of the knesset , hemi doron , said he would ask his superiors either to cancel the speech or to ask köhler to hold it in english .
doron , whose grandfather was killed in the holocaust , said his feet had never touched german soil and he never bought german products .
so he could not allow the german language to be spoken in the jewish people ’ s house of parliament . " a normal procedure " but lahnstein said köhler 's decision to speak in german was nothing unusual nor unprecendented . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former president johannes rau -lrb- right -rrb- and his israeli counterpart , moshe katzav -lrb- left -rrb- in germany in 2002 .
" that is a normal procedure that a president of a country who visits the parliament of another country and delivers a speech does so in his own tongue , " he said , adding that former german president johannes rau -lrb- photo -rrb- was the first to do so five years ago .
" on the other hand we have to understand that there are some members of the knesset , which for very personal reasons can not live with it and they will leave the hall of the knesset .
this happened five years ago as well and we have to understand it , and the rest should be dignity on both sides and it will be dignity on both sides . " some jewish public figures have spoken out in favor of köhler using his native german .
knesset speaker reuven rivlin , who was instrumental in the decision to allow the visiting president to deliver his speech in german , insisted it would be better not to extend an invitation than to demand that the guest speak in a different language .
and israel ’ s former ambassador to germany , avi primor -lrb- photo below -rrb- , also said he thinks there is no reason why köhler should not speak in german . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : avi primor " first of all , the relations between israel and germany are such that this kind of a question should n't arise at all , " he said .
" and secondly , the german language is not only the language of the nazis , but was a very important language before the nazis and is a very important language after the nazis .

but much hinges on whether ante gotovina is produced to face war-crimes charges at the hague . rehn issued his starkest warning yet that the eu would postpone a march date to launch entry talks with zagreb if the retired general is not delivered to the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- . the finnish commissioner said he was " convinced that if the croatian government had the political will to locate and transfer general gotovina , it could do so . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olli rehn rehn -lrb- photo -rrb- said that based on information from un chief prosecutor carla del ponte and other " very informed sources , " croatia and gotovina have discussed a " possible voluntary surrender of general gotovina which did not materialize . " gotovina was also most probably sheltering in croatia or croatian areas of bosnia-hercegovina , " in any case within the reach of the croatian government , " he added . croatian premier surprised croatian prime minister ivo sanader voiced surprise over the threat to postpone the start of entry talks , rejecting the allegation that the government had had contacts with gotovina . " i am not worried but surprised , " sanader told croatian national radio speaking from luxembourg .
" croatia is fully cooperating with the un war crimes tribunal at the hague . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ivo sanader information that the government had held talks with gotovina was " not true , " said the prime minister -lrb- photo -rrb- , adding he was confident accession talks would begin as scheduled on march 17 . gotovina 's lawyer luka misetic said earlier this month that his client would surrender if his case was transferred to a croatian court , a deal immediately dismissed by un prosecutors and by zagreb . eu ready to postpone talks releasing the eu executive 's proposed plan of accession negotiations with croatia , rehn said that zagreb would not today be considered as deserving of eu talks . " if the commission were to give its recommendation on the basis of today 's information , i could not recommend opening negotiations with croatia , " he told a news conference .
" if there is no progress from the croatian side -lrb- on gotovina -rrb- , we are ready to postpone the start of talks . " at a december summit , eu leaders said the bloc would start accession talks with croatia on march 17 - provided it cooperates fully with the icty . that means finding and handing over gotovina , who went into hiding in 2001 when the un court charged him with war crimes against ethnic serbs at the end of croatia 's 1991-95 war of independence from the former yugoslavia . luxembourg foreign minister jean asselborn of the eu 's current presidency said the bloc 's decision on whether to proceed with talks from march 17 would depend in large part on the icty 's appraisal . " every step must go perfectly " confirming the receipt of a letter " from an individual claiming to be mr gotovina 's lawyer , " he said the issue of croatia would be discussed when us secretary of state condoleezza rice visits luxembourg on feb .
9 and 10 . " if tomorrow mr gotovina turns up in the hague , that 's that and we can start earlier , " asselborn said after a meeting of eu foreign ministers .
" but until that happens , march 17 is a buffer date for the start of the negotiations with croatia . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cathedral square in croatia 's capital , zagreb like any other eu candidate , croatia will have to strive hard to transpose the 80,000 pages of eu legislation and standards known as the " acquis communautaire .

27 german president host köhler on tuesday began an official four-day state visit to israel .
the highlight of his visit will a be a controversial speech before the israeli parliament on wednesday . köhler , the former head of the international monetary fund , has made a name for himself as a man who hates small talk and likes to get down to business right away .
his talks with high-ranking israeli leaders later on tuesdy will provide him with another opportunity to do just that . but for several reasons , the visit is anything but a routine job for germany 's president , said manfred lahnstein , the head of the hamburg-based german-israeli society . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we have encouraging developments in the middle east and that is a good background for the visit , " lahnstein said , adding that it marks the 40th anniversary of diplomatic relations between germany and israel .
" we have had the celebrations marking the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the auschwitz annihilation camp .
so you have our ongoing historic responsibility , the fostering and strengthening of excellent albeit not normal relations between the two countries and some political processes , which look promising . " german speech sparks protests on wednesday , köhler is due to deliver a speech on german-israeli relations before parliament , the knesset .
his plan to hold his speech in german has already provoked protests among a small number of israeli deputies who are poised to leave the hall when köhler starts his speech . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knesset in jerusalem israel ’ s minister of health dani naveh said he plans to boycott president köhler ’ s speech .
he told the right-wing israeli daily newspaper maariv that as long as holocaust survivors are still alive , german should not be spoken in israel 's parliament . his comment echoed the feelings of a number of parliamentary deputies .
the acting president of the knesset , hemi doron , said he would ask his superiors either to cancel the speech or to ask köhler to hold it in english .
doron , whose grandfather was killed in the holocaust , said his feet had never touched german soil and he never bought german products .
so he could not allow the german language to be spoken in the jewish people ’ s house of parliament . " a normal procedure " but lahnstein said köhler 's decision to speak in german was nothing unusual nor unprecendented . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former president johannes rau -lrb- right -rrb- and his israeli counterpart , moshe katzav -lrb- left -rrb- in germany in 2002 .
" that is a normal procedure that a president of a country who visits the parliament of another country and delivers a speech does so in his own tongue , " he said , adding that former german president johannes rau -lrb- photo -rrb- was the first to do so five years ago .
" on the other hand we have to understand that there are some members of the knesset , which for very personal reasons can not live with it and they will leave the hall of the knesset .
this happened five years ago as well and we have to understand it , and the rest should be dignity on both sides and it will be dignity on both sides . " some jewish public figures have spoken out in favor of köhler using his native german .
knesset speaker reuven rivlin , who was instrumental in the decision to allow the visiting president to deliver his speech in german , insisted it would be better not to extend an invitation than to demand that the guest speak in a different language .
and israel ’ s former ambassador to germany , avi primor -lrb- photo below -rrb- , also said he thinks there is no reason why köhler should not speak in german . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : avi primor " first of all , the relations between israel and germany are such that this kind of a question should n't arise at all , " he said .
" and secondly , the german language is not only the language of the nazis , but was a very important language before the nazis and is a very important language after the nazis .
it was a very important language for the jewish people . " german far-right overshadows visit but political observers in germany are also afraid that köhler ’ s trip to israel may be overshadowed by a recent scandal surrounding the far-right national party -lrb- npd -rrb- in saxony ’ s regional assembly .
npd leaders there had likened the end-of-wwii allied bombings on german towns to the holocaust , giving rise to a fresh debate about anti-semitism in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a yellow star of david that jews were forced to wear by the nazis is on display at yad vashem manfred lahnstein said the german president will have no way of dodging the issue , but is confident that the incident will not mar köhler ’ s talks with israeli leaders . during his trip , the german president will also take out time to visit the yad vashem holocaust memorial where he ’ s due to honor the six million jews murdered by the nazis . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de remembering germany 's darkest place commemorative events marking the 60th anniversary of the liberation of auschwitz continued throughout thursday as world leaders spoke of an evil that must never be allowed to surface again .

27 german president host köhler on tuesday began an official four-day state visit to israel .
the highlight of his visit will a be a controversial speech before the israeli parliament on wednesday . köhler , the former head of the international monetary fund , has made a name for himself as a man who hates small talk and likes to get down to business right away .
his talks with high-ranking israeli leaders later on tuesdy will provide him with another opportunity to do just that . but for several reasons , the visit is anything but a routine job for germany 's president , said manfred lahnstein , the head of the hamburg-based german-israeli society . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we have encouraging developments in the middle east and that is a good background for the visit , " lahnstein said , adding that it marks the 40th anniversary of diplomatic relations between germany and israel .
" we have had the celebrations marking the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the auschwitz annihilation camp .
so you have our ongoing historic responsibility , the fostering and strengthening of excellent albeit not normal relations between the two countries and some political processes , which look promising . " german speech sparks protests on wednesday , köhler is due to deliver a speech on german-israeli relations before parliament , the knesset .
his plan to hold his speech in german has already provoked protests among a small number of israeli deputies who are poised to leave the hall when köhler starts his speech . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knesset in jerusalem israel ’ s minister of health dani naveh said he plans to boycott president köhler ’ s speech .
he told the right-wing israeli daily newspaper maariv that as long as holocaust survivors are still alive , german should not be spoken in israel 's parliament . his comment echoed the feelings of a number of parliamentary deputies .
the acting president of the knesset , hemi doron , said he would ask his superiors either to cancel the speech or to ask köhler to hold it in english .
doron , whose grandfather was killed in the holocaust , said his feet had never touched german soil and he never bought german products .
so he could not allow the german language to be spoken in the jewish people ’ s house of parliament . " a normal procedure " but lahnstein said köhler 's decision to speak in german was nothing unusual nor unprecendented . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former president johannes rau -lrb- right -rrb- and his israeli counterpart , moshe katzav -lrb- left -rrb- in germany in 2002 .
" that is a normal procedure that a president of a country who visits the parliament of another country and delivers a speech does so in his own tongue , " he said , adding that former german president johannes rau -lrb- photo -rrb- was the first to do so five years ago .
" on the other hand we have to understand that there are some members of the knesset , which for very personal reasons can not live with it and they will leave the hall of the knesset .
this happened five years ago as well and we have to understand it , and the rest should be dignity on both sides and it will be dignity on both sides . " some jewish public figures have spoken out in favor of köhler using his native german .
knesset speaker reuven rivlin , who was instrumental in the decision to allow the visiting president to deliver his speech in german , insisted it would be better not to extend an invitation than to demand that the guest speak in a different language .
and israel ’ s former ambassador to germany , avi primor -lrb- photo below -rrb- , also said he thinks there is no reason why köhler should not speak in german . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : avi primor " first of all , the relations between israel and germany are such that this kind of a question should n't arise at all , " he said .
" and secondly , the german language is not only the language of the nazis , but was a very important language before the nazis and is a very important language after the nazis .
it was a very important language for the jewish people . " german far-right overshadows visit but political observers in germany are also afraid that köhler ’ s trip to israel may be overshadowed by a recent scandal surrounding the far-right national party -lrb- npd -rrb- in saxony ’ s regional assembly .
npd leaders there had likened the end-of-wwii allied bombings on german towns to the holocaust , giving rise to a fresh debate about anti-semitism in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a yellow star of david that jews were forced to wear by the nazis is on display at yad vashem manfred lahnstein said the german president will have no way of dodging the issue , but is confident that the incident will not mar köhler ’ s talks with israeli leaders . during his trip , the german president will also take out time to visit the yad vashem holocaust memorial where he ’ s due to honor the six million jews murdered by the nazis . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de remembering germany 's darkest place commemorative events marking the 60th anniversary of the liberation of auschwitz continued throughout thursday as world leaders spoke of an evil that must never be allowed to surface again .

now , help is at hand thanks to the slightly macabre " phone angel . " a german inventor has come up with a novel way for relatives coping with the grief of losing a loved one to convey their feelings to the departed .
the " phone angel , " a long-life battery powered cell phone device , allows those in mourning to have contact with the deceased when personal pain , distance or disability prevents them from attending the final resting place . not to be confused with a seance or ouija board , the phone angel does n't promise to put you in touch with the spirit world but intends to provide comfort for those coming to terms with their loss by opening the airwaves .
and , although it may seem like a bizarre and slightly macabre idea , jürgen bröther from osnabrück has already sold three of the devices at € 1,500 -lrb- $ 1,953 -rrb- a piece . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " sorry , i ca n't come to the phone right now but if you 'd like to leave a message ... "
" people who are ill , have no time or live too far away to visit the deceased in their grave can now call , " said bröther in an interview with the associated press .
the inventor added that the thought came to him when his mother showed an unwillingness to attend a relative 's grave but would have liked to keep in touch with the person laid to rest there . long life battery keeps the airwaves open the device - consisting of a cell phone , a super strength battery and a small loudspeaker - comes in a waterproof container the size of an average shoe box which is placed in the earth about 30 centimeters -lrb- 11.8 inches -rrb- above the grave .
thanks to two years of collaborating with an electrician , bröther has developed a battery which will allow grieving friends and family almost a year of contact . using an application that most modern mobile phones have , automatic call response , bröther 's invention allows every caller to get through .
the phone angel clicks on and allows communication as if someone on the other end had picked up the receiver .
unlike the recipient of the call , the line is very rarely dead . once the battery has run down , the temptation would be to just cut the losses and leave the device in the ground .
but bröther has thought of that .
as a result , with the phone angel just 30 cm below the surface , it can be dug up and returned once the grieving period is over .

but much hinges on whether ante gotovina is produced to face war-crimes charges at the hague . rehn issued his starkest warning yet that the eu would postpone a march date to launch entry talks with zagreb if the retired general is not delivered to the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- . the finnish commissioner said he was " convinced that if the croatian government had the political will to locate and transfer general gotovina , it could do so . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olli rehn rehn -lrb- photo -rrb- said that based on information from un chief prosecutor carla del ponte and other " very informed sources , " croatia and gotovina have discussed a " possible voluntary surrender of general gotovina which did not materialize . " gotovina was also most probably sheltering in croatia or croatian areas of bosnia-hercegovina , " in any case within the reach of the croatian government , " he added . croatian premier surprised croatian prime minister ivo sanader voiced surprise over the threat to postpone the start of entry talks , rejecting the allegation that the government had had contacts with gotovina . " i am not worried but surprised , " sanader told croatian national radio speaking from luxembourg .
" croatia is fully cooperating with the un war crimes tribunal at the hague . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ivo sanader information that the government had held talks with gotovina was " not true , " said the prime minister -lrb- photo -rrb- , adding he was confident accession talks would begin as scheduled on march 17 . gotovina 's lawyer luka misetic said earlier this month that his client would surrender if his case was transferred to a croatian court , a deal immediately dismissed by un prosecutors and by zagreb . eu ready to postpone talks releasing the eu executive 's proposed plan of accession negotiations with croatia , rehn said that zagreb would not today be considered as deserving of eu talks . " if the commission were to give its recommendation on the basis of today 's information , i could not recommend opening negotiations with croatia , " he told a news conference .
" if there is no progress from the croatian side -lrb- on gotovina -rrb- , we are ready to postpone the start of talks . " at a december summit , eu leaders said the bloc would start accession talks with croatia on march 17 - provided it cooperates fully with the icty . that means finding and handing over gotovina , who went into hiding in 2001 when the un court charged him with war crimes against ethnic serbs at the end of croatia 's 1991-95 war of independence from the former yugoslavia . luxembourg foreign minister jean asselborn of the eu 's current presidency said the bloc 's decision on whether to proceed with talks from march 17 would depend in large part on the icty 's appraisal . " every step must go perfectly " confirming the receipt of a letter " from an individual claiming to be mr gotovina 's lawyer , " he said the issue of croatia would be discussed when us secretary of state condoleezza rice visits luxembourg on feb .
9 and 10 . " if tomorrow mr gotovina turns up in the hague , that 's that and we can start earlier , " asselborn said after a meeting of eu foreign ministers .
" but until that happens , march 17 is a buffer date for the start of the negotiations with croatia .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 01.02.2005 reinventing german innovation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an originial idea is hardly enough to power innovation in germany a recent study into the " to be or not to be " of self-employment revealed a national reluctance among germans to go it alone .
but inventors are crying out for a chance to give the country a cutting-edge status . the study , conducted in the eu and the us over a period of five years , was conclusive proof that entrepreneurial spirit does not run through the veins of german society the same way as the desire for steady and secure work .
while more than 61 percent of americans expressed a desire to run their own show , the same percentage of germans said they were put off the idea because of a fear of failure .
yet , there is undoubtedly more to the picture than that , and given the current blot which unemployment is smudging over germany 's social and economic landscape , embracing the lesser known devil and striking out alone could be the answer to some people 's problems .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting innovation taken seriously is a painstaking process heino hanisch , a berlin-based inventor and jack of many trades , has been out of work for several years .
his continued attempts to get a foot back onto the employment ladder have been repeatedly thwarted by his age - he 's in his mid-40 's - and long-term jobless status .
he is realistic rather than pessimistic when he says he may never again be gainfully employed .
" i see self-employment as the only way forward , but that 's not easy either , because you encounter so many hurdles , financial and otherwise , to get there , " hanisch said .
a question of cash for german inventors , the problem with getting out there and turning their innovative dreams into reality is intrinsically linked to a lack of funding .
" as an inventor , you need more than just an idea .
you need money to register the patent , ideally also money to employ a patent lawyer .
you have to create a prototype which can be shown at exhibitions or trade fairs , and then , most importantly , you need money for advertising , " inventor and engineer peter stepina said .
essentially it all boils down to cash .
and germany 's banks are not champing at the bit to hurl their money at independent creative minds .
" there 's no point in even applying for support from the bank unless you have a lot of your own capital , " hanisch added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : banks keep inventors at arms ' length since very few do , many potentially lucrative inventions are stopped in their tracks .
" of course it makes a difference to us if an inventor is prepared to invest his own money into his idea , but we also want to see a thorough business plan and be sure that the inventor has done his market analysis , " christian hotz , a spokesman for deutsche bank said .
again , that 's a process which the average inventor can not afford .
" it 's a case of the cat biting itself in the tail , " hanisch lamented .
but one new initiative set up by the chamber for trade and industry -lrb- ihk -rrb- in the german city of duisburg is blowing some fresh wind into the stagnant world of independent invention .
a new " idea " the project , aptly entitled " idea " is an original attempt to help inventors towards their ultimate goal of turning their models into money .
a pool of some 80 experts from all fields and walks of life work on a voluntary basis to assess the viability of designs and ideas submitted to them from the innovator on the street .
" the problem at the moment is that there is no financial backing available for individuals .
if an inventor wants to access funding , the only way to go about it is to team up with a company .
even the government initiative for patent funding is out of bounds to the individual , " ihk innovations consultant rolf berenz said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new invention for pasta on the go berenz hopes the project will establish a network of people who work together to promote innovation within germany - not only technological innovation but also in the realms of service and management .
he calls it a one-stop shop in which clever ideas are analyzed , assessed and , where appropriate , the inventor gets feedback from a panel of experts .
what about " me incorporated ? "
it 's certainly a step in the right direction and a more structured move to support an often marginalized profession .
at the moment , the only other possibility inventors have at securing external support is through a government-funded program called " me incorporated , " which is designed to encourage the unemployed to start their own businesses .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dog-walking machine has n't yet taken off but getting into the program requires more than a brilliant idea .
" candidates have to get their ideas analyzed by an expert to assess the likelihood of success , " ellen queisser , spokeswoman for the labor office in berlin said .
it 's a vicious circle for the likes of heino hanisch , who believes it takes imagination to see just how a new product might succeed .
" the experts who are supposed to check for viability are long-term employees who have no idea about being self-employed and no idea about what will or will not work . "
whether that is true or not , it remains a fact that german inventors are out there and feeling frustrated about being prevented from adding some dynamism to the entrepreneurial face of the nation . tamsin walker , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de protecting patents at a snail 's pace in the age of globalization , international patents are needed to protect intellectual property .

revelations on monday named players accused of receiving cash incentives in disputed games . the corruption scandal engulfing german soccer shows no sign of dying down with the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- investigation claiming another scalp on monday . it has been revealed that the sc paderborn captain , thijs waterink , received € 10,000 -lrb- $ 13,000 -rrb- from an anonymous backer as an incentive to defeat hamburg in the german cup tie , one of the four matches shamed referee robert hoyzer has since admitted to manipulating for a € 70,000 purse " i did not know before the game that the players would be receiving this bonus , " paderborn president wilfried finke told the n24 television channel .

27 german president host köhler on tuesday began an official four-day state visit to israel .
the highlight of his visit will a be a controversial speech before the israeli parliament on wednesday . köhler , the former head of the international monetary fund , has made a name for himself as a man who hates small talk and likes to get down to business right away .
his talks with high-ranking israeli leaders later on tuesdy will provide him with another opportunity to do just that . but for several reasons , the visit is anything but a routine job for germany 's president , said manfred lahnstein , the head of the hamburg-based german-israeli society . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we have encouraging developments in the middle east and that is a good background for the visit , " lahnstein said , adding that it marks the 40th anniversary of diplomatic relations between germany and israel .
" we have had the celebrations marking the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the auschwitz annihilation camp .
so you have our ongoing historic responsibility , the fostering and strengthening of excellent albeit not normal relations between the two countries and some political processes , which look promising . " german speech sparks protests on wednesday , köhler is due to deliver a speech on german-israeli relations before parliament , the knesset .
his plan to hold his speech in german has already provoked protests among a small number of israeli deputies who are poised to leave the hall when köhler starts his speech . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knesset in jerusalem israel ’ s minister of health dani naveh said he plans to boycott president köhler ’ s speech .
he told the right-wing israeli daily newspaper maariv that as long as holocaust survivors are still alive , german should not be spoken in israel 's parliament . his comment echoed the feelings of a number of parliamentary deputies .
the acting president of the knesset , hemi doron , said he would ask his superiors either to cancel the speech or to ask köhler to hold it in english .
doron , whose grandfather was killed in the holocaust , said his feet had never touched german soil and he never bought german products .
so he could not allow the german language to be spoken in the jewish people ’ s house of parliament . " a normal procedure " but lahnstein said köhler 's decision to speak in german was nothing unusual nor unprecendented . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former president johannes rau -lrb- right -rrb- and his israeli counterpart , moshe katzav -lrb- left -rrb- in germany in 2002 .
" that is a normal procedure that a president of a country who visits the parliament of another country and delivers a speech does so in his own tongue , " he said , adding that former german president johannes rau -lrb- photo -rrb- was the first to do so five years ago .
" on the other hand we have to understand that there are some members of the knesset , which for very personal reasons can not live with it and they will leave the hall of the knesset .
this happened five years ago as well and we have to understand it , and the rest should be dignity on both sides and it will be dignity on both sides . " some jewish public figures have spoken out in favor of köhler using his native german .
knesset speaker reuven rivlin , who was instrumental in the decision to allow the visiting president to deliver his speech in german , insisted it would be better not to extend an invitation than to demand that the guest speak in a different language .
and israel ’ s former ambassador to germany , avi primor -lrb- photo below -rrb- , also said he thinks there is no reason why köhler should not speak in german . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : avi primor " first of all , the relations between israel and germany are such that this kind of a question should n't arise at all , " he said .
" and secondly , the german language is not only the language of the nazis , but was a very important language before the nazis and is a very important language after the nazis .
it was a very important language for the jewish people . " german far-right overshadows visit but political observers in germany are also afraid that köhler ’ s trip to israel may be overshadowed by a recent scandal surrounding the far-right national party -lrb- npd -rrb- in saxony ’ s regional assembly .
npd leaders there had likened the end-of-wwii allied bombings on german towns to the holocaust , giving rise to a fresh debate about anti-semitism in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a yellow star of david that jews were forced to wear by the nazis is on display at yad vashem manfred lahnstein said the german president will have no way of dodging the issue , but is confident that the incident will not mar köhler ’ s talks with israeli leaders . during his trip , the german president will also take out time to visit the yad vashem holocaust memorial where he ’ s due to honor the six million jews murdered by the nazis . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de remembering germany 's darkest place commemorative events marking the 60th anniversary of the liberation of auschwitz continued throughout thursday as world leaders spoke of an evil that must never be allowed to surface again .

croats , serbs and albanians are hacking into each others ' web sites and leaving nationalistic slogans .
on online forums , bitter political debates have been ignited . in december , albanian internet enthusiasts hacked into the kosovo-based site of the serbian orthodox church .
instead of the usual pictures of the monastery found there , the words " kosovo will gain its independence " popped up on web browsers . in response , serb hackers attacked the online offering of the albanian capital tirana and posted a stream of curses on the page .
over the past four weeks , some 100 web sites from serbia as well as about a dozen albanian ones were illegally altered . virtual attacks the trigger for these virtual attacks between serbs and croats in the second part of december was an incident in which a nationally minded serb basketball player was refused entry to croatia .
croatian hackers let their dissatisfaction over the athlete 's political stance be widely known by launching a virtual attack on the homepage of serbia 's largest private broadcaster , " pink . "
the hackers posted the words " greetings to greater serbia " on the site , accompanied by the croatian flag and emblem . that did n't please serbian hackers and they in turn gained access to the official site of the croatian world ski champion janica kostelic , leaving their own message of " greetings to croatia " behind , along with photographs of the serbian national team .
in the following two weeks , more than 80 croatian and serbian web sites were manipulated , with each side posting more and less explicit nationalistic slogans on " enemy " sites . why and to what end ? the offenders from both countries told media outlets that there were n't any nationalistic motives behind their actions , but that they simply wanted to draw attention to their hacking abilities .
" it does n't matter to me whether i hack into a serbian , croatian , albanian or whatever kind of site , " one notorious serbian hacker who calls himself " acid cookie " said in a radio interview . another one , who goes under the code name " dtm , " explains that he was only interested in pointing out the security lapses in online networks in the balkans .
he said it " is a lot of fun when you can publish your own opinion on a site that has a million visitors a day . " crossing borders but an exchange of opinion between the two peoples of the former yugoslavia , who within the last decade and a half were engaged in a bloody civil war , can take forms besides illegal web site changes .
popular sites such as that operated by the belgrade broadcaster " b92 " or the croatian portal " index.hr " maintain forums in which current political affairs are discussed , even beyond national borders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : veran matic , head of belgrade radio station b-92 , in 1999 on the " b92 " site , many albanians have left messages arguing for the independence of kosovo or against a division of the province which is currently under un administration .
on " index.hr " numerous serbs , montenegrins and bosnians have become engaged participants in discussions about war crimes and coming to terms with the region 's recent past . precursor for real meetings such internet forums , according to lorenz graf , a sociologist who studies the internet at the university of cologne , are an important way in which opinions are formed these days .
but they are n't without risks . " i think that these forums present ways to inform political opinions , " he said .
" but when they are too general , they do n't have a great deal of influence , because they are n't specific enough . " cross-border internet contacts between young computer users in the region also often serve as substitutes for real-time travel .
almost 10 years after the balkans war , tourists from serbia are seldom seen on the croatian coast , just as one would be hard to find a croat in belgrade .
but the brisk reporting in the region from several countries on the internet means that many there have already formed a mental picture of their neighbors . " i can well imagine that such forums can actually bring people closer together , " said graf .
" maybe the participants will say to each other one day , ' you seem nice , why do n't we meet up ' . " internet abuse but it 's not only the tolerant and open-minded who are posting in internet forums , xenophobes have also found a platform there for their own opinions , although their entries are often quickly deleted by forum moderators .
still , these kinds of forums are increasingly becoming targets of hostile attacks because the computer programs that run them are easy prey for experts . using the internet to spread hateful political messages is nothing new .
during the nato bombing campaign against serbia in spring 1999 , the central computers of the allied forces and the pentagon were attacked and anti-war messages were posted on many web sites . however , in the balkans , it is illegal to manipulate web sites belonging to other people or organizations .
xenophobic pronouncements are also against the law , even in internet forums .
but to take action , authorities have to first learn the real name and physical address of the usually anonymous poster .

27 german president host köhler on tuesday began an official four-day state visit to israel .
the highlight of his visit will a be a controversial speech before the israeli parliament on wednesday . köhler , the former head of the international monetary fund , has made a name for himself as a man who hates small talk and likes to get down to business right away .
his talks with high-ranking israeli leaders later on tuesdy will provide him with another opportunity to do just that . but for several reasons , the visit is anything but a routine job for germany 's president , said manfred lahnstein , the head of the hamburg-based german-israeli society . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we have encouraging developments in the middle east and that is a good background for the visit , " lahnstein said , adding that it marks the 40th anniversary of diplomatic relations between germany and israel .
" we have had the celebrations marking the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the auschwitz annihilation camp .
so you have our ongoing historic responsibility , the fostering and strengthening of excellent albeit not normal relations between the two countries and some political processes , which look promising . " german speech sparks protests on wednesday , köhler is due to deliver a speech on german-israeli relations before parliament , the knesset .
his plan to hold his speech in german has already provoked protests among a small number of israeli deputies who are poised to leave the hall when köhler starts his speech . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knesset in jerusalem israel ’ s minister of health dani naveh said he plans to boycott president köhler ’ s speech .
he told the right-wing israeli daily newspaper maariv that as long as holocaust survivors are still alive , german should not be spoken in israel 's parliament . his comment echoed the feelings of a number of parliamentary deputies .
the acting president of the knesset , hemi doron , said he would ask his superiors either to cancel the speech or to ask köhler to hold it in english .
doron , whose grandfather was killed in the holocaust , said his feet had never touched german soil and he never bought german products .
so he could not allow the german language to be spoken in the jewish people ’ s house of parliament . " a normal procedure " but lahnstein said köhler 's decision to speak in german was nothing unusual nor unprecendented . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former president johannes rau -lrb- right -rrb- and his israeli counterpart , moshe katzav -lrb- left -rrb- in germany in 2002 .
" that is a normal procedure that a president of a country who visits the parliament of another country and delivers a speech does so in his own tongue , " he said , adding that former german president johannes rau -lrb- photo -rrb- was the first to do so five years ago .
" on the other hand we have to understand that there are some members of the knesset , which for very personal reasons can not live with it and they will leave the hall of the knesset .
this happened five years ago as well and we have to understand it , and the rest should be dignity on both sides and it will be dignity on both sides . " some jewish public figures have spoken out in favor of köhler using his native german .
knesset speaker reuven rivlin , who was instrumental in the decision to allow the visiting president to deliver his speech in german , insisted it would be better not to extend an invitation than to demand that the guest speak in a different language .
and israel ’ s former ambassador to germany , avi primor -lrb- photo below -rrb- , also said he thinks there is no reason why köhler should not speak in german . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : avi primor " first of all , the relations between israel and germany are such that this kind of a question should n't arise at all , " he said .
" and secondly , the german language is not only the language of the nazis , but was a very important language before the nazis and is a very important language after the nazis .
it was a very important language for the jewish people . " german far-right overshadows visit but political observers in germany are also afraid that köhler ’ s trip to israel may be overshadowed by a recent scandal surrounding the far-right national party -lrb- npd -rrb- in saxony ’ s regional assembly .
npd leaders there had likened the end-of-wwii allied bombings on german towns to the holocaust , giving rise to a fresh debate about anti-semitism in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a yellow star of david that jews were forced to wear by the nazis is on display at yad vashem manfred lahnstein said the german president will have no way of dodging the issue , but is confident that the incident will not mar köhler ’ s talks with israeli leaders . during his trip , the german president will also take out time to visit the yad vashem holocaust memorial where he ’ s due to honor the six million jews murdered by the nazis . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de remembering germany 's darkest place commemorative events marking the 60th anniversary of the liberation of auschwitz continued throughout thursday as world leaders spoke of an evil that must never be allowed to surface again .

but this week the show , with its people-next-door characters , aired its 1,000th episode . many of them are n't all that sexy , hardly any are rich , and they 're usually never confronted with amnesia , alien abductions , evil twins or any of the other outlandish situations that have become part and parcel of many of the world 's serial dramas . instead , up and down lindenstrasse , the fictional street in a munich suburb where the series of the same name is set , fairly ordinary people meet the triumphs and tragedies that many experience in real life : infidelity , failing marriages , first love , parental disapproval , new careers or youth violence .
the characters are like the neighbors next door and the german public has been tuning in faithfully to find out where their on-screen lives are taking them for 20 years or 1,000 episodes . for many germans , sunday evening from 6:40 to 7:10 p.m. is " lindenstrasse " time , and woe to the person who calls or shows up unannounced at the door of a fan during that period . borrowed from the brits the show 's premise was borrowed from the bbc 's " coronation street , " britain 's longest-running television soap opera , which is set in a gritty industrial suburb of manchester .
the " lindenstrasse " crowd has less coal dust to contend with , but like their british cousins , the characters on the outskirts of munich are overwhelmingly midway or slightly lower on the socio-economic scale .
instead of super models , oil barons or jet-setting cosmetic company heads , the folks who live or work on lindenstrasse are housewives , taxi drivers , travel agents or hair stylists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lindenstrasse street sign the concerns of the beimer , kling , zenker or sarikaki families are generally the concerns of average people .
they complain about high taxes , unemployment or like to share the latest gossip about the super 's wife .
frau beimer 's husband has left her for a younger woman .
a greek family is thrown into turmoil when the oldest son wants to marry a german woman . controversial issues but lindenstrasse has not been afraid to tackle more controversial issues and has been on the forefront regarding several topics other shows have been reluctant to touch .
the daughter of one of the central families once suffered from bulimia ; another son was born with down 's syndrome . an hiv-positive woman passed on the virus to her son and a gay couple took care of the boy after his mother 's death from the disease .
lesbian storylines have been running for years and , in 1990 , the show featured the first gay kiss on german primetime tv . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actress marie-luise marjan and hans w. geißendörfer , the series producer the characters ' responses to many controversial issues have led some to complain that the creator and producer of the show , hans geissendörfer -lrb- photo -rrb- , uses the show to present his own left-of-center political opinions .
critics say other views are represented as being odd or out of touch with the times .
that , they say , is problematic since the show airs on german public broadcasting and , due to its station 's charter , has a duty to remain politically neutral . millions watch every week for the 1,000th episode , more than seven million tuned in for a special 45-minute broadcast .
while " lindenstrasse " has lost some its audience to " younger " shows with a strong teen element , such as " good times and bad " and " forbidden love , " the show still attracts on average 4.8 million viewers on sunday evenings . its current contract with west german broadcasting , which produces the show in a suburb of cologne , runs through 2008 and fans are guaranteed at least another 219 episodes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : annemarie wendl as else kling what fans wo n't be seeing much more of is likely germany 's most famous concierge , else kling , who has been a feature on the show since the beginning .
annemarie wendl , the 90-year-old actress who has played the part for 20 years , says she will step down sometime in 2005 .
but she does n't want to die peacefully in her sleep surrounded by loved ones and flowers .
" i want to be murdered , not have some boring death in bed , " she told germany 's bild am sonntag newspaper .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 01.02.2005 a mini license for german teens großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 'll still be a little too young starting tuesday , 16-year-old germans can drive so-called mini cars .
the controversial vehicles are not deemed safe by everyone but eu officials required germany to allow teens to drive them anyway . unlike their contemporaries in many other countries , german teenagers have so far had to wait until turning 18 before being able to drive a car .
that 's no longer the case as 16-year-olds can now get a driver 's license for " be up , " " albizia " or mc1 , " as some of the mini cars are called . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : minicar mc1 at first sight , the vehicles almost look like normal cars , but they only weigh around 350 kilograms -lrb- about 700 pounds -rrb- and can not go faster than 45 kilometers per hour -lrb- 28 miles per hour -rrb- . the lightweight automobiles have raised the eyebrows of car experts , who are concerned about their safety . " these cars do n't offer any active or passive security measures for the driver , " said otto saalmann of germany 's largest automobile club , adac , which has conducted a crash test with a mini car . " the drivers ' crumple zone is pretty much his own body , " saalmann added , saying that the risk of injury was extremely high and that during the test , major parts broke and the transmission was pushed inside the car .
apart from security problems with the vehicle , saalmann also said mini cars posed a risk on streets as they slow down traffic . " they can drive on countryside highways , leading to congestion , accidents and risky overtake maneuvers , " he said . eu pushes for teen license bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mini cars are also more common on japanese streets but eu competition regulations brought about the driver 's licenses for 16-year-olds .
germany did have stricter rules than other union members - only people aged 18 and over who had a regular driver 's license where allowed to drive mini cars .
few dealers sold the mainly french products and they were rarely seen on german roads . eu commissioners saw this as a competitive disadvantage for mini car makers on the german market and pressured germany 's federal government to lower the age requirement to allow teens to drive before turning 18 . mathieu grosch , a belgian eu parliamentarian , said he agreed with the commission 's assessment that german law violated competition rules . " clearly there are market tendencies where some people say that they do n't want to sell this product in favor of another , " he said .
" but that 's a form of protectionism which can not be tolerated . " german compromise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the model of a " quad " bike on a german driver 's license as a compromise , germany decided to introduce a new class of driver 's licences that can be obtained at 16 years of age .
the so-called " s " license allows teens to drive mini cars and ride " trikes " and " quads " - motor bikes with three and four wheels .
to get licensed , applicants have to pass a written and practical exam . by introducing the " s " license , germany complied with eu demands but still sets the bar much higher than its neighboring countries .
government officials said they believed the new license represented the best possible compromise between eu and national law . " the only question that 's important here is : ' what kind of license do i need to safely drive such a car ' ? " said christian weibrecht , a spokesman for the german transportation ministry .
" the question is n't whether such cars are safe or not .
it 's important to remember that these vehicles have been legal in other eu countries for years and that according to eu law , we can not prevent that they are sold and driven in germany . " experts are not waiting to see whether teenagers will actually end up applying for the " s " license and starting a boom of mini cars on german streets .
if nothing else , the costs might keep them from doing so : a license will set them back between € 800 and € 1,000 and mini cars come with an average price tag of € 10,000 . and when the young drivers are ready to switch to the real thing two years later , they will have to start from scratch again to get a " real " driver 's license . christiane wolters -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a little high 's ok on german highways cannabis might still be illegal in germany , but police officers have long ignored the occasional joint smoker .

revelations on monday named players accused of receiving cash incentives in disputed games . the corruption scandal engulfing german soccer shows no sign of dying down with the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- investigation claiming another scalp on monday . it has been revealed that the sc paderborn captain , thijs waterink , received € 10,000 -lrb- $ 13,000 -rrb- from an anonymous backer as an incentive to defeat hamburg in the german cup tie , one of the four matches shamed referee robert hoyzer has since admitted to manipulating for a € 70,000 purse " i did not know before the game that the players would be receiving this bonus , " paderborn president wilfried finke told the n24 television channel .
" a man from southern europe phoned team captain waterink and said , ' there is € 10,000 as a team bonus if you win against hamburg .
if you do not , we want the money back . " ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : referee robert hoyzer during hamburg-paderborn game paderborn won the game 4-2 after hoyzer awarded two controversial penalty kicks and sent off hamburg 's belgian international emile mpenza .
dutchman waterink split the unrecorded bonus among his victorious team-mates . he has since been suspended as part of the escalating investigation which has already seen the end of hoyzer 's career while four men were arrested last week and three have been charged with fraud in connection with the case . fears of a scandal to rival 1971 the widening scandal has ominous similarities to the one that plunged german soccer into its darkest hour 34 years ago .
match-fixing and bribes engulfed the bundesliga in 1971 when more than 50 players , a number of coaches and officials plus the clubs arminia bielefeld and kickers offenbach were found guilty of offering bribes and fixing bundesliga games , prompting the dfb to dish out hefty fines and suspensions . revelations of coercion between parties will no doubt bring the nightmares back for the dfb - and it is likely to get worse .
the news that both paderborn and hoyzer were directly involved has caused a further shock and finke claims it is highly likely that hamburg also have a role to play . hamburg players suspected of complicity " this is just the tip of the iceberg , " explained finke .
" since the referee and paderborn players are involved i would also suggest that the hamburg players are looked at too .
to ensure a bet comes off you need all three parties involved - the winners , the losers and the referee . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg sv hamburg are furious at the implication and club president bernd hoffmann admitted legal action was being considered .
" the comments are a disgrace , " raged hoffmann .
" we will speak with our lawyer about these claims and think about taking legal action .

the capital club have denied that their players were involved and the trio have pleaded their innocence . more clubs and players to be probed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dfb investigation hopes to move swiftly to close the case .
two other lower division clubs dresden and chemnitz have also been mentioned in connection with match-fixing while referee jurgen jansen is also being investigated after he was named by hoyzer . jansen was due to referee werder bremen 's match against hansa rostock on sunday but the dfb chose to remove him before kick-off .
the dfb described jansen 's removal as a " purely precautionary measure , " saying he was n't suspected of fixing matches .
jansen gave a sworn statement on monday denying any connection to the affair . meanwhile , bookmaker oddset has accused the dfb of failing to heed a tip-off they gave on august 23 of last year in regard to the hamburg-paderborn game .
oddset maintained they sent a fax to the dfb 48 hours after the cup match but dfb president gerhard mayer-vorfelder denied the bookmaker 's claim . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : a shadow over german soccer german soccer has struggled recently .

now , help is at hand thanks to the slightly macabre " phone angel . " a german inventor has come up with a novel way for relatives coping with the grief of losing a loved one to convey their feelings to the departed .
the " phone angel , " a long-life battery powered cell phone device , allows those in mourning to have contact with the deceased when personal pain , distance or disability prevents them from attending the final resting place . not to be confused with a seance or ouija board , the phone angel does n't promise to put you in touch with the spirit world but intends to provide comfort for those coming to terms with their loss by opening the airwaves .
and , although it may seem like a bizarre and slightly macabre idea , jürgen bröther from osnabrück has already sold three of the devices at € 1,500 -lrb- $ 1,953 -rrb- a piece . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " sorry , i ca n't come to the phone right now but if you 'd like to leave a message ... "
" people who are ill , have no time or live too far away to visit the deceased in their grave can now call , " said bröther in an interview with the associated press .
the inventor added that the thought came to him when his mother showed an unwillingness to attend a relative 's grave but would have liked to keep in touch with the person laid to rest there . long life battery keeps the airwaves open the device - consisting of a cell phone , a super strength battery and a small loudspeaker - comes in a waterproof container the size of an average shoe box which is placed in the earth about 30 centimeters -lrb- 11.8 inches -rrb- above the grave .
thanks to two years of collaborating with an electrician , bröther has developed a battery which will allow grieving friends and family almost a year of contact . using an application that most modern mobile phones have , automatic call response , bröther 's invention allows every caller to get through .
the phone angel clicks on and allows communication as if someone on the other end had picked up the receiver .
unlike the recipient of the call , the line is very rarely dead . once the battery has run down , the temptation would be to just cut the losses and leave the device in the ground .
but bröther has thought of that .
as a result , with the phone angel just 30 cm below the surface , it can be dug up and returned once the grieving period is over .

but much hinges on whether ante gotovina is produced to face war-crimes charges at the hague . rehn issued his starkest warning yet that the eu would postpone a march date to launch entry talks with zagreb if the retired general is not delivered to the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- . the finnish commissioner said he was " convinced that if the croatian government had the political will to locate and transfer general gotovina , it could do so . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olli rehn rehn -lrb- photo -rrb- said that based on information from un chief prosecutor carla del ponte and other " very informed sources , " croatia and gotovina have discussed a " possible voluntary surrender of general gotovina which did not materialize . " gotovina was also most probably sheltering in croatia or croatian areas of bosnia-hercegovina , " in any case within the reach of the croatian government , " he added . croatian premier surprised croatian prime minister ivo sanader voiced surprise over the threat to postpone the start of entry talks , rejecting the allegation that the government had had contacts with gotovina .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 01.02.2005 a mini license for german teens großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 'll still be a little too young starting tuesday , 16-year-old germans can drive so-called mini cars .
the controversial vehicles are not deemed safe by everyone but eu officials required germany to allow teens to drive them anyway . unlike their contemporaries in many other countries , german teenagers have so far had to wait until turning 18 before being able to drive a car .
that 's no longer the case as 16-year-olds can now get a driver 's license for " be up , " " albizia " or mc1 , " as some of the mini cars are called . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : minicar mc1 at first sight , the vehicles almost look like normal cars , but they only weigh around 350 kilograms -lrb- about 700 pounds -rrb- and can not go faster than 45 kilometers per hour -lrb- 28 miles per hour -rrb- . the lightweight automobiles have raised the eyebrows of car experts , who are concerned about their safety . " these cars do n't offer any active or passive security measures for the driver , " said otto saalmann of germany 's largest automobile club , adac , which has conducted a crash test with a mini car . " the drivers ' crumple zone is pretty much his own body , " saalmann added , saying that the risk of injury was extremely high and that during the test , major parts broke and the transmission was pushed inside the car .
apart from security problems with the vehicle , saalmann also said mini cars posed a risk on streets as they slow down traffic . " they can drive on countryside highways , leading to congestion , accidents and risky overtake maneuvers , " he said . eu pushes for teen license bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mini cars are also more common on japanese streets but eu competition regulations brought about the driver 's licenses for 16-year-olds .
germany did have stricter rules than other union members - only people aged 18 and over who had a regular driver 's license where allowed to drive mini cars .
few dealers sold the mainly french products and they were rarely seen on german roads . eu commissioners saw this as a competitive disadvantage for mini car makers on the german market and pressured germany 's federal government to lower the age requirement to allow teens to drive before turning 18 . mathieu grosch , a belgian eu parliamentarian , said he agreed with the commission 's assessment that german law violated competition rules . " clearly there are market tendencies where some people say that they do n't want to sell this product in favor of another , " he said .
" but that 's a form of protectionism which can not be tolerated . " german compromise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the model of a " quad " bike on a german driver 's license as a compromise , germany decided to introduce a new class of driver 's licences that can be obtained at 16 years of age .
the so-called " s " license allows teens to drive mini cars and ride " trikes " and " quads " - motor bikes with three and four wheels .
to get licensed , applicants have to pass a written and practical exam . by introducing the " s " license , germany complied with eu demands but still sets the bar much higher than its neighboring countries .
government officials said they believed the new license represented the best possible compromise between eu and national law . " the only question that 's important here is : ' what kind of license do i need to safely drive such a car ' ? " said christian weibrecht , a spokesman for the german transportation ministry .

if nothing else , the costs might keep them from doing so : a license will set them back between € 800 and € 1,000 and mini cars come with an average price tag of € 10,000 . and when the young drivers are ready to switch to the real thing two years later , they will have to start from scratch again to get a " real " driver 's license . christiane wolters -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a little high 's ok on german highways cannabis might still be illegal in germany , but police officers have long ignored the occasional joint smoker .

27 german president host köhler on tuesday began an official four-day state visit to israel .
the highlight of his visit will a be a controversial speech before the israeli parliament on wednesday . köhler , the former head of the international monetary fund , has made a name for himself as a man who hates small talk and likes to get down to business right away .
his talks with high-ranking israeli leaders later on tuesdy will provide him with another opportunity to do just that . but for several reasons , the visit is anything but a routine job for germany 's president , said manfred lahnstein , the head of the hamburg-based german-israeli society . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we have encouraging developments in the middle east and that is a good background for the visit , " lahnstein said , adding that it marks the 40th anniversary of diplomatic relations between germany and israel .
" we have had the celebrations marking the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the auschwitz annihilation camp .
so you have our ongoing historic responsibility , the fostering and strengthening of excellent albeit not normal relations between the two countries and some political processes , which look promising . " german speech sparks protests on wednesday , köhler is due to deliver a speech on german-israeli relations before parliament , the knesset .
his plan to hold his speech in german has already provoked protests among a small number of israeli deputies who are poised to leave the hall when köhler starts his speech . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knesset in jerusalem israel ’ s minister of health dani naveh said he plans to boycott president köhler ’ s speech .
he told the right-wing israeli daily newspaper maariv that as long as holocaust survivors are still alive , german should not be spoken in israel 's parliament . his comment echoed the feelings of a number of parliamentary deputies .
the acting president of the knesset , hemi doron , said he would ask his superiors either to cancel the speech or to ask köhler to hold it in english .
doron , whose grandfather was killed in the holocaust , said his feet had never touched german soil and he never bought german products .
so he could not allow the german language to be spoken in the jewish people ’ s house of parliament . " a normal procedure " but lahnstein said köhler 's decision to speak in german was nothing unusual nor unprecendented . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former president johannes rau -lrb- right -rrb- and his israeli counterpart , moshe katzav -lrb- left -rrb- in germany in 2002 .
" that is a normal procedure that a president of a country who visits the parliament of another country and delivers a speech does so in his own tongue , " he said , adding that former german president johannes rau -lrb- photo -rrb- was the first to do so five years ago .
" on the other hand we have to understand that there are some members of the knesset , which for very personal reasons can not live with it and they will leave the hall of the knesset .
this happened five years ago as well and we have to understand it , and the rest should be dignity on both sides and it will be dignity on both sides . " some jewish public figures have spoken out in favor of köhler using his native german .
knesset speaker reuven rivlin , who was instrumental in the decision to allow the visiting president to deliver his speech in german , insisted it would be better not to extend an invitation than to demand that the guest speak in a different language .
and israel ’ s former ambassador to germany , avi primor -lrb- photo below -rrb- , also said he thinks there is no reason why köhler should not speak in german . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : avi primor " first of all , the relations between israel and germany are such that this kind of a question should n't arise at all , " he said .
" and secondly , the german language is not only the language of the nazis , but was a very important language before the nazis and is a very important language after the nazis .
it was a very important language for the jewish people . " german far-right overshadows visit but political observers in germany are also afraid that köhler ’ s trip to israel may be overshadowed by a recent scandal surrounding the far-right national party -lrb- npd -rrb- in saxony ’ s regional assembly .
npd leaders there had likened the end-of-wwii allied bombings on german towns to the holocaust , giving rise to a fresh debate about anti-semitism in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a yellow star of david that jews were forced to wear by the nazis is on display at yad vashem manfred lahnstein said the german president will have no way of dodging the issue , but is confident that the incident will not mar köhler ’ s talks with israeli leaders . during his trip , the german president will also take out time to visit the yad vashem holocaust memorial where he ’ s due to honor the six million jews murdered by the nazis . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de remembering germany 's darkest place commemorative events marking the 60th anniversary of the liberation of auschwitz continued throughout thursday as world leaders spoke of an evil that must never be allowed to surface again .

the controversial vehicles are not deemed safe by everyone but eu officials required germany to allow teens to drive them anyway . unlike their contemporaries in many other countries , german teenagers have so far had to wait until turning 18 before being able to drive a car .
that 's no longer the case as 16-year-olds can now get a driver 's license for " be up , " " albizia " or mc1 , " as some of the mini cars are called . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : minicar mc1 at first sight , the vehicles almost look like normal cars , but they only weigh around 350 kilograms -lrb- about 700 pounds -rrb- and can not go faster than 45 kilometers per hour -lrb- 28 miles per hour -rrb- . the lightweight automobiles have raised the eyebrows of car experts , who are concerned about their safety . " these cars do n't offer any active or passive security measures for the driver , " said otto saalmann of germany 's largest automobile club , adac , which has conducted a crash test with a mini car . " the drivers ' crumple zone is pretty much his own body , " saalmann added , saying that the risk of injury was extremely high and that during the test , major parts broke and the transmission was pushed inside the car .
apart from security problems with the vehicle , saalmann also said mini cars posed a risk on streets as they slow down traffic . " they can drive on countryside highways , leading to congestion , accidents and risky overtake maneuvers , " he said . eu pushes for teen license bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mini cars are also more common on japanese streets but eu competition regulations brought about the driver 's licenses for 16-year-olds .
germany did have stricter rules than other union members - only people aged 18 and over who had a regular driver 's license where allowed to drive mini cars .
few dealers sold the mainly french products and they were rarely seen on german roads . eu commissioners saw this as a competitive disadvantage for mini car makers on the german market and pressured germany 's federal government to lower the age requirement to allow teens to drive before turning 18 . mathieu grosch , a belgian eu parliamentarian , said he agreed with the commission 's assessment that german law violated competition rules . " clearly there are market tendencies where some people say that they do n't want to sell this product in favor of another , " he said .
" but that 's a form of protectionism which can not be tolerated . " german compromise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the model of a " quad " bike on a german driver 's license as a compromise , germany decided to introduce a new class of driver 's licences that can be obtained at 16 years of age .

while more than 61 percent of americans expressed a desire to run their own show , the same percentage of germans said they were put off the idea because of a fear of failure .
yet , there is undoubtedly more to the picture than that , and given the current blot which unemployment is smudging over germany 's social and economic landscape , embracing the lesser known devil and striking out alone could be the answer to some people 's problems .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting innovation taken seriously is a painstaking process heino hanisch , a berlin-based inventor and jack of many trades , has been out of work for several years .
his continued attempts to get a foot back onto the employment ladder have been repeatedly thwarted by his age - he 's in his mid-40 's - and long-term jobless status .
he is realistic rather than pessimistic when he says he may never again be gainfully employed .
" i see self-employment as the only way forward , but that 's not easy either , because you encounter so many hurdles , financial and otherwise , to get there , " hanisch said .
a question of cash for german inventors , the problem with getting out there and turning their innovative dreams into reality is intrinsically linked to a lack of funding .
" as an inventor , you need more than just an idea .
you need money to register the patent , ideally also money to employ a patent lawyer .
you have to create a prototype which can be shown at exhibitions or trade fairs , and then , most importantly , you need money for advertising , " inventor and engineer peter stepina said .
essentially it all boils down to cash .
and germany 's banks are not champing at the bit to hurl their money at independent creative minds .

" it 's a case of the cat biting itself in the tail , " hanisch lamented .
but one new initiative set up by the chamber for trade and industry -lrb- ihk -rrb- in the german city of duisburg is blowing some fresh wind into the stagnant world of independent invention .
a new " idea " the project , aptly entitled " idea " is an original attempt to help inventors towards their ultimate goal of turning their models into money .
a pool of some 80 experts from all fields and walks of life work on a voluntary basis to assess the viability of designs and ideas submitted to them from the innovator on the street .
" the problem at the moment is that there is no financial backing available for individuals .
if an inventor wants to access funding , the only way to go about it is to team up with a company .
even the government initiative for patent funding is out of bounds to the individual , " ihk innovations consultant rolf berenz said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new invention for pasta on the go berenz hopes the project will establish a network of people who work together to promote innovation within germany - not only technological innovation but also in the realms of service and management .
he calls it a one-stop shop in which clever ideas are analyzed , assessed and , where appropriate , the inventor gets feedback from a panel of experts .
what about " me incorporated ? "
it 's certainly a step in the right direction and a more structured move to support an often marginalized profession .
at the moment , the only other possibility inventors have at securing external support is through a government-funded program called " me incorporated , " which is designed to encourage the unemployed to start their own businesses .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dog-walking machine has n't yet taken off but getting into the program requires more than a brilliant idea .
" candidates have to get their ideas analyzed by an expert to assess the likelihood of success , " ellen queisser , spokeswoman for the labor office in berlin said .
it 's a vicious circle for the likes of heino hanisch , who believes it takes imagination to see just how a new product might succeed .
" the experts who are supposed to check for viability are long-term employees who have no idea about being self-employed and no idea about what will or will not work . "

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new invention for pasta on the go berenz hopes the project will establish a network of people who work together to promote innovation within germany - not only technological innovation but also in the realms of service and management .
he calls it a one-stop shop in which clever ideas are analyzed , assessed and , where appropriate , the inventor gets feedback from a panel of experts .
what about " me incorporated ? "
it 's certainly a step in the right direction and a more structured move to support an often marginalized profession .
at the moment , the only other possibility inventors have at securing external support is through a government-funded program called " me incorporated , " which is designed to encourage the unemployed to start their own businesses .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dog-walking machine has n't yet taken off but getting into the program requires more than a brilliant idea .
" candidates have to get their ideas analyzed by an expert to assess the likelihood of success , " ellen queisser , spokeswoman for the labor office in berlin said .
it 's a vicious circle for the likes of heino hanisch , who believes it takes imagination to see just how a new product might succeed .
" the experts who are supposed to check for viability are long-term employees who have no idea about being self-employed and no idea about what will or will not work . "
whether that is true or not , it remains a fact that german inventors are out there and feeling frustrated about being prevented from adding some dynamism to the entrepreneurial face of the nation . tamsin walker , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de protecting patents at a snail 's pace in the age of globalization , international patents are needed to protect intellectual property .

but much hinges on whether ante gotovina is produced to face war-crimes charges at the hague . rehn issued his starkest warning yet that the eu would postpone a march date to launch entry talks with zagreb if the retired general is not delivered to the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- . the finnish commissioner said he was " convinced that if the croatian government had the political will to locate and transfer general gotovina , it could do so . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olli rehn rehn -lrb- photo -rrb- said that based on information from un chief prosecutor carla del ponte and other " very informed sources , " croatia and gotovina have discussed a " possible voluntary surrender of general gotovina which did not materialize . " gotovina was also most probably sheltering in croatia or croatian areas of bosnia-hercegovina , " in any case within the reach of the croatian government , " he added . croatian premier surprised croatian prime minister ivo sanader voiced surprise over the threat to postpone the start of entry talks , rejecting the allegation that the government had had contacts with gotovina . " i am not worried but surprised , " sanader told croatian national radio speaking from luxembourg .
" croatia is fully cooperating with the un war crimes tribunal at the hague . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ivo sanader information that the government had held talks with gotovina was " not true , " said the prime minister -lrb- photo -rrb- , adding he was confident accession talks would begin as scheduled on march 17 . gotovina 's lawyer luka misetic said earlier this month that his client would surrender if his case was transferred to a croatian court , a deal immediately dismissed by un prosecutors and by zagreb . eu ready to postpone talks releasing the eu executive 's proposed plan of accession negotiations with croatia , rehn said that zagreb would not today be considered as deserving of eu talks . " if the commission were to give its recommendation on the basis of today 's information , i could not recommend opening negotiations with croatia , " he told a news conference .
" if there is no progress from the croatian side -lrb- on gotovina -rrb- , we are ready to postpone the start of talks . " at a december summit , eu leaders said the bloc would start accession talks with croatia on march 17 - provided it cooperates fully with the icty . that means finding and handing over gotovina , who went into hiding in 2001 when the un court charged him with war crimes against ethnic serbs at the end of croatia 's 1991-95 war of independence from the former yugoslavia . luxembourg foreign minister jean asselborn of the eu 's current presidency said the bloc 's decision on whether to proceed with talks from march 17 would depend in large part on the icty 's appraisal . " every step must go perfectly " confirming the receipt of a letter " from an individual claiming to be mr gotovina 's lawyer , " he said the issue of croatia would be discussed when us secretary of state condoleezza rice visits luxembourg on feb .
9 and 10 . " if tomorrow mr gotovina turns up in the hague , that 's that and we can start earlier , " asselborn said after a meeting of eu foreign ministers .
" but until that happens , march 17 is a buffer date for the start of the negotiations with croatia . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cathedral square in croatia 's capital , zagreb like any other eu candidate , croatia will have to strive hard to transpose the 80,000 pages of eu legislation and standards known as the " acquis communautaire .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 01.02.2005 a mini license for german teens großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 'll still be a little too young starting tuesday , 16-year-old germans can drive so-called mini cars .
the controversial vehicles are not deemed safe by everyone but eu officials required germany to allow teens to drive them anyway . unlike their contemporaries in many other countries , german teenagers have so far had to wait until turning 18 before being able to drive a car .
that 's no longer the case as 16-year-olds can now get a driver 's license for " be up , " " albizia " or mc1 , " as some of the mini cars are called . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : minicar mc1 at first sight , the vehicles almost look like normal cars , but they only weigh around 350 kilograms -lrb- about 700 pounds -rrb- and can not go faster than 45 kilometers per hour -lrb- 28 miles per hour -rrb- . the lightweight automobiles have raised the eyebrows of car experts , who are concerned about their safety . " these cars do n't offer any active or passive security measures for the driver , " said otto saalmann of germany 's largest automobile club , adac , which has conducted a crash test with a mini car . " the drivers ' crumple zone is pretty much his own body , " saalmann added , saying that the risk of injury was extremely high and that during the test , major parts broke and the transmission was pushed inside the car .
apart from security problems with the vehicle , saalmann also said mini cars posed a risk on streets as they slow down traffic . " they can drive on countryside highways , leading to congestion , accidents and risky overtake maneuvers , " he said . eu pushes for teen license bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mini cars are also more common on japanese streets but eu competition regulations brought about the driver 's licenses for 16-year-olds .
germany did have stricter rules than other union members - only people aged 18 and over who had a regular driver 's license where allowed to drive mini cars .
few dealers sold the mainly french products and they were rarely seen on german roads . eu commissioners saw this as a competitive disadvantage for mini car makers on the german market and pressured germany 's federal government to lower the age requirement to allow teens to drive before turning 18 . mathieu grosch , a belgian eu parliamentarian , said he agreed with the commission 's assessment that german law violated competition rules . " clearly there are market tendencies where some people say that they do n't want to sell this product in favor of another , " he said .
" but that 's a form of protectionism which can not be tolerated . " german compromise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the model of a " quad " bike on a german driver 's license as a compromise , germany decided to introduce a new class of driver 's licences that can be obtained at 16 years of age .
the so-called " s " license allows teens to drive mini cars and ride " trikes " and " quads " - motor bikes with three and four wheels .
to get licensed , applicants have to pass a written and practical exam . by introducing the " s " license , germany complied with eu demands but still sets the bar much higher than its neighboring countries .
government officials said they believed the new license represented the best possible compromise between eu and national law . " the only question that 's important here is : ' what kind of license do i need to safely drive such a car ' ? " said christian weibrecht , a spokesman for the german transportation ministry .
" the question is n't whether such cars are safe or not .
it 's important to remember that these vehicles have been legal in other eu countries for years and that according to eu law , we can not prevent that they are sold and driven in germany . " experts are not waiting to see whether teenagers will actually end up applying for the " s " license and starting a boom of mini cars on german streets .
if nothing else , the costs might keep them from doing so : a license will set them back between € 800 and € 1,000 and mini cars come with an average price tag of € 10,000 . and when the young drivers are ready to switch to the real thing two years later , they will have to start from scratch again to get a " real " driver 's license . christiane wolters -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a little high 's ok on german highways cannabis might still be illegal in germany , but police officers have long ignored the occasional joint smoker .

croats , serbs and albanians are hacking into each others ' web sites and leaving nationalistic slogans .
on online forums , bitter political debates have been ignited . in december , albanian internet enthusiasts hacked into the kosovo-based site of the serbian orthodox church .
instead of the usual pictures of the monastery found there , the words " kosovo will gain its independence " popped up on web browsers . in response , serb hackers attacked the online offering of the albanian capital tirana and posted a stream of curses on the page .
over the past four weeks , some 100 web sites from serbia as well as about a dozen albanian ones were illegally altered . virtual attacks the trigger for these virtual attacks between serbs and croats in the second part of december was an incident in which a nationally minded serb basketball player was refused entry to croatia .
croatian hackers let their dissatisfaction over the athlete 's political stance be widely known by launching a virtual attack on the homepage of serbia 's largest private broadcaster , " pink . "
the hackers posted the words " greetings to greater serbia " on the site , accompanied by the croatian flag and emblem . that did n't please serbian hackers and they in turn gained access to the official site of the croatian world ski champion janica kostelic , leaving their own message of " greetings to croatia " behind , along with photographs of the serbian national team .
in the following two weeks , more than 80 croatian and serbian web sites were manipulated , with each side posting more and less explicit nationalistic slogans on " enemy " sites . why and to what end ? the offenders from both countries told media outlets that there were n't any nationalistic motives behind their actions , but that they simply wanted to draw attention to their hacking abilities .
" it does n't matter to me whether i hack into a serbian , croatian , albanian or whatever kind of site , " one notorious serbian hacker who calls himself " acid cookie " said in a radio interview . another one , who goes under the code name " dtm , " explains that he was only interested in pointing out the security lapses in online networks in the balkans .
he said it " is a lot of fun when you can publish your own opinion on a site that has a million visitors a day . " crossing borders but an exchange of opinion between the two peoples of the former yugoslavia , who within the last decade and a half were engaged in a bloody civil war , can take forms besides illegal web site changes .
popular sites such as that operated by the belgrade broadcaster " b92 " or the croatian portal " index.hr " maintain forums in which current political affairs are discussed , even beyond national borders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : veran matic , head of belgrade radio station b-92 , in 1999 on the " b92 " site , many albanians have left messages arguing for the independence of kosovo or against a division of the province which is currently under un administration .
on " index.hr " numerous serbs , montenegrins and bosnians have become engaged participants in discussions about war crimes and coming to terms with the region 's recent past . precursor for real meetings such internet forums , according to lorenz graf , a sociologist who studies the internet at the university of cologne , are an important way in which opinions are formed these days .
but they are n't without risks . " i think that these forums present ways to inform political opinions , " he said .
" but when they are too general , they do n't have a great deal of influence , because they are n't specific enough . " cross-border internet contacts between young computer users in the region also often serve as substitutes for real-time travel .
almost 10 years after the balkans war , tourists from serbia are seldom seen on the croatian coast , just as one would be hard to find a croat in belgrade .
but the brisk reporting in the region from several countries on the internet means that many there have already formed a mental picture of their neighbors . " i can well imagine that such forums can actually bring people closer together , " said graf .
" maybe the participants will say to each other one day , ' you seem nice , why do n't we meet up ' . " internet abuse but it 's not only the tolerant and open-minded who are posting in internet forums , xenophobes have also found a platform there for their own opinions , although their entries are often quickly deleted by forum moderators .

croats , serbs and albanians are hacking into each others ' web sites and leaving nationalistic slogans .
on online forums , bitter political debates have been ignited . in december , albanian internet enthusiasts hacked into the kosovo-based site of the serbian orthodox church .
instead of the usual pictures of the monastery found there , the words " kosovo will gain its independence " popped up on web browsers . in response , serb hackers attacked the online offering of the albanian capital tirana and posted a stream of curses on the page .
over the past four weeks , some 100 web sites from serbia as well as about a dozen albanian ones were illegally altered . virtual attacks the trigger for these virtual attacks between serbs and croats in the second part of december was an incident in which a nationally minded serb basketball player was refused entry to croatia .
croatian hackers let their dissatisfaction over the athlete 's political stance be widely known by launching a virtual attack on the homepage of serbia 's largest private broadcaster , " pink . "
the hackers posted the words " greetings to greater serbia " on the site , accompanied by the croatian flag and emblem . that did n't please serbian hackers and they in turn gained access to the official site of the croatian world ski champion janica kostelic , leaving their own message of " greetings to croatia " behind , along with photographs of the serbian national team .
in the following two weeks , more than 80 croatian and serbian web sites were manipulated , with each side posting more and less explicit nationalistic slogans on " enemy " sites . why and to what end ? the offenders from both countries told media outlets that there were n't any nationalistic motives behind their actions , but that they simply wanted to draw attention to their hacking abilities .
" it does n't matter to me whether i hack into a serbian , croatian , albanian or whatever kind of site , " one notorious serbian hacker who calls himself " acid cookie " said in a radio interview . another one , who goes under the code name " dtm , " explains that he was only interested in pointing out the security lapses in online networks in the balkans .
he said it " is a lot of fun when you can publish your own opinion on a site that has a million visitors a day . " crossing borders but an exchange of opinion between the two peoples of the former yugoslavia , who within the last decade and a half were engaged in a bloody civil war , can take forms besides illegal web site changes .
popular sites such as that operated by the belgrade broadcaster " b92 " or the croatian portal " index.hr " maintain forums in which current political affairs are discussed , even beyond national borders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : veran matic , head of belgrade radio station b-92 , in 1999 on the " b92 " site , many albanians have left messages arguing for the independence of kosovo or against a division of the province which is currently under un administration .
on " index.hr " numerous serbs , montenegrins and bosnians have become engaged participants in discussions about war crimes and coming to terms with the region 's recent past . precursor for real meetings such internet forums , according to lorenz graf , a sociologist who studies the internet at the university of cologne , are an important way in which opinions are formed these days .
but they are n't without risks . " i think that these forums present ways to inform political opinions , " he said .
" but when they are too general , they do n't have a great deal of influence , because they are n't specific enough . " cross-border internet contacts between young computer users in the region also often serve as substitutes for real-time travel .
almost 10 years after the balkans war , tourists from serbia are seldom seen on the croatian coast , just as one would be hard to find a croat in belgrade .
but the brisk reporting in the region from several countries on the internet means that many there have already formed a mental picture of their neighbors . " i can well imagine that such forums can actually bring people closer together , " said graf .
" maybe the participants will say to each other one day , ' you seem nice , why do n't we meet up ' . " internet abuse but it 's not only the tolerant and open-minded who are posting in internet forums , xenophobes have also found a platform there for their own opinions , although their entries are often quickly deleted by forum moderators .

the characters are like the neighbors next door and the german public has been tuning in faithfully to find out where their on-screen lives are taking them for 20 years or 1,000 episodes . for many germans , sunday evening from 6:40 to 7:10 p.m. is " lindenstrasse " time , and woe to the person who calls or shows up unannounced at the door of a fan during that period . borrowed from the brits the show 's premise was borrowed from the bbc 's " coronation street , " britain 's longest-running television soap opera , which is set in a gritty industrial suburb of manchester .
the " lindenstrasse " crowd has less coal dust to contend with , but like their british cousins , the characters on the outskirts of munich are overwhelmingly midway or slightly lower on the socio-economic scale .

while " lindenstrasse " has lost some its audience to " younger " shows with a strong teen element , such as " good times and bad " and " forbidden love , " the show still attracts on average 4.8 million viewers on sunday evenings . its current contract with west german broadcasting , which produces the show in a suburb of cologne , runs through 2008 and fans are guaranteed at least another 219 episodes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : annemarie wendl as else kling what fans wo n't be seeing much more of is likely germany 's most famous concierge , else kling , who has been a feature on the show since the beginning .

croats , serbs and albanians are hacking into each others ' web sites and leaving nationalistic slogans .
on online forums , bitter political debates have been ignited . in december , albanian internet enthusiasts hacked into the kosovo-based site of the serbian orthodox church .
instead of the usual pictures of the monastery found there , the words " kosovo will gain its independence " popped up on web browsers . in response , serb hackers attacked the online offering of the albanian capital tirana and posted a stream of curses on the page .
over the past four weeks , some 100 web sites from serbia as well as about a dozen albanian ones were illegally altered . virtual attacks the trigger for these virtual attacks between serbs and croats in the second part of december was an incident in which a nationally minded serb basketball player was refused entry to croatia .
croatian hackers let their dissatisfaction over the athlete 's political stance be widely known by launching a virtual attack on the homepage of serbia 's largest private broadcaster , " pink . "
the hackers posted the words " greetings to greater serbia " on the site , accompanied by the croatian flag and emblem . that did n't please serbian hackers and they in turn gained access to the official site of the croatian world ski champion janica kostelic , leaving their own message of " greetings to croatia " behind , along with photographs of the serbian national team .
in the following two weeks , more than 80 croatian and serbian web sites were manipulated , with each side posting more and less explicit nationalistic slogans on " enemy " sites . why and to what end ? the offenders from both countries told media outlets that there were n't any nationalistic motives behind their actions , but that they simply wanted to draw attention to their hacking abilities .
" it does n't matter to me whether i hack into a serbian , croatian , albanian or whatever kind of site , " one notorious serbian hacker who calls himself " acid cookie " said in a radio interview . another one , who goes under the code name " dtm , " explains that he was only interested in pointing out the security lapses in online networks in the balkans .
he said it " is a lot of fun when you can publish your own opinion on a site that has a million visitors a day . " crossing borders but an exchange of opinion between the two peoples of the former yugoslavia , who within the last decade and a half were engaged in a bloody civil war , can take forms besides illegal web site changes .
popular sites such as that operated by the belgrade broadcaster " b92 " or the croatian portal " index.hr " maintain forums in which current political affairs are discussed , even beyond national borders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : veran matic , head of belgrade radio station b-92 , in 1999 on the " b92 " site , many albanians have left messages arguing for the independence of kosovo or against a division of the province which is currently under un administration .
on " index.hr " numerous serbs , montenegrins and bosnians have become engaged participants in discussions about war crimes and coming to terms with the region 's recent past . precursor for real meetings such internet forums , according to lorenz graf , a sociologist who studies the internet at the university of cologne , are an important way in which opinions are formed these days .
but they are n't without risks . " i think that these forums present ways to inform political opinions , " he said .
" but when they are too general , they do n't have a great deal of influence , because they are n't specific enough . " cross-border internet contacts between young computer users in the region also often serve as substitutes for real-time travel .
almost 10 years after the balkans war , tourists from serbia are seldom seen on the croatian coast , just as one would be hard to find a croat in belgrade .
but the brisk reporting in the region from several countries on the internet means that many there have already formed a mental picture of their neighbors . " i can well imagine that such forums can actually bring people closer together , " said graf .
" maybe the participants will say to each other one day , ' you seem nice , why do n't we meet up ' . " internet abuse but it 's not only the tolerant and open-minded who are posting in internet forums , xenophobes have also found a platform there for their own opinions , although their entries are often quickly deleted by forum moderators .
still , these kinds of forums are increasingly becoming targets of hostile attacks because the computer programs that run them are easy prey for experts . using the internet to spread hateful political messages is nothing new .
during the nato bombing campaign against serbia in spring 1999 , the central computers of the allied forces and the pentagon were attacked and anti-war messages were posted on many web sites . however , in the balkans , it is illegal to manipulate web sites belonging to other people or organizations .
xenophobic pronouncements are also against the law , even in internet forums .
but to take action , authorities have to first learn the real name and physical address of the usually anonymous poster .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 01.02.2005 reinventing german innovation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an originial idea is hardly enough to power innovation in germany a recent study into the " to be or not to be " of self-employment revealed a national reluctance among germans to go it alone .
but inventors are crying out for a chance to give the country a cutting-edge status . the study , conducted in the eu and the us over a period of five years , was conclusive proof that entrepreneurial spirit does not run through the veins of german society the same way as the desire for steady and secure work .
while more than 61 percent of americans expressed a desire to run their own show , the same percentage of germans said they were put off the idea because of a fear of failure .
yet , there is undoubtedly more to the picture than that , and given the current blot which unemployment is smudging over germany 's social and economic landscape , embracing the lesser known devil and striking out alone could be the answer to some people 's problems .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting innovation taken seriously is a painstaking process heino hanisch , a berlin-based inventor and jack of many trades , has been out of work for several years .
his continued attempts to get a foot back onto the employment ladder have been repeatedly thwarted by his age - he 's in his mid-40 's - and long-term jobless status .
he is realistic rather than pessimistic when he says he may never again be gainfully employed .
" i see self-employment as the only way forward , but that 's not easy either , because you encounter so many hurdles , financial and otherwise , to get there , " hanisch said .
a question of cash for german inventors , the problem with getting out there and turning their innovative dreams into reality is intrinsically linked to a lack of funding .
" as an inventor , you need more than just an idea .
you need money to register the patent , ideally also money to employ a patent lawyer .
you have to create a prototype which can be shown at exhibitions or trade fairs , and then , most importantly , you need money for advertising , " inventor and engineer peter stepina said .
essentially it all boils down to cash .
and germany 's banks are not champing at the bit to hurl their money at independent creative minds .
" there 's no point in even applying for support from the bank unless you have a lot of your own capital , " hanisch added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : banks keep inventors at arms ' length since very few do , many potentially lucrative inventions are stopped in their tracks .
" of course it makes a difference to us if an inventor is prepared to invest his own money into his idea , but we also want to see a thorough business plan and be sure that the inventor has done his market analysis , " christian hotz , a spokesman for deutsche bank said .
again , that 's a process which the average inventor can not afford .
" it 's a case of the cat biting itself in the tail , " hanisch lamented .
but one new initiative set up by the chamber for trade and industry -lrb- ihk -rrb- in the german city of duisburg is blowing some fresh wind into the stagnant world of independent invention .
a new " idea " the project , aptly entitled " idea " is an original attempt to help inventors towards their ultimate goal of turning their models into money .
a pool of some 80 experts from all fields and walks of life work on a voluntary basis to assess the viability of designs and ideas submitted to them from the innovator on the street .
" the problem at the moment is that there is no financial backing available for individuals .
if an inventor wants to access funding , the only way to go about it is to team up with a company .
even the government initiative for patent funding is out of bounds to the individual , " ihk innovations consultant rolf berenz said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new invention for pasta on the go berenz hopes the project will establish a network of people who work together to promote innovation within germany - not only technological innovation but also in the realms of service and management .
he calls it a one-stop shop in which clever ideas are analyzed , assessed and , where appropriate , the inventor gets feedback from a panel of experts .

on " index.hr " numerous serbs , montenegrins and bosnians have become engaged participants in discussions about war crimes and coming to terms with the region 's recent past . precursor for real meetings such internet forums , according to lorenz graf , a sociologist who studies the internet at the university of cologne , are an important way in which opinions are formed these days .
but they are n't without risks . " i think that these forums present ways to inform political opinions , " he said .
" but when they are too general , they do n't have a great deal of influence , because they are n't specific enough . " cross-border internet contacts between young computer users in the region also often serve as substitutes for real-time travel .
almost 10 years after the balkans war , tourists from serbia are seldom seen on the croatian coast , just as one would be hard to find a croat in belgrade .
but the brisk reporting in the region from several countries on the internet means that many there have already formed a mental picture of their neighbors . " i can well imagine that such forums can actually bring people closer together , " said graf .
" maybe the participants will say to each other one day , ' you seem nice , why do n't we meet up ' . " internet abuse but it 's not only the tolerant and open-minded who are posting in internet forums , xenophobes have also found a platform there for their own opinions , although their entries are often quickly deleted by forum moderators .
still , these kinds of forums are increasingly becoming targets of hostile attacks because the computer programs that run them are easy prey for experts . using the internet to spread hateful political messages is nothing new .
during the nato bombing campaign against serbia in spring 1999 , the central computers of the allied forces and the pentagon were attacked and anti-war messages were posted on many web sites . however , in the balkans , it is illegal to manipulate web sites belonging to other people or organizations .
xenophobic pronouncements are also against the law , even in internet forums .
but to take action , authorities have to first learn the real name and physical address of the usually anonymous poster .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 01.02.2005 reinventing german innovation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an originial idea is hardly enough to power innovation in germany a recent study into the " to be or not to be " of self-employment revealed a national reluctance among germans to go it alone .
but inventors are crying out for a chance to give the country a cutting-edge status . the study , conducted in the eu and the us over a period of five years , was conclusive proof that entrepreneurial spirit does not run through the veins of german society the same way as the desire for steady and secure work .
while more than 61 percent of americans expressed a desire to run their own show , the same percentage of germans said they were put off the idea because of a fear of failure .
yet , there is undoubtedly more to the picture than that , and given the current blot which unemployment is smudging over germany 's social and economic landscape , embracing the lesser known devil and striking out alone could be the answer to some people 's problems .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting innovation taken seriously is a painstaking process heino hanisch , a berlin-based inventor and jack of many trades , has been out of work for several years .
his continued attempts to get a foot back onto the employment ladder have been repeatedly thwarted by his age - he 's in his mid-40 's - and long-term jobless status .
he is realistic rather than pessimistic when he says he may never again be gainfully employed .
" i see self-employment as the only way forward , but that 's not easy either , because you encounter so many hurdles , financial and otherwise , to get there , " hanisch said .
a question of cash for german inventors , the problem with getting out there and turning their innovative dreams into reality is intrinsically linked to a lack of funding .
" as an inventor , you need more than just an idea .
you need money to register the patent , ideally also money to employ a patent lawyer .
you have to create a prototype which can be shown at exhibitions or trade fairs , and then , most importantly , you need money for advertising , " inventor and engineer peter stepina said .
essentially it all boils down to cash .
and germany 's banks are not champing at the bit to hurl their money at independent creative minds .
" there 's no point in even applying for support from the bank unless you have a lot of your own capital , " hanisch added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : banks keep inventors at arms ' length since very few do , many potentially lucrative inventions are stopped in their tracks .
" of course it makes a difference to us if an inventor is prepared to invest his own money into his idea , but we also want to see a thorough business plan and be sure that the inventor has done his market analysis , " christian hotz , a spokesman for deutsche bank said .
again , that 's a process which the average inventor can not afford .
" it 's a case of the cat biting itself in the tail , " hanisch lamented .
but one new initiative set up by the chamber for trade and industry -lrb- ihk -rrb- in the german city of duisburg is blowing some fresh wind into the stagnant world of independent invention .
a new " idea " the project , aptly entitled " idea " is an original attempt to help inventors towards their ultimate goal of turning their models into money .
a pool of some 80 experts from all fields and walks of life work on a voluntary basis to assess the viability of designs and ideas submitted to them from the innovator on the street .
" the problem at the moment is that there is no financial backing available for individuals .
if an inventor wants to access funding , the only way to go about it is to team up with a company .
even the government initiative for patent funding is out of bounds to the individual , " ihk innovations consultant rolf berenz said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new invention for pasta on the go berenz hopes the project will establish a network of people who work together to promote innovation within germany - not only technological innovation but also in the realms of service and management .
he calls it a one-stop shop in which clever ideas are analyzed , assessed and , where appropriate , the inventor gets feedback from a panel of experts .
what about " me incorporated ? "
it 's certainly a step in the right direction and a more structured move to support an often marginalized profession .
at the moment , the only other possibility inventors have at securing external support is through a government-funded program called " me incorporated , " which is designed to encourage the unemployed to start their own businesses .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dog-walking machine has n't yet taken off but getting into the program requires more than a brilliant idea .
" candidates have to get their ideas analyzed by an expert to assess the likelihood of success , " ellen queisser , spokeswoman for the labor office in berlin said .
it 's a vicious circle for the likes of heino hanisch , who believes it takes imagination to see just how a new product might succeed .
" the experts who are supposed to check for viability are long-term employees who have no idea about being self-employed and no idea about what will or will not work . "
whether that is true or not , it remains a fact that german inventors are out there and feeling frustrated about being prevented from adding some dynamism to the entrepreneurial face of the nation . tamsin walker , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de protecting patents at a snail 's pace in the age of globalization , international patents are needed to protect intellectual property .

but inventors are crying out for a chance to give the country a cutting-edge status . the study , conducted in the eu and the us over a period of five years , was conclusive proof that entrepreneurial spirit does not run through the veins of german society the same way as the desire for steady and secure work .
while more than 61 percent of americans expressed a desire to run their own show , the same percentage of germans said they were put off the idea because of a fear of failure .
yet , there is undoubtedly more to the picture than that , and given the current blot which unemployment is smudging over germany 's social and economic landscape , embracing the lesser known devil and striking out alone could be the answer to some people 's problems .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting innovation taken seriously is a painstaking process heino hanisch , a berlin-based inventor and jack of many trades , has been out of work for several years .
his continued attempts to get a foot back onto the employment ladder have been repeatedly thwarted by his age - he 's in his mid-40 's - and long-term jobless status .
he is realistic rather than pessimistic when he says he may never again be gainfully employed .
" i see self-employment as the only way forward , but that 's not easy either , because you encounter so many hurdles , financial and otherwise , to get there , " hanisch said .
a question of cash for german inventors , the problem with getting out there and turning their innovative dreams into reality is intrinsically linked to a lack of funding .
" as an inventor , you need more than just an idea .
you need money to register the patent , ideally also money to employ a patent lawyer .
you have to create a prototype which can be shown at exhibitions or trade fairs , and then , most importantly , you need money for advertising , " inventor and engineer peter stepina said .
essentially it all boils down to cash .
and germany 's banks are not champing at the bit to hurl their money at independent creative minds .
" there 's no point in even applying for support from the bank unless you have a lot of your own capital , " hanisch added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : banks keep inventors at arms ' length since very few do , many potentially lucrative inventions are stopped in their tracks .
" of course it makes a difference to us if an inventor is prepared to invest his own money into his idea , but we also want to see a thorough business plan and be sure that the inventor has done his market analysis , " christian hotz , a spokesman for deutsche bank said .
again , that 's a process which the average inventor can not afford .
" it 's a case of the cat biting itself in the tail , " hanisch lamented .
but one new initiative set up by the chamber for trade and industry -lrb- ihk -rrb- in the german city of duisburg is blowing some fresh wind into the stagnant world of independent invention .
a new " idea " the project , aptly entitled " idea " is an original attempt to help inventors towards their ultimate goal of turning their models into money .
a pool of some 80 experts from all fields and walks of life work on a voluntary basis to assess the viability of designs and ideas submitted to them from the innovator on the street .
" the problem at the moment is that there is no financial backing available for individuals .
if an inventor wants to access funding , the only way to go about it is to team up with a company .
even the government initiative for patent funding is out of bounds to the individual , " ihk innovations consultant rolf berenz said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new invention for pasta on the go berenz hopes the project will establish a network of people who work together to promote innovation within germany - not only technological innovation but also in the realms of service and management .
he calls it a one-stop shop in which clever ideas are analyzed , assessed and , where appropriate , the inventor gets feedback from a panel of experts .
what about " me incorporated ? "
it 's certainly a step in the right direction and a more structured move to support an often marginalized profession .
at the moment , the only other possibility inventors have at securing external support is through a government-funded program called " me incorporated , " which is designed to encourage the unemployed to start their own businesses .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dog-walking machine has n't yet taken off but getting into the program requires more than a brilliant idea .
" candidates have to get their ideas analyzed by an expert to assess the likelihood of success , " ellen queisser , spokeswoman for the labor office in berlin said .
it 's a vicious circle for the likes of heino hanisch , who believes it takes imagination to see just how a new product might succeed .
" the experts who are supposed to check for viability are long-term employees who have no idea about being self-employed and no idea about what will or will not work . "
whether that is true or not , it remains a fact that german inventors are out there and feeling frustrated about being prevented from adding some dynamism to the entrepreneurial face of the nation . tamsin walker , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de protecting patents at a snail 's pace in the age of globalization , international patents are needed to protect intellectual property .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 01.02.2005 first german tv soap celebrates 20 years großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of cast of the long-running " lindenstrasse " when it began in 1985 , the soap opera " lindenstrasse " got miserable reviews and many predicted a short life for the series .
but this week the show , with its people-next-door characters , aired its 1,000th episode . many of them are n't all that sexy , hardly any are rich , and they 're usually never confronted with amnesia , alien abductions , evil twins or any of the other outlandish situations that have become part and parcel of many of the world 's serial dramas . instead , up and down lindenstrasse , the fictional street in a munich suburb where the series of the same name is set , fairly ordinary people meet the triumphs and tragedies that many experience in real life : infidelity , failing marriages , first love , parental disapproval , new careers or youth violence .
the characters are like the neighbors next door and the german public has been tuning in faithfully to find out where their on-screen lives are taking them for 20 years or 1,000 episodes . for many germans , sunday evening from 6:40 to 7:10 p.m. is " lindenstrasse " time , and woe to the person who calls or shows up unannounced at the door of a fan during that period . borrowed from the brits the show 's premise was borrowed from the bbc 's " coronation street , " britain 's longest-running television soap opera , which is set in a gritty industrial suburb of manchester .
the " lindenstrasse " crowd has less coal dust to contend with , but like their british cousins , the characters on the outskirts of munich are overwhelmingly midway or slightly lower on the socio-economic scale .
instead of super models , oil barons or jet-setting cosmetic company heads , the folks who live or work on lindenstrasse are housewives , taxi drivers , travel agents or hair stylists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lindenstrasse street sign the concerns of the beimer , kling , zenker or sarikaki families are generally the concerns of average people .
they complain about high taxes , unemployment or like to share the latest gossip about the super 's wife .
frau beimer 's husband has left her for a younger woman .
a greek family is thrown into turmoil when the oldest son wants to marry a german woman . controversial issues but lindenstrasse has not been afraid to tackle more controversial issues and has been on the forefront regarding several topics other shows have been reluctant to touch .
the daughter of one of the central families once suffered from bulimia ; another son was born with down 's syndrome . an hiv-positive woman passed on the virus to her son and a gay couple took care of the boy after his mother 's death from the disease .
lesbian storylines have been running for years and , in 1990 , the show featured the first gay kiss on german primetime tv . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actress marie-luise marjan and hans w. geißendörfer , the series producer the characters ' responses to many controversial issues have led some to complain that the creator and producer of the show , hans geissendörfer -lrb- photo -rrb- , uses the show to present his own left-of-center political opinions .
critics say other views are represented as being odd or out of touch with the times .
that , they say , is problematic since the show airs on german public broadcasting and , due to its station 's charter , has a duty to remain politically neutral . millions watch every week for the 1,000th episode , more than seven million tuned in for a special 45-minute broadcast .
while " lindenstrasse " has lost some its audience to " younger " shows with a strong teen element , such as " good times and bad " and " forbidden love , " the show still attracts on average 4.8 million viewers on sunday evenings . its current contract with west german broadcasting , which produces the show in a suburb of cologne , runs through 2008 and fans are guaranteed at least another 219 episodes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : annemarie wendl as else kling what fans wo n't be seeing much more of is likely germany 's most famous concierge , else kling , who has been a feature on the show since the beginning .
annemarie wendl , the 90-year-old actress who has played the part for 20 years , says she will step down sometime in 2005 .
but she does n't want to die peacefully in her sleep surrounded by loved ones and flowers .
" i want to be murdered , not have some boring death in bed , " she told germany 's bild am sonntag newspaper .

croats , serbs and albanians are hacking into each others ' web sites and leaving nationalistic slogans .
on online forums , bitter political debates have been ignited . in december , albanian internet enthusiasts hacked into the kosovo-based site of the serbian orthodox church .
instead of the usual pictures of the monastery found there , the words " kosovo will gain its independence " popped up on web browsers . in response , serb hackers attacked the online offering of the albanian capital tirana and posted a stream of curses on the page .
over the past four weeks , some 100 web sites from serbia as well as about a dozen albanian ones were illegally altered . virtual attacks the trigger for these virtual attacks between serbs and croats in the second part of december was an incident in which a nationally minded serb basketball player was refused entry to croatia .

but this week the show , with its people-next-door characters , aired its 1,000th episode . many of them are n't all that sexy , hardly any are rich , and they 're usually never confronted with amnesia , alien abductions , evil twins or any of the other outlandish situations that have become part and parcel of many of the world 's serial dramas . instead , up and down lindenstrasse , the fictional street in a munich suburb where the series of the same name is set , fairly ordinary people meet the triumphs and tragedies that many experience in real life : infidelity , failing marriages , first love , parental disapproval , new careers or youth violence .
the characters are like the neighbors next door and the german public has been tuning in faithfully to find out where their on-screen lives are taking them for 20 years or 1,000 episodes . for many germans , sunday evening from 6:40 to 7:10 p.m. is " lindenstrasse " time , and woe to the person who calls or shows up unannounced at the door of a fan during that period . borrowed from the brits the show 's premise was borrowed from the bbc 's " coronation street , " britain 's longest-running television soap opera , which is set in a gritty industrial suburb of manchester .
the " lindenstrasse " crowd has less coal dust to contend with , but like their british cousins , the characters on the outskirts of munich are overwhelmingly midway or slightly lower on the socio-economic scale .
instead of super models , oil barons or jet-setting cosmetic company heads , the folks who live or work on lindenstrasse are housewives , taxi drivers , travel agents or hair stylists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lindenstrasse street sign the concerns of the beimer , kling , zenker or sarikaki families are generally the concerns of average people .
they complain about high taxes , unemployment or like to share the latest gossip about the super 's wife .
frau beimer 's husband has left her for a younger woman .
a greek family is thrown into turmoil when the oldest son wants to marry a german woman . controversial issues but lindenstrasse has not been afraid to tackle more controversial issues and has been on the forefront regarding several topics other shows have been reluctant to touch .
the daughter of one of the central families once suffered from bulimia ; another son was born with down 's syndrome . an hiv-positive woman passed on the virus to her son and a gay couple took care of the boy after his mother 's death from the disease .
lesbian storylines have been running for years and , in 1990 , the show featured the first gay kiss on german primetime tv . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actress marie-luise marjan and hans w. geißendörfer , the series producer the characters ' responses to many controversial issues have led some to complain that the creator and producer of the show , hans geissendörfer -lrb- photo -rrb- , uses the show to present his own left-of-center political opinions .
critics say other views are represented as being odd or out of touch with the times .
that , they say , is problematic since the show airs on german public broadcasting and , due to its station 's charter , has a duty to remain politically neutral . millions watch every week for the 1,000th episode , more than seven million tuned in for a special 45-minute broadcast .
while " lindenstrasse " has lost some its audience to " younger " shows with a strong teen element , such as " good times and bad " and " forbidden love , " the show still attracts on average 4.8 million viewers on sunday evenings . its current contract with west german broadcasting , which produces the show in a suburb of cologne , runs through 2008 and fans are guaranteed at least another 219 episodes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : annemarie wendl as else kling what fans wo n't be seeing much more of is likely germany 's most famous concierge , else kling , who has been a feature on the show since the beginning .
annemarie wendl , the 90-year-old actress who has played the part for 20 years , says she will step down sometime in 2005 .
but she does n't want to die peacefully in her sleep surrounded by loved ones and flowers .
" i want to be murdered , not have some boring death in bed , " she told germany 's bild am sonntag newspaper .

now , help is at hand thanks to the slightly macabre " phone angel . " a german inventor has come up with a novel way for relatives coping with the grief of losing a loved one to convey their feelings to the departed .
the " phone angel , " a long-life battery powered cell phone device , allows those in mourning to have contact with the deceased when personal pain , distance or disability prevents them from attending the final resting place . not to be confused with a seance or ouija board , the phone angel does n't promise to put you in touch with the spirit world but intends to provide comfort for those coming to terms with their loss by opening the airwaves .

" people who are ill , have no time or live too far away to visit the deceased in their grave can now call , " said bröther in an interview with the associated press .
the inventor added that the thought came to him when his mother showed an unwillingness to attend a relative 's grave but would have liked to keep in touch with the person laid to rest there . long life battery keeps the airwaves open the device - consisting of a cell phone , a super strength battery and a small loudspeaker - comes in a waterproof container the size of an average shoe box which is placed in the earth about 30 centimeters -lrb- 11.8 inches -rrb- above the grave .
thanks to two years of collaborating with an electrician , bröther has developed a battery which will allow grieving friends and family almost a year of contact . using an application that most modern mobile phones have , automatic call response , bröther 's invention allows every caller to get through .
the phone angel clicks on and allows communication as if someone on the other end had picked up the receiver .
unlike the recipient of the call , the line is very rarely dead . once the battery has run down , the temptation would be to just cut the losses and leave the device in the ground .
but bröther has thought of that .

the controversial vehicles are not deemed safe by everyone but eu officials required germany to allow teens to drive them anyway . unlike their contemporaries in many other countries , german teenagers have so far had to wait until turning 18 before being able to drive a car .

" these cars do n't offer any active or passive security measures for the driver , " said otto saalmann of germany 's largest automobile club , adac , which has conducted a crash test with a mini car . " the drivers ' crumple zone is pretty much his own body , " saalmann added , saying that the risk of injury was extremely high and that during the test , major parts broke and the transmission was pushed inside the car .
apart from security problems with the vehicle , saalmann also said mini cars posed a risk on streets as they slow down traffic . " they can drive on countryside highways , leading to congestion , accidents and risky overtake maneuvers , " he said . eu pushes for teen license bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mini cars are also more common on japanese streets but eu competition regulations brought about the driver 's licenses for 16-year-olds .
germany did have stricter rules than other union members - only people aged 18 and over who had a regular driver 's license where allowed to drive mini cars .
few dealers sold the mainly french products and they were rarely seen on german roads . eu commissioners saw this as a competitive disadvantage for mini car makers on the german market and pressured germany 's federal government to lower the age requirement to allow teens to drive before turning 18 . mathieu grosch , a belgian eu parliamentarian , said he agreed with the commission 's assessment that german law violated competition rules .

the so-called " s " license allows teens to drive mini cars and ride " trikes " and " quads " - motor bikes with three and four wheels .
to get licensed , applicants have to pass a written and practical exam . by introducing the " s " license , germany complied with eu demands but still sets the bar much higher than its neighboring countries .
government officials said they believed the new license represented the best possible compromise between eu and national law . " the only question that 's important here is : ' what kind of license do i need to safely drive such a car ' ? " said christian weibrecht , a spokesman for the german transportation ministry .
" the question is n't whether such cars are safe or not .
it 's important to remember that these vehicles have been legal in other eu countries for years and that according to eu law , we can not prevent that they are sold and driven in germany . " experts are not waiting to see whether teenagers will actually end up applying for the " s " license and starting a boom of mini cars on german streets .
if nothing else , the costs might keep them from doing so : a license will set them back between € 800 and € 1,000 and mini cars come with an average price tag of € 10,000 . and when the young drivers are ready to switch to the real thing two years later , they will have to start from scratch again to get a " real " driver 's license . christiane wolters -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a little high 's ok on german highways cannabis might still be illegal in germany , but police officers have long ignored the occasional joint smoker .

the controversial vehicles are not deemed safe by everyone but eu officials required germany to allow teens to drive them anyway . unlike their contemporaries in many other countries , german teenagers have so far had to wait until turning 18 before being able to drive a car .
that 's no longer the case as 16-year-olds can now get a driver 's license for " be up , " " albizia " or mc1 , " as some of the mini cars are called . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : minicar mc1 at first sight , the vehicles almost look like normal cars , but they only weigh around 350 kilograms -lrb- about 700 pounds -rrb- and can not go faster than 45 kilometers per hour -lrb- 28 miles per hour -rrb- . the lightweight automobiles have raised the eyebrows of car experts , who are concerned about their safety . " these cars do n't offer any active or passive security measures for the driver , " said otto saalmann of germany 's largest automobile club , adac , which has conducted a crash test with a mini car . " the drivers ' crumple zone is pretty much his own body , " saalmann added , saying that the risk of injury was extremely high and that during the test , major parts broke and the transmission was pushed inside the car .
apart from security problems with the vehicle , saalmann also said mini cars posed a risk on streets as they slow down traffic . " they can drive on countryside highways , leading to congestion , accidents and risky overtake maneuvers , " he said . eu pushes for teen license bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mini cars are also more common on japanese streets but eu competition regulations brought about the driver 's licenses for 16-year-olds .
germany did have stricter rules than other union members - only people aged 18 and over who had a regular driver 's license where allowed to drive mini cars .
few dealers sold the mainly french products and they were rarely seen on german roads . eu commissioners saw this as a competitive disadvantage for mini car makers on the german market and pressured germany 's federal government to lower the age requirement to allow teens to drive before turning 18 . mathieu grosch , a belgian eu parliamentarian , said he agreed with the commission 's assessment that german law violated competition rules . " clearly there are market tendencies where some people say that they do n't want to sell this product in favor of another , " he said .

the so-called " s " license allows teens to drive mini cars and ride " trikes " and " quads " - motor bikes with three and four wheels .
to get licensed , applicants have to pass a written and practical exam . by introducing the " s " license , germany complied with eu demands but still sets the bar much higher than its neighboring countries .
government officials said they believed the new license represented the best possible compromise between eu and national law . " the only question that 's important here is : ' what kind of license do i need to safely drive such a car ' ? " said christian weibrecht , a spokesman for the german transportation ministry .
" the question is n't whether such cars are safe or not .

the controversial vehicles are not deemed safe by everyone but eu officials required germany to allow teens to drive them anyway . unlike their contemporaries in many other countries , german teenagers have so far had to wait until turning 18 before being able to drive a car .
that 's no longer the case as 16-year-olds can now get a driver 's license for " be up , " " albizia " or mc1 , " as some of the mini cars are called . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : minicar mc1 at first sight , the vehicles almost look like normal cars , but they only weigh around 350 kilograms -lrb- about 700 pounds -rrb- and can not go faster than 45 kilometers per hour -lrb- 28 miles per hour -rrb- . the lightweight automobiles have raised the eyebrows of car experts , who are concerned about their safety . " these cars do n't offer any active or passive security measures for the driver , " said otto saalmann of germany 's largest automobile club , adac , which has conducted a crash test with a mini car . " the drivers ' crumple zone is pretty much his own body , " saalmann added , saying that the risk of injury was extremely high and that during the test , major parts broke and the transmission was pushed inside the car .
apart from security problems with the vehicle , saalmann also said mini cars posed a risk on streets as they slow down traffic . " they can drive on countryside highways , leading to congestion , accidents and risky overtake maneuvers , " he said . eu pushes for teen license bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mini cars are also more common on japanese streets but eu competition regulations brought about the driver 's licenses for 16-year-olds .
germany did have stricter rules than other union members - only people aged 18 and over who had a regular driver 's license where allowed to drive mini cars .
few dealers sold the mainly french products and they were rarely seen on german roads . eu commissioners saw this as a competitive disadvantage for mini car makers on the german market and pressured germany 's federal government to lower the age requirement to allow teens to drive before turning 18 . mathieu grosch , a belgian eu parliamentarian , said he agreed with the commission 's assessment that german law violated competition rules . " clearly there are market tendencies where some people say that they do n't want to sell this product in favor of another , " he said .
" but that 's a form of protectionism which can not be tolerated . " german compromise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the model of a " quad " bike on a german driver 's license as a compromise , germany decided to introduce a new class of driver 's licences that can be obtained at 16 years of age .
the so-called " s " license allows teens to drive mini cars and ride " trikes " and " quads " - motor bikes with three and four wheels .
to get licensed , applicants have to pass a written and practical exam . by introducing the " s " license , germany complied with eu demands but still sets the bar much higher than its neighboring countries .
government officials said they believed the new license represented the best possible compromise between eu and national law . " the only question that 's important here is : ' what kind of license do i need to safely drive such a car ' ? " said christian weibrecht , a spokesman for the german transportation ministry .
" the question is n't whether such cars are safe or not .
it 's important to remember that these vehicles have been legal in other eu countries for years and that according to eu law , we can not prevent that they are sold and driven in germany . " experts are not waiting to see whether teenagers will actually end up applying for the " s " license and starting a boom of mini cars on german streets .
if nothing else , the costs might keep them from doing so : a license will set them back between € 800 and € 1,000 and mini cars come with an average price tag of € 10,000 . and when the young drivers are ready to switch to the real thing two years later , they will have to start from scratch again to get a " real " driver 's license . christiane wolters -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a little high 's ok on german highways cannabis might still be illegal in germany , but police officers have long ignored the occasional joint smoker .

27 german president host köhler on tuesday began an official four-day state visit to israel .
the highlight of his visit will a be a controversial speech before the israeli parliament on wednesday . köhler , the former head of the international monetary fund , has made a name for himself as a man who hates small talk and likes to get down to business right away .
his talks with high-ranking israeli leaders later on tuesdy will provide him with another opportunity to do just that . but for several reasons , the visit is anything but a routine job for germany 's president , said manfred lahnstein , the head of the hamburg-based german-israeli society . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we have encouraging developments in the middle east and that is a good background for the visit , " lahnstein said , adding that it marks the 40th anniversary of diplomatic relations between germany and israel .
" we have had the celebrations marking the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the auschwitz annihilation camp .
so you have our ongoing historic responsibility , the fostering and strengthening of excellent albeit not normal relations between the two countries and some political processes , which look promising . " german speech sparks protests on wednesday , köhler is due to deliver a speech on german-israeli relations before parliament , the knesset .
his plan to hold his speech in german has already provoked protests among a small number of israeli deputies who are poised to leave the hall when köhler starts his speech . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knesset in jerusalem israel ’ s minister of health dani naveh said he plans to boycott president köhler ’ s speech .
he told the right-wing israeli daily newspaper maariv that as long as holocaust survivors are still alive , german should not be spoken in israel 's parliament . his comment echoed the feelings of a number of parliamentary deputies .
the acting president of the knesset , hemi doron , said he would ask his superiors either to cancel the speech or to ask köhler to hold it in english .
doron , whose grandfather was killed in the holocaust , said his feet had never touched german soil and he never bought german products .
so he could not allow the german language to be spoken in the jewish people ’ s house of parliament .

knesset speaker reuven rivlin , who was instrumental in the decision to allow the visiting president to deliver his speech in german , insisted it would be better not to extend an invitation than to demand that the guest speak in a different language .

revelations on monday named players accused of receiving cash incentives in disputed games . the corruption scandal engulfing german soccer shows no sign of dying down with the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- investigation claiming another scalp on monday . it has been revealed that the sc paderborn captain , thijs waterink , received € 10,000 -lrb- $ 13,000 -rrb- from an anonymous backer as an incentive to defeat hamburg in the german cup tie , one of the four matches shamed referee robert hoyzer has since admitted to manipulating for a € 70,000 purse " i did not know before the game that the players would be receiving this bonus , " paderborn president wilfried finke told the n24 television channel .
" a man from southern europe phoned team captain waterink and said , ' there is € 10,000 as a team bonus if you win against hamburg .
if you do not , we want the money back . " ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : referee robert hoyzer during hamburg-paderborn game paderborn won the game 4-2 after hoyzer awarded two controversial penalty kicks and sent off hamburg 's belgian international emile mpenza .
dutchman waterink split the unrecorded bonus among his victorious team-mates . he has since been suspended as part of the escalating investigation which has already seen the end of hoyzer 's career while four men were arrested last week and three have been charged with fraud in connection with the case . fears of a scandal to rival 1971 the widening scandal has ominous similarities to the one that plunged german soccer into its darkest hour 34 years ago .
match-fixing and bribes engulfed the bundesliga in 1971 when more than 50 players , a number of coaches and officials plus the clubs arminia bielefeld and kickers offenbach were found guilty of offering bribes and fixing bundesliga games , prompting the dfb to dish out hefty fines and suspensions . revelations of coercion between parties will no doubt bring the nightmares back for the dfb - and it is likely to get worse .
the news that both paderborn and hoyzer were directly involved has caused a further shock and finke claims it is highly likely that hamburg also have a role to play . hamburg players suspected of complicity " this is just the tip of the iceberg , " explained finke .
" since the referee and paderborn players are involved i would also suggest that the hamburg players are looked at too .
to ensure a bet comes off you need all three parties involved - the winners , the losers and the referee . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg sv hamburg are furious at the implication and club president bernd hoffmann admitted legal action was being considered .
" the comments are a disgrace , " raged hoffmann .
" we will speak with our lawyer about these claims and think about taking legal action .

the capital club have denied that their players were involved and the trio have pleaded their innocence . more clubs and players to be probed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dfb investigation hopes to move swiftly to close the case .
two other lower division clubs dresden and chemnitz have also been mentioned in connection with match-fixing while referee jurgen jansen is also being investigated after he was named by hoyzer . jansen was due to referee werder bremen 's match against hansa rostock on sunday but the dfb chose to remove him before kick-off .
the dfb described jansen 's removal as a " purely precautionary measure , " saying he was n't suspected of fixing matches .
jansen gave a sworn statement on monday denying any connection to the affair . meanwhile , bookmaker oddset has accused the dfb of failing to heed a tip-off they gave on august 23 of last year in regard to the hamburg-paderborn game .
oddset maintained they sent a fax to the dfb 48 hours after the cup match but dfb president gerhard mayer-vorfelder denied the bookmaker 's claim . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : a shadow over german soccer german soccer has struggled recently .

revelations on monday named players accused of receiving cash incentives in disputed games . the corruption scandal engulfing german soccer shows no sign of dying down with the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- investigation claiming another scalp on monday . it has been revealed that the sc paderborn captain , thijs waterink , received € 10,000 -lrb- $ 13,000 -rrb- from an anonymous backer as an incentive to defeat hamburg in the german cup tie , one of the four matches shamed referee robert hoyzer has since admitted to manipulating for a € 70,000 purse " i did not know before the game that the players would be receiving this bonus , " paderborn president wilfried finke told the n24 television channel .
" a man from southern europe phoned team captain waterink and said , ' there is € 10,000 as a team bonus if you win against hamburg .
if you do not , we want the money back . " ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : referee robert hoyzer during hamburg-paderborn game paderborn won the game 4-2 after hoyzer awarded two controversial penalty kicks and sent off hamburg 's belgian international emile mpenza .
dutchman waterink split the unrecorded bonus among his victorious team-mates . he has since been suspended as part of the escalating investigation which has already seen the end of hoyzer 's career while four men were arrested last week and three have been charged with fraud in connection with the case . fears of a scandal to rival 1971 the widening scandal has ominous similarities to the one that plunged german soccer into its darkest hour 34 years ago .
match-fixing and bribes engulfed the bundesliga in 1971 when more than 50 players , a number of coaches and officials plus the clubs arminia bielefeld and kickers offenbach were found guilty of offering bribes and fixing bundesliga games , prompting the dfb to dish out hefty fines and suspensions . revelations of coercion between parties will no doubt bring the nightmares back for the dfb - and it is likely to get worse .
the news that both paderborn and hoyzer were directly involved has caused a further shock and finke claims it is highly likely that hamburg also have a role to play . hamburg players suspected of complicity " this is just the tip of the iceberg , " explained finke .
" since the referee and paderborn players are involved i would also suggest that the hamburg players are looked at too .
to ensure a bet comes off you need all three parties involved - the winners , the losers and the referee . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg sv hamburg are furious at the implication and club president bernd hoffmann admitted legal action was being considered .
" the comments are a disgrace , " raged hoffmann .
" we will speak with our lawyer about these claims and think about taking legal action . " hertha berlin are another bundesliga side implicated in the scandal with three of their players - alexander madlung , nando rafael and josip simunic - named in connection with a second round cup match between hertha and eintracht braunschweig on sept .
22 of last year . regional side braunschweig won 3-2 with defender madlung scoring an own goal in the 80th minute to seal hertha 's defeat .
the capital club have denied that their players were involved and the trio have pleaded their innocence . more clubs and players to be probed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dfb investigation hopes to move swiftly to close the case .
two other lower division clubs dresden and chemnitz have also been mentioned in connection with match-fixing while referee jurgen jansen is also being investigated after he was named by hoyzer . jansen was due to referee werder bremen 's match against hansa rostock on sunday but the dfb chose to remove him before kick-off .
the dfb described jansen 's removal as a " purely precautionary measure , " saying he was n't suspected of fixing matches .
jansen gave a sworn statement on monday denying any connection to the affair . meanwhile , bookmaker oddset has accused the dfb of failing to heed a tip-off they gave on august 23 of last year in regard to the hamburg-paderborn game .
oddset maintained they sent a fax to the dfb 48 hours after the cup match but dfb president gerhard mayer-vorfelder denied the bookmaker 's claim . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : a shadow over german soccer german soccer has struggled recently .

but much hinges on whether ante gotovina is produced to face war-crimes charges at the hague . rehn issued his starkest warning yet that the eu would postpone a march date to launch entry talks with zagreb if the retired general is not delivered to the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- . the finnish commissioner said he was " convinced that if the croatian government had the political will to locate and transfer general gotovina , it could do so . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olli rehn rehn -lrb- photo -rrb- said that based on information from un chief prosecutor carla del ponte and other " very informed sources , " croatia and gotovina have discussed a " possible voluntary surrender of general gotovina which did not materialize . " gotovina was also most probably sheltering in croatia or croatian areas of bosnia-hercegovina , " in any case within the reach of the croatian government , " he added . croatian premier surprised croatian prime minister ivo sanader voiced surprise over the threat to postpone the start of entry talks , rejecting the allegation that the government had had contacts with gotovina . " i am not worried but surprised , " sanader told croatian national radio speaking from luxembourg .
" croatia is fully cooperating with the un war crimes tribunal at the hague . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ivo sanader information that the government had held talks with gotovina was " not true , " said the prime minister -lrb- photo -rrb- , adding he was confident accession talks would begin as scheduled on march 17 . gotovina 's lawyer luka misetic said earlier this month that his client would surrender if his case was transferred to a croatian court , a deal immediately dismissed by un prosecutors and by zagreb . eu ready to postpone talks releasing the eu executive 's proposed plan of accession negotiations with croatia , rehn said that zagreb would not today be considered as deserving of eu talks . " if the commission were to give its recommendation on the basis of today 's information , i could not recommend opening negotiations with croatia , " he told a news conference .
" if there is no progress from the croatian side -lrb- on gotovina -rrb- , we are ready to postpone the start of talks . " at a december summit , eu leaders said the bloc would start accession talks with croatia on march 17 - provided it cooperates fully with the icty . that means finding and handing over gotovina , who went into hiding in 2001 when the un court charged him with war crimes against ethnic serbs at the end of croatia 's 1991-95 war of independence from the former yugoslavia . luxembourg foreign minister jean asselborn of the eu 's current presidency said the bloc 's decision on whether to proceed with talks from march 17 would depend in large part on the icty 's appraisal . " every step must go perfectly " confirming the receipt of a letter " from an individual claiming to be mr gotovina 's lawyer , " he said the issue of croatia would be discussed when us secretary of state condoleezza rice visits luxembourg on feb .
9 and 10 . " if tomorrow mr gotovina turns up in the hague , that 's that and we can start earlier , " asselborn said after a meeting of eu foreign ministers .
" but until that happens , march 17 is a buffer date for the start of the negotiations with croatia . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cathedral square in croatia 's capital , zagreb like any other eu candidate , croatia will have to strive hard to transpose the 80,000 pages of eu legislation and standards known as the " acquis communautaire .

but much hinges on whether ante gotovina is produced to face war-crimes charges at the hague . rehn issued his starkest warning yet that the eu would postpone a march date to launch entry talks with zagreb if the retired general is not delivered to the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- . the finnish commissioner said he was " convinced that if the croatian government had the political will to locate and transfer general gotovina , it could do so . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olli rehn rehn -lrb- photo -rrb- said that based on information from un chief prosecutor carla del ponte and other " very informed sources , " croatia and gotovina have discussed a " possible voluntary surrender of general gotovina which did not materialize . " gotovina was also most probably sheltering in croatia or croatian areas of bosnia-hercegovina , " in any case within the reach of the croatian government , " he added . croatian premier surprised croatian prime minister ivo sanader voiced surprise over the threat to postpone the start of entry talks , rejecting the allegation that the government had had contacts with gotovina . " i am not worried but surprised , " sanader told croatian national radio speaking from luxembourg .
" croatia is fully cooperating with the un war crimes tribunal at the hague . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ivo sanader information that the government had held talks with gotovina was " not true , " said the prime minister -lrb- photo -rrb- , adding he was confident accession talks would begin as scheduled on march 17 . gotovina 's lawyer luka misetic said earlier this month that his client would surrender if his case was transferred to a croatian court , a deal immediately dismissed by un prosecutors and by zagreb . eu ready to postpone talks releasing the eu executive 's proposed plan of accession negotiations with croatia , rehn said that zagreb would not today be considered as deserving of eu talks . " if the commission were to give its recommendation on the basis of today 's information , i could not recommend opening negotiations with croatia , " he told a news conference .
" if there is no progress from the croatian side -lrb- on gotovina -rrb- , we are ready to postpone the start of talks . " at a december summit , eu leaders said the bloc would start accession talks with croatia on march 17 - provided it cooperates fully with the icty . that means finding and handing over gotovina , who went into hiding in 2001 when the un court charged him with war crimes against ethnic serbs at the end of croatia 's 1991-95 war of independence from the former yugoslavia . luxembourg foreign minister jean asselborn of the eu 's current presidency said the bloc 's decision on whether to proceed with talks from march 17 would depend in large part on the icty 's appraisal . " every step must go perfectly " confirming the receipt of a letter " from an individual claiming to be mr gotovina 's lawyer , " he said the issue of croatia would be discussed when us secretary of state condoleezza rice visits luxembourg on feb .
9 and 10 . " if tomorrow mr gotovina turns up in the hague , that 's that and we can start earlier , " asselborn said after a meeting of eu foreign ministers .
" but until that happens , march 17 is a buffer date for the start of the negotiations with croatia . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cathedral square in croatia 's capital , zagreb like any other eu candidate , croatia will have to strive hard to transpose the 80,000 pages of eu legislation and standards known as the " acquis communautaire . " rehn proposed to eu member states that the accession negotiations be broken down into 35 chapters and the talks be conducted chapter by chapter . " to meet 2009 , every step must go perfectly , " he said . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de croatian president wins reelection croatian president stipe mesic beat his ruling conservative party rival in sunday 's election , securing a second five-year term and promising to lead the former yugoslav republic into the european union .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 01.02.2005 first german tv soap celebrates 20 years großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of cast of the long-running " lindenstrasse " when it began in 1985 , the soap opera " lindenstrasse " got miserable reviews and many predicted a short life for the series .
but this week the show , with its people-next-door characters , aired its 1,000th episode . many of them are n't all that sexy , hardly any are rich , and they 're usually never confronted with amnesia , alien abductions , evil twins or any of the other outlandish situations that have become part and parcel of many of the world 's serial dramas . instead , up and down lindenstrasse , the fictional street in a munich suburb where the series of the same name is set , fairly ordinary people meet the triumphs and tragedies that many experience in real life : infidelity , failing marriages , first love , parental disapproval , new careers or youth violence .
the characters are like the neighbors next door and the german public has been tuning in faithfully to find out where their on-screen lives are taking them for 20 years or 1,000 episodes . for many germans , sunday evening from 6:40 to 7:10 p.m. is " lindenstrasse " time , and woe to the person who calls or shows up unannounced at the door of a fan during that period . borrowed from the brits the show 's premise was borrowed from the bbc 's " coronation street , " britain 's longest-running television soap opera , which is set in a gritty industrial suburb of manchester .
the " lindenstrasse " crowd has less coal dust to contend with , but like their british cousins , the characters on the outskirts of munich are overwhelmingly midway or slightly lower on the socio-economic scale .
instead of super models , oil barons or jet-setting cosmetic company heads , the folks who live or work on lindenstrasse are housewives , taxi drivers , travel agents or hair stylists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lindenstrasse street sign the concerns of the beimer , kling , zenker or sarikaki families are generally the concerns of average people .
they complain about high taxes , unemployment or like to share the latest gossip about the super 's wife .
frau beimer 's husband has left her for a younger woman .
a greek family is thrown into turmoil when the oldest son wants to marry a german woman . controversial issues but lindenstrasse has not been afraid to tackle more controversial issues and has been on the forefront regarding several topics other shows have been reluctant to touch .
the daughter of one of the central families once suffered from bulimia ; another son was born with down 's syndrome . an hiv-positive woman passed on the virus to her son and a gay couple took care of the boy after his mother 's death from the disease .
lesbian storylines have been running for years and , in 1990 , the show featured the first gay kiss on german primetime tv . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actress marie-luise marjan and hans w. geißendörfer , the series producer the characters ' responses to many controversial issues have led some to complain that the creator and producer of the show , hans geissendörfer -lrb- photo -rrb- , uses the show to present his own left-of-center political opinions .
critics say other views are represented as being odd or out of touch with the times .
that , they say , is problematic since the show airs on german public broadcasting and , due to its station 's charter , has a duty to remain politically neutral . millions watch every week for the 1,000th episode , more than seven million tuned in for a special 45-minute broadcast .
while " lindenstrasse " has lost some its audience to " younger " shows with a strong teen element , such as " good times and bad " and " forbidden love , " the show still attracts on average 4.8 million viewers on sunday evenings . its current contract with west german broadcasting , which produces the show in a suburb of cologne , runs through 2008 and fans are guaranteed at least another 219 episodes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : annemarie wendl as else kling what fans wo n't be seeing much more of is likely germany 's most famous concierge , else kling , who has been a feature on the show since the beginning .
annemarie wendl , the 90-year-old actress who has played the part for 20 years , says she will step down sometime in 2005 .
but she does n't want to die peacefully in her sleep surrounded by loved ones and flowers .
" i want to be murdered , not have some boring death in bed , " she told germany 's bild am sonntag newspaper .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 01.02.2005 croatia 's eu bid threatened großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gotovina 's arrest is crucial for croatia 's eu membership talks the european union has accused croatia of deliberately failing to act to arrest a fugitive general whose fate is central to the country 's eu membership bid . eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn said that croatia could , if all went well , join the eu in 2009 .
but much hinges on whether ante gotovina is produced to face war-crimes charges at the hague . rehn issued his starkest warning yet that the eu would postpone a march date to launch entry talks with zagreb if the retired general is not delivered to the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- . the finnish commissioner said he was " convinced that if the croatian government had the political will to locate and transfer general gotovina , it could do so . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olli rehn rehn -lrb- photo -rrb- said that based on information from un chief prosecutor carla del ponte and other " very informed sources , " croatia and gotovina have discussed a " possible voluntary surrender of general gotovina which did not materialize . " gotovina was also most probably sheltering in croatia or croatian areas of bosnia-hercegovina , " in any case within the reach of the croatian government , " he added . croatian premier surprised croatian prime minister ivo sanader voiced surprise over the threat to postpone the start of entry talks , rejecting the allegation that the government had had contacts with gotovina . " i am not worried but surprised , " sanader told croatian national radio speaking from luxembourg .
" croatia is fully cooperating with the un war crimes tribunal at the hague . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ivo sanader information that the government had held talks with gotovina was " not true , " said the prime minister -lrb- photo -rrb- , adding he was confident accession talks would begin as scheduled on march 17 . gotovina 's lawyer luka misetic said earlier this month that his client would surrender if his case was transferred to a croatian court , a deal immediately dismissed by un prosecutors and by zagreb . eu ready to postpone talks releasing the eu executive 's proposed plan of accession negotiations with croatia , rehn said that zagreb would not today be considered as deserving of eu talks . " if the commission were to give its recommendation on the basis of today 's information , i could not recommend opening negotiations with croatia , " he told a news conference .
" if there is no progress from the croatian side -lrb- on gotovina -rrb- , we are ready to postpone the start of talks . " at a december summit , eu leaders said the bloc would start accession talks with croatia on march 17 - provided it cooperates fully with the icty . that means finding and handing over gotovina , who went into hiding in 2001 when the un court charged him with war crimes against ethnic serbs at the end of croatia 's 1991-95 war of independence from the former yugoslavia . luxembourg foreign minister jean asselborn of the eu 's current presidency said the bloc 's decision on whether to proceed with talks from march 17 would depend in large part on the icty 's appraisal . " every step must go perfectly " confirming the receipt of a letter " from an individual claiming to be mr gotovina 's lawyer , " he said the issue of croatia would be discussed when us secretary of state condoleezza rice visits luxembourg on feb .
9 and 10 . " if tomorrow mr gotovina turns up in the hague , that 's that and we can start earlier , " asselborn said after a meeting of eu foreign ministers .
" but until that happens , march 17 is a buffer date for the start of the negotiations with croatia . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cathedral square in croatia 's capital , zagreb like any other eu candidate , croatia will have to strive hard to transpose the 80,000 pages of eu legislation and standards known as the " acquis communautaire .

27 german president host köhler on tuesday began an official four-day state visit to israel .
the highlight of his visit will a be a controversial speech before the israeli parliament on wednesday . köhler , the former head of the international monetary fund , has made a name for himself as a man who hates small talk and likes to get down to business right away .
his talks with high-ranking israeli leaders later on tuesdy will provide him with another opportunity to do just that . but for several reasons , the visit is anything but a routine job for germany 's president , said manfred lahnstein , the head of the hamburg-based german-israeli society . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we have encouraging developments in the middle east and that is a good background for the visit , " lahnstein said , adding that it marks the 40th anniversary of diplomatic relations between germany and israel .
" we have had the celebrations marking the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the auschwitz annihilation camp .
so you have our ongoing historic responsibility , the fostering and strengthening of excellent albeit not normal relations between the two countries and some political processes , which look promising . " german speech sparks protests on wednesday , köhler is due to deliver a speech on german-israeli relations before parliament , the knesset .
his plan to hold his speech in german has already provoked protests among a small number of israeli deputies who are poised to leave the hall when köhler starts his speech . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knesset in jerusalem israel ’ s minister of health dani naveh said he plans to boycott president köhler ’ s speech .
he told the right-wing israeli daily newspaper maariv that as long as holocaust survivors are still alive , german should not be spoken in israel 's parliament . his comment echoed the feelings of a number of parliamentary deputies .
the acting president of the knesset , hemi doron , said he would ask his superiors either to cancel the speech or to ask köhler to hold it in english .
doron , whose grandfather was killed in the holocaust , said his feet had never touched german soil and he never bought german products .
so he could not allow the german language to be spoken in the jewish people ’ s house of parliament . " a normal procedure " but lahnstein said köhler 's decision to speak in german was nothing unusual nor unprecendented . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former president johannes rau -lrb- right -rrb- and his israeli counterpart , moshe katzav -lrb- left -rrb- in germany in 2002 .
" that is a normal procedure that a president of a country who visits the parliament of another country and delivers a speech does so in his own tongue , " he said , adding that former german president johannes rau -lrb- photo -rrb- was the first to do so five years ago .
" on the other hand we have to understand that there are some members of the knesset , which for very personal reasons can not live with it and they will leave the hall of the knesset .
this happened five years ago as well and we have to understand it , and the rest should be dignity on both sides and it will be dignity on both sides . " some jewish public figures have spoken out in favor of köhler using his native german .
knesset speaker reuven rivlin , who was instrumental in the decision to allow the visiting president to deliver his speech in german , insisted it would be better not to extend an invitation than to demand that the guest speak in a different language .
and israel ’ s former ambassador to germany , avi primor -lrb- photo below -rrb- , also said he thinks there is no reason why köhler should not speak in german . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : avi primor " first of all , the relations between israel and germany are such that this kind of a question should n't arise at all , " he said .
" and secondly , the german language is not only the language of the nazis , but was a very important language before the nazis and is a very important language after the nazis .
it was a very important language for the jewish people . " german far-right overshadows visit but political observers in germany are also afraid that köhler ’ s trip to israel may be overshadowed by a recent scandal surrounding the far-right national party -lrb- npd -rrb- in saxony ’ s regional assembly .
npd leaders there had likened the end-of-wwii allied bombings on german towns to the holocaust , giving rise to a fresh debate about anti-semitism in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a yellow star of david that jews were forced to wear by the nazis is on display at yad vashem manfred lahnstein said the german president will have no way of dodging the issue , but is confident that the incident will not mar köhler ’ s talks with israeli leaders . during his trip , the german president will also take out time to visit the yad vashem holocaust memorial where he ’ s due to honor the six million jews murdered by the nazis . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de remembering germany 's darkest place commemorative events marking the 60th anniversary of the liberation of auschwitz continued throughout thursday as world leaders spoke of an evil that must never be allowed to surface again .

his talks with high-ranking israeli leaders later on tuesdy will provide him with another opportunity to do just that . but for several reasons , the visit is anything but a routine job for germany 's president , said manfred lahnstein , the head of the hamburg-based german-israeli society . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we have encouraging developments in the middle east and that is a good background for the visit , " lahnstein said , adding that it marks the 40th anniversary of diplomatic relations between germany and israel .
" we have had the celebrations marking the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the auschwitz annihilation camp .
so you have our ongoing historic responsibility , the fostering and strengthening of excellent albeit not normal relations between the two countries and some political processes , which look promising . " german speech sparks protests on wednesday , köhler is due to deliver a speech on german-israeli relations before parliament , the knesset .
his plan to hold his speech in german has already provoked protests among a small number of israeli deputies who are poised to leave the hall when köhler starts his speech . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knesset in jerusalem israel ’ s minister of health dani naveh said he plans to boycott president köhler ’ s speech .
he told the right-wing israeli daily newspaper maariv that as long as holocaust survivors are still alive , german should not be spoken in israel 's parliament . his comment echoed the feelings of a number of parliamentary deputies .
the acting president of the knesset , hemi doron , said he would ask his superiors either to cancel the speech or to ask köhler to hold it in english .
doron , whose grandfather was killed in the holocaust , said his feet had never touched german soil and he never bought german products .
so he could not allow the german language to be spoken in the jewish people ’ s house of parliament . " a normal procedure " but lahnstein said köhler 's decision to speak in german was nothing unusual nor unprecendented . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former president johannes rau -lrb- right -rrb- and his israeli counterpart , moshe katzav -lrb- left -rrb- in germany in 2002 .
" that is a normal procedure that a president of a country who visits the parliament of another country and delivers a speech does so in his own tongue , " he said , adding that former german president johannes rau -lrb- photo -rrb- was the first to do so five years ago .
" on the other hand we have to understand that there are some members of the knesset , which for very personal reasons can not live with it and they will leave the hall of the knesset .
this happened five years ago as well and we have to understand it , and the rest should be dignity on both sides and it will be dignity on both sides . " some jewish public figures have spoken out in favor of köhler using his native german .
knesset speaker reuven rivlin , who was instrumental in the decision to allow the visiting president to deliver his speech in german , insisted it would be better not to extend an invitation than to demand that the guest speak in a different language .
and israel ’ s former ambassador to germany , avi primor -lrb- photo below -rrb- , also said he thinks there is no reason why köhler should not speak in german . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : avi primor " first of all , the relations between israel and germany are such that this kind of a question should n't arise at all , " he said .
" and secondly , the german language is not only the language of the nazis , but was a very important language before the nazis and is a very important language after the nazis .
it was a very important language for the jewish people . " german far-right overshadows visit but political observers in germany are also afraid that köhler ’ s trip to israel may be overshadowed by a recent scandal surrounding the far-right national party -lrb- npd -rrb- in saxony ’ s regional assembly .
npd leaders there had likened the end-of-wwii allied bombings on german towns to the holocaust , giving rise to a fresh debate about anti-semitism in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a yellow star of david that jews were forced to wear by the nazis is on display at yad vashem manfred lahnstein said the german president will have no way of dodging the issue , but is confident that the incident will not mar köhler ’ s talks with israeli leaders . during his trip , the german president will also take out time to visit the yad vashem holocaust memorial where he ’ s due to honor the six million jews murdered by the nazis . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de remembering germany 's darkest place commemorative events marking the 60th anniversary of the liberation of auschwitz continued throughout thursday as world leaders spoke of an evil that must never be allowed to surface again .

27 german president host köhler on tuesday began an official four-day state visit to israel .
the highlight of his visit will a be a controversial speech before the israeli parliament on wednesday . köhler , the former head of the international monetary fund , has made a name for himself as a man who hates small talk and likes to get down to business right away .
his talks with high-ranking israeli leaders later on tuesdy will provide him with another opportunity to do just that . but for several reasons , the visit is anything but a routine job for germany 's president , said manfred lahnstein , the head of the hamburg-based german-israeli society . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we have encouraging developments in the middle east and that is a good background for the visit , " lahnstein said , adding that it marks the 40th anniversary of diplomatic relations between germany and israel .

doron , whose grandfather was killed in the holocaust , said his feet had never touched german soil and he never bought german products .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 01.02.2005 a mini license for german teens großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 'll still be a little too young starting tuesday , 16-year-old germans can drive so-called mini cars .
the controversial vehicles are not deemed safe by everyone but eu officials required germany to allow teens to drive them anyway . unlike their contemporaries in many other countries , german teenagers have so far had to wait until turning 18 before being able to drive a car .
that 's no longer the case as 16-year-olds can now get a driver 's license for " be up , " " albizia " or mc1 , " as some of the mini cars are called . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : minicar mc1 at first sight , the vehicles almost look like normal cars , but they only weigh around 350 kilograms -lrb- about 700 pounds -rrb- and can not go faster than 45 kilometers per hour -lrb- 28 miles per hour -rrb- . the lightweight automobiles have raised the eyebrows of car experts , who are concerned about their safety . " these cars do n't offer any active or passive security measures for the driver , " said otto saalmann of germany 's largest automobile club , adac , which has conducted a crash test with a mini car . " the drivers ' crumple zone is pretty much his own body , " saalmann added , saying that the risk of injury was extremely high and that during the test , major parts broke and the transmission was pushed inside the car .
apart from security problems with the vehicle , saalmann also said mini cars posed a risk on streets as they slow down traffic . " they can drive on countryside highways , leading to congestion , accidents and risky overtake maneuvers , " he said . eu pushes for teen license bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mini cars are also more common on japanese streets but eu competition regulations brought about the driver 's licenses for 16-year-olds .
germany did have stricter rules than other union members - only people aged 18 and over who had a regular driver 's license where allowed to drive mini cars .
few dealers sold the mainly french products and they were rarely seen on german roads . eu commissioners saw this as a competitive disadvantage for mini car makers on the german market and pressured germany 's federal government to lower the age requirement to allow teens to drive before turning 18 . mathieu grosch , a belgian eu parliamentarian , said he agreed with the commission 's assessment that german law violated competition rules . " clearly there are market tendencies where some people say that they do n't want to sell this product in favor of another , " he said .
" but that 's a form of protectionism which can not be tolerated . " german compromise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the model of a " quad " bike on a german driver 's license as a compromise , germany decided to introduce a new class of driver 's licences that can be obtained at 16 years of age .
the so-called " s " license allows teens to drive mini cars and ride " trikes " and " quads " - motor bikes with three and four wheels .
to get licensed , applicants have to pass a written and practical exam . by introducing the " s " license , germany complied with eu demands but still sets the bar much higher than its neighboring countries .
government officials said they believed the new license represented the best possible compromise between eu and national law . " the only question that 's important here is : ' what kind of license do i need to safely drive such a car ' ? " said christian weibrecht , a spokesman for the german transportation ministry .
" the question is n't whether such cars are safe or not .
it 's important to remember that these vehicles have been legal in other eu countries for years and that according to eu law , we can not prevent that they are sold and driven in germany . " experts are not waiting to see whether teenagers will actually end up applying for the " s " license and starting a boom of mini cars on german streets .
if nothing else , the costs might keep them from doing so : a license will set them back between € 800 and € 1,000 and mini cars come with an average price tag of € 10,000 . and when the young drivers are ready to switch to the real thing two years later , they will have to start from scratch again to get a " real " driver 's license . christiane wolters -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a little high 's ok on german highways cannabis might still be illegal in germany , but police officers have long ignored the occasional joint smoker .

the controversial vehicles are not deemed safe by everyone but eu officials required germany to allow teens to drive them anyway . unlike their contemporaries in many other countries , german teenagers have so far had to wait until turning 18 before being able to drive a car .

the so-called " s " license allows teens to drive mini cars and ride " trikes " and " quads " - motor bikes with three and four wheels .
to get licensed , applicants have to pass a written and practical exam . by introducing the " s " license , germany complied with eu demands but still sets the bar much higher than its neighboring countries .
government officials said they believed the new license represented the best possible compromise between eu and national law .

germany did have stricter rules than other union members - only people aged 18 and over who had a regular driver 's license where allowed to drive mini cars .
few dealers sold the mainly french products and they were rarely seen on german roads . eu commissioners saw this as a competitive disadvantage for mini car makers on the german market and pressured germany 's federal government to lower the age requirement to allow teens to drive before turning 18 . mathieu grosch , a belgian eu parliamentarian , said he agreed with the commission 's assessment that german law violated competition rules .

the so-called " s " license allows teens to drive mini cars and ride " trikes " and " quads " - motor bikes with three and four wheels .
to get licensed , applicants have to pass a written and practical exam . by introducing the " s " license , germany complied with eu demands but still sets the bar much higher than its neighboring countries .
government officials said they believed the new license represented the best possible compromise between eu and national law . " the only question that 's important here is : ' what kind of license do i need to safely drive such a car ' ? " said christian weibrecht , a spokesman for the german transportation ministry .

the controversial vehicles are not deemed safe by everyone but eu officials required germany to allow teens to drive them anyway . unlike their contemporaries in many other countries , german teenagers have so far had to wait until turning 18 before being able to drive a car .
that 's no longer the case as 16-year-olds can now get a driver 's license for " be up , " " albizia " or mc1 , " as some of the mini cars are called . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : minicar mc1 at first sight , the vehicles almost look like normal cars , but they only weigh around 350 kilograms -lrb- about 700 pounds -rrb- and can not go faster than 45 kilometers per hour -lrb- 28 miles per hour -rrb- . the lightweight automobiles have raised the eyebrows of car experts , who are concerned about their safety .

the " phone angel , " a long-life battery powered cell phone device , allows those in mourning to have contact with the deceased when personal pain , distance or disability prevents them from attending the final resting place . not to be confused with a seance or ouija board , the phone angel does n't promise to put you in touch with the spirit world but intends to provide comfort for those coming to terms with their loss by opening the airwaves .

thanks to two years of collaborating with an electrician , bröther has developed a battery which will allow grieving friends and family almost a year of contact . using an application that most modern mobile phones have , automatic call response , bröther 's invention allows every caller to get through .
the phone angel clicks on and allows communication as if someone on the other end had picked up the receiver .
unlike the recipient of the call , the line is very rarely dead . once the battery has run down , the temptation would be to just cut the losses and leave the device in the ground .

now , help is at hand thanks to the slightly macabre " phone angel . " a german inventor has come up with a novel way for relatives coping with the grief of losing a loved one to convey their feelings to the departed .
the " phone angel , " a long-life battery powered cell phone device , allows those in mourning to have contact with the deceased when personal pain , distance or disability prevents them from attending the final resting place . not to be confused with a seance or ouija board , the phone angel does n't promise to put you in touch with the spirit world but intends to provide comfort for those coming to terms with their loss by opening the airwaves .

croats , serbs and albanians are hacking into each others ' web sites and leaving nationalistic slogans .
on online forums , bitter political debates have been ignited . in december , albanian internet enthusiasts hacked into the kosovo-based site of the serbian orthodox church .
instead of the usual pictures of the monastery found there , the words " kosovo will gain its independence " popped up on web browsers . in response , serb hackers attacked the online offering of the albanian capital tirana and posted a stream of curses on the page .
over the past four weeks , some 100 web sites from serbia as well as about a dozen albanian ones were illegally altered . virtual attacks the trigger for these virtual attacks between serbs and croats in the second part of december was an incident in which a nationally minded serb basketball player was refused entry to croatia .
croatian hackers let their dissatisfaction over the athlete 's political stance be widely known by launching a virtual attack on the homepage of serbia 's largest private broadcaster , " pink . "
the hackers posted the words " greetings to greater serbia " on the site , accompanied by the croatian flag and emblem . that did n't please serbian hackers and they in turn gained access to the official site of the croatian world ski champion janica kostelic , leaving their own message of " greetings to croatia " behind , along with photographs of the serbian national team .
in the following two weeks , more than 80 croatian and serbian web sites were manipulated , with each side posting more and less explicit nationalistic slogans on " enemy " sites . why and to what end ? the offenders from both countries told media outlets that there were n't any nationalistic motives behind their actions , but that they simply wanted to draw attention to their hacking abilities .
" it does n't matter to me whether i hack into a serbian , croatian , albanian or whatever kind of site , " one notorious serbian hacker who calls himself " acid cookie " said in a radio interview . another one , who goes under the code name " dtm , " explains that he was only interested in pointing out the security lapses in online networks in the balkans .
he said it " is a lot of fun when you can publish your own opinion on a site that has a million visitors a day . " crossing borders but an exchange of opinion between the two peoples of the former yugoslavia , who within the last decade and a half were engaged in a bloody civil war , can take forms besides illegal web site changes .

but they are n't without risks . " i think that these forums present ways to inform political opinions , " he said .
" but when they are too general , they do n't have a great deal of influence , because they are n't specific enough . " cross-border internet contacts between young computer users in the region also often serve as substitutes for real-time travel .
almost 10 years after the balkans war , tourists from serbia are seldom seen on the croatian coast , just as one would be hard to find a croat in belgrade .
but the brisk reporting in the region from several countries on the internet means that many there have already formed a mental picture of their neighbors . " i can well imagine that such forums can actually bring people closer together , " said graf .

during the nato bombing campaign against serbia in spring 1999 , the central computers of the allied forces and the pentagon were attacked and anti-war messages were posted on many web sites . however , in the balkans , it is illegal to manipulate web sites belonging to other people or organizations .

but this week the show , with its people-next-door characters , aired its 1,000th episode . many of them are n't all that sexy , hardly any are rich , and they 're usually never confronted with amnesia , alien abductions , evil twins or any of the other outlandish situations that have become part and parcel of many of the world 's serial dramas . instead , up and down lindenstrasse , the fictional street in a munich suburb where the series of the same name is set , fairly ordinary people meet the triumphs and tragedies that many experience in real life : infidelity , failing marriages , first love , parental disapproval , new careers or youth violence .
the characters are like the neighbors next door and the german public has been tuning in faithfully to find out where their on-screen lives are taking them for 20 years or 1,000 episodes . for many germans , sunday evening from 6:40 to 7:10 p.m. is " lindenstrasse " time , and woe to the person who calls or shows up unannounced at the door of a fan during that period . borrowed from the brits the show 's premise was borrowed from the bbc 's " coronation street , " britain 's longest-running television soap opera , which is set in a gritty industrial suburb of manchester .
the " lindenstrasse " crowd has less coal dust to contend with , but like their british cousins , the characters on the outskirts of munich are overwhelmingly midway or slightly lower on the socio-economic scale .
instead of super models , oil barons or jet-setting cosmetic company heads , the folks who live or work on lindenstrasse are housewives , taxi drivers , travel agents or hair stylists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lindenstrasse street sign the concerns of the beimer , kling , zenker or sarikaki families are generally the concerns of average people .
they complain about high taxes , unemployment or like to share the latest gossip about the super 's wife .
frau beimer 's husband has left her for a younger woman .
a greek family is thrown into turmoil when the oldest son wants to marry a german woman . controversial issues but lindenstrasse has not been afraid to tackle more controversial issues and has been on the forefront regarding several topics other shows have been reluctant to touch .
the daughter of one of the central families once suffered from bulimia ; another son was born with down 's syndrome . an hiv-positive woman passed on the virus to her son and a gay couple took care of the boy after his mother 's death from the disease .
lesbian storylines have been running for years and , in 1990 , the show featured the first gay kiss on german primetime tv . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actress marie-luise marjan and hans w. geißendörfer , the series producer the characters ' responses to many controversial issues have led some to complain that the creator and producer of the show , hans geissendörfer -lrb- photo -rrb- , uses the show to present his own left-of-center political opinions .
critics say other views are represented as being odd or out of touch with the times .
that , they say , is problematic since the show airs on german public broadcasting and , due to its station 's charter , has a duty to remain politically neutral . millions watch every week for the 1,000th episode , more than seven million tuned in for a special 45-minute broadcast .
while " lindenstrasse " has lost some its audience to " younger " shows with a strong teen element , such as " good times and bad " and " forbidden love , " the show still attracts on average 4.8 million viewers on sunday evenings . its current contract with west german broadcasting , which produces the show in a suburb of cologne , runs through 2008 and fans are guaranteed at least another 219 episodes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : annemarie wendl as else kling what fans wo n't be seeing much more of is likely germany 's most famous concierge , else kling , who has been a feature on the show since the beginning .
annemarie wendl , the 90-year-old actress who has played the part for 20 years , says she will step down sometime in 2005 .
but she does n't want to die peacefully in her sleep surrounded by loved ones and flowers .
" i want to be murdered , not have some boring death in bed , " she told germany 's bild am sonntag newspaper .

croats , serbs and albanians are hacking into each others ' web sites and leaving nationalistic slogans .
on online forums , bitter political debates have been ignited . in december , albanian internet enthusiasts hacked into the kosovo-based site of the serbian orthodox church .
instead of the usual pictures of the monastery found there , the words " kosovo will gain its independence " popped up on web browsers . in response , serb hackers attacked the online offering of the albanian capital tirana and posted a stream of curses on the page .
over the past four weeks , some 100 web sites from serbia as well as about a dozen albanian ones were illegally altered . virtual attacks the trigger for these virtual attacks between serbs and croats in the second part of december was an incident in which a nationally minded serb basketball player was refused entry to croatia .
croatian hackers let their dissatisfaction over the athlete 's political stance be widely known by launching a virtual attack on the homepage of serbia 's largest private broadcaster , " pink . "
the hackers posted the words " greetings to greater serbia " on the site , accompanied by the croatian flag and emblem . that did n't please serbian hackers and they in turn gained access to the official site of the croatian world ski champion janica kostelic , leaving their own message of " greetings to croatia " behind , along with photographs of the serbian national team .
in the following two weeks , more than 80 croatian and serbian web sites were manipulated , with each side posting more and less explicit nationalistic slogans on " enemy " sites . why and to what end ? the offenders from both countries told media outlets that there were n't any nationalistic motives behind their actions , but that they simply wanted to draw attention to their hacking abilities .
" it does n't matter to me whether i hack into a serbian , croatian , albanian or whatever kind of site , " one notorious serbian hacker who calls himself " acid cookie " said in a radio interview . another one , who goes under the code name " dtm , " explains that he was only interested in pointing out the security lapses in online networks in the balkans .

almost 10 years after the balkans war , tourists from serbia are seldom seen on the croatian coast , just as one would be hard to find a croat in belgrade .

but this week the show , with its people-next-door characters , aired its 1,000th episode . many of them are n't all that sexy , hardly any are rich , and they 're usually never confronted with amnesia , alien abductions , evil twins or any of the other outlandish situations that have become part and parcel of many of the world 's serial dramas . instead , up and down lindenstrasse , the fictional street in a munich suburb where the series of the same name is set , fairly ordinary people meet the triumphs and tragedies that many experience in real life : infidelity , failing marriages , first love , parental disapproval , new careers or youth violence .
the characters are like the neighbors next door and the german public has been tuning in faithfully to find out where their on-screen lives are taking them for 20 years or 1,000 episodes . for many germans , sunday evening from 6:40 to 7:10 p.m. is " lindenstrasse " time , and woe to the person who calls or shows up unannounced at the door of a fan during that period . borrowed from the brits the show 's premise was borrowed from the bbc 's " coronation street , " britain 's longest-running television soap opera , which is set in a gritty industrial suburb of manchester .
the " lindenstrasse " crowd has less coal dust to contend with , but like their british cousins , the characters on the outskirts of munich are overwhelmingly midway or slightly lower on the socio-economic scale .
instead of super models , oil barons or jet-setting cosmetic company heads , the folks who live or work on lindenstrasse are housewives , taxi drivers , travel agents or hair stylists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lindenstrasse street sign the concerns of the beimer , kling , zenker or sarikaki families are generally the concerns of average people .
they complain about high taxes , unemployment or like to share the latest gossip about the super 's wife .
frau beimer 's husband has left her for a younger woman .
a greek family is thrown into turmoil when the oldest son wants to marry a german woman . controversial issues but lindenstrasse has not been afraid to tackle more controversial issues and has been on the forefront regarding several topics other shows have been reluctant to touch .
the daughter of one of the central families once suffered from bulimia ; another son was born with down 's syndrome . an hiv-positive woman passed on the virus to her son and a gay couple took care of the boy after his mother 's death from the disease .
lesbian storylines have been running for years and , in 1990 , the show featured the first gay kiss on german primetime tv . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actress marie-luise marjan and hans w. geißendörfer , the series producer the characters ' responses to many controversial issues have led some to complain that the creator and producer of the show , hans geissendörfer -lrb- photo -rrb- , uses the show to present his own left-of-center political opinions .
critics say other views are represented as being odd or out of touch with the times .
that , they say , is problematic since the show airs on german public broadcasting and , due to its station 's charter , has a duty to remain politically neutral . millions watch every week for the 1,000th episode , more than seven million tuned in for a special 45-minute broadcast .
while " lindenstrasse " has lost some its audience to " younger " shows with a strong teen element , such as " good times and bad " and " forbidden love , " the show still attracts on average 4.8 million viewers on sunday evenings . its current contract with west german broadcasting , which produces the show in a suburb of cologne , runs through 2008 and fans are guaranteed at least another 219 episodes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : annemarie wendl as else kling what fans wo n't be seeing much more of is likely germany 's most famous concierge , else kling , who has been a feature on the show since the beginning .
annemarie wendl , the 90-year-old actress who has played the part for 20 years , says she will step down sometime in 2005 .
but she does n't want to die peacefully in her sleep surrounded by loved ones and flowers .
" i want to be murdered , not have some boring death in bed , " she told germany 's bild am sonntag newspaper .

27 german president host köhler on tuesday began an official four-day state visit to israel .
the highlight of his visit will a be a controversial speech before the israeli parliament on wednesday . köhler , the former head of the international monetary fund , has made a name for himself as a man who hates small talk and likes to get down to business right away .
his talks with high-ranking israeli leaders later on tuesdy will provide him with another opportunity to do just that . but for several reasons , the visit is anything but a routine job for germany 's president , said manfred lahnstein , the head of the hamburg-based german-israeli society . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we have encouraging developments in the middle east and that is a good background for the visit , " lahnstein said , adding that it marks the 40th anniversary of diplomatic relations between germany and israel .
" we have had the celebrations marking the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the auschwitz annihilation camp .
so you have our ongoing historic responsibility , the fostering and strengthening of excellent albeit not normal relations between the two countries and some political processes , which look promising . " german speech sparks protests on wednesday , köhler is due to deliver a speech on german-israeli relations before parliament , the knesset .
his plan to hold his speech in german has already provoked protests among a small number of israeli deputies who are poised to leave the hall when köhler starts his speech . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knesset in jerusalem israel ’ s minister of health dani naveh said he plans to boycott president köhler ’ s speech .
he told the right-wing israeli daily newspaper maariv that as long as holocaust survivors are still alive , german should not be spoken in israel 's parliament . his comment echoed the feelings of a number of parliamentary deputies .
the acting president of the knesset , hemi doron , said he would ask his superiors either to cancel the speech or to ask köhler to hold it in english .
doron , whose grandfather was killed in the holocaust , said his feet had never touched german soil and he never bought german products .
so he could not allow the german language to be spoken in the jewish people ’ s house of parliament . " a normal procedure " but lahnstein said köhler 's decision to speak in german was nothing unusual nor unprecendented . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former president johannes rau -lrb- right -rrb- and his israeli counterpart , moshe katzav -lrb- left -rrb- in germany in 2002 .
" that is a normal procedure that a president of a country who visits the parliament of another country and delivers a speech does so in his own tongue , " he said , adding that former german president johannes rau -lrb- photo -rrb- was the first to do so five years ago .
" on the other hand we have to understand that there are some members of the knesset , which for very personal reasons can not live with it and they will leave the hall of the knesset .
this happened five years ago as well and we have to understand it , and the rest should be dignity on both sides and it will be dignity on both sides . " some jewish public figures have spoken out in favor of köhler using his native german .
knesset speaker reuven rivlin , who was instrumental in the decision to allow the visiting president to deliver his speech in german , insisted it would be better not to extend an invitation than to demand that the guest speak in a different language .
and israel ’ s former ambassador to germany , avi primor -lrb- photo below -rrb- , also said he thinks there is no reason why köhler should not speak in german . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : avi primor " first of all , the relations between israel and germany are such that this kind of a question should n't arise at all , " he said .
" and secondly , the german language is not only the language of the nazis , but was a very important language before the nazis and is a very important language after the nazis .
it was a very important language for the jewish people . " german far-right overshadows visit but political observers in germany are also afraid that köhler ’ s trip to israel may be overshadowed by a recent scandal surrounding the far-right national party -lrb- npd -rrb- in saxony ’ s regional assembly .
npd leaders there had likened the end-of-wwii allied bombings on german towns to the holocaust , giving rise to a fresh debate about anti-semitism in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a yellow star of david that jews were forced to wear by the nazis is on display at yad vashem manfred lahnstein said the german president will have no way of dodging the issue , but is confident that the incident will not mar köhler ’ s talks with israeli leaders . during his trip , the german president will also take out time to visit the yad vashem holocaust memorial where he ’ s due to honor the six million jews murdered by the nazis . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de remembering germany 's darkest place commemorative events marking the 60th anniversary of the liberation of auschwitz continued throughout thursday as world leaders spoke of an evil that must never be allowed to surface again .

revelations on monday named players accused of receiving cash incentives in disputed games . the corruption scandal engulfing german soccer shows no sign of dying down with the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- investigation claiming another scalp on monday . it has been revealed that the sc paderborn captain , thijs waterink , received € 10,000 -lrb- $ 13,000 -rrb- from an anonymous backer as an incentive to defeat hamburg in the german cup tie , one of the four matches shamed referee robert hoyzer has since admitted to manipulating for a € 70,000 purse " i did not know before the game that the players would be receiving this bonus , " paderborn president wilfried finke told the n24 television channel .
" a man from southern europe phoned team captain waterink and said , ' there is € 10,000 as a team bonus if you win against hamburg .
if you do not , we want the money back . " ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : referee robert hoyzer during hamburg-paderborn game paderborn won the game 4-2 after hoyzer awarded two controversial penalty kicks and sent off hamburg 's belgian international emile mpenza .
dutchman waterink split the unrecorded bonus among his victorious team-mates . he has since been suspended as part of the escalating investigation which has already seen the end of hoyzer 's career while four men were arrested last week and three have been charged with fraud in connection with the case . fears of a scandal to rival 1971 the widening scandal has ominous similarities to the one that plunged german soccer into its darkest hour 34 years ago .
match-fixing and bribes engulfed the bundesliga in 1971 when more than 50 players , a number of coaches and officials plus the clubs arminia bielefeld and kickers offenbach were found guilty of offering bribes and fixing bundesliga games , prompting the dfb to dish out hefty fines and suspensions . revelations of coercion between parties will no doubt bring the nightmares back for the dfb - and it is likely to get worse .
the news that both paderborn and hoyzer were directly involved has caused a further shock and finke claims it is highly likely that hamburg also have a role to play . hamburg players suspected of complicity " this is just the tip of the iceberg , " explained finke .
" since the referee and paderborn players are involved i would also suggest that the hamburg players are looked at too .
to ensure a bet comes off you need all three parties involved - the winners , the losers and the referee . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg sv hamburg are furious at the implication and club president bernd hoffmann admitted legal action was being considered .
" the comments are a disgrace , " raged hoffmann .
" we will speak with our lawyer about these claims and think about taking legal action . " hertha berlin are another bundesliga side implicated in the scandal with three of their players - alexander madlung , nando rafael and josip simunic - named in connection with a second round cup match between hertha and eintracht braunschweig on sept .
22 of last year . regional side braunschweig won 3-2 with defender madlung scoring an own goal in the 80th minute to seal hertha 's defeat .
the capital club have denied that their players were involved and the trio have pleaded their innocence . more clubs and players to be probed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dfb investigation hopes to move swiftly to close the case .
two other lower division clubs dresden and chemnitz have also been mentioned in connection with match-fixing while referee jurgen jansen is also being investigated after he was named by hoyzer . jansen was due to referee werder bremen 's match against hansa rostock on sunday but the dfb chose to remove him before kick-off .
the dfb described jansen 's removal as a " purely precautionary measure , " saying he was n't suspected of fixing matches .
jansen gave a sworn statement on monday denying any connection to the affair . meanwhile , bookmaker oddset has accused the dfb of failing to heed a tip-off they gave on august 23 of last year in regard to the hamburg-paderborn game .
oddset maintained they sent a fax to the dfb 48 hours after the cup match but dfb president gerhard mayer-vorfelder denied the bookmaker 's claim . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : a shadow over german soccer german soccer has struggled recently .

but this week the show , with its people-next-door characters , aired its 1,000th episode . many of them are n't all that sexy , hardly any are rich , and they 're usually never confronted with amnesia , alien abductions , evil twins or any of the other outlandish situations that have become part and parcel of many of the world 's serial dramas . instead , up and down lindenstrasse , the fictional street in a munich suburb where the series of the same name is set , fairly ordinary people meet the triumphs and tragedies that many experience in real life : infidelity , failing marriages , first love , parental disapproval , new careers or youth violence .
the characters are like the neighbors next door and the german public has been tuning in faithfully to find out where their on-screen lives are taking them for 20 years or 1,000 episodes . for many germans , sunday evening from 6:40 to 7:10 p.m. is " lindenstrasse " time , and woe to the person who calls or shows up unannounced at the door of a fan during that period . borrowed from the brits the show 's premise was borrowed from the bbc 's " coronation street , " britain 's longest-running television soap opera , which is set in a gritty industrial suburb of manchester .
the " lindenstrasse " crowd has less coal dust to contend with , but like their british cousins , the characters on the outskirts of munich are overwhelmingly midway or slightly lower on the socio-economic scale .
instead of super models , oil barons or jet-setting cosmetic company heads , the folks who live or work on lindenstrasse are housewives , taxi drivers , travel agents or hair stylists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lindenstrasse street sign the concerns of the beimer , kling , zenker or sarikaki families are generally the concerns of average people .
they complain about high taxes , unemployment or like to share the latest gossip about the super 's wife .
frau beimer 's husband has left her for a younger woman .
a greek family is thrown into turmoil when the oldest son wants to marry a german woman . controversial issues but lindenstrasse has not been afraid to tackle more controversial issues and has been on the forefront regarding several topics other shows have been reluctant to touch .
the daughter of one of the central families once suffered from bulimia ; another son was born with down 's syndrome . an hiv-positive woman passed on the virus to her son and a gay couple took care of the boy after his mother 's death from the disease .
lesbian storylines have been running for years and , in 1990 , the show featured the first gay kiss on german primetime tv . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actress marie-luise marjan and hans w. geißendörfer , the series producer the characters ' responses to many controversial issues have led some to complain that the creator and producer of the show , hans geissendörfer -lrb- photo -rrb- , uses the show to present his own left-of-center political opinions .
critics say other views are represented as being odd or out of touch with the times .
that , they say , is problematic since the show airs on german public broadcasting and , due to its station 's charter , has a duty to remain politically neutral . millions watch every week for the 1,000th episode , more than seven million tuned in for a special 45-minute broadcast .
while " lindenstrasse " has lost some its audience to " younger " shows with a strong teen element , such as " good times and bad " and " forbidden love , " the show still attracts on average 4.8 million viewers on sunday evenings . its current contract with west german broadcasting , which produces the show in a suburb of cologne , runs through 2008 and fans are guaranteed at least another 219 episodes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : annemarie wendl as else kling what fans wo n't be seeing much more of is likely germany 's most famous concierge , else kling , who has been a feature on the show since the beginning .
annemarie wendl , the 90-year-old actress who has played the part for 20 years , says she will step down sometime in 2005 .
but she does n't want to die peacefully in her sleep surrounded by loved ones and flowers .
" i want to be murdered , not have some boring death in bed , " she told germany 's bild am sonntag newspaper .

the controversial vehicles are not deemed safe by everyone but eu officials required germany to allow teens to drive them anyway . unlike their contemporaries in many other countries , german teenagers have so far had to wait until turning 18 before being able to drive a car .

" the drivers ' crumple zone is pretty much his own body , " saalmann added , saying that the risk of injury was extremely high and that during the test , major parts broke and the transmission was pushed inside the car .
apart from security problems with the vehicle , saalmann also said mini cars posed a risk on streets as they slow down traffic . " they can drive on countryside highways , leading to congestion , accidents and risky overtake maneuvers , " he said . eu pushes for teen license bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mini cars are also more common on japanese streets but eu competition regulations brought about the driver 's licenses for 16-year-olds .
germany did have stricter rules than other union members - only people aged 18 and over who had a regular driver 's license where allowed to drive mini cars .
few dealers sold the mainly french products and they were rarely seen on german roads . eu commissioners saw this as a competitive disadvantage for mini car makers on the german market and pressured germany 's federal government to lower the age requirement to allow teens to drive before turning 18 . mathieu grosch , a belgian eu parliamentarian , said he agreed with the commission 's assessment that german law violated competition rules .

the so-called " s " license allows teens to drive mini cars and ride " trikes " and " quads " - motor bikes with three and four wheels .
to get licensed , applicants have to pass a written and practical exam . by introducing the " s " license , germany complied with eu demands but still sets the bar much higher than its neighboring countries .
government officials said they believed the new license represented the best possible compromise between eu and national law .

it 's important to remember that these vehicles have been legal in other eu countries for years and that according to eu law , we can not prevent that they are sold and driven in germany .

the controversial vehicles are not deemed safe by everyone but eu officials required germany to allow teens to drive them anyway . unlike their contemporaries in many other countries , german teenagers have so far had to wait until turning 18 before being able to drive a car .
that 's no longer the case as 16-year-olds can now get a driver 's license for " be up , " " albizia " or mc1 , " as some of the mini cars are called . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : minicar mc1 at first sight , the vehicles almost look like normal cars , but they only weigh around 350 kilograms -lrb- about 700 pounds -rrb- and can not go faster than 45 kilometers per hour -lrb- 28 miles per hour -rrb- . the lightweight automobiles have raised the eyebrows of car experts , who are concerned about their safety . " these cars do n't offer any active or passive security measures for the driver , " said otto saalmann of germany 's largest automobile club , adac , which has conducted a crash test with a mini car . " the drivers ' crumple zone is pretty much his own body , " saalmann added , saying that the risk of injury was extremely high and that during the test , major parts broke and the transmission was pushed inside the car .
apart from security problems with the vehicle , saalmann also said mini cars posed a risk on streets as they slow down traffic . " they can drive on countryside highways , leading to congestion , accidents and risky overtake maneuvers , " he said . eu pushes for teen license bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mini cars are also more common on japanese streets but eu competition regulations brought about the driver 's licenses for 16-year-olds .
germany did have stricter rules than other union members - only people aged 18 and over who had a regular driver 's license where allowed to drive mini cars .
few dealers sold the mainly french products and they were rarely seen on german roads . eu commissioners saw this as a competitive disadvantage for mini car makers on the german market and pressured germany 's federal government to lower the age requirement to allow teens to drive before turning 18 . mathieu grosch , a belgian eu parliamentarian , said he agreed with the commission 's assessment that german law violated competition rules .

the so-called " s " license allows teens to drive mini cars and ride " trikes " and " quads " - motor bikes with three and four wheels .
to get licensed , applicants have to pass a written and practical exam . by introducing the " s " license , germany complied with eu demands but still sets the bar much higher than its neighboring countries .
government officials said they believed the new license represented the best possible compromise between eu and national law .

the controversial vehicles are not deemed safe by everyone but eu officials required germany to allow teens to drive them anyway . unlike their contemporaries in many other countries , german teenagers have so far had to wait until turning 18 before being able to drive a car .
that 's no longer the case as 16-year-olds can now get a driver 's license for " be up , " " albizia " or mc1 , " as some of the mini cars are called . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : minicar mc1 at first sight , the vehicles almost look like normal cars , but they only weigh around 350 kilograms -lrb- about 700 pounds -rrb- and can not go faster than 45 kilometers per hour -lrb- 28 miles per hour -rrb- . the lightweight automobiles have raised the eyebrows of car experts , who are concerned about their safety . " these cars do n't offer any active or passive security measures for the driver , " said otto saalmann of germany 's largest automobile club , adac , which has conducted a crash test with a mini car . " the drivers ' crumple zone is pretty much his own body , " saalmann added , saying that the risk of injury was extremely high and that during the test , major parts broke and the transmission was pushed inside the car .
apart from security problems with the vehicle , saalmann also said mini cars posed a risk on streets as they slow down traffic . " they can drive on countryside highways , leading to congestion , accidents and risky overtake maneuvers , " he said . eu pushes for teen license bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mini cars are also more common on japanese streets but eu competition regulations brought about the driver 's licenses for 16-year-olds .
germany did have stricter rules than other union members - only people aged 18 and over who had a regular driver 's license where allowed to drive mini cars .
few dealers sold the mainly french products and they were rarely seen on german roads . eu commissioners saw this as a competitive disadvantage for mini car makers on the german market and pressured germany 's federal government to lower the age requirement to allow teens to drive before turning 18 . mathieu grosch , a belgian eu parliamentarian , said he agreed with the commission 's assessment that german law violated competition rules . " clearly there are market tendencies where some people say that they do n't want to sell this product in favor of another , " he said .
" but that 's a form of protectionism which can not be tolerated . " german compromise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the model of a " quad " bike on a german driver 's license as a compromise , germany decided to introduce a new class of driver 's licences that can be obtained at 16 years of age .
the so-called " s " license allows teens to drive mini cars and ride " trikes " and " quads " - motor bikes with three and four wheels .
to get licensed , applicants have to pass a written and practical exam . by introducing the " s " license , germany complied with eu demands but still sets the bar much higher than its neighboring countries .
government officials said they believed the new license represented the best possible compromise between eu and national law . " the only question that 's important here is : ' what kind of license do i need to safely drive such a car ' ? " said christian weibrecht , a spokesman for the german transportation ministry .
" the question is n't whether such cars are safe or not .
it 's important to remember that these vehicles have been legal in other eu countries for years and that according to eu law , we can not prevent that they are sold and driven in germany . " experts are not waiting to see whether teenagers will actually end up applying for the " s " license and starting a boom of mini cars on german streets .
if nothing else , the costs might keep them from doing so : a license will set them back between € 800 and € 1,000 and mini cars come with an average price tag of € 10,000 . and when the young drivers are ready to switch to the real thing two years later , they will have to start from scratch again to get a " real " driver 's license . christiane wolters -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a little high 's ok on german highways cannabis might still be illegal in germany , but police officers have long ignored the occasional joint smoker .

now , help is at hand thanks to the slightly macabre " phone angel . " a german inventor has come up with a novel way for relatives coping with the grief of losing a loved one to convey their feelings to the departed .
the " phone angel , " a long-life battery powered cell phone device , allows those in mourning to have contact with the deceased when personal pain , distance or disability prevents them from attending the final resting place . not to be confused with a seance or ouija board , the phone angel does n't promise to put you in touch with the spirit world but intends to provide comfort for those coming to terms with their loss by opening the airwaves .

the phone angel clicks on and allows communication as if someone on the other end had picked up the receiver .
unlike the recipient of the call , the line is very rarely dead . once the battery has run down , the temptation would be to just cut the losses and leave the device in the ground .

now , help is at hand thanks to the slightly macabre " phone angel . " a german inventor has come up with a novel way for relatives coping with the grief of losing a loved one to convey their feelings to the departed .
the " phone angel , " a long-life battery powered cell phone device , allows those in mourning to have contact with the deceased when personal pain , distance or disability prevents them from attending the final resting place . not to be confused with a seance or ouija board , the phone angel does n't promise to put you in touch with the spirit world but intends to provide comfort for those coming to terms with their loss by opening the airwaves .

" people who are ill , have no time or live too far away to visit the deceased in their grave can now call , " said bröther in an interview with the associated press .
the inventor added that the thought came to him when his mother showed an unwillingness to attend a relative 's grave but would have liked to keep in touch with the person laid to rest there . long life battery keeps the airwaves open the device - consisting of a cell phone , a super strength battery and a small loudspeaker - comes in a waterproof container the size of an average shoe box which is placed in the earth about 30 centimeters -lrb- 11.8 inches -rrb- above the grave .
thanks to two years of collaborating with an electrician , bröther has developed a battery which will allow grieving friends and family almost a year of contact . using an application that most modern mobile phones have , automatic call response , bröther 's invention allows every caller to get through .
the phone angel clicks on and allows communication as if someone on the other end had picked up the receiver .
unlike the recipient of the call , the line is very rarely dead . once the battery has run down , the temptation would be to just cut the losses and leave the device in the ground .
but bröther has thought of that .

the brewery , located in the neukölln district in the southwest of the german capital , is closing its doors after more than 130 years in business .
a spokesman for the company said dr oetker was planning to transfer production of berliner kindl to another of its breweries in the city .
it is also closing a brewery in dortmund , western germany .
the move is aimed at helping dr oetker cut up to 450 jobs as beer consumption in germany declines , the company said .
according to the federal statistics office , beer sales in germany continued to decline last year , consolidating a trend that has surfaced over the last decade . once dubbed " the champagne of the north , " berliner kindl is now a beverage of preference among construction workers .
the beer has been described by one connoisseur as having a " citrusy nose " and being slightly " skunky . " dw-world.de german beer at the world cup ?

germans revere soccer almost as much as they do their beer , so fans of both found it hard to swallow the news that only american beer would be sold in stadiums when germany hosts the world cup .

the brewery , located in the neukölln district in the southwest of the german capital , is closing its doors after more than 130 years in business .
a spokesman for the company said dr oetker was planning to transfer production of berliner kindl to another of its breweries in the city .
it is also closing a brewery in dortmund , western germany .
the move is aimed at helping dr oetker cut up to 450 jobs as beer consumption in germany declines , the company said .
according to the federal statistics office , beer sales in germany continued to decline last year , consolidating a trend that has surfaced over the last decade . once dubbed " the champagne of the north , " berliner kindl is now a beverage of preference among construction workers .
the beer has been described by one connoisseur as having a " citrusy nose " and being slightly " skunky . " dw-world.de german beer at the world cup ?
ja , bitte !
germans revere soccer almost as much as they do their beer , so fans of both found it hard to swallow the news that only american beer would be sold in stadiums when germany hosts the world cup .

his talks with high-ranking israeli leaders later on tuesdy will provide him with another opportunity to do just that . but for several reasons , the visit is anything but a routine job for germany 's president , said manfred lahnstein , the head of the hamburg-based german-israeli society . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we have encouraging developments in the middle east and that is a good background for the visit , " lahnstein said , adding that it marks the 40th anniversary of diplomatic relations between germany and israel .
" we have had the celebrations marking the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the auschwitz annihilation camp .
so you have our ongoing historic responsibility , the fostering and strengthening of excellent albeit not normal relations between the two countries and some political processes , which look promising . " german speech sparks protests on wednesday , köhler is due to deliver a speech on german-israeli relations before parliament , the knesset .
his plan to hold his speech in german has already provoked protests among a small number of israeli deputies who are poised to leave the hall when köhler starts his speech . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knesset in jerusalem israel ’ s minister of health dani naveh said he plans to boycott president köhler ’ s speech .
he told the right-wing israeli daily newspaper maariv that as long as holocaust survivors are still alive , german should not be spoken in israel 's parliament . his comment echoed the feelings of a number of parliamentary deputies .
the acting president of the knesset , hemi doron , said he would ask his superiors either to cancel the speech or to ask köhler to hold it in english .
doron , whose grandfather was killed in the holocaust , said his feet had never touched german soil and he never bought german products .
so he could not allow the german language to be spoken in the jewish people ’ s house of parliament . " a normal procedure " but lahnstein said köhler 's decision to speak in german was nothing unusual nor unprecendented . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former president johannes rau -lrb- right -rrb- and his israeli counterpart , moshe katzav -lrb- left -rrb- in germany in 2002 .

" on the other hand we have to understand that there are some members of the knesset , which for very personal reasons can not live with it and they will leave the hall of the knesset .
this happened five years ago as well and we have to understand it , and the rest should be dignity on both sides and it will be dignity on both sides . " some jewish public figures have spoken out in favor of köhler using his native german .
knesset speaker reuven rivlin , who was instrumental in the decision to allow the visiting president to deliver his speech in german , insisted it would be better not to extend an invitation than to demand that the guest speak in a different language .
and israel ’ s former ambassador to germany , avi primor -lrb- photo below -rrb- , also said he thinks there is no reason why köhler should not speak in german . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : avi primor " first of all , the relations between israel and germany are such that this kind of a question should n't arise at all , " he said .

27 german president host köhler on tuesday began an official four-day state visit to israel .
the highlight of his visit will a be a controversial speech before the israeli parliament on wednesday . köhler , the former head of the international monetary fund , has made a name for himself as a man who hates small talk and likes to get down to business right away .
his talks with high-ranking israeli leaders later on tuesdy will provide him with another opportunity to do just that . but for several reasons , the visit is anything but a routine job for germany 's president , said manfred lahnstein , the head of the hamburg-based german-israeli society . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we have encouraging developments in the middle east and that is a good background for the visit , " lahnstein said , adding that it marks the 40th anniversary of diplomatic relations between germany and israel .

" german speech sparks protests on wednesday , köhler is due to deliver a speech on german-israeli relations before parliament , the knesset .

the acting president of the knesset , hemi doron , said he would ask his superiors either to cancel the speech or to ask köhler to hold it in english .
doron , whose grandfather was killed in the holocaust , said his feet had never touched german soil and he never bought german products .

knesset speaker reuven rivlin , who was instrumental in the decision to allow the visiting president to deliver his speech in german , insisted it would be better not to extend an invitation than to demand that the guest speak in a different language .

27 german president host köhler on tuesday began an official four-day state visit to israel .
the highlight of his visit will a be a controversial speech before the israeli parliament on wednesday . köhler , the former head of the international monetary fund , has made a name for himself as a man who hates small talk and likes to get down to business right away .
his talks with high-ranking israeli leaders later on tuesdy will provide him with another opportunity to do just that . but for several reasons , the visit is anything but a routine job for germany 's president , said manfred lahnstein , the head of the hamburg-based german-israeli society . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we have encouraging developments in the middle east and that is a good background for the visit , " lahnstein said , adding that it marks the 40th anniversary of diplomatic relations between germany and israel .
" we have had the celebrations marking the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the auschwitz annihilation camp .
so you have our ongoing historic responsibility , the fostering and strengthening of excellent albeit not normal relations between the two countries and some political processes , which look promising . " german speech sparks protests on wednesday , köhler is due to deliver a speech on german-israeli relations before parliament , the knesset .
his plan to hold his speech in german has already provoked protests among a small number of israeli deputies who are poised to leave the hall when köhler starts his speech . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knesset in jerusalem israel ’ s minister of health dani naveh said he plans to boycott president köhler ’ s speech .
he told the right-wing israeli daily newspaper maariv that as long as holocaust survivors are still alive , german should not be spoken in israel 's parliament . his comment echoed the feelings of a number of parliamentary deputies .
the acting president of the knesset , hemi doron , said he would ask his superiors either to cancel the speech or to ask köhler to hold it in english .
doron , whose grandfather was killed in the holocaust , said his feet had never touched german soil and he never bought german products .
so he could not allow the german language to be spoken in the jewish people ’ s house of parliament . " a normal procedure " but lahnstein said köhler 's decision to speak in german was nothing unusual nor unprecendented . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former president johannes rau -lrb- right -rrb- and his israeli counterpart , moshe katzav -lrb- left -rrb- in germany in 2002 .
" that is a normal procedure that a president of a country who visits the parliament of another country and delivers a speech does so in his own tongue , " he said , adding that former german president johannes rau -lrb- photo -rrb- was the first to do so five years ago .
" on the other hand we have to understand that there are some members of the knesset , which for very personal reasons can not live with it and they will leave the hall of the knesset .
this happened five years ago as well and we have to understand it , and the rest should be dignity on both sides and it will be dignity on both sides . " some jewish public figures have spoken out in favor of köhler using his native german .
knesset speaker reuven rivlin , who was instrumental in the decision to allow the visiting president to deliver his speech in german , insisted it would be better not to extend an invitation than to demand that the guest speak in a different language .
and israel ’ s former ambassador to germany , avi primor -lrb- photo below -rrb- , also said he thinks there is no reason why köhler should not speak in german . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : avi primor " first of all , the relations between israel and germany are such that this kind of a question should n't arise at all , " he said .
" and secondly , the german language is not only the language of the nazis , but was a very important language before the nazis and is a very important language after the nazis .
it was a very important language for the jewish people . " german far-right overshadows visit but political observers in germany are also afraid that köhler ’ s trip to israel may be overshadowed by a recent scandal surrounding the far-right national party -lrb- npd -rrb- in saxony ’ s regional assembly .
npd leaders there had likened the end-of-wwii allied bombings on german towns to the holocaust , giving rise to a fresh debate about anti-semitism in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a yellow star of david that jews were forced to wear by the nazis is on display at yad vashem manfred lahnstein said the german president will have no way of dodging the issue , but is confident that the incident will not mar köhler ’ s talks with israeli leaders . during his trip , the german president will also take out time to visit the yad vashem holocaust memorial where he ’ s due to honor the six million jews murdered by the nazis . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de remembering germany 's darkest place commemorative events marking the 60th anniversary of the liberation of auschwitz continued throughout thursday as world leaders spoke of an evil that must never be allowed to surface again .

the group which employs nearly 10,000 people , had presented its 27 creditor banks with a new restructuring plan last month , which entailed € 150 million -lrb- $ 196 million -rrb- in divestments and stringent cost-cutting of up to € 60 million per year .
in return , the building company hoped to convince all of its creditor banks to extend a € 200 million credit line and a € 1.5 billion loan guarantee .
but while the majority of the banks creditors had supported the restructuring plans , some thought the restructuring did not go far enough and demanded additional belt-tightening . dw-world.de german workers fill french building gaps it 's not just science and technology specialists who leave germany for better jobs .
construction workers , too , have a good prospects abroad .
in france , for example , experience counts more than age .

now , help is at hand thanks to the slightly macabre " phone angel . " a german inventor has come up with a novel way for relatives coping with the grief of losing a loved one to convey their feelings to the departed .
the " phone angel , " a long-life battery powered cell phone device , allows those in mourning to have contact with the deceased when personal pain , distance or disability prevents them from attending the final resting place . not to be confused with a seance or ouija board , the phone angel does n't promise to put you in touch with the spirit world but intends to provide comfort for those coming to terms with their loss by opening the airwaves .

" people who are ill , have no time or live too far away to visit the deceased in their grave can now call , " said bröther in an interview with the associated press .
the inventor added that the thought came to him when his mother showed an unwillingness to attend a relative 's grave but would have liked to keep in touch with the person laid to rest there . long life battery keeps the airwaves open the device - consisting of a cell phone , a super strength battery and a small loudspeaker - comes in a waterproof container the size of an average shoe box which is placed in the earth about 30 centimeters -lrb- 11.8 inches -rrb- above the grave .
thanks to two years of collaborating with an electrician , bröther has developed a battery which will allow grieving friends and family almost a year of contact . using an application that most modern mobile phones have , automatic call response , bröther 's invention allows every caller to get through .
the phone angel clicks on and allows communication as if someone on the other end had picked up the receiver .
unlike the recipient of the call , the line is very rarely dead . once the battery has run down , the temptation would be to just cut the losses and leave the device in the ground .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 01.02.2005 a mini license for german teens großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 'll still be a little too young starting tuesday , 16-year-old germans can drive so-called mini cars .
the controversial vehicles are not deemed safe by everyone but eu officials required germany to allow teens to drive them anyway . unlike their contemporaries in many other countries , german teenagers have so far had to wait until turning 18 before being able to drive a car .
that 's no longer the case as 16-year-olds can now get a driver 's license for " be up , " " albizia " or mc1 , " as some of the mini cars are called . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : minicar mc1 at first sight , the vehicles almost look like normal cars , but they only weigh around 350 kilograms -lrb- about 700 pounds -rrb- and can not go faster than 45 kilometers per hour -lrb- 28 miles per hour -rrb- . the lightweight automobiles have raised the eyebrows of car experts , who are concerned about their safety . " these cars do n't offer any active or passive security measures for the driver , " said otto saalmann of germany 's largest automobile club , adac , which has conducted a crash test with a mini car . " the drivers ' crumple zone is pretty much his own body , " saalmann added , saying that the risk of injury was extremely high and that during the test , major parts broke and the transmission was pushed inside the car .
apart from security problems with the vehicle , saalmann also said mini cars posed a risk on streets as they slow down traffic . " they can drive on countryside highways , leading to congestion , accidents and risky overtake maneuvers , " he said . eu pushes for teen license bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mini cars are also more common on japanese streets but eu competition regulations brought about the driver 's licenses for 16-year-olds .
germany did have stricter rules than other union members - only people aged 18 and over who had a regular driver 's license where allowed to drive mini cars .
few dealers sold the mainly french products and they were rarely seen on german roads . eu commissioners saw this as a competitive disadvantage for mini car makers on the german market and pressured germany 's federal government to lower the age requirement to allow teens to drive before turning 18 . mathieu grosch , a belgian eu parliamentarian , said he agreed with the commission 's assessment that german law violated competition rules . " clearly there are market tendencies where some people say that they do n't want to sell this product in favor of another , " he said .
" but that 's a form of protectionism which can not be tolerated . " german compromise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the model of a " quad " bike on a german driver 's license as a compromise , germany decided to introduce a new class of driver 's licences that can be obtained at 16 years of age .
the so-called " s " license allows teens to drive mini cars and ride " trikes " and " quads " - motor bikes with three and four wheels .
to get licensed , applicants have to pass a written and practical exam . by introducing the " s " license , germany complied with eu demands but still sets the bar much higher than its neighboring countries .
government officials said they believed the new license represented the best possible compromise between eu and national law . " the only question that 's important here is : ' what kind of license do i need to safely drive such a car ' ? " said christian weibrecht , a spokesman for the german transportation ministry .
" the question is n't whether such cars are safe or not .
it 's important to remember that these vehicles have been legal in other eu countries for years and that according to eu law , we can not prevent that they are sold and driven in germany . " experts are not waiting to see whether teenagers will actually end up applying for the " s " license and starting a boom of mini cars on german streets .
if nothing else , the costs might keep them from doing so : a license will set them back between € 800 and € 1,000 and mini cars come with an average price tag of € 10,000 . and when the young drivers are ready to switch to the real thing two years later , they will have to start from scratch again to get a " real " driver 's license . christiane wolters -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a little high 's ok on german highways cannabis might still be illegal in germany , but police officers have long ignored the occasional joint smoker .

the controversial vehicles are not deemed safe by everyone but eu officials required germany to allow teens to drive them anyway . unlike their contemporaries in many other countries , german teenagers have so far had to wait until turning 18 before being able to drive a car .

" these cars do n't offer any active or passive security measures for the driver , " said otto saalmann of germany 's largest automobile club , adac , which has conducted a crash test with a mini car . " the drivers ' crumple zone is pretty much his own body , " saalmann added , saying that the risk of injury was extremely high and that during the test , major parts broke and the transmission was pushed inside the car .
apart from security problems with the vehicle , saalmann also said mini cars posed a risk on streets as they slow down traffic . " they can drive on countryside highways , leading to congestion , accidents and risky overtake maneuvers , " he said . eu pushes for teen license bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mini cars are also more common on japanese streets but eu competition regulations brought about the driver 's licenses for 16-year-olds .
germany did have stricter rules than other union members - only people aged 18 and over who had a regular driver 's license where allowed to drive mini cars .
few dealers sold the mainly french products and they were rarely seen on german roads . eu commissioners saw this as a competitive disadvantage for mini car makers on the german market and pressured germany 's federal government to lower the age requirement to allow teens to drive before turning 18 . mathieu grosch , a belgian eu parliamentarian , said he agreed with the commission 's assessment that german law violated competition rules .

the so-called " s " license allows teens to drive mini cars and ride " trikes " and " quads " - motor bikes with three and four wheels .
to get licensed , applicants have to pass a written and practical exam . by introducing the " s " license , germany complied with eu demands but still sets the bar much higher than its neighboring countries .
government officials said they believed the new license represented the best possible compromise between eu and national law . " the only question that 's important here is : ' what kind of license do i need to safely drive such a car ' ? " said christian weibrecht , a spokesman for the german transportation ministry .
" the question is n't whether such cars are safe or not .
it 's important to remember that these vehicles have been legal in other eu countries for years and that according to eu law , we can not prevent that they are sold and driven in germany . " experts are not waiting to see whether teenagers will actually end up applying for the " s " license and starting a boom of mini cars on german streets .
if nothing else , the costs might keep them from doing so : a license will set them back between € 800 and € 1,000 and mini cars come with an average price tag of € 10,000 . and when the young drivers are ready to switch to the real thing two years later , they will have to start from scratch again to get a " real " driver 's license . christiane wolters -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a little high 's ok on german highways cannabis might still be illegal in germany , but police officers have long ignored the occasional joint smoker .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 01.02.2005 making a connection with the dead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " phone angel " father bröther many in the grips of grief will find it hard to face a visit to the grave of a loved one , while some may be unable to make the journey .
now , help is at hand thanks to the slightly macabre " phone angel . " a german inventor has come up with a novel way for relatives coping with the grief of losing a loved one to convey their feelings to the departed .
the " phone angel , " a long-life battery powered cell phone device , allows those in mourning to have contact with the deceased when personal pain , distance or disability prevents them from attending the final resting place . not to be confused with a seance or ouija board , the phone angel does n't promise to put you in touch with the spirit world but intends to provide comfort for those coming to terms with their loss by opening the airwaves .
and , although it may seem like a bizarre and slightly macabre idea , jürgen bröther from osnabrück has already sold three of the devices at € 1,500 -lrb- $ 1,953 -rrb- a piece . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " sorry , i ca n't come to the phone right now but if you 'd like to leave a message ... "
" people who are ill , have no time or live too far away to visit the deceased in their grave can now call , " said bröther in an interview with the associated press .
the inventor added that the thought came to him when his mother showed an unwillingness to attend a relative 's grave but would have liked to keep in touch with the person laid to rest there . long life battery keeps the airwaves open the device - consisting of a cell phone , a super strength battery and a small loudspeaker - comes in a waterproof container the size of an average shoe box which is placed in the earth about 30 centimeters -lrb- 11.8 inches -rrb- above the grave .

the controversial vehicles are not deemed safe by everyone but eu officials required germany to allow teens to drive them anyway . unlike their contemporaries in many other countries , german teenagers have so far had to wait until turning 18 before being able to drive a car .

" these cars do n't offer any active or passive security measures for the driver , " said otto saalmann of germany 's largest automobile club , adac , which has conducted a crash test with a mini car . " the drivers ' crumple zone is pretty much his own body , " saalmann added , saying that the risk of injury was extremely high and that during the test , major parts broke and the transmission was pushed inside the car .
apart from security problems with the vehicle , saalmann also said mini cars posed a risk on streets as they slow down traffic . " they can drive on countryside highways , leading to congestion , accidents and risky overtake maneuvers , " he said . eu pushes for teen license bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mini cars are also more common on japanese streets but eu competition regulations brought about the driver 's licenses for 16-year-olds .
germany did have stricter rules than other union members - only people aged 18 and over who had a regular driver 's license where allowed to drive mini cars .
few dealers sold the mainly french products and they were rarely seen on german roads . eu commissioners saw this as a competitive disadvantage for mini car makers on the german market and pressured germany 's federal government to lower the age requirement to allow teens to drive before turning 18 . mathieu grosch , a belgian eu parliamentarian , said he agreed with the commission 's assessment that german law violated competition rules .

the so-called " s " license allows teens to drive mini cars and ride " trikes " and " quads " - motor bikes with three and four wheels .
to get licensed , applicants have to pass a written and practical exam . by introducing the " s " license , germany complied with eu demands but still sets the bar much higher than its neighboring countries .
government officials said they believed the new license represented the best possible compromise between eu and national law . " the only question that 's important here is : ' what kind of license do i need to safely drive such a car ' ? " said christian weibrecht , a spokesman for the german transportation ministry .
" the question is n't whether such cars are safe or not .
it 's important to remember that these vehicles have been legal in other eu countries for years and that according to eu law , we can not prevent that they are sold and driven in germany . " experts are not waiting to see whether teenagers will actually end up applying for the " s " license and starting a boom of mini cars on german streets .
if nothing else , the costs might keep them from doing so : a license will set them back between € 800 and € 1,000 and mini cars come with an average price tag of € 10,000 . and when the young drivers are ready to switch to the real thing two years later , they will have to start from scratch again to get a " real " driver 's license . christiane wolters -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a little high 's ok on german highways cannabis might still be illegal in germany , but police officers have long ignored the occasional joint smoker .

now , help is at hand thanks to the slightly macabre " phone angel . " a german inventor has come up with a novel way for relatives coping with the grief of losing a loved one to convey their feelings to the departed .
the " phone angel , " a long-life battery powered cell phone device , allows those in mourning to have contact with the deceased when personal pain , distance or disability prevents them from attending the final resting place . not to be confused with a seance or ouija board , the phone angel does n't promise to put you in touch with the spirit world but intends to provide comfort for those coming to terms with their loss by opening the airwaves .
and , although it may seem like a bizarre and slightly macabre idea , jürgen bröther from osnabrück has already sold three of the devices at € 1,500 -lrb- $ 1,953 -rrb- a piece . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " sorry , i ca n't come to the phone right now but if you 'd like to leave a message ... "
" people who are ill , have no time or live too far away to visit the deceased in their grave can now call , " said bröther in an interview with the associated press .
the inventor added that the thought came to him when his mother showed an unwillingness to attend a relative 's grave but would have liked to keep in touch with the person laid to rest there . long life battery keeps the airwaves open the device - consisting of a cell phone , a super strength battery and a small loudspeaker - comes in a waterproof container the size of an average shoe box which is placed in the earth about 30 centimeters -lrb- 11.8 inches -rrb- above the grave .
thanks to two years of collaborating with an electrician , bröther has developed a battery which will allow grieving friends and family almost a year of contact . using an application that most modern mobile phones have , automatic call response , bröther 's invention allows every caller to get through .
the phone angel clicks on and allows communication as if someone on the other end had picked up the receiver .
unlike the recipient of the call , the line is very rarely dead . once the battery has run down , the temptation would be to just cut the losses and leave the device in the ground .
but bröther has thought of that .
as a result , with the phone angel just 30 cm below the surface , it can be dug up and returned once the grieving period is over .

but much hinges on whether ante gotovina is produced to face war-crimes charges at the hague . rehn issued his starkest warning yet that the eu would postpone a march date to launch entry talks with zagreb if the retired general is not delivered to the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- . the finnish commissioner said he was " convinced that if the croatian government had the political will to locate and transfer general gotovina , it could do so . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olli rehn rehn -lrb- photo -rrb- said that based on information from un chief prosecutor carla del ponte and other " very informed sources , " croatia and gotovina have discussed a " possible voluntary surrender of general gotovina which did not materialize . " gotovina was also most probably sheltering in croatia or croatian areas of bosnia-hercegovina , " in any case within the reach of the croatian government , " he added . croatian premier surprised croatian prime minister ivo sanader voiced surprise over the threat to postpone the start of entry talks , rejecting the allegation that the government had had contacts with gotovina . " i am not worried but surprised , " sanader told croatian national radio speaking from luxembourg .
" croatia is fully cooperating with the un war crimes tribunal at the hague . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ivo sanader information that the government had held talks with gotovina was " not true , " said the prime minister -lrb- photo -rrb- , adding he was confident accession talks would begin as scheduled on march 17 . gotovina 's lawyer luka misetic said earlier this month that his client would surrender if his case was transferred to a croatian court , a deal immediately dismissed by un prosecutors and by zagreb . eu ready to postpone talks releasing the eu executive 's proposed plan of accession negotiations with croatia , rehn said that zagreb would not today be considered as deserving of eu talks . " if the commission were to give its recommendation on the basis of today 's information , i could not recommend opening negotiations with croatia , " he told a news conference .
" if there is no progress from the croatian side -lrb- on gotovina -rrb- , we are ready to postpone the start of talks . " at a december summit , eu leaders said the bloc would start accession talks with croatia on march 17 - provided it cooperates fully with the icty . that means finding and handing over gotovina , who went into hiding in 2001 when the un court charged him with war crimes against ethnic serbs at the end of croatia 's 1991-95 war of independence from the former yugoslavia . luxembourg foreign minister jean asselborn of the eu 's current presidency said the bloc 's decision on whether to proceed with talks from march 17 would depend in large part on the icty 's appraisal . " every step must go perfectly " confirming the receipt of a letter " from an individual claiming to be mr gotovina 's lawyer , " he said the issue of croatia would be discussed when us secretary of state condoleezza rice visits luxembourg on feb .
9 and 10 . " if tomorrow mr gotovina turns up in the hague , that 's that and we can start earlier , " asselborn said after a meeting of eu foreign ministers .
" but until that happens , march 17 is a buffer date for the start of the negotiations with croatia . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cathedral square in croatia 's capital , zagreb like any other eu candidate , croatia will have to strive hard to transpose the 80,000 pages of eu legislation and standards known as the " acquis communautaire .

the project will offer advice and training to traders .

research conducted last year found that almost one quarter of regular young drinkers bought their alcohol at their corner shop .
the atg is considering making membership of the new scheme compulsory for all applicants of licences to sell alcohol .
some local traders , including sainsbury 's , have already backed the scheme .

brownian motion , the photoelectric effect and special and general relativity will be tackled in an hour-long performance by punkscience .
the show , which is part of einstein year , takes place at the science museum in west london , on 1 and 8 february .
the project aims to demonstrate the relevance of science to everyday life .
' hardcore physics ' einstein year also marks the 100th anniversary since the genius put out three of the four papers that would change the way we viewed the universe .

jon said : " the point is that this is really , really hardcore physics .

"
i came to the uk about three years ago as a student .
when i later got a job here my employer applied for a work permit for me , which came through last year .
my fiancée and i met while i was at university .
we 've been living together now for three years and plan to get married in july at a catholic church .
when my partner and i contacted the priest we were told we should go to the register office to give notice to marry about four months in advance of the wedding day .
but after i heard about the rule changes i contacted the local office and was told i 'd come under the new scheme .
it 's so demeaning having to apply for permission from the home secretary to get married .
it 's de-humanising , it 's like saying that i am a second-class citizen .
the difficulty for us specifically is firstly that it 's an added cost , marriages are already expensive , we 're looking at around £ 12,000 for our wedding and now we have to pay another £ 135 for a certificate of approval .
and it is only valid for three months , so if i apply for it too early it will expire before i get married . * ' raising money ' also we 're planning to go on honeymoon to egypt so i need to get a visa for that .
so our concern is when my passport goes off to the home office how long will it take before i get it back , everything is in jeopardy if they do n't return it on time .
i pay my taxes like everybody else and i do n't have access to many benefits that british people may have because of my status .
you may have some suspicious marriages taking place but i do n't think this is the way to curb that .
what they should do is give registrars more training to recognise bogus marriages .
you should n't have to get approval and pay for it before you see the registrar .
if you look at the number of foreign nationals getting married in a year and the kind of revenue they 're going to be raising from this , i think it 's more about raising money really . " * under the new rules , foreign nationals who are resident in the uk and want to get married have first to apply for a certificate of approval from the home office , which is valid for three months .
within this period , they must give notice of their intention to marry .
this must be done at one of 76 designated register offices .
the marriage must then take place within 12 months in england , wales and northern ireland or within three months in scotland .

how are marriage rules changing ?
from 1 february 2005 , the rules governing marriage change for foreign nationals " subject to immigration control " - people who do not have complete and open residency in the uk .
in essence , the law now says foreign nationals who want to marry , be it to a british citizen or another foreigner , will now need government approval .
those affected will be required to give notice of their marriage at one of 76 special register offices , rather than at any council .
the " certificate for approval " for a marriage will cost £ 135 .
does this affect people from the european union ?
people from the eu have a right to freely live and work in the uk under rules that allow british people to do the same in other eu countries .
some other european nationals are also exempt .
finally , the rules do not apply to foreign nationals who do not need a visa to be in the uk - typically someone who has been settled and working here for a long time or someone given refugee protection .
but it does affect everyone else from africa to the united states and from asia to australia .
the rules also apply to same-sex couples planning to use the new civil partnership laws .
so who is likely to get turned away ?
basically people with no right to be in the uk and people with a visa about to expire .
if someone says they want to get married a month before their visa runs out , they will almost certainly be told they can not because officials may assume that it is a sham marriage .
so what happens if someone is rejected ?
quite simply , if you do not get home office approval and you do not have permission to stay in the uk , a registrar will not give the go-ahead to a marriage .
why is the government doing this ?
the home office introduced these new rules because it believes it needs to clamp down on fraudulent marriages networks used by people trying to avoid being removed from the country .
if you are foreign and marry a british or eu citizen , it enhances your rights to residency .
ministers say abuse has increased in recent years and registrars have been unable to stop suspect marriages .
have they got a case ?
officials estimate there are 15,000 sham marriages every year , 8,000 of them in london .
there have been a number of high-profile raids of marriages in the past few years during which immigration authorities have broken criminal enterprises setting up fake marriages .
one recent case saw 25 people jailed for a sham marriage network stretching from london to leicester .
anecdotal evidence suggests it goes on among all communities and involves people from all walks of life , from manual workers in the black economy to graduates on gap years .
how do our laws compare with other european countries ?
registrars back the changes .
they tend to say the law has been too lax in comparison with other european countries and these new rules will help them in their job .
are these rules universally welcomed ?
no - and they face a rough ride .
the joint council for the welfare of immigrants says the rules are unfair and discriminatory against minorities .
the joint parliamentary committee on human rights has some sympathy with that organisation 's complaints - its report warned of a " significant risk " the law would contradict the european convention on human rights and face challenges in the high court .

how are marriage rules changing ?
from 1 february 2005 , the rules governing marriage change for foreign nationals " subject to immigration control " - people who do not have complete and open residency in the uk .
in essence , the law now says foreign nationals who want to marry , be it to a british citizen or another foreigner , will now need government approval .
those affected will be required to give notice of their marriage at one of 76 special register offices , rather than at any council .
the " certificate for approval " for a marriage will cost £ 135 .
does this affect people from the european union ?
people from the eu have a right to freely live and work in the uk under rules that allow british people to do the same in other eu countries .
some other european nationals are also exempt .
finally , the rules do not apply to foreign nationals who do not need a visa to be in the uk - typically someone who has been settled and working here for a long time or someone given refugee protection .
but it does affect everyone else from africa to the united states and from asia to australia .
the rules also apply to same-sex couples planning to use the new civil partnership laws .
so who is likely to get turned away ?
basically people with no right to be in the uk and people with a visa about to expire .
if someone says they want to get married a month before their visa runs out , they will almost certainly be told they can not because officials may assume that it is a sham marriage .
so what happens if someone is rejected ?
quite simply , if you do not get home office approval and you do not have permission to stay in the uk , a registrar will not give the go-ahead to a marriage .
why is the government doing this ?
the home office introduced these new rules because it believes it needs to clamp down on fraudulent marriages networks used by people trying to avoid being removed from the country .
if you are foreign and marry a british or eu citizen , it enhances your rights to residency .
ministers say abuse has increased in recent years and registrars have been unable to stop suspect marriages .
have they got a case ?
officials estimate there are 15,000 sham marriages every year , 8,000 of them in london .
there have been a number of high-profile raids of marriages in the past few years during which immigration authorities have broken criminal enterprises setting up fake marriages .
one recent case saw 25 people jailed for a sham marriage network stretching from london to leicester .
anecdotal evidence suggests it goes on among all communities and involves people from all walks of life , from manual workers in the black economy to graduates on gap years .
how do our laws compare with other european countries ?
registrars back the changes .
they tend to say the law has been too lax in comparison with other european countries and these new rules will help them in their job .
are these rules universally welcomed ?
no - and they face a rough ride .
the joint council for the welfare of immigrants says the rules are unfair and discriminatory against minorities .
the joint parliamentary committee on human rights has some sympathy with that organisation 's complaints - its report warned of a " significant risk " the law would contradict the european convention on human rights and face challenges in the high court .

how are marriage rules changing ?
from 1 february 2005 , the rules governing marriage change for foreign nationals " subject to immigration control " - people who do not have complete and open residency in the uk .
in essence , the law now says foreign nationals who want to marry , be it to a british citizen or another foreigner , will now need government approval .
those affected will be required to give notice of their marriage at one of 76 special register offices , rather than at any council .
the " certificate for approval " for a marriage will cost £ 135 .
does this affect people from the european union ?
people from the eu have a right to freely live and work in the uk under rules that allow british people to do the same in other eu countries .
some other european nationals are also exempt .
finally , the rules do not apply to foreign nationals who do not need a visa to be in the uk - typically someone who has been settled and working here for a long time or someone given refugee protection .
but it does affect everyone else from africa to the united states and from asia to australia .
the rules also apply to same-sex couples planning to use the new civil partnership laws .
so who is likely to get turned away ?
basically people with no right to be in the uk and people with a visa about to expire .
if someone says they want to get married a month before their visa runs out , they will almost certainly be told they can not because officials may assume that it is a sham marriage .
so what happens if someone is rejected ?
quite simply , if you do not get home office approval and you do not have permission to stay in the uk , a registrar will not give the go-ahead to a marriage .
why is the government doing this ?
the home office introduced these new rules because it believes it needs to clamp down on fraudulent marriages networks used by people trying to avoid being removed from the country .
if you are foreign and marry a british or eu citizen , it enhances your rights to residency .
ministers say abuse has increased in recent years and registrars have been unable to stop suspect marriages .
have they got a case ?
officials estimate there are 15,000 sham marriages every year , 8,000 of them in london .
there have been a number of high-profile raids of marriages in the past few years during which immigration authorities have broken criminal enterprises setting up fake marriages .
one recent case saw 25 people jailed for a sham marriage network stretching from london to leicester .
anecdotal evidence suggests it goes on among all communities and involves people from all walks of life , from manual workers in the black economy to graduates on gap years .
how do our laws compare with other european countries ?
registrars back the changes .
they tend to say the law has been too lax in comparison with other european countries and these new rules will help them in their job .
are these rules universally welcomed ?
no - and they face a rough ride .
the joint council for the welfare of immigrants says the rules are unfair and discriminatory against minorities .
the joint parliamentary committee on human rights has some sympathy with that organisation 's complaints - its report warned of a " significant risk " the law would contradict the european convention on human rights and face challenges in the high court .

i came to the uk about three years ago as a student .
when i later got a job here my employer applied for a work permit for me , which came through last year .
my fiancée and i met while i was at university .
we 've been living together now for three years and plan to get married in july at a catholic church .
when my partner and i contacted the priest we were told we should go to the register office to give notice to marry about four months in advance of the wedding day .
but after i heard about the rule changes i contacted the local office and was told i 'd come under the new scheme .

it 's de-humanising , it 's like saying that i am a second-class citizen .
the difficulty for us specifically is firstly that it 's an added cost , marriages are already expensive , we 're looking at around £ 12,000 for our wedding and now we have to pay another £ 135 for a certificate of approval .
and it is only valid for three months , so if i apply for it too early it will expire before i get married . * ' raising money ' also we 're planning to go on honeymoon to egypt so i need to get a visa for that .

i pay my taxes like everybody else and i do n't have access to many benefits that british people may have because of my status .
you may have some suspicious marriages taking place but i do n't think this is the way to curb that .
what they should do is give registrars more training to recognise bogus marriages .
you should n't have to get approval and pay for it before you see the registrar .
if you look at the number of foreign nationals getting married in a year and the kind of revenue they 're going to be raising from this , i think it 's more about raising money really . * under the new rules , foreign nationals who are resident in the uk and want to get married have first to apply for a certificate of approval from the home office , which is valid for three months .
within this period , they must give notice of their intention to marry .
this must be done at one of 76 designated register offices .
the marriage must then take place within 12 months in england , wales and northern ireland or within three months in scotland .

his promise was made during a meeting in westminster on monday night .
dr gibbons ' predecessor jane hutt , whom he replaced last month , came under criticism over waiting lists from labour mps and opposition ams .
clwyd west mp gareth thomas told dr gibbons that failure to cut waiting times could undermine devolution .
in november , the british medical association said nhs staff were " weeping with despair " as figures showed 311,000 people were waiting for treatment in wales .
in the same month lists in england were at their lowest for 17 years , with 856,600 people waiting for treatment . "
both dr gibbons and the mps present at the meeting certainly agreed there had been huge advances in the nhs in wales . "
wayne david mp speaking to the bbc news website , dr gibbons said monday 's meeting , in which he was subjected to 30 minutes of direct questioning , had been " fairly constructive " .
" i do n't want to discuss what went on in a private meeting - it was a confidential meeting , but waiting times are a priority for me , " he said .
' good exchange of views ' caerphilly mp wayne david said the meeting had been " a good exchange of views " .
" both dr gibbons and the mps present certainly agreed there had been huge advances in the nhs in wales , but also agreed much work needs to be done quickly as far as waiting times were concerned , " he said .
one unidentified mp is reported to have said said that dr gibbons was " less in denial " about the state of the welsh nhs than his predecessor .
last week , figures revealed that hospital waiting times in wales fell in the final three months of last year - which prompted dr gibbons to say the gap with england was closing .
the welsh conservatives accused dr gibbons of " hollow tokenism " and said he needed to focus all his attention on tackling waiting times .
their health spokesman , jonathan morgan , said : " it rather begs the question what brian gibbons will be doing for the other six days of the week .
" we need a serious commitment from dr gibbons to help those on long waiting lists by offering them treatment either in england where the waits are shorter or in the private sector . "

the now formally launched msn search site takes the training wheels off the test version unveiled in november 2003 .
the revamped engine indexes more pages than before , can give direct answers to factual questions , and features tools to help people create detailed queries .
microsoft faces challenges establishing itself as a serious search site because of the intense competition for queries .
stiff competition google still reigns supreme as the site people turn to most often when they go online to answer a query , keep up with news or search for images .
but in the last year google has faced greater competition than ever for users as old rivals , such as yahoo and microsoft , and new entrants such as amazon and blinkx , try to grab some of the searching audience for themselves .
this renewed interest has come about because of the realisation that many of the things people do online begin with a search for information - be it for a particular web page , recipe , book , gadget , news story , image or anything else .
microsoft is keen to make its home-grown search engine a significant rival to google .
to generate its corpus of data , microsoft has indexed 5 billion webpages and claims to update its document index every two days - more often than rivals .
the microsoft search engine can also answer specific queries directly rather than send people to a page that might contain the answer .
' following the market ' for its direct answer feature , microsoft is calling on its encarta encyclopaedia to provide answers to questions about definitions , facts , calculations , conversions and solutions to equations .
tony macklin , director of product at ask jeeves , pointed out that its search engine has been answering specific queries this way since april 2003 .
" the major search providers have moved beyond delivering only algorithmic search , so in many ways microsoft is following the market , " he said .
tools sitting alongside the msn search engine allow users to refine results to specific websites , countries , regions or languages .
microsoft is also using so-called " graphic equalisers " that let people adjust the relevance of terms to get results that are more up-to-date or more popular .
the company said that user feedback from earlier test versions had been used to refine the workings of the finished system .
the test , or beta , version of the msn search engine unveiled in november had a few teething troubles .

the area covers holyhead town centre , train station and ferry terminal .
it follows complaints from members of the public , traders and tourists about drunkenness and anti-social behaviour .
councillor hefin thomas said he hoped it would end the problem of " groups of young lads drinking on the streets , making a nuisance of themselves " .
police officers enforcing the zone will have powers to confiscate alcohol and make arrests if people do not stop drinking .
mr thomas , in charge of public protection at anglesey council , said that anti-social drinking was " totally unacceptable " . "
this zone will help create a safer environment and improve the quality of life for the people of holyhead " cliff everett , councillor " -lsb- it -rsb- leads to criminal , disorderly and violent behaviour , " he said .
mr thomas said the issue had been a problem for several years , but had " heightened " in the last six months , and gave a very bad first impression to people visiting holyhead .
" i believe that this alcohol-free zone is a step in the right direction and we are currently looking at the possibility of setting up further zones on the island , " he added .
the zone has been created by anglesey 's council , following an application by the island 's community safety partnership .
the designated area will also extend beyond holyhead high school , newry beach and victoria road .
holyhead councillor cliff everett said that " inconsiderate behaviour " by drinkers was a serious problem .
" -lsb- i -rsb- trust that with the correct enforcement we will soon be rid of problems associated with alcohol , " he said .
" this zone will help create a safer environment and improve the quality of life for the people of holyhead . "
meanwhile , north wales police are looking for a gang of 20 youngsters - girls as well as boys - who chased and attacked two men in holyhead .
the two young men , who were punched , kicked and had hurled stones at them , needed treatement at ysbyty gwynedd in bangor .
a wallet with a large amount of cash was also stolen in the incident last friday night after the men in their 20s had left the local skate park .
they were chased along three streets to the beach , where the attack took place .
police said the attackers were all between 15 and 17 .
on the other side of anglesey , a series of measures to stop anti-social behaviour in the village of dwyran have been announced .
the number of crimes reported in dwyran rose rapidly during december , with 13 incidents reported in one day .
