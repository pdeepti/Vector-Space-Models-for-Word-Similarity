the plan is not without its critics . in the northern german federal state of schleswig-holstein , the danish minority party ssw has become a decisive factor in forming a post-election coalition government .
social democrats and greens are now courting the small party - which , by agreeing to tolerate the coalition , is now in a position to ask for political favors in the interest of its own voters . the slavonic minority of the sorbs in eastern germany have a vested interest in what happens in schleswig holstein .
they also want to become more influential .
on wednesday , sorbian leaders announced they 'd be forming a minority party of their own before the end of march in a bid for more political clout . the desire for direct influence up to now , the 20,000 protestant sorbs in brandenburg and another 40,000 catholic sorbs in neighboring saxony are only represented by an umbrella organization called domovina , as well as sorbian councils in the state assemblies .
however , neither of the two offer any direct influence on decision-making . elke lorenz , a local counsellor in the sorbian stronghold of bautzen , views the sorbs ' endeavours to found a party of their own with suspicion , and plays down current difficulties . " i would n't say there have ever been grave conflicts between us germans and the sorbs living here , " she said .
" we can look back on many centuries of peaceful coexistence .
of course , the nazi period had a severe impact on our relationship in that the sorbian language and the sorbian party was banned .
but things have long returned to normal . " the next step for sorbian leaders such as hannes kell , though , the re-founding of a party is essential .
he says that increasingly , the sorbs are viewed as a mere folklore ensemble entitled to appear at cultural events in the region .
he calls for more political influence to make sure that sorbian traditions are preserved .
and money plays no small role in this . kell deplores the cutting of subsidies over the past few years .
in 2005 alone , the sorbian minority in brandenburg will get € 152,000 -lrb- $ 200,000 -rrb- less than previously promised by the regional government .
federal allocations are also going down with the government in berlin shelling out € 450,000 less than in the previous year . sorbs on the move bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan nuck leos shatava from the institute of sorbian culture is skeptical about the forming of a party , fearing that it might not get the desired backing from the population on the ground .
jan nuck -lrb- photo -rrb- from domowina also has his doubts , saying he does n't see " why it would lead to greater influence for the sorbs . " but hannes kell says it 's high time the sorbs entered uncharted territory in unified germany . he 's poised to form the party to be called " serbska ludowa strona , " or sorbian people 's party , in a few weeks ' time .
just like the danish minority party in schleswig-holstein , the sorbian party would not have to clear the five-percent hurdle at elections .

the plan is not without its critics . in the northern german federal state of schleswig-holstein , the danish minority party ssw has become a decisive factor in forming a post-election coalition government .
social democrats and greens are now courting the small party - which , by agreeing to tolerate the coalition , is now in a position to ask for political favors in the interest of its own voters . the slavonic minority of the sorbs in eastern germany have a vested interest in what happens in schleswig holstein .
they also want to become more influential .
on wednesday , sorbian leaders announced they 'd be forming a minority party of their own before the end of march in a bid for more political clout . the desire for direct influence up to now , the 20,000 protestant sorbs in brandenburg and another 40,000 catholic sorbs in neighboring saxony are only represented by an umbrella organization called domovina , as well as sorbian councils in the state assemblies .
however , neither of the two offer any direct influence on decision-making . elke lorenz , a local counsellor in the sorbian stronghold of bautzen , views the sorbs ' endeavours to found a party of their own with suspicion , and plays down current difficulties . " i would n't say there have ever been grave conflicts between us germans and the sorbs living here , " she said .
" we can look back on many centuries of peaceful coexistence .
of course , the nazi period had a severe impact on our relationship in that the sorbian language and the sorbian party was banned .
but things have long returned to normal . " the next step for sorbian leaders such as hannes kell , though , the re-founding of a party is essential .
he says that increasingly , the sorbs are viewed as a mere folklore ensemble entitled to appear at cultural events in the region .
he calls for more political influence to make sure that sorbian traditions are preserved .
and money plays no small role in this . kell deplores the cutting of subsidies over the past few years .
in 2005 alone , the sorbian minority in brandenburg will get € 152,000 -lrb- $ 200,000 -rrb- less than previously promised by the regional government .
federal allocations are also going down with the government in berlin shelling out € 450,000 less than in the previous year . sorbs on the move bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan nuck leos shatava from the institute of sorbian culture is skeptical about the forming of a party , fearing that it might not get the desired backing from the population on the ground .
jan nuck -lrb- photo -rrb- from domowina also has his doubts , saying he does n't see " why it would lead to greater influence for the sorbs . " but hannes kell says it 's high time the sorbs entered uncharted territory in unified germany . he 's poised to form the party to be called " serbska ludowa strona , " or sorbian people 's party , in a few weeks ' time .
just like the danish minority party in schleswig-holstein , the sorbian party would not have to clear the five-percent hurdle at elections .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 04.03.2005 germans agree to curb smoking großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soon a more common sight in german restaurants and bars moving to protect non-smokers in germany , the federal government and the country 's association of hotels and restaurants have signed an agreement which obliges owners to create non-smoking sections for their customers . the idea is to reserve at least half of the restaurant or hotel space for non-smokers with relevant sections to be created over the next three years .
the agreement came about quickly , as it is a far better option for the hotel business rather than facing draconian anti-smoking measures in public spaces , such as those that have been implemented recently in italy , malta and ireland . the latter countries have already completely banned smoking in public places despite large-scale opposition .
while tobacco-related diseases kill 650,000 eu citizens every year , a ban on smoking in public places has met with particularly fierce opposition in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italians puffed their last cigarettes inside restaurants and bars at the beginning of the year the government is aware of the fact that imposing a total ban on smoking for instance in hotels and restaurants is pretty well impossible .
and so it has been banking on voluntary agreements with corporations profiting from the multi-billion-euro tobacco business . both sides are happy it was a happy marion caspers-merk , under-secretary in the federal health ministry , who announced that the influential association of hotel and restaurant owners had agreed to set up smoke-free sections for their customers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german train stations have viturally banned smoking " we have regulations for the workplace which guarantee each employee a smoke-free environment , if he or she so wishes , " she said .
" we also have strict laws meant to protect young people under the age of 16 from getting hold of tobacco too easily .
and i ’ m glad that our anti-smoking campaign has now reached a new stage with the agreement that 's been signed between the government and the german association of hotels and restaurants . " the association ’ s president , ernst fischer , has promised to implement the agreement as quickly as possible . " people in our business don ’ t want to exclude anyone , " he said .
" we simply want both smokers and non-smokers to feel comfortable in our hotels and restaurants .
and certainly we want to do our best to fulfill the wishes of our customers .
but we don ’ t need a law to ensure this .
if you look around , the spirit of the new agreement is already present in most of the bigger hotels and restaurants where there are bound to be non-smoking sections already in place .
the agreement will make sure that this practice will expand to all of our hotels and restaurants . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : optional non-smoking rooms have become standard in germany marc scherr , press spokesman for the accor hotel chain , insisted that customers should continue to have the choice whether they want to smoke or not .
but his plea for individual freedom deliberately dodges health issues related to passive smoking . " it is praiseworthy to do something for the health of the people , but it is not possible to do that to the disadvantage of our enterprises , " he said , adding that restaurants lost a lot of business after the smoking ban went into effect in new york . " we believe the smoking and the non-smoking can only be solved by market powers , because right now we already have a lot of restaurants in german offering non-smoking zones , " scherr added . eu combats smoking the german government sees the new agreement as conforming with a fresh anti-smoking campaign launched by the european commission .
the campaign will tour all 25 eu capital cities until 2008 and will be coupled with anti-smoking tv ads . the eu campaign comes two days after the who ’ s framework convention on tobacco control went into force .
the treaty which was also signed by germany imposes a ban on tobacco company advertising as well as introducing international standards on labeling , pricing and taxes . hardy graupner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tough on smoking or tough on its ban ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 04.03.2005 germans agree to curb smoking großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soon a more common sight in german restaurants and bars moving to protect non-smokers in germany , the federal government and the country 's association of hotels and restaurants have signed an agreement which obliges owners to create non-smoking sections for their customers . the idea is to reserve at least half of the restaurant or hotel space for non-smokers with relevant sections to be created over the next three years .
the agreement came about quickly , as it is a far better option for the hotel business rather than facing draconian anti-smoking measures in public spaces , such as those that have been implemented recently in italy , malta and ireland . the latter countries have already completely banned smoking in public places despite large-scale opposition .
while tobacco-related diseases kill 650,000 eu citizens every year , a ban on smoking in public places has met with particularly fierce opposition in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italians puffed their last cigarettes inside restaurants and bars at the beginning of the year the government is aware of the fact that imposing a total ban on smoking for instance in hotels and restaurants is pretty well impossible .
and so it has been banking on voluntary agreements with corporations profiting from the multi-billion-euro tobacco business . both sides are happy it was a happy marion caspers-merk , under-secretary in the federal health ministry , who announced that the influential association of hotel and restaurant owners had agreed to set up smoke-free sections for their customers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german train stations have viturally banned smoking " we have regulations for the workplace which guarantee each employee a smoke-free environment , if he or she so wishes , " she said .
" we also have strict laws meant to protect young people under the age of 16 from getting hold of tobacco too easily .
and i ’ m glad that our anti-smoking campaign has now reached a new stage with the agreement that 's been signed between the government and the german association of hotels and restaurants . " the association ’ s president , ernst fischer , has promised to implement the agreement as quickly as possible . " people in our business don ’ t want to exclude anyone , " he said .
" we simply want both smokers and non-smokers to feel comfortable in our hotels and restaurants .
and certainly we want to do our best to fulfill the wishes of our customers .
but we don ’ t need a law to ensure this .
if you look around , the spirit of the new agreement is already present in most of the bigger hotels and restaurants where there are bound to be non-smoking sections already in place .
the agreement will make sure that this practice will expand to all of our hotels and restaurants . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : optional non-smoking rooms have become standard in germany marc scherr , press spokesman for the accor hotel chain , insisted that customers should continue to have the choice whether they want to smoke or not .
but his plea for individual freedom deliberately dodges health issues related to passive smoking . " it is praiseworthy to do something for the health of the people , but it is not possible to do that to the disadvantage of our enterprises , " he said , adding that restaurants lost a lot of business after the smoking ban went into effect in new york . " we believe the smoking and the non-smoking can only be solved by market powers , because right now we already have a lot of restaurants in german offering non-smoking zones , " scherr added . eu combats smoking the german government sees the new agreement as conforming with a fresh anti-smoking campaign launched by the european commission .
the campaign will tour all 25 eu capital cities until 2008 and will be coupled with anti-smoking tv ads . the eu campaign comes two days after the who ’ s framework convention on tobacco control went into force .
the treaty which was also signed by germany imposes a ban on tobacco company advertising as well as introducing international standards on labeling , pricing and taxes . hardy graupner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tough on smoking or tough on its ban ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 04.03.2005 germans agree to curb smoking großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soon a more common sight in german restaurants and bars moving to protect non-smokers in germany , the federal government and the country 's association of hotels and restaurants have signed an agreement which obliges owners to create non-smoking sections for their customers . the idea is to reserve at least half of the restaurant or hotel space for non-smokers with relevant sections to be created over the next three years .
the agreement came about quickly , as it is a far better option for the hotel business rather than facing draconian anti-smoking measures in public spaces , such as those that have been implemented recently in italy , malta and ireland . the latter countries have already completely banned smoking in public places despite large-scale opposition .
while tobacco-related diseases kill 650,000 eu citizens every year , a ban on smoking in public places has met with particularly fierce opposition in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italians puffed their last cigarettes inside restaurants and bars at the beginning of the year the government is aware of the fact that imposing a total ban on smoking for instance in hotels and restaurants is pretty well impossible .
and so it has been banking on voluntary agreements with corporations profiting from the multi-billion-euro tobacco business . both sides are happy it was a happy marion caspers-merk , under-secretary in the federal health ministry , who announced that the influential association of hotel and restaurant owners had agreed to set up smoke-free sections for their customers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german train stations have viturally banned smoking " we have regulations for the workplace which guarantee each employee a smoke-free environment , if he or she so wishes , " she said .
" we also have strict laws meant to protect young people under the age of 16 from getting hold of tobacco too easily .
and i ’ m glad that our anti-smoking campaign has now reached a new stage with the agreement that 's been signed between the government and the german association of hotels and restaurants . " the association ’ s president , ernst fischer , has promised to implement the agreement as quickly as possible . " people in our business don ’ t want to exclude anyone , " he said .
" we simply want both smokers and non-smokers to feel comfortable in our hotels and restaurants .
and certainly we want to do our best to fulfill the wishes of our customers .
but we don ’ t need a law to ensure this .
if you look around , the spirit of the new agreement is already present in most of the bigger hotels and restaurants where there are bound to be non-smoking sections already in place .
the agreement will make sure that this practice will expand to all of our hotels and restaurants . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : optional non-smoking rooms have become standard in germany marc scherr , press spokesman for the accor hotel chain , insisted that customers should continue to have the choice whether they want to smoke or not .
but his plea for individual freedom deliberately dodges health issues related to passive smoking . " it is praiseworthy to do something for the health of the people , but it is not possible to do that to the disadvantage of our enterprises , " he said , adding that restaurants lost a lot of business after the smoking ban went into effect in new york . " we believe the smoking and the non-smoking can only be solved by market powers , because right now we already have a lot of restaurants in german offering non-smoking zones , " scherr added . eu combats smoking the german government sees the new agreement as conforming with a fresh anti-smoking campaign launched by the european commission .
the campaign will tour all 25 eu capital cities until 2008 and will be coupled with anti-smoking tv ads . the eu campaign comes two days after the who ’ s framework convention on tobacco control went into force .
the treaty which was also signed by germany imposes a ban on tobacco company advertising as well as introducing international standards on labeling , pricing and taxes . hardy graupner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tough on smoking or tough on its ban ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 04.03.2005 the love-hate nature of car ownership großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sometimes happy , sometimes sad : car ownership is a complicated thing is a car just a means of transport or is it much more than that ?
surely it 's just a machine which makes some aspects of our lives easier .
or is it ? a car is something different for everyone .
it could just be a means to an end , the most convenient way of getting to where you want to go .
it could be your work ; it could be your life .
but whatever a car represents , it can be a reference point to a certain time , a reminder of days gone by just as a song or a place can take you back years . a first car is like a first love .
it is something you see others enjoying as you grow up and something that fills your heart with longing , expectation and a little trepidation .
you see the amount of time some drivers spend with their vehicles and you crave that connection ; you see the exhilaration on their faces as they drive and wonder if you will ever feel that joy .
in short , you just ca n't wait until you 're old enough to enjoy those same pleasures . in that way , owning your first car is like a coming of age .
in britain , where i spent the best part of 17 years preparing for the day i was handed the keys to the car door , the age at which you can legally drive comes amid the whirling maelstrom of late adolescence with all its raging hormones and soul-crushing melodrama . but in the eye of this hurricane , you have this proof that you are considered an adult .
you are allowed on the road with all the other grown-ups .
all of life 's troubles at that point can be solved as long as you have a steering wheel to grab and an accelerator to gun .
girlfriends can come and go but as long as you have a tank of gas at the time , so can you . my first getaway car was an austin mini and , i freely admit , i gave myself entirely to that car .
it was bought in a storm from a coastal village for the princely sum of ₤ 70 -lrb- € 101 , $ 133 -rrb- .
i had yet to pass my driving test and my extremely nervous but charitable mother agreed to co-pilot our return with me at the wheel , despite the sheets of rain and booming clouds above .
it was love at first sight .
royal blue flashed with sea air rust , it would be my escape route throughout my mid-teens . the curse of the boy racer or so i thought .
as with many young drivers , the car in its purest form was never enough .
in went the sunroof , on went the wide wheels and straight box double-shotgun exhaust and racing steering wheel .
and the stereo ?
if the gurgling pipes at the back were n't enough to signal my arrival , then my soundsystem would be .
but the love affair was not to last .
i got greedy .
i wanted more . to exchange one love for another always seems like a good idea at the time .
you 're moving on , older and wiser , to new horizons .
you feel you have outgrown your past .
but you soon realize that , as with all first loves , the cars that come after ' the one ' have the problem that they must always live in that shadow . my ford fiesta was an affair of the head , not of the heart .
the larger engine , the glossy red exterior , the boxy maturity it exuded in comparison to the bubble-shaped go-kart i had exchanged it for - i was seduced .
buying the fiesta felt like i was moving up the driving ladder .
i had been a fully licensed driver for a year and it was time to get serious .
however , i was left cold - literally . refrigerator on wheels or status symbol ? purchased during the waning weeks of autumn , the fiesta seemed an ideal chariot for the busy life i was now leading .
people with cars had a certain standing within a group of friends and the responsibility of being the designated driver at times was an added ego boost .
people wanted to drive with me . that is until winter hit and i found out that i had to do a steady 70 miles per hour -lrb- 112 kph -rrb- for at least 45 minutes before the heater would even begin to blow anything other than an icy chill into the car .
driving with me had turned into a recurring scene from the keanu reeves movie speed .
if the needle dropped below 70 , those on board were in danger of freezing to death .
however , negotiating roads in december at that speed was also life-threatening and the fiesta was soon in the classifieds and out of my life . but i had not learned my lesson .
again my head was turned .
this time a slinky german number caught my eye .
the teutonic charm of the volkswagen golf was too much and i took the next step up the auto evolutionary ladder … into a nightmare . the breakdown of a relationship within a day of ownership , she 'd died on me .
after suffering the ignominy of being towed back into town , we tried again .
this time the failure was more spectacular as we disappeared in a boom of black smoke which would have made james bond envious as we accelerated away from a roundabout and limped onto the hard shoulder . like any man caught in a destructive affair , words meant nothing .
i was convinced it would all work out .
my hard earned cash went on a new engine and for a while we were happy together .
until the breakdowns started again and i knew it was over .
i managed to get her running long enough to sell her but she was cursed .
a few weeks later , i saw , from my hiding place , the new owner pushing the car along a street . what a fool i 'd been !
how could i have been so easily swayed ?
my next car would be a return to those warm and happy memories of my first love .
this time , the mini was newer , more sophisticated and considerably more expensive .
she was a dream to drive and i honestly felt sad to see her go as i departed for university some 18 months later . maybe it was the realization that you ca n't turn back time or that public transport is much cheaper than owning your own .
whatever it was , i have n't owned a car since . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a mini license for german teens starting tuesday , 16-year-old germans can drive so-called mini cars .

surely it 's just a machine which makes some aspects of our lives easier .
or is it ? a car is something different for everyone .
it could just be a means to an end , the most convenient way of getting to where you want to go .
it could be your work ; it could be your life .
but whatever a car represents , it can be a reference point to a certain time , a reminder of days gone by just as a song or a place can take you back years . a first car is like a first love .
it is something you see others enjoying as you grow up and something that fills your heart with longing , expectation and a little trepidation .
you see the amount of time some drivers spend with their vehicles and you crave that connection ; you see the exhilaration on their faces as they drive and wonder if you will ever feel that joy .
in short , you just ca n't wait until you 're old enough to enjoy those same pleasures . in that way , owning your first car is like a coming of age .
in britain , where i spent the best part of 17 years preparing for the day i was handed the keys to the car door , the age at which you can legally drive comes amid the whirling maelstrom of late adolescence with all its raging hormones and soul-crushing melodrama . but in the eye of this hurricane , you have this proof that you are considered an adult .
you are allowed on the road with all the other grown-ups .
all of life 's troubles at that point can be solved as long as you have a steering wheel to grab and an accelerator to gun .
girlfriends can come and go but as long as you have a tank of gas at the time , so can you . my first getaway car was an austin mini and , i freely admit , i gave myself entirely to that car .
it was bought in a storm from a coastal village for the princely sum of ₤ 70 -lrb- € 101 , $ 133 -rrb- .
i had yet to pass my driving test and my extremely nervous but charitable mother agreed to co-pilot our return with me at the wheel , despite the sheets of rain and booming clouds above .
it was love at first sight .
royal blue flashed with sea air rust , it would be my escape route throughout my mid-teens . the curse of the boy racer or so i thought .
as with many young drivers , the car in its purest form was never enough .
in went the sunroof , on went the wide wheels and straight box double-shotgun exhaust and racing steering wheel .
and the stereo ?
if the gurgling pipes at the back were n't enough to signal my arrival , then my soundsystem would be .
but the love affair was not to last .
i got greedy .
i wanted more . to exchange one love for another always seems like a good idea at the time .
you 're moving on , older and wiser , to new horizons .
you feel you have outgrown your past .
but you soon realize that , as with all first loves , the cars that come after ' the one ' have the problem that they must always live in that shadow . my ford fiesta was an affair of the head , not of the heart .
the larger engine , the glossy red exterior , the boxy maturity it exuded in comparison to the bubble-shaped go-kart i had exchanged it for - i was seduced .
buying the fiesta felt like i was moving up the driving ladder .
i had been a fully licensed driver for a year and it was time to get serious .
however , i was left cold - literally . refrigerator on wheels or status symbol ? purchased during the waning weeks of autumn , the fiesta seemed an ideal chariot for the busy life i was now leading .
people with cars had a certain standing within a group of friends and the responsibility of being the designated driver at times was an added ego boost .
people wanted to drive with me . that is until winter hit and i found out that i had to do a steady 70 miles per hour -lrb- 112 kph -rrb- for at least 45 minutes before the heater would even begin to blow anything other than an icy chill into the car .
driving with me had turned into a recurring scene from the keanu reeves movie speed .
if the needle dropped below 70 , those on board were in danger of freezing to death .
however , negotiating roads in december at that speed was also life-threatening and the fiesta was soon in the classifieds and out of my life . but i had not learned my lesson .
again my head was turned .
this time a slinky german number caught my eye .
the teutonic charm of the volkswagen golf was too much and i took the next step up the auto evolutionary ladder … into a nightmare . the breakdown of a relationship within a day of ownership , she 'd died on me .
after suffering the ignominy of being towed back into town , we tried again .
this time the failure was more spectacular as we disappeared in a boom of black smoke which would have made james bond envious as we accelerated away from a roundabout and limped onto the hard shoulder . like any man caught in a destructive affair , words meant nothing .
i was convinced it would all work out .
my hard earned cash went on a new engine and for a while we were happy together .
until the breakdowns started again and i knew it was over .
i managed to get her running long enough to sell her but she was cursed .
a few weeks later , i saw , from my hiding place , the new owner pushing the car along a street . what a fool i 'd been !
how could i have been so easily swayed ?
my next car would be a return to those warm and happy memories of my first love .
this time , the mini was newer , more sophisticated and considerably more expensive .
she was a dream to drive and i honestly felt sad to see her go as i departed for university some 18 months later . maybe it was the realization that you ca n't turn back time or that public transport is much cheaper than owning your own .
whatever it was , i have n't owned a car since . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a mini license for german teens starting tuesday , 16-year-old germans can drive so-called mini cars .

as with many young drivers , the car in its purest form was never enough .
in went the sunroof , on went the wide wheels and straight box double-shotgun exhaust and racing steering wheel .
and the stereo ?
if the gurgling pipes at the back were n't enough to signal my arrival , then my soundsystem would be .
but the love affair was not to last .
i got greedy .
i wanted more . to exchange one love for another always seems like a good idea at the time .
you 're moving on , older and wiser , to new horizons .
you feel you have outgrown your past .
but you soon realize that , as with all first loves , the cars that come after ' the one ' have the problem that they must always live in that shadow . my ford fiesta was an affair of the head , not of the heart .
the larger engine , the glossy red exterior , the boxy maturity it exuded in comparison to the bubble-shaped go-kart i had exchanged it for - i was seduced .
buying the fiesta felt like i was moving up the driving ladder .
i had been a fully licensed driver for a year and it was time to get serious .
however , i was left cold - literally . refrigerator on wheels or status symbol ? purchased during the waning weeks of autumn , the fiesta seemed an ideal chariot for the busy life i was now leading .
people with cars had a certain standing within a group of friends and the responsibility of being the designated driver at times was an added ego boost .
people wanted to drive with me . that is until winter hit and i found out that i had to do a steady 70 miles per hour -lrb- 112 kph -rrb- for at least 45 minutes before the heater would even begin to blow anything other than an icy chill into the car .
driving with me had turned into a recurring scene from the keanu reeves movie speed .
if the needle dropped below 70 , those on board were in danger of freezing to death .
however , negotiating roads in december at that speed was also life-threatening and the fiesta was soon in the classifieds and out of my life . but i had not learned my lesson .
again my head was turned .
this time a slinky german number caught my eye .
the teutonic charm of the volkswagen golf was too much and i took the next step up the auto evolutionary ladder … into a nightmare . the breakdown of a relationship within a day of ownership , she 'd died on me .
after suffering the ignominy of being towed back into town , we tried again .
this time the failure was more spectacular as we disappeared in a boom of black smoke which would have made james bond envious as we accelerated away from a roundabout and limped onto the hard shoulder . like any man caught in a destructive affair , words meant nothing .
i was convinced it would all work out .
my hard earned cash went on a new engine and for a while we were happy together .
until the breakdowns started again and i knew it was over .
i managed to get her running long enough to sell her but she was cursed .
a few weeks later , i saw , from my hiding place , the new owner pushing the car along a street . what a fool i 'd been !
how could i have been so easily swayed ?
my next car would be a return to those warm and happy memories of my first love .
this time , the mini was newer , more sophisticated and considerably more expensive .
she was a dream to drive and i honestly felt sad to see her go as i departed for university some 18 months later . maybe it was the realization that you ca n't turn back time or that public transport is much cheaper than owning your own .

surely it 's just a machine which makes some aspects of our lives easier .
or is it ? a car is something different for everyone .
it could just be a means to an end , the most convenient way of getting to where you want to go .
it could be your work ; it could be your life .
but whatever a car represents , it can be a reference point to a certain time , a reminder of days gone by just as a song or a place can take you back years . a first car is like a first love .
it is something you see others enjoying as you grow up and something that fills your heart with longing , expectation and a little trepidation .
you see the amount of time some drivers spend with their vehicles and you crave that connection ; you see the exhilaration on their faces as they drive and wonder if you will ever feel that joy .
in short , you just ca n't wait until you 're old enough to enjoy those same pleasures . in that way , owning your first car is like a coming of age .
in britain , where i spent the best part of 17 years preparing for the day i was handed the keys to the car door , the age at which you can legally drive comes amid the whirling maelstrom of late adolescence with all its raging hormones and soul-crushing melodrama . but in the eye of this hurricane , you have this proof that you are considered an adult .
you are allowed on the road with all the other grown-ups .
all of life 's troubles at that point can be solved as long as you have a steering wheel to grab and an accelerator to gun .
girlfriends can come and go but as long as you have a tank of gas at the time , so can you . my first getaway car was an austin mini and , i freely admit , i gave myself entirely to that car .
it was bought in a storm from a coastal village for the princely sum of ₤ 70 -lrb- € 101 , $ 133 -rrb- .
i had yet to pass my driving test and my extremely nervous but charitable mother agreed to co-pilot our return with me at the wheel , despite the sheets of rain and booming clouds above .
it was love at first sight .
royal blue flashed with sea air rust , it would be my escape route throughout my mid-teens . the curse of the boy racer or so i thought .
as with many young drivers , the car in its purest form was never enough .

one of the last to speak the language there is a german cardinal who might soon become the next pope . latin 's long lost its status as the world 's lingua franca , but until recently , vatican visitors were able to hear some cardinals converse in what remains the church 's official language . but according to reginald foster , the vatican 's top latinist , the sounds of rome 's days of glory can rarely be heard in the eternal city these days .

the berlin administrative court upheld a decision by the german government in 2001 to award the proceeds from the sale of property formerly owned by the wertheim family to the frankfurt-based jewish claims conference , which is working to recover the family 's assets . karstadtquelle , germany 's largest department store operator , which acquired the wertheim business in 1994 , said it would take its case to the federal administrative court to seek permission to appeal against the judgment .
the company maintains it can not be held liable for what happened under the nazis . the two sites in question on berlin 's leipziger strasse were once home to offices of the wertheim store chain but the nazis took them over in 1933 as part of their policy to seize jewish businesses .
after the war , however , the properties became part of communist east berlin , putting any claims to them on hold until after german reunification , in 1990 .

the plan is not without its critics . in the northern german federal state of schleswig-holstein , the danish minority party ssw has become a decisive factor in forming a post-election coalition government .
social democrats and greens are now courting the small party - which , by agreeing to tolerate the coalition , is now in a position to ask for political favors in the interest of its own voters . the slavonic minority of the sorbs in eastern germany have a vested interest in what happens in schleswig holstein .
they also want to become more influential .
on wednesday , sorbian leaders announced they 'd be forming a minority party of their own before the end of march in a bid for more political clout . the desire for direct influence up to now , the 20,000 protestant sorbs in brandenburg and another 40,000 catholic sorbs in neighboring saxony are only represented by an umbrella organization called domovina , as well as sorbian councils in the state assemblies .
however , neither of the two offer any direct influence on decision-making . elke lorenz , a local counsellor in the sorbian stronghold of bautzen , views the sorbs ' endeavours to found a party of their own with suspicion , and plays down current difficulties . " i would n't say there have ever been grave conflicts between us germans and the sorbs living here , " she said .
" we can look back on many centuries of peaceful coexistence .
of course , the nazi period had a severe impact on our relationship in that the sorbian language and the sorbian party was banned .
but things have long returned to normal . " the next step for sorbian leaders such as hannes kell , though , the re-founding of a party is essential .
he says that increasingly , the sorbs are viewed as a mere folklore ensemble entitled to appear at cultural events in the region .
he calls for more political influence to make sure that sorbian traditions are preserved .
and money plays no small role in this . kell deplores the cutting of subsidies over the past few years .
in 2005 alone , the sorbian minority in brandenburg will get € 152,000 -lrb- $ 200,000 -rrb- less than previously promised by the regional government .
federal allocations are also going down with the government in berlin shelling out € 450,000 less than in the previous year . sorbs on the move bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan nuck leos shatava from the institute of sorbian culture is skeptical about the forming of a party , fearing that it might not get the desired backing from the population on the ground .

" but hannes kell says it 's high time the sorbs entered uncharted territory in unified germany . he 's poised to form the party to be called " serbska ludowa strona , " or sorbian people 's party , in a few weeks ' time .
just like the danish minority party in schleswig-holstein , the sorbian party would not have to clear the five-percent hurdle at elections .

the plan is not without its critics . in the northern german federal state of schleswig-holstein , the danish minority party ssw has become a decisive factor in forming a post-election coalition government .
social democrats and greens are now courting the small party - which , by agreeing to tolerate the coalition , is now in a position to ask for political favors in the interest of its own voters . the slavonic minority of the sorbs in eastern germany have a vested interest in what happens in schleswig holstein .
they also want to become more influential .
on wednesday , sorbian leaders announced they 'd be forming a minority party of their own before the end of march in a bid for more political clout . the desire for direct influence up to now , the 20,000 protestant sorbs in brandenburg and another 40,000 catholic sorbs in neighboring saxony are only represented by an umbrella organization called domovina , as well as sorbian councils in the state assemblies .
however , neither of the two offer any direct influence on decision-making . elke lorenz , a local counsellor in the sorbian stronghold of bautzen , views the sorbs ' endeavours to found a party of their own with suspicion , and plays down current difficulties . " i would n't say there have ever been grave conflicts between us germans and the sorbs living here , " she said .
" we can look back on many centuries of peaceful coexistence .
of course , the nazi period had a severe impact on our relationship in that the sorbian language and the sorbian party was banned .
but things have long returned to normal . " the next step for sorbian leaders such as hannes kell , though , the re-founding of a party is essential .
he says that increasingly , the sorbs are viewed as a mere folklore ensemble entitled to appear at cultural events in the region .
he calls for more political influence to make sure that sorbian traditions are preserved .
and money plays no small role in this . kell deplores the cutting of subsidies over the past few years .
in 2005 alone , the sorbian minority in brandenburg will get € 152,000 -lrb- $ 200,000 -rrb- less than previously promised by the regional government .
federal allocations are also going down with the government in berlin shelling out € 450,000 less than in the previous year . sorbs on the move bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan nuck leos shatava from the institute of sorbian culture is skeptical about the forming of a party , fearing that it might not get the desired backing from the population on the ground .

after a lengthy battle of wills , england coach sven-goran eriksson won his battle to secure a four-week gap before next year 's world cup finals . the fa announced on thursday that the fa cup final , the last game of the domestic season , will be held on saturday , may 13 , 2006 in the first match at the new wembley stadium . world soccer governing body fifa had allowed the fa special dispensation to play next season 's final on may 20 but eriksson maintained england needed the full four weeks ' preparation time . the fa decision to bring forward the date of the final by a week , and the knock-on effect of the premier league ending a week earlier than normal , is more than eriksson could have hoped for after a concerted campaign to give his players extra time to recover from the rigors of domestic action . other european leagues which are hoping to field their national teams in the 2006 spectacle may be less lucky if their 2005/06 fixtures are more or less similar to those of the current season .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 04.03.2005 searching for america 's ambassador großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coats has already left , but a new ambassador has not been named the post of us ambassador to germany has become vacant after daniel coats left the position in february .
a german-american academic is one of the most likely candidates to become the us 's next top diplomat in germany . the new ambassador will have to know germany well , he or she should speak the language and have good connections in washington - these are some of the requirements experts in berlin and the us capital mention when asked about necessary qualifications for the job . this says a lot as coats , a former republican us senator from indiana , was friendly with the white house but did n't know that much about germany when he arrived in 2001 .
the latter especially became a problem during the rift between the us and germany over the war in iraq : coats was unable to be as involved as his predecessor because he lacked the language skills to do so . bildunterschrift : art rendering of the new us embassy at the paris square next to the brandenburg gate , left , in berlin .
construction is currently under way , with completion scheduled for spring 2008 but after us president george w. bush 's friendly praise during his visit to germany on feb .
23 , it seems like " old europe " might regain importance on washington 's political radar screen . professional or buddy ? that 's why the selection of a new ambassador will be an indicator for foreign policy plans during bush 's second term . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john kornblum after all , there 's two ways diplomatic posts are filled by countries around the world : picking a professional or rewarding a buddy , sending an experienced career diplomat from within the foreign ministry or installing a party member and friend .
coats fit the latter category while his predecessor , john kornblum -lrb- photo -rrb- , came from within the us state department . the choice will also show the extent of us secretary of state condoleezza rice 's influence .
the president usually picks ambassadors , but as rice has a very close relationship with bush , the appointment of a rice confidant could serve as a signal for her strong position of power within the administration . an academic ambassador ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard casper so far , the white house has not nominated anyone as coat 's successor .
but one name that keeps coming up is that of gerhard casper , the hamburg-born former president of stanford university .
casper -lrb- photo -rrb- , who emigrated to the us in 1964 , could be an ideal candidate : he knows germany and has a personal connection with rice .
as stanford president , he named her the university 's dean , the institution 's no. 2 job . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elizabeth jones along with casper , elizabeth jones -lrb- photo -rrb- and richard burt -lrb- photo , below -rrb- are also mentioned as potential ambassadors .
jones , the assistant secretary of european and eurasian affairs in the state department , had already been nominated by former president bill clinton to succeed kornblum as ambassador to germany .
but after bush 's election , the new president decided to send coats instead . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard burt burt already served as us ambassador to germany from 1985 to 1989 after he occupied jones ' current position .
while jones probably lacks the necessary ties to the white house and rice , burt 's disadvantage is that he was already in germany during the last phase of the cold war and could hardly be presented as a signal for a fresh start in us-german relations . michael knigge -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bush , schröder say past is past during bilateral talks in mainz , schröder said germany 's disputes with the united states over iraq were in the past .

after a lengthy battle of wills , england coach sven-goran eriksson won his battle to secure a four-week gap before next year 's world cup finals . the fa announced on thursday that the fa cup final , the last game of the domestic season , will be held on saturday , may 13 , 2006 in the first match at the new wembley stadium . world soccer governing body fifa had allowed the fa special dispensation to play next season 's final on may 20 but eriksson maintained england needed the full four weeks ' preparation time . the fa decision to bring forward the date of the final by a week , and the knock-on effect of the premier league ending a week earlier than normal , is more than eriksson could have hoped for after a concerted campaign to give his players extra time to recover from the rigors of domestic action . other european leagues which are hoping to field their national teams in the 2006 spectacle may be less lucky if their 2005/06 fixtures are more or less similar to those of the current season .
fifa has recommended a four-week window between the end of domestic action and the world cup but if some countries fail to take advantage of this , england may have at least two weeks more preparation time than some of their continental rivals . european rivals may be at a disadvantage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany will have at least three weeks before they appear in their world cup .
in germany , the host nation , the bundesliga could come to a close on the weekend of may 20-21 , giving those players involved in jürgen klinsmann 's plans almost three weeks off before the opening game of the world cup in munich on june 9 .
those still involved in the german dfb cup final , which is always played a week after the last league game of the season , will still have two weeks to prepare and recover . ligue 1 in france traditionally comes to a close on the last weekend in may , with the french cup final already over with by the beginning of that month .
french national team players who still ply their trade at home will have a fortnight before the world cup .
italy 's serie a and the spanish primera liga also end on the last weekend in may with the copa italia decided in early may and the copa del rey out of the way in late march . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porto players celebrate as they lift the champions league trophy in 2004 .
players involved on the final in 2006 may have little time to rest before the world cup .
the european competitions also should be out of the way by the end of may 2006 with the champions league final being played in the middle of the last week of the month and the uefa cup a week earlier , around the 18th . while it all sounds rosy for the english , currently leading group six in qualifying , to accommodate this luxury european soccer has to implement some unpopular changes . fa plans have european implications to make sure that a fixture pile-up does n't undo the fa 's work , any fa cup replays in the fifth and sixth rounds of the 2005/06 competition will be scrapped for clubs still involved in european competitions .
teams in the uefa cup will not be required to play replays in the fifth round or quarter-finals .
those in the champions league will not have quarter-final replays and any ties affected will go to extra time and penalties if necessary . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rested players may make for a more exciting world cup in 2006 .
the fa said in a statement that the replay exemptions would only affect next season : " this follows continued positive talks involving the fa , premier league and football league to find an appropriate solution to protecting the tradition and heritage of the fa cup , while allowing for fifa 's four-week window between the end of all major domestic seasons and the start of the world cup . " " the fa believes it is crucial to allow the national team to be given equal preparation time to every other team competing in germany next summer , subject to qualification .
to allow for a full four-week break , the domestic season has to conclude by may 13 .

fifa has recommended a four-week window between the end of domestic action and the world cup but if some countries fail to take advantage of this , england may have at least two weeks more preparation time than some of their continental rivals . european rivals may be at a disadvantage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany will have at least three weeks before they appear in their world cup .
in germany , the host nation , the bundesliga could come to a close on the weekend of may 20-21 , giving those players involved in jürgen klinsmann 's plans almost three weeks off before the opening game of the world cup in munich on june 9 .
those still involved in the german dfb cup final , which is always played a week after the last league game of the season , will still have two weeks to prepare and recover . ligue 1 in france traditionally comes to a close on the last weekend in may , with the french cup final already over with by the beginning of that month .
french national team players who still ply their trade at home will have a fortnight before the world cup .
italy 's serie a and the spanish primera liga also end on the last weekend in may with the copa italia decided in early may and the copa del rey out of the way in late march . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porto players celebrate as they lift the champions league trophy in 2004 .
players involved on the final in 2006 may have little time to rest before the world cup .
the european competitions also should be out of the way by the end of may 2006 with the champions league final being played in the middle of the last week of the month and the uefa cup a week earlier , around the 18th . while it all sounds rosy for the english , currently leading group six in qualifying , to accommodate this luxury european soccer has to implement some unpopular changes . fa plans have european implications to make sure that a fixture pile-up does n't undo the fa 's work , any fa cup replays in the fifth and sixth rounds of the 2005/06 competition will be scrapped for clubs still involved in european competitions .
teams in the uefa cup will not be required to play replays in the fifth round or quarter-finals .
those in the champions league will not have quarter-final replays and any ties affected will go to extra time and penalties if necessary . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rested players may make for a more exciting world cup in 2006 .
the fa said in a statement that the replay exemptions would only affect next season : " this follows continued positive talks involving the fa , premier league and football league to find an appropriate solution to protecting the tradition and heritage of the fa cup , while allowing for fifa 's four-week window between the end of all major domestic seasons and the start of the world cup . " " the fa believes it is crucial to allow the national team to be given equal preparation time to every other team competing in germany next summer , subject to qualification .
to allow for a full four-week break , the domestic season has to conclude by may 13 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 04.03.2005 jewish heirs win real estate dispute großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wertheim family claims central berlin properties worth millions a german court ruled on friday that the descendants of a jewish department store dynasty were entitled to up to € 20 million -lrb- $ 26.2 million -rrb- in compensation , dealing a blow to retail giant karstadtquelle . the ruling is the latest step in a long-running dispute over real estate seized by the nazis in berlin in the 1930s now valued at hundreds of millions of euros .
the berlin administrative court upheld a decision by the german government in 2001 to award the proceeds from the sale of property formerly owned by the wertheim family to the frankfurt-based jewish claims conference , which is working to recover the family 's assets . karstadtquelle , germany 's largest department store operator , which acquired the wertheim business in 1994 , said it would take its case to the federal administrative court to seek permission to appeal against the judgment .
the company maintains it can not be held liable for what happened under the nazis . the two sites in question on berlin 's leipziger strasse were once home to offices of the wertheim store chain but the nazis took them over in 1933 as part of their policy to seize jewish businesses .
after the war , however , the properties became part of communist east berlin , putting any claims to them on hold until after german reunification , in 1990 .
further claims pending bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gideon taylor of the conference on jewish material claims gideon taylor -lrb- photo -rrb- , jewish claims conference executive vice president , welcomed the ruling . " we hope that , with other cases pending , karstadt will finally do the right thing and acknowledge the moral and financial claim on these properties , " he said in a statement .
" this would clear the way for the wertheim family 's stolen assets to be returned even sooner and for justice to finally be done . " the jcc represents wertheim heirs , many of whom now live in the united states .
barbara principe -lrb- photo -rrb- , a 72-year old new jersey grandmother and the oldest living heir , lauded the decision . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barbara principe , wertheim family spokeswoman " this is a great day for our family , " she said .
" it 's the victims and not the big company who were robbed . " the ruling in the test case has implications for another contested site on berlin 's prime-location potsdamer platz , which is now home to a ritz carlton hotel and a cluster of high-rise plush office buildings .
the heirs have contested ownership of seven central berlin properties , including real estate where germany built offices for the federal parliament .
the claims are expected to reach a total of € 400 million -lrb- $ 525 million -rrb- . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de compensation chance for jewish property heirs following a ruling by the federal administrative court , former owners of property at berlin 's newly modelled potsdamer platz can go ahead and officially apply for repatriation .

the berlin administrative court upheld a decision by the german government in 2001 to award the proceeds from the sale of property formerly owned by the wertheim family to the frankfurt-based jewish claims conference , which is working to recover the family 's assets . karstadtquelle , germany 's largest department store operator , which acquired the wertheim business in 1994 , said it would take its case to the federal administrative court to seek permission to appeal against the judgment .
the company maintains it can not be held liable for what happened under the nazis . the two sites in question on berlin 's leipziger strasse were once home to offices of the wertheim store chain but the nazis took them over in 1933 as part of their policy to seize jewish businesses .

surely it 's just a machine which makes some aspects of our lives easier .
or is it ? a car is something different for everyone .
it could just be a means to an end , the most convenient way of getting to where you want to go .
it could be your work ; it could be your life .
but whatever a car represents , it can be a reference point to a certain time , a reminder of days gone by just as a song or a place can take you back years . a first car is like a first love .
it is something you see others enjoying as you grow up and something that fills your heart with longing , expectation and a little trepidation .
you see the amount of time some drivers spend with their vehicles and you crave that connection ; you see the exhilaration on their faces as they drive and wonder if you will ever feel that joy .
in short , you just ca n't wait until you 're old enough to enjoy those same pleasures . in that way , owning your first car is like a coming of age .
in britain , where i spent the best part of 17 years preparing for the day i was handed the keys to the car door , the age at which you can legally drive comes amid the whirling maelstrom of late adolescence with all its raging hormones and soul-crushing melodrama . but in the eye of this hurricane , you have this proof that you are considered an adult .
you are allowed on the road with all the other grown-ups .

surely it 's just a machine which makes some aspects of our lives easier .
or is it ? a car is something different for everyone .
it could just be a means to an end , the most convenient way of getting to where you want to go .
it could be your work ; it could be your life .
but whatever a car represents , it can be a reference point to a certain time , a reminder of days gone by just as a song or a place can take you back years . a first car is like a first love .
it is something you see others enjoying as you grow up and something that fills your heart with longing , expectation and a little trepidation .
you see the amount of time some drivers spend with their vehicles and you crave that connection ; you see the exhilaration on their faces as they drive and wonder if you will ever feel that joy .
in short , you just ca n't wait until you 're old enough to enjoy those same pleasures . in that way , owning your first car is like a coming of age .
in britain , where i spent the best part of 17 years preparing for the day i was handed the keys to the car door , the age at which you can legally drive comes amid the whirling maelstrom of late adolescence with all its raging hormones and soul-crushing melodrama . but in the eye of this hurricane , you have this proof that you are considered an adult .
you are allowed on the road with all the other grown-ups .
all of life 's troubles at that point can be solved as long as you have a steering wheel to grab and an accelerator to gun .
girlfriends can come and go but as long as you have a tank of gas at the time , so can you . my first getaway car was an austin mini and , i freely admit , i gave myself entirely to that car .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 04.03.2005 germans agree to curb smoking großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soon a more common sight in german restaurants and bars moving to protect non-smokers in germany , the federal government and the country 's association of hotels and restaurants have signed an agreement which obliges owners to create non-smoking sections for their customers . the idea is to reserve at least half of the restaurant or hotel space for non-smokers with relevant sections to be created over the next three years .
the agreement came about quickly , as it is a far better option for the hotel business rather than facing draconian anti-smoking measures in public spaces , such as those that have been implemented recently in italy , malta and ireland . the latter countries have already completely banned smoking in public places despite large-scale opposition .
while tobacco-related diseases kill 650,000 eu citizens every year , a ban on smoking in public places has met with particularly fierce opposition in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italians puffed their last cigarettes inside restaurants and bars at the beginning of the year the government is aware of the fact that imposing a total ban on smoking for instance in hotels and restaurants is pretty well impossible .
and so it has been banking on voluntary agreements with corporations profiting from the multi-billion-euro tobacco business . both sides are happy it was a happy marion caspers-merk , under-secretary in the federal health ministry , who announced that the influential association of hotel and restaurant owners had agreed to set up smoke-free sections for their customers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german train stations have viturally banned smoking " we have regulations for the workplace which guarantee each employee a smoke-free environment , if he or she so wishes , " she said .
" we also have strict laws meant to protect young people under the age of 16 from getting hold of tobacco too easily .
and i ’ m glad that our anti-smoking campaign has now reached a new stage with the agreement that 's been signed between the government and the german association of hotels and restaurants . " the association ’ s president , ernst fischer , has promised to implement the agreement as quickly as possible . " people in our business don ’ t want to exclude anyone , " he said .
" we simply want both smokers and non-smokers to feel comfortable in our hotels and restaurants .
and certainly we want to do our best to fulfill the wishes of our customers .
but we don ’ t need a law to ensure this .
if you look around , the spirit of the new agreement is already present in most of the bigger hotels and restaurants where there are bound to be non-smoking sections already in place .
the agreement will make sure that this practice will expand to all of our hotels and restaurants . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : optional non-smoking rooms have become standard in germany marc scherr , press spokesman for the accor hotel chain , insisted that customers should continue to have the choice whether they want to smoke or not .
but his plea for individual freedom deliberately dodges health issues related to passive smoking . " it is praiseworthy to do something for the health of the people , but it is not possible to do that to the disadvantage of our enterprises , " he said , adding that restaurants lost a lot of business after the smoking ban went into effect in new york . " we believe the smoking and the non-smoking can only be solved by market powers , because right now we already have a lot of restaurants in german offering non-smoking zones , " scherr added . eu combats smoking the german government sees the new agreement as conforming with a fresh anti-smoking campaign launched by the european commission .
the campaign will tour all 25 eu capital cities until 2008 and will be coupled with anti-smoking tv ads . the eu campaign comes two days after the who ’ s framework convention on tobacco control went into force .
the treaty which was also signed by germany imposes a ban on tobacco company advertising as well as introducing international standards on labeling , pricing and taxes . hardy graupner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tough on smoking or tough on its ban ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 04.03.2005 the love-hate nature of car ownership großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sometimes happy , sometimes sad : car ownership is a complicated thing is a car just a means of transport or is it much more than that ?
surely it 's just a machine which makes some aspects of our lives easier .
or is it ? a car is something different for everyone .
it could just be a means to an end , the most convenient way of getting to where you want to go .
it could be your work ; it could be your life .
but whatever a car represents , it can be a reference point to a certain time , a reminder of days gone by just as a song or a place can take you back years . a first car is like a first love .
it is something you see others enjoying as you grow up and something that fills your heart with longing , expectation and a little trepidation .
you see the amount of time some drivers spend with their vehicles and you crave that connection ; you see the exhilaration on their faces as they drive and wonder if you will ever feel that joy .
in short , you just ca n't wait until you 're old enough to enjoy those same pleasures . in that way , owning your first car is like a coming of age .
in britain , where i spent the best part of 17 years preparing for the day i was handed the keys to the car door , the age at which you can legally drive comes amid the whirling maelstrom of late adolescence with all its raging hormones and soul-crushing melodrama . but in the eye of this hurricane , you have this proof that you are considered an adult .
you are allowed on the road with all the other grown-ups .
all of life 's troubles at that point can be solved as long as you have a steering wheel to grab and an accelerator to gun .
girlfriends can come and go but as long as you have a tank of gas at the time , so can you . my first getaway car was an austin mini and , i freely admit , i gave myself entirely to that car .
it was bought in a storm from a coastal village for the princely sum of ₤ 70 -lrb- € 101 , $ 133 -rrb- .
i had yet to pass my driving test and my extremely nervous but charitable mother agreed to co-pilot our return with me at the wheel , despite the sheets of rain and booming clouds above .
it was love at first sight .
royal blue flashed with sea air rust , it would be my escape route throughout my mid-teens . the curse of the boy racer or so i thought .
as with many young drivers , the car in its purest form was never enough .
in went the sunroof , on went the wide wheels and straight box double-shotgun exhaust and racing steering wheel .
and the stereo ?
if the gurgling pipes at the back were n't enough to signal my arrival , then my soundsystem would be .
but the love affair was not to last .
i got greedy .
i wanted more . to exchange one love for another always seems like a good idea at the time .
you 're moving on , older and wiser , to new horizons .
you feel you have outgrown your past .
but you soon realize that , as with all first loves , the cars that come after ' the one ' have the problem that they must always live in that shadow . my ford fiesta was an affair of the head , not of the heart .
the larger engine , the glossy red exterior , the boxy maturity it exuded in comparison to the bubble-shaped go-kart i had exchanged it for - i was seduced .
buying the fiesta felt like i was moving up the driving ladder .
i had been a fully licensed driver for a year and it was time to get serious .
however , i was left cold - literally . refrigerator on wheels or status symbol ? purchased during the waning weeks of autumn , the fiesta seemed an ideal chariot for the busy life i was now leading .
people with cars had a certain standing within a group of friends and the responsibility of being the designated driver at times was an added ego boost .
people wanted to drive with me . that is until winter hit and i found out that i had to do a steady 70 miles per hour -lrb- 112 kph -rrb- for at least 45 minutes before the heater would even begin to blow anything other than an icy chill into the car .
driving with me had turned into a recurring scene from the keanu reeves movie speed .
if the needle dropped below 70 , those on board were in danger of freezing to death .
however , negotiating roads in december at that speed was also life-threatening and the fiesta was soon in the classifieds and out of my life . but i had not learned my lesson .
again my head was turned .
this time a slinky german number caught my eye .
the teutonic charm of the volkswagen golf was too much and i took the next step up the auto evolutionary ladder … into a nightmare . the breakdown of a relationship within a day of ownership , she 'd died on me .
after suffering the ignominy of being towed back into town , we tried again .
this time the failure was more spectacular as we disappeared in a boom of black smoke which would have made james bond envious as we accelerated away from a roundabout and limped onto the hard shoulder . like any man caught in a destructive affair , words meant nothing .
i was convinced it would all work out .
my hard earned cash went on a new engine and for a while we were happy together .
until the breakdowns started again and i knew it was over .
i managed to get her running long enough to sell her but she was cursed .
a few weeks later , i saw , from my hiding place , the new owner pushing the car along a street . what a fool i 'd been !
how could i have been so easily swayed ?
my next car would be a return to those warm and happy memories of my first love .
this time , the mini was newer , more sophisticated and considerably more expensive .
she was a dream to drive and i honestly felt sad to see her go as i departed for university some 18 months later . maybe it was the realization that you ca n't turn back time or that public transport is much cheaper than owning your own .
whatever it was , i have n't owned a car since . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a mini license for german teens starting tuesday , 16-year-old germans can drive so-called mini cars .

the agreement came about quickly , as it is a far better option for the hotel business rather than facing draconian anti-smoking measures in public spaces , such as those that have been implemented recently in italy , malta and ireland . the latter countries have already completely banned smoking in public places despite large-scale opposition .
while tobacco-related diseases kill 650,000 eu citizens every year , a ban on smoking in public places has met with particularly fierce opposition in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italians puffed their last cigarettes inside restaurants and bars at the beginning of the year the government is aware of the fact that imposing a total ban on smoking for instance in hotels and restaurants is pretty well impossible .

" we simply want both smokers and non-smokers to feel comfortable in our hotels and restaurants .
and certainly we want to do our best to fulfill the wishes of our customers .
but we don ’ t need a law to ensure this .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 04.03.2005 the love-hate nature of car ownership großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sometimes happy , sometimes sad : car ownership is a complicated thing is a car just a means of transport or is it much more than that ?
surely it 's just a machine which makes some aspects of our lives easier .
or is it ? a car is something different for everyone .
it could just be a means to an end , the most convenient way of getting to where you want to go .
it could be your work ; it could be your life .
but whatever a car represents , it can be a reference point to a certain time , a reminder of days gone by just as a song or a place can take you back years . a first car is like a first love .
it is something you see others enjoying as you grow up and something that fills your heart with longing , expectation and a little trepidation .
you see the amount of time some drivers spend with their vehicles and you crave that connection ; you see the exhilaration on their faces as they drive and wonder if you will ever feel that joy .
in short , you just ca n't wait until you 're old enough to enjoy those same pleasures . in that way , owning your first car is like a coming of age .
in britain , where i spent the best part of 17 years preparing for the day i was handed the keys to the car door , the age at which you can legally drive comes amid the whirling maelstrom of late adolescence with all its raging hormones and soul-crushing melodrama . but in the eye of this hurricane , you have this proof that you are considered an adult .
you are allowed on the road with all the other grown-ups .
all of life 's troubles at that point can be solved as long as you have a steering wheel to grab and an accelerator to gun .
girlfriends can come and go but as long as you have a tank of gas at the time , so can you . my first getaway car was an austin mini and , i freely admit , i gave myself entirely to that car .
it was bought in a storm from a coastal village for the princely sum of ₤ 70 -lrb- € 101 , $ 133 -rrb- .
i had yet to pass my driving test and my extremely nervous but charitable mother agreed to co-pilot our return with me at the wheel , despite the sheets of rain and booming clouds above .
it was love at first sight .
royal blue flashed with sea air rust , it would be my escape route throughout my mid-teens . the curse of the boy racer or so i thought .
as with many young drivers , the car in its purest form was never enough .
in went the sunroof , on went the wide wheels and straight box double-shotgun exhaust and racing steering wheel .
and the stereo ?
if the gurgling pipes at the back were n't enough to signal my arrival , then my soundsystem would be .
but the love affair was not to last .
i got greedy .
i wanted more . to exchange one love for another always seems like a good idea at the time .
you 're moving on , older and wiser , to new horizons .
you feel you have outgrown your past .
but you soon realize that , as with all first loves , the cars that come after ' the one ' have the problem that they must always live in that shadow . my ford fiesta was an affair of the head , not of the heart .
the larger engine , the glossy red exterior , the boxy maturity it exuded in comparison to the bubble-shaped go-kart i had exchanged it for - i was seduced .
buying the fiesta felt like i was moving up the driving ladder .
i had been a fully licensed driver for a year and it was time to get serious .
however , i was left cold - literally . refrigerator on wheels or status symbol ? purchased during the waning weeks of autumn , the fiesta seemed an ideal chariot for the busy life i was now leading .
people with cars had a certain standing within a group of friends and the responsibility of being the designated driver at times was an added ego boost .
people wanted to drive with me . that is until winter hit and i found out that i had to do a steady 70 miles per hour -lrb- 112 kph -rrb- for at least 45 minutes before the heater would even begin to blow anything other than an icy chill into the car .
driving with me had turned into a recurring scene from the keanu reeves movie speed .
if the needle dropped below 70 , those on board were in danger of freezing to death .
however , negotiating roads in december at that speed was also life-threatening and the fiesta was soon in the classifieds and out of my life . but i had not learned my lesson .
again my head was turned .
this time a slinky german number caught my eye .
the teutonic charm of the volkswagen golf was too much and i took the next step up the auto evolutionary ladder … into a nightmare . the breakdown of a relationship within a day of ownership , she 'd died on me .
after suffering the ignominy of being towed back into town , we tried again .
this time the failure was more spectacular as we disappeared in a boom of black smoke which would have made james bond envious as we accelerated away from a roundabout and limped onto the hard shoulder . like any man caught in a destructive affair , words meant nothing .
i was convinced it would all work out .
my hard earned cash went on a new engine and for a while we were happy together .
until the breakdowns started again and i knew it was over .
i managed to get her running long enough to sell her but she was cursed .
a few weeks later , i saw , from my hiding place , the new owner pushing the car along a street . what a fool i 'd been !
how could i have been so easily swayed ?
my next car would be a return to those warm and happy memories of my first love .
this time , the mini was newer , more sophisticated and considerably more expensive .
she was a dream to drive and i honestly felt sad to see her go as i departed for university some 18 months later . maybe it was the realization that you ca n't turn back time or that public transport is much cheaper than owning your own .
whatever it was , i have n't owned a car since . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a mini license for german teens starting tuesday , 16-year-old germans can drive so-called mini cars .

but is he too much of a good thing ? lagerfeld may be fashion 's busiest man .
after his brief flirtation with the world of mass market retail - climaxing with his phenomenally successful limited-edition line for swedish chain hennes & mauritz last november - the german designer has returned to the catwalk for the next leg of his bid for expansion . one of the most anticipated collections of the season , his lagerfeld gallery show on wednesday was his second of three in the space of two weeks .
he unveiled his work for fendi in milan last week and will hit the catwalk again for chanel on friday . " what i like is to be everywhere , " he told reuters .
" i like to have this kind of ubiquity in every sense of the word . " cash for cachet bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as one of the first designers to spark the growing " masstige " trend - the popularity of mass products with designer prestige - lagerfeld single-handedly showed the notoriously haughty world of haute couture that slumming it certainly does n't sully reputations . in paris this week , the german designer made a strong statement with his autumn-winter 2005-06 line , his first since us fashion giant tommy hilfiger bought the label in december . the us company has high hopes for lagerfeld gallery .
" we want to run it as a very upscale couture business , " ceo david dyer told reuters .

floppy fur hats added a finishing touch . lagerfeld sent out his signature slim-leg trousers and crisp white shirts , but the collection took on a generally softer silhouette , with laid-back denim skirts and sheer chiffon dresses with flower detailing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dusty rose and peacock blue added a more feminine allure to the standard black and white , especially for evening .
a full-length pleated goddess gown with a twisted halter neckline in chocolate silk fluttered to the floor . the audience loved it .

surely it 's just a machine which makes some aspects of our lives easier .
or is it ? a car is something different for everyone .
it could just be a means to an end , the most convenient way of getting to where you want to go .
it could be your work ; it could be your life .
but whatever a car represents , it can be a reference point to a certain time , a reminder of days gone by just as a song or a place can take you back years . a first car is like a first love .
it is something you see others enjoying as you grow up and something that fills your heart with longing , expectation and a little trepidation .
you see the amount of time some drivers spend with their vehicles and you crave that connection ; you see the exhilaration on their faces as they drive and wonder if you will ever feel that joy .
in short , you just ca n't wait until you 're old enough to enjoy those same pleasures . in that way , owning your first car is like a coming of age .
in britain , where i spent the best part of 17 years preparing for the day i was handed the keys to the car door , the age at which you can legally drive comes amid the whirling maelstrom of late adolescence with all its raging hormones and soul-crushing melodrama . but in the eye of this hurricane , you have this proof that you are considered an adult .
you are allowed on the road with all the other grown-ups .
all of life 's troubles at that point can be solved as long as you have a steering wheel to grab and an accelerator to gun .
girlfriends can come and go but as long as you have a tank of gas at the time , so can you . my first getaway car was an austin mini and , i freely admit , i gave myself entirely to that car .
it was bought in a storm from a coastal village for the princely sum of ₤ 70 -lrb- € 101 , $ 133 -rrb- .
i had yet to pass my driving test and my extremely nervous but charitable mother agreed to co-pilot our return with me at the wheel , despite the sheets of rain and booming clouds above .
it was love at first sight .
royal blue flashed with sea air rust , it would be my escape route throughout my mid-teens . the curse of the boy racer or so i thought .
as with many young drivers , the car in its purest form was never enough .
in went the sunroof , on went the wide wheels and straight box double-shotgun exhaust and racing steering wheel .
and the stereo ?
if the gurgling pipes at the back were n't enough to signal my arrival , then my soundsystem would be .
but the love affair was not to last .
i got greedy .
i wanted more . to exchange one love for another always seems like a good idea at the time .
you 're moving on , older and wiser , to new horizons .
you feel you have outgrown your past .
but you soon realize that , as with all first loves , the cars that come after ' the one ' have the problem that they must always live in that shadow . my ford fiesta was an affair of the head , not of the heart .
the larger engine , the glossy red exterior , the boxy maturity it exuded in comparison to the bubble-shaped go-kart i had exchanged it for - i was seduced .
buying the fiesta felt like i was moving up the driving ladder .
i had been a fully licensed driver for a year and it was time to get serious .
however , i was left cold - literally . refrigerator on wheels or status symbol ? purchased during the waning weeks of autumn , the fiesta seemed an ideal chariot for the busy life i was now leading .
people with cars had a certain standing within a group of friends and the responsibility of being the designated driver at times was an added ego boost .
people wanted to drive with me . that is until winter hit and i found out that i had to do a steady 70 miles per hour -lrb- 112 kph -rrb- for at least 45 minutes before the heater would even begin to blow anything other than an icy chill into the car .
driving with me had turned into a recurring scene from the keanu reeves movie speed .
if the needle dropped below 70 , those on board were in danger of freezing to death .
however , negotiating roads in december at that speed was also life-threatening and the fiesta was soon in the classifieds and out of my life . but i had not learned my lesson .
again my head was turned .
this time a slinky german number caught my eye .
the teutonic charm of the volkswagen golf was too much and i took the next step up the auto evolutionary ladder … into a nightmare . the breakdown of a relationship within a day of ownership , she 'd died on me .
after suffering the ignominy of being towed back into town , we tried again .
this time the failure was more spectacular as we disappeared in a boom of black smoke which would have made james bond envious as we accelerated away from a roundabout and limped onto the hard shoulder . like any man caught in a destructive affair , words meant nothing .
i was convinced it would all work out .
my hard earned cash went on a new engine and for a while we were happy together .
until the breakdowns started again and i knew it was over .
i managed to get her running long enough to sell her but she was cursed .
a few weeks later , i saw , from my hiding place , the new owner pushing the car along a street . what a fool i 'd been !
how could i have been so easily swayed ?
my next car would be a return to those warm and happy memories of my first love .
this time , the mini was newer , more sophisticated and considerably more expensive .
she was a dream to drive and i honestly felt sad to see her go as i departed for university some 18 months later . maybe it was the realization that you ca n't turn back time or that public transport is much cheaper than owning your own .
whatever it was , i have n't owned a car since . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a mini license for german teens starting tuesday , 16-year-old germans can drive so-called mini cars .

" we believe the smoking and the non-smoking can only be solved by market powers , because right now we already have a lot of restaurants in german offering non-smoking zones , " scherr added . eu combats smoking the german government sees the new agreement as conforming with a fresh anti-smoking campaign launched by the european commission .
the campaign will tour all 25 eu capital cities until 2008 and will be coupled with anti-smoking tv ads . the eu campaign comes two days after the who ’ s framework convention on tobacco control went into force .

the berlin administrative court upheld a decision by the german government in 2001 to award the proceeds from the sale of property formerly owned by the wertheim family to the frankfurt-based jewish claims conference , which is working to recover the family 's assets . karstadtquelle , germany 's largest department store operator , which acquired the wertheim business in 1994 , said it would take its case to the federal administrative court to seek permission to appeal against the judgment .
the company maintains it can not be held liable for what happened under the nazis . the two sites in question on berlin 's leipziger strasse were once home to offices of the wertheim store chain but the nazis took them over in 1933 as part of their policy to seize jewish businesses .
after the war , however , the properties became part of communist east berlin , putting any claims to them on hold until after german reunification , in 1990 .
further claims pending bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gideon taylor of the conference on jewish material claims gideon taylor -lrb- photo -rrb- , jewish claims conference executive vice president , welcomed the ruling . " we hope that , with other cases pending , karstadt will finally do the right thing and acknowledge the moral and financial claim on these properties , " he said in a statement .
" this would clear the way for the wertheim family 's stolen assets to be returned even sooner and for justice to finally be done . " the jcc represents wertheim heirs , many of whom now live in the united states .
barbara principe -lrb- photo -rrb- , a 72-year old new jersey grandmother and the oldest living heir , lauded the decision . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barbara principe , wertheim family spokeswoman " this is a great day for our family , " she said .
" it 's the victims and not the big company who were robbed . " the ruling in the test case has implications for another contested site on berlin 's prime-location potsdamer platz , which is now home to a ritz carlton hotel and a cluster of high-rise plush office buildings .
the heirs have contested ownership of seven central berlin properties , including real estate where germany built offices for the federal parliament .
the claims are expected to reach a total of € 400 million -lrb- $ 525 million -rrb- . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de compensation chance for jewish property heirs following a ruling by the federal administrative court , former owners of property at berlin 's newly modelled potsdamer platz can go ahead and officially apply for repatriation .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 04.03.2005 sorbs aim for party of their own großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sorb minority want more political clout the sorbs - a slavonic minority living in the eastern german federal states of brandenburg and saxony - are poised to found a political party .
the plan is not without its critics . in the northern german federal state of schleswig-holstein , the danish minority party ssw has become a decisive factor in forming a post-election coalition government .
social democrats and greens are now courting the small party - which , by agreeing to tolerate the coalition , is now in a position to ask for political favors in the interest of its own voters . the slavonic minority of the sorbs in eastern germany have a vested interest in what happens in schleswig holstein .
they also want to become more influential .
on wednesday , sorbian leaders announced they 'd be forming a minority party of their own before the end of march in a bid for more political clout . the desire for direct influence up to now , the 20,000 protestant sorbs in brandenburg and another 40,000 catholic sorbs in neighboring saxony are only represented by an umbrella organization called domovina , as well as sorbian councils in the state assemblies .
however , neither of the two offer any direct influence on decision-making . elke lorenz , a local counsellor in the sorbian stronghold of bautzen , views the sorbs ' endeavours to found a party of their own with suspicion , and plays down current difficulties . " i would n't say there have ever been grave conflicts between us germans and the sorbs living here , " she said .
" we can look back on many centuries of peaceful coexistence .
of course , the nazi period had a severe impact on our relationship in that the sorbian language and the sorbian party was banned .
but things have long returned to normal . " the next step for sorbian leaders such as hannes kell , though , the re-founding of a party is essential .
he says that increasingly , the sorbs are viewed as a mere folklore ensemble entitled to appear at cultural events in the region .
he calls for more political influence to make sure that sorbian traditions are preserved .
and money plays no small role in this . kell deplores the cutting of subsidies over the past few years .
in 2005 alone , the sorbian minority in brandenburg will get € 152,000 -lrb- $ 200,000 -rrb- less than previously promised by the regional government .
federal allocations are also going down with the government in berlin shelling out € 450,000 less than in the previous year . sorbs on the move bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan nuck leos shatava from the institute of sorbian culture is skeptical about the forming of a party , fearing that it might not get the desired backing from the population on the ground .
jan nuck -lrb- photo -rrb- from domowina also has his doubts , saying he does n't see " why it would lead to greater influence for the sorbs . " but hannes kell says it 's high time the sorbs entered uncharted territory in unified germany . he 's poised to form the party to be called " serbska ludowa strona , " or sorbian people 's party , in a few weeks ' time .
just like the danish minority party in schleswig-holstein , the sorbian party would not have to clear the five-percent hurdle at elections .
some 20,000 votes would entitle them to send a representative of their own into the regional parliament . hardy graupner -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's struggling ethnic minority on a modest stretch of land in germany 's east saxony and south brandenburg regions , a tiny slavonic nation continues to fight its corner for cultural recognition and " sorb " survival .

the plan is not without its critics . in the northern german federal state of schleswig-holstein , the danish minority party ssw has become a decisive factor in forming a post-election coalition government .
social democrats and greens are now courting the small party - which , by agreeing to tolerate the coalition , is now in a position to ask for political favors in the interest of its own voters . the slavonic minority of the sorbs in eastern germany have a vested interest in what happens in schleswig holstein .

however , neither of the two offer any direct influence on decision-making . elke lorenz , a local counsellor in the sorbian stronghold of bautzen , views the sorbs ' endeavours to found a party of their own with suspicion , and plays down current difficulties .

the berlin administrative court upheld a decision by the german government in 2001 to award the proceeds from the sale of property formerly owned by the wertheim family to the frankfurt-based jewish claims conference , which is working to recover the family 's assets . karstadtquelle , germany 's largest department store operator , which acquired the wertheim business in 1994 , said it would take its case to the federal administrative court to seek permission to appeal against the judgment .
the company maintains it can not be held liable for what happened under the nazis . the two sites in question on berlin 's leipziger strasse were once home to offices of the wertheim store chain but the nazis took them over in 1933 as part of their policy to seize jewish businesses .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 04.03.2005 sorbs aim for party of their own großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sorb minority want more political clout the sorbs - a slavonic minority living in the eastern german federal states of brandenburg and saxony - are poised to found a political party .
the plan is not without its critics . in the northern german federal state of schleswig-holstein , the danish minority party ssw has become a decisive factor in forming a post-election coalition government .
social democrats and greens are now courting the small party - which , by agreeing to tolerate the coalition , is now in a position to ask for political favors in the interest of its own voters . the slavonic minority of the sorbs in eastern germany have a vested interest in what happens in schleswig holstein .
they also want to become more influential .
on wednesday , sorbian leaders announced they 'd be forming a minority party of their own before the end of march in a bid for more political clout . the desire for direct influence up to now , the 20,000 protestant sorbs in brandenburg and another 40,000 catholic sorbs in neighboring saxony are only represented by an umbrella organization called domovina , as well as sorbian councils in the state assemblies .
however , neither of the two offer any direct influence on decision-making . elke lorenz , a local counsellor in the sorbian stronghold of bautzen , views the sorbs ' endeavours to found a party of their own with suspicion , and plays down current difficulties . " i would n't say there have ever been grave conflicts between us germans and the sorbs living here , " she said .
" we can look back on many centuries of peaceful coexistence .
of course , the nazi period had a severe impact on our relationship in that the sorbian language and the sorbian party was banned .
but things have long returned to normal . " the next step for sorbian leaders such as hannes kell , though , the re-founding of a party is essential .
he says that increasingly , the sorbs are viewed as a mere folklore ensemble entitled to appear at cultural events in the region .
he calls for more political influence to make sure that sorbian traditions are preserved .
and money plays no small role in this . kell deplores the cutting of subsidies over the past few years .
in 2005 alone , the sorbian minority in brandenburg will get € 152,000 -lrb- $ 200,000 -rrb- less than previously promised by the regional government .
federal allocations are also going down with the government in berlin shelling out € 450,000 less than in the previous year . sorbs on the move bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan nuck leos shatava from the institute of sorbian culture is skeptical about the forming of a party , fearing that it might not get the desired backing from the population on the ground .
jan nuck -lrb- photo -rrb- from domowina also has his doubts , saying he does n't see " why it would lead to greater influence for the sorbs .

a german-american academic is one of the most likely candidates to become the us 's next top diplomat in germany . the new ambassador will have to know germany well , he or she should speak the language and have good connections in washington - these are some of the requirements experts in berlin and the us capital mention when asked about necessary qualifications for the job . this says a lot as coats , a former republican us senator from indiana , was friendly with the white house but did n't know that much about germany when he arrived in 2001 .
the latter especially became a problem during the rift between the us and germany over the war in iraq : coats was unable to be as involved as his predecessor because he lacked the language skills to do so . bildunterschrift : art rendering of the new us embassy at the paris square next to the brandenburg gate , left , in berlin .
construction is currently under way , with completion scheduled for spring 2008 but after us president george w. bush 's friendly praise during his visit to germany on feb .
23 , it seems like " old europe " might regain importance on washington 's political radar screen . professional or buddy ? that 's why the selection of a new ambassador will be an indicator for foreign policy plans during bush 's second term . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john kornblum after all , there 's two ways diplomatic posts are filled by countries around the world : picking a professional or rewarding a buddy , sending an experienced career diplomat from within the foreign ministry or installing a party member and friend .
coats fit the latter category while his predecessor , john kornblum -lrb- photo -rrb- , came from within the us state department . the choice will also show the extent of us secretary of state condoleezza rice 's influence .
the president usually picks ambassadors , but as rice has a very close relationship with bush , the appointment of a rice confidant could serve as a signal for her strong position of power within the administration . an academic ambassador ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard casper so far , the white house has not nominated anyone as coat 's successor .
but one name that keeps coming up is that of gerhard casper , the hamburg-born former president of stanford university .
casper -lrb- photo -rrb- , who emigrated to the us in 1964 , could be an ideal candidate : he knows germany and has a personal connection with rice .
as stanford president , he named her the university 's dean , the institution 's no. 2 job . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elizabeth jones along with casper , elizabeth jones -lrb- photo -rrb- and richard burt -lrb- photo , below -rrb- are also mentioned as potential ambassadors .
jones , the assistant secretary of european and eurasian affairs in the state department , had already been nominated by former president bill clinton to succeed kornblum as ambassador to germany .
but after bush 's election , the new president decided to send coats instead . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard burt burt already served as us ambassador to germany from 1985 to 1989 after he occupied jones ' current position .
while jones probably lacks the necessary ties to the white house and rice , burt 's disadvantage is that he was already in germany during the last phase of the cold war and could hardly be presented as a signal for a fresh start in us-german relations . michael knigge -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bush , schröder say past is past during bilateral talks in mainz , schröder said germany 's disputes with the united states over iraq were in the past .

a german-american academic is one of the most likely candidates to become the us 's next top diplomat in germany . the new ambassador will have to know germany well , he or she should speak the language and have good connections in washington - these are some of the requirements experts in berlin and the us capital mention when asked about necessary qualifications for the job . this says a lot as coats , a former republican us senator from indiana , was friendly with the white house but did n't know that much about germany when he arrived in 2001 .
the latter especially became a problem during the rift between the us and germany over the war in iraq : coats was unable to be as involved as his predecessor because he lacked the language skills to do so . bildunterschrift : art rendering of the new us embassy at the paris square next to the brandenburg gate , left , in berlin .

one of the last to speak the language there is a german cardinal who might soon become the next pope . latin 's long lost its status as the world 's lingua franca , but until recently , vatican visitors were able to hear some cardinals converse in what remains the church 's official language . but according to reginald foster , the vatican 's top latinist , the sounds of rome 's days of glory can rarely be heard in the eternal city these days . " the cardinals mostly speak italian now , " he told reuters news service .
" most of them studied here so they 're comfortable with it . i joke with cardinals in latin ... and most do n't laugh . " foster added that many church leaders also use french and german to communicate .
that could make things easy for cardinal joseph ratzinger , who has been mentioned as a possible successor to pope john paul ii . according to foster , ratzinger is one of the only remaining fluent latin speakers . the bavarian native , however , has a clear advantage over others : back home , people use " servus , " the latin word for slave , to say good-bye .
and " prost , " the german word for " cheers , " comes from prosit , latin for " may it become . " dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de could a bavarian become pope ?

the company maintains it can not be held liable for what happened under the nazis . the two sites in question on berlin 's leipziger strasse were once home to offices of the wertheim store chain but the nazis took them over in 1933 as part of their policy to seize jewish businesses .

the berlin administrative court upheld a decision by the german government in 2001 to award the proceeds from the sale of property formerly owned by the wertheim family to the frankfurt-based jewish claims conference , which is working to recover the family 's assets . karstadtquelle , germany 's largest department store operator , which acquired the wertheim business in 1994 , said it would take its case to the federal administrative court to seek permission to appeal against the judgment .
the company maintains it can not be held liable for what happened under the nazis . the two sites in question on berlin 's leipziger strasse were once home to offices of the wertheim store chain but the nazis took them over in 1933 as part of their policy to seize jewish businesses .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 04.03.2005 germans agree to curb smoking großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soon a more common sight in german restaurants and bars moving to protect non-smokers in germany , the federal government and the country 's association of hotels and restaurants have signed an agreement which obliges owners to create non-smoking sections for their customers . the idea is to reserve at least half of the restaurant or hotel space for non-smokers with relevant sections to be created over the next three years .
the agreement came about quickly , as it is a far better option for the hotel business rather than facing draconian anti-smoking measures in public spaces , such as those that have been implemented recently in italy , malta and ireland . the latter countries have already completely banned smoking in public places despite large-scale opposition .
while tobacco-related diseases kill 650,000 eu citizens every year , a ban on smoking in public places has met with particularly fierce opposition in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italians puffed their last cigarettes inside restaurants and bars at the beginning of the year the government is aware of the fact that imposing a total ban on smoking for instance in hotels and restaurants is pretty well impossible .
and so it has been banking on voluntary agreements with corporations profiting from the multi-billion-euro tobacco business . both sides are happy it was a happy marion caspers-merk , under-secretary in the federal health ministry , who announced that the influential association of hotel and restaurant owners had agreed to set up smoke-free sections for their customers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german train stations have viturally banned smoking " we have regulations for the workplace which guarantee each employee a smoke-free environment , if he or she so wishes , " she said .
" we also have strict laws meant to protect young people under the age of 16 from getting hold of tobacco too easily .
and i ’ m glad that our anti-smoking campaign has now reached a new stage with the agreement that 's been signed between the government and the german association of hotels and restaurants . " the association ’ s president , ernst fischer , has promised to implement the agreement as quickly as possible . " people in our business don ’ t want to exclude anyone , " he said .
" we simply want both smokers and non-smokers to feel comfortable in our hotels and restaurants .
and certainly we want to do our best to fulfill the wishes of our customers .
but we don ’ t need a law to ensure this .
if you look around , the spirit of the new agreement is already present in most of the bigger hotels and restaurants where there are bound to be non-smoking sections already in place .
the agreement will make sure that this practice will expand to all of our hotels and restaurants . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : optional non-smoking rooms have become standard in germany marc scherr , press spokesman for the accor hotel chain , insisted that customers should continue to have the choice whether they want to smoke or not .
but his plea for individual freedom deliberately dodges health issues related to passive smoking . " it is praiseworthy to do something for the health of the people , but it is not possible to do that to the disadvantage of our enterprises , " he said , adding that restaurants lost a lot of business after the smoking ban went into effect in new york . " we believe the smoking and the non-smoking can only be solved by market powers , because right now we already have a lot of restaurants in german offering non-smoking zones , " scherr added . eu combats smoking the german government sees the new agreement as conforming with a fresh anti-smoking campaign launched by the european commission .
the campaign will tour all 25 eu capital cities until 2008 and will be coupled with anti-smoking tv ads . the eu campaign comes two days after the who ’ s framework convention on tobacco control went into force .
the treaty which was also signed by germany imposes a ban on tobacco company advertising as well as introducing international standards on labeling , pricing and taxes . hardy graupner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tough on smoking or tough on its ban ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 04.03.2005 germans agree to curb smoking großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soon a more common sight in german restaurants and bars moving to protect non-smokers in germany , the federal government and the country 's association of hotels and restaurants have signed an agreement which obliges owners to create non-smoking sections for their customers . the idea is to reserve at least half of the restaurant or hotel space for non-smokers with relevant sections to be created over the next three years .
the agreement came about quickly , as it is a far better option for the hotel business rather than facing draconian anti-smoking measures in public spaces , such as those that have been implemented recently in italy , malta and ireland . the latter countries have already completely banned smoking in public places despite large-scale opposition .
while tobacco-related diseases kill 650,000 eu citizens every year , a ban on smoking in public places has met with particularly fierce opposition in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italians puffed their last cigarettes inside restaurants and bars at the beginning of the year the government is aware of the fact that imposing a total ban on smoking for instance in hotels and restaurants is pretty well impossible .
and so it has been banking on voluntary agreements with corporations profiting from the multi-billion-euro tobacco business . both sides are happy it was a happy marion caspers-merk , under-secretary in the federal health ministry , who announced that the influential association of hotel and restaurant owners had agreed to set up smoke-free sections for their customers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german train stations have viturally banned smoking " we have regulations for the workplace which guarantee each employee a smoke-free environment , if he or she so wishes , " she said .
" we also have strict laws meant to protect young people under the age of 16 from getting hold of tobacco too easily .
and i ’ m glad that our anti-smoking campaign has now reached a new stage with the agreement that 's been signed between the government and the german association of hotels and restaurants . " the association ’ s president , ernst fischer , has promised to implement the agreement as quickly as possible . " people in our business don ’ t want to exclude anyone , " he said .
" we simply want both smokers and non-smokers to feel comfortable in our hotels and restaurants .
and certainly we want to do our best to fulfill the wishes of our customers .
but we don ’ t need a law to ensure this .
if you look around , the spirit of the new agreement is already present in most of the bigger hotels and restaurants where there are bound to be non-smoking sections already in place .
the agreement will make sure that this practice will expand to all of our hotels and restaurants . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : optional non-smoking rooms have become standard in germany marc scherr , press spokesman for the accor hotel chain , insisted that customers should continue to have the choice whether they want to smoke or not .
but his plea for individual freedom deliberately dodges health issues related to passive smoking . " it is praiseworthy to do something for the health of the people , but it is not possible to do that to the disadvantage of our enterprises , " he said , adding that restaurants lost a lot of business after the smoking ban went into effect in new york . " we believe the smoking and the non-smoking can only be solved by market powers , because right now we already have a lot of restaurants in german offering non-smoking zones , " scherr added . eu combats smoking the german government sees the new agreement as conforming with a fresh anti-smoking campaign launched by the european commission .
the campaign will tour all 25 eu capital cities until 2008 and will be coupled with anti-smoking tv ads . the eu campaign comes two days after the who ’ s framework convention on tobacco control went into force .
the treaty which was also signed by germany imposes a ban on tobacco company advertising as well as introducing international standards on labeling , pricing and taxes . hardy graupner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tough on smoking or tough on its ban ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 04.03.2005 germans agree to curb smoking großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soon a more common sight in german restaurants and bars moving to protect non-smokers in germany , the federal government and the country 's association of hotels and restaurants have signed an agreement which obliges owners to create non-smoking sections for their customers . the idea is to reserve at least half of the restaurant or hotel space for non-smokers with relevant sections to be created over the next three years .
the agreement came about quickly , as it is a far better option for the hotel business rather than facing draconian anti-smoking measures in public spaces , such as those that have been implemented recently in italy , malta and ireland . the latter countries have already completely banned smoking in public places despite large-scale opposition .
while tobacco-related diseases kill 650,000 eu citizens every year , a ban on smoking in public places has met with particularly fierce opposition in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italians puffed their last cigarettes inside restaurants and bars at the beginning of the year the government is aware of the fact that imposing a total ban on smoking for instance in hotels and restaurants is pretty well impossible .
and so it has been banking on voluntary agreements with corporations profiting from the multi-billion-euro tobacco business . both sides are happy it was a happy marion caspers-merk , under-secretary in the federal health ministry , who announced that the influential association of hotel and restaurant owners had agreed to set up smoke-free sections for their customers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german train stations have viturally banned smoking " we have regulations for the workplace which guarantee each employee a smoke-free environment , if he or she so wishes , " she said .
" we also have strict laws meant to protect young people under the age of 16 from getting hold of tobacco too easily .
and i ’ m glad that our anti-smoking campaign has now reached a new stage with the agreement that 's been signed between the government and the german association of hotels and restaurants . " the association ’ s president , ernst fischer , has promised to implement the agreement as quickly as possible . " people in our business don ’ t want to exclude anyone , " he said .
" we simply want both smokers and non-smokers to feel comfortable in our hotels and restaurants .
and certainly we want to do our best to fulfill the wishes of our customers .
but we don ’ t need a law to ensure this .
if you look around , the spirit of the new agreement is already present in most of the bigger hotels and restaurants where there are bound to be non-smoking sections already in place .
the agreement will make sure that this practice will expand to all of our hotels and restaurants . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : optional non-smoking rooms have become standard in germany marc scherr , press spokesman for the accor hotel chain , insisted that customers should continue to have the choice whether they want to smoke or not .
but his plea for individual freedom deliberately dodges health issues related to passive smoking . " it is praiseworthy to do something for the health of the people , but it is not possible to do that to the disadvantage of our enterprises , " he said , adding that restaurants lost a lot of business after the smoking ban went into effect in new york . " we believe the smoking and the non-smoking can only be solved by market powers , because right now we already have a lot of restaurants in german offering non-smoking zones , " scherr added . eu combats smoking the german government sees the new agreement as conforming with a fresh anti-smoking campaign launched by the european commission .
the campaign will tour all 25 eu capital cities until 2008 and will be coupled with anti-smoking tv ads . the eu campaign comes two days after the who ’ s framework convention on tobacco control went into force .
the treaty which was also signed by germany imposes a ban on tobacco company advertising as well as introducing international standards on labeling , pricing and taxes . hardy graupner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tough on smoking or tough on its ban ?

after a lengthy battle of wills , england coach sven-goran eriksson won his battle to secure a four-week gap before next year 's world cup finals . the fa announced on thursday that the fa cup final , the last game of the domestic season , will be held on saturday , may 13 , 2006 in the first match at the new wembley stadium . world soccer governing body fifa had allowed the fa special dispensation to play next season 's final on may 20 but eriksson maintained england needed the full four weeks ' preparation time . the fa decision to bring forward the date of the final by a week , and the knock-on effect of the premier league ending a week earlier than normal , is more than eriksson could have hoped for after a concerted campaign to give his players extra time to recover from the rigors of domestic action . other european leagues which are hoping to field their national teams in the 2006 spectacle may be less lucky if their 2005/06 fixtures are more or less similar to those of the current season .
fifa has recommended a four-week window between the end of domestic action and the world cup but if some countries fail to take advantage of this , england may have at least two weeks more preparation time than some of their continental rivals . european rivals may be at a disadvantage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany will have at least three weeks before they appear in their world cup .
in germany , the host nation , the bundesliga could come to a close on the weekend of may 20-21 , giving those players involved in jürgen klinsmann 's plans almost three weeks off before the opening game of the world cup in munich on june 9 .
those still involved in the german dfb cup final , which is always played a week after the last league game of the season , will still have two weeks to prepare and recover . ligue 1 in france traditionally comes to a close on the last weekend in may , with the french cup final already over with by the beginning of that month .
french national team players who still ply their trade at home will have a fortnight before the world cup .
italy 's serie a and the spanish primera liga also end on the last weekend in may with the copa italia decided in early may and the copa del rey out of the way in late march . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porto players celebrate as they lift the champions league trophy in 2004 .
players involved on the final in 2006 may have little time to rest before the world cup .
the european competitions also should be out of the way by the end of may 2006 with the champions league final being played in the middle of the last week of the month and the uefa cup a week earlier , around the 18th . while it all sounds rosy for the english , currently leading group six in qualifying , to accommodate this luxury european soccer has to implement some unpopular changes . fa plans have european implications to make sure that a fixture pile-up does n't undo the fa 's work , any fa cup replays in the fifth and sixth rounds of the 2005/06 competition will be scrapped for clubs still involved in european competitions .
teams in the uefa cup will not be required to play replays in the fifth round or quarter-finals .
those in the champions league will not have quarter-final replays and any ties affected will go to extra time and penalties if necessary . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rested players may make for a more exciting world cup in 2006 .
the fa said in a statement that the replay exemptions would only affect next season : " this follows continued positive talks involving the fa , premier league and football league to find an appropriate solution to protecting the tradition and heritage of the fa cup , while allowing for fifa 's four-week window between the end of all major domestic seasons and the start of the world cup . " " the fa believes it is crucial to allow the national team to be given equal preparation time to every other team competing in germany next summer , subject to qualification .
to allow for a full four-week break , the domestic season has to conclude by may 13 .

the plan is not without its critics . in the northern german federal state of schleswig-holstein , the danish minority party ssw has become a decisive factor in forming a post-election coalition government .
social democrats and greens are now courting the small party - which , by agreeing to tolerate the coalition , is now in a position to ask for political favors in the interest of its own voters . the slavonic minority of the sorbs in eastern germany have a vested interest in what happens in schleswig holstein .
they also want to become more influential .
on wednesday , sorbian leaders announced they 'd be forming a minority party of their own before the end of march in a bid for more political clout . the desire for direct influence up to now , the 20,000 protestant sorbs in brandenburg and another 40,000 catholic sorbs in neighboring saxony are only represented by an umbrella organization called domovina , as well as sorbian councils in the state assemblies .
however , neither of the two offer any direct influence on decision-making . elke lorenz , a local counsellor in the sorbian stronghold of bautzen , views the sorbs ' endeavours to found a party of their own with suspicion , and plays down current difficulties . " i would n't say there have ever been grave conflicts between us germans and the sorbs living here , " she said .
" we can look back on many centuries of peaceful coexistence .
of course , the nazi period had a severe impact on our relationship in that the sorbian language and the sorbian party was banned .
but things have long returned to normal . " the next step for sorbian leaders such as hannes kell , though , the re-founding of a party is essential .
he says that increasingly , the sorbs are viewed as a mere folklore ensemble entitled to appear at cultural events in the region .
he calls for more political influence to make sure that sorbian traditions are preserved .
and money plays no small role in this . kell deplores the cutting of subsidies over the past few years .
in 2005 alone , the sorbian minority in brandenburg will get € 152,000 -lrb- $ 200,000 -rrb- less than previously promised by the regional government .
federal allocations are also going down with the government in berlin shelling out € 450,000 less than in the previous year . sorbs on the move bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan nuck leos shatava from the institute of sorbian culture is skeptical about the forming of a party , fearing that it might not get the desired backing from the population on the ground .
jan nuck -lrb- photo -rrb- from domowina also has his doubts , saying he does n't see " why it would lead to greater influence for the sorbs . " but hannes kell says it 's high time the sorbs entered uncharted territory in unified germany . he 's poised to form the party to be called " serbska ludowa strona , " or sorbian people 's party , in a few weeks ' time .
just like the danish minority party in schleswig-holstein , the sorbian party would not have to clear the five-percent hurdle at elections .
some 20,000 votes would entitle them to send a representative of their own into the regional parliament . hardy graupner -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's struggling ethnic minority on a modest stretch of land in germany 's east saxony and south brandenburg regions , a tiny slavonic nation continues to fight its corner for cultural recognition and " sorb " survival .

surely it 's just a machine which makes some aspects of our lives easier .
or is it ? a car is something different for everyone .
it could just be a means to an end , the most convenient way of getting to where you want to go .
it could be your work ; it could be your life .
but whatever a car represents , it can be a reference point to a certain time , a reminder of days gone by just as a song or a place can take you back years . a first car is like a first love .
it is something you see others enjoying as you grow up and something that fills your heart with longing , expectation and a little trepidation .
you see the amount of time some drivers spend with their vehicles and you crave that connection ; you see the exhilaration on their faces as they drive and wonder if you will ever feel that joy .
in short , you just ca n't wait until you 're old enough to enjoy those same pleasures . in that way , owning your first car is like a coming of age .
in britain , where i spent the best part of 17 years preparing for the day i was handed the keys to the car door , the age at which you can legally drive comes amid the whirling maelstrom of late adolescence with all its raging hormones and soul-crushing melodrama . but in the eye of this hurricane , you have this proof that you are considered an adult .
you are allowed on the road with all the other grown-ups .
all of life 's troubles at that point can be solved as long as you have a steering wheel to grab and an accelerator to gun .
girlfriends can come and go but as long as you have a tank of gas at the time , so can you . my first getaway car was an austin mini and , i freely admit , i gave myself entirely to that car .
it was bought in a storm from a coastal village for the princely sum of ₤ 70 -lrb- € 101 , $ 133 -rrb- .
i had yet to pass my driving test and my extremely nervous but charitable mother agreed to co-pilot our return with me at the wheel , despite the sheets of rain and booming clouds above .
it was love at first sight .
royal blue flashed with sea air rust , it would be my escape route throughout my mid-teens . the curse of the boy racer or so i thought .
as with many young drivers , the car in its purest form was never enough .
in went the sunroof , on went the wide wheels and straight box double-shotgun exhaust and racing steering wheel .
and the stereo ?
if the gurgling pipes at the back were n't enough to signal my arrival , then my soundsystem would be .
but the love affair was not to last .
i got greedy .
i wanted more . to exchange one love for another always seems like a good idea at the time .
you 're moving on , older and wiser , to new horizons .
you feel you have outgrown your past .
but you soon realize that , as with all first loves , the cars that come after ' the one ' have the problem that they must always live in that shadow . my ford fiesta was an affair of the head , not of the heart .
the larger engine , the glossy red exterior , the boxy maturity it exuded in comparison to the bubble-shaped go-kart i had exchanged it for - i was seduced .
buying the fiesta felt like i was moving up the driving ladder .
i had been a fully licensed driver for a year and it was time to get serious .
however , i was left cold - literally . refrigerator on wheels or status symbol ? purchased during the waning weeks of autumn , the fiesta seemed an ideal chariot for the busy life i was now leading .
people with cars had a certain standing within a group of friends and the responsibility of being the designated driver at times was an added ego boost .
people wanted to drive with me . that is until winter hit and i found out that i had to do a steady 70 miles per hour -lrb- 112 kph -rrb- for at least 45 minutes before the heater would even begin to blow anything other than an icy chill into the car .
driving with me had turned into a recurring scene from the keanu reeves movie speed .
if the needle dropped below 70 , those on board were in danger of freezing to death .
however , negotiating roads in december at that speed was also life-threatening and the fiesta was soon in the classifieds and out of my life . but i had not learned my lesson .
again my head was turned .
this time a slinky german number caught my eye .
the teutonic charm of the volkswagen golf was too much and i took the next step up the auto evolutionary ladder … into a nightmare . the breakdown of a relationship within a day of ownership , she 'd died on me .
after suffering the ignominy of being towed back into town , we tried again .
this time the failure was more spectacular as we disappeared in a boom of black smoke which would have made james bond envious as we accelerated away from a roundabout and limped onto the hard shoulder . like any man caught in a destructive affair , words meant nothing .
i was convinced it would all work out .
my hard earned cash went on a new engine and for a while we were happy together .
until the breakdowns started again and i knew it was over .
i managed to get her running long enough to sell her but she was cursed .
a few weeks later , i saw , from my hiding place , the new owner pushing the car along a street . what a fool i 'd been !
how could i have been so easily swayed ?
my next car would be a return to those warm and happy memories of my first love .
this time , the mini was newer , more sophisticated and considerably more expensive .
she was a dream to drive and i honestly felt sad to see her go as i departed for university some 18 months later . maybe it was the realization that you ca n't turn back time or that public transport is much cheaper than owning your own .
whatever it was , i have n't owned a car since . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a mini license for german teens starting tuesday , 16-year-old germans can drive so-called mini cars .

surely it 's just a machine which makes some aspects of our lives easier .
or is it ? a car is something different for everyone .
it could just be a means to an end , the most convenient way of getting to where you want to go .
it could be your work ; it could be your life .
but whatever a car represents , it can be a reference point to a certain time , a reminder of days gone by just as a song or a place can take you back years . a first car is like a first love .
it is something you see others enjoying as you grow up and something that fills your heart with longing , expectation and a little trepidation .
you see the amount of time some drivers spend with their vehicles and you crave that connection ; you see the exhilaration on their faces as they drive and wonder if you will ever feel that joy .
in short , you just ca n't wait until you 're old enough to enjoy those same pleasures . in that way , owning your first car is like a coming of age .
in britain , where i spent the best part of 17 years preparing for the day i was handed the keys to the car door , the age at which you can legally drive comes amid the whirling maelstrom of late adolescence with all its raging hormones and soul-crushing melodrama . but in the eye of this hurricane , you have this proof that you are considered an adult .
you are allowed on the road with all the other grown-ups .
all of life 's troubles at that point can be solved as long as you have a steering wheel to grab and an accelerator to gun .
girlfriends can come and go but as long as you have a tank of gas at the time , so can you . my first getaway car was an austin mini and , i freely admit , i gave myself entirely to that car .
it was bought in a storm from a coastal village for the princely sum of ₤ 70 -lrb- € 101 , $ 133 -rrb- .
i had yet to pass my driving test and my extremely nervous but charitable mother agreed to co-pilot our return with me at the wheel , despite the sheets of rain and booming clouds above .
it was love at first sight .
royal blue flashed with sea air rust , it would be my escape route throughout my mid-teens . the curse of the boy racer or so i thought .
as with many young drivers , the car in its purest form was never enough .
in went the sunroof , on went the wide wheels and straight box double-shotgun exhaust and racing steering wheel .
and the stereo ?
if the gurgling pipes at the back were n't enough to signal my arrival , then my soundsystem would be .
but the love affair was not to last .
i got greedy .
i wanted more . to exchange one love for another always seems like a good idea at the time .
you 're moving on , older and wiser , to new horizons .
you feel you have outgrown your past .
but you soon realize that , as with all first loves , the cars that come after ' the one ' have the problem that they must always live in that shadow . my ford fiesta was an affair of the head , not of the heart .
the larger engine , the glossy red exterior , the boxy maturity it exuded in comparison to the bubble-shaped go-kart i had exchanged it for - i was seduced .
buying the fiesta felt like i was moving up the driving ladder .
i had been a fully licensed driver for a year and it was time to get serious .
however , i was left cold - literally . refrigerator on wheels or status symbol ? purchased during the waning weeks of autumn , the fiesta seemed an ideal chariot for the busy life i was now leading .
people with cars had a certain standing within a group of friends and the responsibility of being the designated driver at times was an added ego boost .
people wanted to drive with me . that is until winter hit and i found out that i had to do a steady 70 miles per hour -lrb- 112 kph -rrb- for at least 45 minutes before the heater would even begin to blow anything other than an icy chill into the car .
driving with me had turned into a recurring scene from the keanu reeves movie speed .
if the needle dropped below 70 , those on board were in danger of freezing to death .
however , negotiating roads in december at that speed was also life-threatening and the fiesta was soon in the classifieds and out of my life . but i had not learned my lesson .
again my head was turned .
this time a slinky german number caught my eye .
the teutonic charm of the volkswagen golf was too much and i took the next step up the auto evolutionary ladder … into a nightmare . the breakdown of a relationship within a day of ownership , she 'd died on me .
after suffering the ignominy of being towed back into town , we tried again .
this time the failure was more spectacular as we disappeared in a boom of black smoke which would have made james bond envious as we accelerated away from a roundabout and limped onto the hard shoulder . like any man caught in a destructive affair , words meant nothing .
i was convinced it would all work out .
my hard earned cash went on a new engine and for a while we were happy together .
until the breakdowns started again and i knew it was over .
i managed to get her running long enough to sell her but she was cursed .
a few weeks later , i saw , from my hiding place , the new owner pushing the car along a street . what a fool i 'd been !
how could i have been so easily swayed ?
my next car would be a return to those warm and happy memories of my first love .
this time , the mini was newer , more sophisticated and considerably more expensive .
she was a dream to drive and i honestly felt sad to see her go as i departed for university some 18 months later . maybe it was the realization that you ca n't turn back time or that public transport is much cheaper than owning your own .
whatever it was , i have n't owned a car since . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a mini license for german teens starting tuesday , 16-year-old germans can drive so-called mini cars .

the plan is not without its critics . in the northern german federal state of schleswig-holstein , the danish minority party ssw has become a decisive factor in forming a post-election coalition government .
social democrats and greens are now courting the small party - which , by agreeing to tolerate the coalition , is now in a position to ask for political favors in the interest of its own voters . the slavonic minority of the sorbs in eastern germany have a vested interest in what happens in schleswig holstein .
they also want to become more influential .
on wednesday , sorbian leaders announced they 'd be forming a minority party of their own before the end of march in a bid for more political clout . the desire for direct influence up to now , the 20,000 protestant sorbs in brandenburg and another 40,000 catholic sorbs in neighboring saxony are only represented by an umbrella organization called domovina , as well as sorbian councils in the state assemblies .
however , neither of the two offer any direct influence on decision-making . elke lorenz , a local counsellor in the sorbian stronghold of bautzen , views the sorbs ' endeavours to found a party of their own with suspicion , and plays down current difficulties . " i would n't say there have ever been grave conflicts between us germans and the sorbs living here , " she said .
" we can look back on many centuries of peaceful coexistence .
of course , the nazi period had a severe impact on our relationship in that the sorbian language and the sorbian party was banned .
but things have long returned to normal . " the next step for sorbian leaders such as hannes kell , though , the re-founding of a party is essential .
he says that increasingly , the sorbs are viewed as a mere folklore ensemble entitled to appear at cultural events in the region .
he calls for more political influence to make sure that sorbian traditions are preserved .
and money plays no small role in this . kell deplores the cutting of subsidies over the past few years .
in 2005 alone , the sorbian minority in brandenburg will get € 152,000 -lrb- $ 200,000 -rrb- less than previously promised by the regional government .
federal allocations are also going down with the government in berlin shelling out € 450,000 less than in the previous year . sorbs on the move bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan nuck leos shatava from the institute of sorbian culture is skeptical about the forming of a party , fearing that it might not get the desired backing from the population on the ground .
jan nuck -lrb- photo -rrb- from domowina also has his doubts , saying he does n't see " why it would lead to greater influence for the sorbs . " but hannes kell says it 's high time the sorbs entered uncharted territory in unified germany . he 's poised to form the party to be called " serbska ludowa strona , " or sorbian people 's party , in a few weeks ' time .
just like the danish minority party in schleswig-holstein , the sorbian party would not have to clear the five-percent hurdle at elections .
some 20,000 votes would entitle them to send a representative of their own into the regional parliament . hardy graupner -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's struggling ethnic minority on a modest stretch of land in germany 's east saxony and south brandenburg regions , a tiny slavonic nation continues to fight its corner for cultural recognition and " sorb " survival .

on wednesday , sorbian leaders announced they 'd be forming a minority party of their own before the end of march in a bid for more political clout . the desire for direct influence up to now , the 20,000 protestant sorbs in brandenburg and another 40,000 catholic sorbs in neighboring saxony are only represented by an umbrella organization called domovina , as well as sorbian councils in the state assemblies .
however , neither of the two offer any direct influence on decision-making . elke lorenz , a local counsellor in the sorbian stronghold of bautzen , views the sorbs ' endeavours to found a party of their own with suspicion , and plays down current difficulties . " i would n't say there have ever been grave conflicts between us germans and the sorbs living here , " she said .
" we can look back on many centuries of peaceful coexistence .
of course , the nazi period had a severe impact on our relationship in that the sorbian language and the sorbian party was banned .
but things have long returned to normal . " the next step for sorbian leaders such as hannes kell , though , the re-founding of a party is essential .
he says that increasingly , the sorbs are viewed as a mere folklore ensemble entitled to appear at cultural events in the region .
he calls for more political influence to make sure that sorbian traditions are preserved .
and money plays no small role in this . kell deplores the cutting of subsidies over the past few years .
in 2005 alone , the sorbian minority in brandenburg will get € 152,000 -lrb- $ 200,000 -rrb- less than previously promised by the regional government .
federal allocations are also going down with the government in berlin shelling out € 450,000 less than in the previous year . sorbs on the move bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan nuck leos shatava from the institute of sorbian culture is skeptical about the forming of a party , fearing that it might not get the desired backing from the population on the ground .
jan nuck -lrb- photo -rrb- from domowina also has his doubts , saying he does n't see " why it would lead to greater influence for the sorbs . " but hannes kell says it 's high time the sorbs entered uncharted territory in unified germany . he 's poised to form the party to be called " serbska ludowa strona , " or sorbian people 's party , in a few weeks ' time .
just like the danish minority party in schleswig-holstein , the sorbian party would not have to clear the five-percent hurdle at elections .
some 20,000 votes would entitle them to send a representative of their own into the regional parliament . hardy graupner -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's struggling ethnic minority on a modest stretch of land in germany 's east saxony and south brandenburg regions , a tiny slavonic nation continues to fight its corner for cultural recognition and " sorb " survival .

8 , 2005 -rrb- opinion : who 's afraid of the sorbs ?
numerous politicians have recently called on muslims to increase their efforts to integrate into german society .
but germany should n't become fixated on the issue of parallel societies , according to dw 's peter philipp . -lrb- nov .

the plan is not without its critics . in the northern german federal state of schleswig-holstein , the danish minority party ssw has become a decisive factor in forming a post-election coalition government .
social democrats and greens are now courting the small party - which , by agreeing to tolerate the coalition , is now in a position to ask for political favors in the interest of its own voters . the slavonic minority of the sorbs in eastern germany have a vested interest in what happens in schleswig holstein .

a german-american academic is one of the most likely candidates to become the us 's next top diplomat in germany . the new ambassador will have to know germany well , he or she should speak the language and have good connections in washington - these are some of the requirements experts in berlin and the us capital mention when asked about necessary qualifications for the job . this says a lot as coats , a former republican us senator from indiana , was friendly with the white house but did n't know that much about germany when he arrived in 2001 .

a german-american academic is one of the most likely candidates to become the us 's next top diplomat in germany . the new ambassador will have to know germany well , he or she should speak the language and have good connections in washington - these are some of the requirements experts in berlin and the us capital mention when asked about necessary qualifications for the job . this says a lot as coats , a former republican us senator from indiana , was friendly with the white house but did n't know that much about germany when he arrived in 2001 .
the latter especially became a problem during the rift between the us and germany over the war in iraq : coats was unable to be as involved as his predecessor because he lacked the language skills to do so . bildunterschrift : art rendering of the new us embassy at the paris square next to the brandenburg gate , left , in berlin .

cardinal joachim meisner , cologne 's archbishop , told reporters the pope " had a much stronger voice than i expected , " and had said he was happy the cardinal was there .
" i told him it was very important that he make the visit to cologne in august , " meisner told journalists at the gemelli hospital where the 84-year-old pope has spent the last seven days recovering from a throat operation to ease breathing difficulties .
" everybody is waiting for the holy father to be in cologne in august , and i told him that it is n't necessary to speak with many young people but it is important that he be present , " said meisner .
the vatican had already pencilled in the trip to cologne next august , but john paul 's ii 's second hospitalization in a month has cast doubt on whether he would be well enough to make what would be his 105th foreign visit as pope . dw-world.de could a bavarian become pope ?
while some priests say talk of a papal resignation is in bad taste , others are looking for the man who will come after john paul ii , and there 's a chance it might be german cardinal joseph ratzinger -lrb- feb .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 04.03.2005 germans agree to curb smoking großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soon a more common sight in german restaurants and bars moving to protect non-smokers in germany , the federal government and the country 's association of hotels and restaurants have signed an agreement which obliges owners to create non-smoking sections for their customers . the idea is to reserve at least half of the restaurant or hotel space for non-smokers with relevant sections to be created over the next three years .
the agreement came about quickly , as it is a far better option for the hotel business rather than facing draconian anti-smoking measures in public spaces , such as those that have been implemented recently in italy , malta and ireland . the latter countries have already completely banned smoking in public places despite large-scale opposition .
while tobacco-related diseases kill 650,000 eu citizens every year , a ban on smoking in public places has met with particularly fierce opposition in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italians puffed their last cigarettes inside restaurants and bars at the beginning of the year the government is aware of the fact that imposing a total ban on smoking for instance in hotels and restaurants is pretty well impossible .
and so it has been banking on voluntary agreements with corporations profiting from the multi-billion-euro tobacco business . both sides are happy it was a happy marion caspers-merk , under-secretary in the federal health ministry , who announced that the influential association of hotel and restaurant owners had agreed to set up smoke-free sections for their customers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german train stations have viturally banned smoking " we have regulations for the workplace which guarantee each employee a smoke-free environment , if he or she so wishes , " she said .
" we also have strict laws meant to protect young people under the age of 16 from getting hold of tobacco too easily .
and i ’ m glad that our anti-smoking campaign has now reached a new stage with the agreement that 's been signed between the government and the german association of hotels and restaurants . " the association ’ s president , ernst fischer , has promised to implement the agreement as quickly as possible . " people in our business don ’ t want to exclude anyone , " he said .
" we simply want both smokers and non-smokers to feel comfortable in our hotels and restaurants .
and certainly we want to do our best to fulfill the wishes of our customers .
but we don ’ t need a law to ensure this .

the agreement came about quickly , as it is a far better option for the hotel business rather than facing draconian anti-smoking measures in public spaces , such as those that have been implemented recently in italy , malta and ireland . the latter countries have already completely banned smoking in public places despite large-scale opposition .
while tobacco-related diseases kill 650,000 eu citizens every year , a ban on smoking in public places has met with particularly fierce opposition in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italians puffed their last cigarettes inside restaurants and bars at the beginning of the year the government is aware of the fact that imposing a total ban on smoking for instance in hotels and restaurants is pretty well impossible .
and so it has been banking on voluntary agreements with corporations profiting from the multi-billion-euro tobacco business . both sides are happy it was a happy marion caspers-merk , under-secretary in the federal health ministry , who announced that the influential association of hotel and restaurant owners had agreed to set up smoke-free sections for their customers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german train stations have viturally banned smoking " we have regulations for the workplace which guarantee each employee a smoke-free environment , if he or she so wishes , " she said .
" we also have strict laws meant to protect young people under the age of 16 from getting hold of tobacco too easily .
and i ’ m glad that our anti-smoking campaign has now reached a new stage with the agreement that 's been signed between the government and the german association of hotels and restaurants . " the association ’ s president , ernst fischer , has promised to implement the agreement as quickly as possible . " people in our business don ’ t want to exclude anyone , " he said .
" we simply want both smokers and non-smokers to feel comfortable in our hotels and restaurants .
and certainly we want to do our best to fulfill the wishes of our customers .
but we don ’ t need a law to ensure this .

surely it 's just a machine which makes some aspects of our lives easier .
or is it ? a car is something different for everyone .
it could just be a means to an end , the most convenient way of getting to where you want to go .
it could be your work ; it could be your life .
but whatever a car represents , it can be a reference point to a certain time , a reminder of days gone by just as a song or a place can take you back years . a first car is like a first love .
it is something you see others enjoying as you grow up and something that fills your heart with longing , expectation and a little trepidation .
you see the amount of time some drivers spend with their vehicles and you crave that connection ; you see the exhilaration on their faces as they drive and wonder if you will ever feel that joy .
in short , you just ca n't wait until you 're old enough to enjoy those same pleasures . in that way , owning your first car is like a coming of age .
in britain , where i spent the best part of 17 years preparing for the day i was handed the keys to the car door , the age at which you can legally drive comes amid the whirling maelstrom of late adolescence with all its raging hormones and soul-crushing melodrama . but in the eye of this hurricane , you have this proof that you are considered an adult .
you are allowed on the road with all the other grown-ups .
all of life 's troubles at that point can be solved as long as you have a steering wheel to grab and an accelerator to gun .
girlfriends can come and go but as long as you have a tank of gas at the time , so can you . my first getaway car was an austin mini and , i freely admit , i gave myself entirely to that car .
it was bought in a storm from a coastal village for the princely sum of ₤ 70 -lrb- € 101 , $ 133 -rrb- .
i had yet to pass my driving test and my extremely nervous but charitable mother agreed to co-pilot our return with me at the wheel , despite the sheets of rain and booming clouds above .
it was love at first sight .
royal blue flashed with sea air rust , it would be my escape route throughout my mid-teens . the curse of the boy racer or so i thought .
as with many young drivers , the car in its purest form was never enough .
in went the sunroof , on went the wide wheels and straight box double-shotgun exhaust and racing steering wheel .
and the stereo ?
if the gurgling pipes at the back were n't enough to signal my arrival , then my soundsystem would be .
but the love affair was not to last .
i got greedy .
i wanted more . to exchange one love for another always seems like a good idea at the time .
you 're moving on , older and wiser , to new horizons .
you feel you have outgrown your past .
but you soon realize that , as with all first loves , the cars that come after ' the one ' have the problem that they must always live in that shadow . my ford fiesta was an affair of the head , not of the heart .
the larger engine , the glossy red exterior , the boxy maturity it exuded in comparison to the bubble-shaped go-kart i had exchanged it for - i was seduced .
buying the fiesta felt like i was moving up the driving ladder .
i had been a fully licensed driver for a year and it was time to get serious .
however , i was left cold - literally . refrigerator on wheels or status symbol ? purchased during the waning weeks of autumn , the fiesta seemed an ideal chariot for the busy life i was now leading .
people with cars had a certain standing within a group of friends and the responsibility of being the designated driver at times was an added ego boost .
people wanted to drive with me . that is until winter hit and i found out that i had to do a steady 70 miles per hour -lrb- 112 kph -rrb- for at least 45 minutes before the heater would even begin to blow anything other than an icy chill into the car .
driving with me had turned into a recurring scene from the keanu reeves movie speed .
if the needle dropped below 70 , those on board were in danger of freezing to death .
however , negotiating roads in december at that speed was also life-threatening and the fiesta was soon in the classifieds and out of my life . but i had not learned my lesson .
again my head was turned .
this time a slinky german number caught my eye .
the teutonic charm of the volkswagen golf was too much and i took the next step up the auto evolutionary ladder … into a nightmare . the breakdown of a relationship within a day of ownership , she 'd died on me .
after suffering the ignominy of being towed back into town , we tried again .
this time the failure was more spectacular as we disappeared in a boom of black smoke which would have made james bond envious as we accelerated away from a roundabout and limped onto the hard shoulder . like any man caught in a destructive affair , words meant nothing .
i was convinced it would all work out .
my hard earned cash went on a new engine and for a while we were happy together .
until the breakdowns started again and i knew it was over .
i managed to get her running long enough to sell her but she was cursed .
a few weeks later , i saw , from my hiding place , the new owner pushing the car along a street . what a fool i 'd been !
how could i have been so easily swayed ?
my next car would be a return to those warm and happy memories of my first love .
this time , the mini was newer , more sophisticated and considerably more expensive .
she was a dream to drive and i honestly felt sad to see her go as i departed for university some 18 months later . maybe it was the realization that you ca n't turn back time or that public transport is much cheaper than owning your own .
whatever it was , i have n't owned a car since . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a mini license for german teens starting tuesday , 16-year-old germans can drive so-called mini cars .

surely it 's just a machine which makes some aspects of our lives easier .
or is it ? a car is something different for everyone .
it could just be a means to an end , the most convenient way of getting to where you want to go .
it could be your work ; it could be your life .
but whatever a car represents , it can be a reference point to a certain time , a reminder of days gone by just as a song or a place can take you back years . a first car is like a first love .
it is something you see others enjoying as you grow up and something that fills your heart with longing , expectation and a little trepidation .
you see the amount of time some drivers spend with their vehicles and you crave that connection ; you see the exhilaration on their faces as they drive and wonder if you will ever feel that joy .
in short , you just ca n't wait until you 're old enough to enjoy those same pleasures . in that way , owning your first car is like a coming of age .
in britain , where i spent the best part of 17 years preparing for the day i was handed the keys to the car door , the age at which you can legally drive comes amid the whirling maelstrom of late adolescence with all its raging hormones and soul-crushing melodrama . but in the eye of this hurricane , you have this proof that you are considered an adult .
you are allowed on the road with all the other grown-ups .
all of life 's troubles at that point can be solved as long as you have a steering wheel to grab and an accelerator to gun .
girlfriends can come and go but as long as you have a tank of gas at the time , so can you . my first getaway car was an austin mini and , i freely admit , i gave myself entirely to that car .
it was bought in a storm from a coastal village for the princely sum of ₤ 70 -lrb- € 101 , $ 133 -rrb- .
i had yet to pass my driving test and my extremely nervous but charitable mother agreed to co-pilot our return with me at the wheel , despite the sheets of rain and booming clouds above .
it was love at first sight .
royal blue flashed with sea air rust , it would be my escape route throughout my mid-teens . the curse of the boy racer or so i thought .
as with many young drivers , the car in its purest form was never enough .
in went the sunroof , on went the wide wheels and straight box double-shotgun exhaust and racing steering wheel .
and the stereo ?
if the gurgling pipes at the back were n't enough to signal my arrival , then my soundsystem would be .
but the love affair was not to last .
i got greedy .
i wanted more . to exchange one love for another always seems like a good idea at the time .
you 're moving on , older and wiser , to new horizons .
you feel you have outgrown your past .
but you soon realize that , as with all first loves , the cars that come after ' the one ' have the problem that they must always live in that shadow . my ford fiesta was an affair of the head , not of the heart .
the larger engine , the glossy red exterior , the boxy maturity it exuded in comparison to the bubble-shaped go-kart i had exchanged it for - i was seduced .
buying the fiesta felt like i was moving up the driving ladder .
i had been a fully licensed driver for a year and it was time to get serious .
however , i was left cold - literally . refrigerator on wheels or status symbol ? purchased during the waning weeks of autumn , the fiesta seemed an ideal chariot for the busy life i was now leading .
people with cars had a certain standing within a group of friends and the responsibility of being the designated driver at times was an added ego boost .
people wanted to drive with me . that is until winter hit and i found out that i had to do a steady 70 miles per hour -lrb- 112 kph -rrb- for at least 45 minutes before the heater would even begin to blow anything other than an icy chill into the car .
driving with me had turned into a recurring scene from the keanu reeves movie speed .
if the needle dropped below 70 , those on board were in danger of freezing to death .
however , negotiating roads in december at that speed was also life-threatening and the fiesta was soon in the classifieds and out of my life . but i had not learned my lesson .
again my head was turned .
this time a slinky german number caught my eye .
the teutonic charm of the volkswagen golf was too much and i took the next step up the auto evolutionary ladder … into a nightmare . the breakdown of a relationship within a day of ownership , she 'd died on me .
after suffering the ignominy of being towed back into town , we tried again .
this time the failure was more spectacular as we disappeared in a boom of black smoke which would have made james bond envious as we accelerated away from a roundabout and limped onto the hard shoulder . like any man caught in a destructive affair , words meant nothing .
i was convinced it would all work out .
my hard earned cash went on a new engine and for a while we were happy together .
until the breakdowns started again and i knew it was over .
i managed to get her running long enough to sell her but she was cursed .
a few weeks later , i saw , from my hiding place , the new owner pushing the car along a street . what a fool i 'd been !
how could i have been so easily swayed ?
my next car would be a return to those warm and happy memories of my first love .
this time , the mini was newer , more sophisticated and considerably more expensive .
she was a dream to drive and i honestly felt sad to see her go as i departed for university some 18 months later . maybe it was the realization that you ca n't turn back time or that public transport is much cheaper than owning your own .
whatever it was , i have n't owned a car since . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a mini license for german teens starting tuesday , 16-year-old germans can drive so-called mini cars .

but is he too much of a good thing ? lagerfeld may be fashion 's busiest man .
after his brief flirtation with the world of mass market retail - climaxing with his phenomenally successful limited-edition line for swedish chain hennes & mauritz last november - the german designer has returned to the catwalk for the next leg of his bid for expansion . one of the most anticipated collections of the season , his lagerfeld gallery show on wednesday was his second of three in the space of two weeks .
he unveiled his work for fendi in milan last week and will hit the catwalk again for chanel on friday . " what i like is to be everywhere , " he told reuters .
" i like to have this kind of ubiquity in every sense of the word . " cash for cachet bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as one of the first designers to spark the growing " masstige " trend - the popularity of mass products with designer prestige - lagerfeld single-handedly showed the notoriously haughty world of haute couture that slumming it certainly does n't sully reputations . in paris this week , the german designer made a strong statement with his autumn-winter 2005-06 line , his first since us fashion giant tommy hilfiger bought the label in december . the us company has high hopes for lagerfeld gallery .
" we want to run it as a very upscale couture business , " ceo david dyer told reuters .
" we 're looking to be a multi-brand , multi-channel company .
i do n't think you can get any better than karl lagerfeld , so we think we started with the crown jewels . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : proving once again that his business sense is as impeccable as his taste , lagerfeld benefits from hilfiger 's financial clout and position in the key us market , while in return , the outfit gets to bask in the reflected glory of lagerfeld 's quintessentially european chic . an eye for the iconic bildunterschrift : as prince 's " u got the look " blared from the sound system , lagerfeld 's models strutted out in loads of fur , from sumptuous black astrakhan coats to short mink-covered boots to lush high collars that obscured the face . with his customary eye for the iconic , the designer even offered electronic message belts covered in fur that contained a tiny digital screen with the words " lagerfeld gallery " continuously scrolling by in red .

surely it 's just a machine which makes some aspects of our lives easier .
or is it ? a car is something different for everyone .
it could just be a means to an end , the most convenient way of getting to where you want to go .
it could be your work ; it could be your life .
but whatever a car represents , it can be a reference point to a certain time , a reminder of days gone by just as a song or a place can take you back years . a first car is like a first love .
it is something you see others enjoying as you grow up and something that fills your heart with longing , expectation and a little trepidation .
you see the amount of time some drivers spend with their vehicles and you crave that connection ; you see the exhilaration on their faces as they drive and wonder if you will ever feel that joy .
in short , you just ca n't wait until you 're old enough to enjoy those same pleasures . in that way , owning your first car is like a coming of age .
in britain , where i spent the best part of 17 years preparing for the day i was handed the keys to the car door , the age at which you can legally drive comes amid the whirling maelstrom of late adolescence with all its raging hormones and soul-crushing melodrama . but in the eye of this hurricane , you have this proof that you are considered an adult .
you are allowed on the road with all the other grown-ups .
all of life 's troubles at that point can be solved as long as you have a steering wheel to grab and an accelerator to gun .
girlfriends can come and go but as long as you have a tank of gas at the time , so can you . my first getaway car was an austin mini and , i freely admit , i gave myself entirely to that car .
it was bought in a storm from a coastal village for the princely sum of ₤ 70 -lrb- € 101 , $ 133 -rrb- .
i had yet to pass my driving test and my extremely nervous but charitable mother agreed to co-pilot our return with me at the wheel , despite the sheets of rain and booming clouds above .
it was love at first sight .
royal blue flashed with sea air rust , it would be my escape route throughout my mid-teens . the curse of the boy racer or so i thought .
as with many young drivers , the car in its purest form was never enough .
in went the sunroof , on went the wide wheels and straight box double-shotgun exhaust and racing steering wheel .
and the stereo ?
if the gurgling pipes at the back were n't enough to signal my arrival , then my soundsystem would be .
but the love affair was not to last .
i got greedy .
i wanted more . to exchange one love for another always seems like a good idea at the time .
you 're moving on , older and wiser , to new horizons .
you feel you have outgrown your past .
but you soon realize that , as with all first loves , the cars that come after ' the one ' have the problem that they must always live in that shadow . my ford fiesta was an affair of the head , not of the heart .
the larger engine , the glossy red exterior , the boxy maturity it exuded in comparison to the bubble-shaped go-kart i had exchanged it for - i was seduced .
buying the fiesta felt like i was moving up the driving ladder .
i had been a fully licensed driver for a year and it was time to get serious .
however , i was left cold - literally . refrigerator on wheels or status symbol ? purchased during the waning weeks of autumn , the fiesta seemed an ideal chariot for the busy life i was now leading .
people with cars had a certain standing within a group of friends and the responsibility of being the designated driver at times was an added ego boost .
people wanted to drive with me . that is until winter hit and i found out that i had to do a steady 70 miles per hour -lrb- 112 kph -rrb- for at least 45 minutes before the heater would even begin to blow anything other than an icy chill into the car .
driving with me had turned into a recurring scene from the keanu reeves movie speed .
if the needle dropped below 70 , those on board were in danger of freezing to death .
however , negotiating roads in december at that speed was also life-threatening and the fiesta was soon in the classifieds and out of my life . but i had not learned my lesson .
again my head was turned .
this time a slinky german number caught my eye .
the teutonic charm of the volkswagen golf was too much and i took the next step up the auto evolutionary ladder … into a nightmare . the breakdown of a relationship within a day of ownership , she 'd died on me .
after suffering the ignominy of being towed back into town , we tried again .
this time the failure was more spectacular as we disappeared in a boom of black smoke which would have made james bond envious as we accelerated away from a roundabout and limped onto the hard shoulder . like any man caught in a destructive affair , words meant nothing .
i was convinced it would all work out .
my hard earned cash went on a new engine and for a while we were happy together .
until the breakdowns started again and i knew it was over .
i managed to get her running long enough to sell her but she was cursed .
a few weeks later , i saw , from my hiding place , the new owner pushing the car along a street . what a fool i 'd been !
how could i have been so easily swayed ?
my next car would be a return to those warm and happy memories of my first love .
this time , the mini was newer , more sophisticated and considerably more expensive .
she was a dream to drive and i honestly felt sad to see her go as i departed for university some 18 months later . maybe it was the realization that you ca n't turn back time or that public transport is much cheaper than owning your own .
whatever it was , i have n't owned a car since . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a mini license for german teens starting tuesday , 16-year-old germans can drive so-called mini cars .

it could just be a means to an end , the most convenient way of getting to where you want to go .
it could be your work ; it could be your life .
but whatever a car represents , it can be a reference point to a certain time , a reminder of days gone by just as a song or a place can take you back years . a first car is like a first love .
it is something you see others enjoying as you grow up and something that fills your heart with longing , expectation and a little trepidation .
you see the amount of time some drivers spend with their vehicles and you crave that connection ; you see the exhilaration on their faces as they drive and wonder if you will ever feel that joy .
in short , you just ca n't wait until you 're old enough to enjoy those same pleasures . in that way , owning your first car is like a coming of age .
in britain , where i spent the best part of 17 years preparing for the day i was handed the keys to the car door , the age at which you can legally drive comes amid the whirling maelstrom of late adolescence with all its raging hormones and soul-crushing melodrama . but in the eye of this hurricane , you have this proof that you are considered an adult .
you are allowed on the road with all the other grown-ups .
all of life 's troubles at that point can be solved as long as you have a steering wheel to grab and an accelerator to gun .
girlfriends can come and go but as long as you have a tank of gas at the time , so can you . my first getaway car was an austin mini and , i freely admit , i gave myself entirely to that car .
it was bought in a storm from a coastal village for the princely sum of ₤ 70 -lrb- € 101 , $ 133 -rrb- .
i had yet to pass my driving test and my extremely nervous but charitable mother agreed to co-pilot our return with me at the wheel , despite the sheets of rain and booming clouds above .
it was love at first sight .
royal blue flashed with sea air rust , it would be my escape route throughout my mid-teens . the curse of the boy racer or so i thought .
as with many young drivers , the car in its purest form was never enough .
in went the sunroof , on went the wide wheels and straight box double-shotgun exhaust and racing steering wheel .
and the stereo ?
if the gurgling pipes at the back were n't enough to signal my arrival , then my soundsystem would be .
but the love affair was not to last .
i got greedy .
i wanted more . to exchange one love for another always seems like a good idea at the time .
you 're moving on , older and wiser , to new horizons .
you feel you have outgrown your past .
but you soon realize that , as with all first loves , the cars that come after ' the one ' have the problem that they must always live in that shadow . my ford fiesta was an affair of the head , not of the heart .
the larger engine , the glossy red exterior , the boxy maturity it exuded in comparison to the bubble-shaped go-kart i had exchanged it for - i was seduced .
buying the fiesta felt like i was moving up the driving ladder .
i had been a fully licensed driver for a year and it was time to get serious .
however , i was left cold - literally . refrigerator on wheels or status symbol ? purchased during the waning weeks of autumn , the fiesta seemed an ideal chariot for the busy life i was now leading .
people with cars had a certain standing within a group of friends and the responsibility of being the designated driver at times was an added ego boost .
people wanted to drive with me . that is until winter hit and i found out that i had to do a steady 70 miles per hour -lrb- 112 kph -rrb- for at least 45 minutes before the heater would even begin to blow anything other than an icy chill into the car .
driving with me had turned into a recurring scene from the keanu reeves movie speed .
if the needle dropped below 70 , those on board were in danger of freezing to death .
however , negotiating roads in december at that speed was also life-threatening and the fiesta was soon in the classifieds and out of my life . but i had not learned my lesson .
again my head was turned .
this time a slinky german number caught my eye .
the teutonic charm of the volkswagen golf was too much and i took the next step up the auto evolutionary ladder … into a nightmare . the breakdown of a relationship within a day of ownership , she 'd died on me .
after suffering the ignominy of being towed back into town , we tried again .
this time the failure was more spectacular as we disappeared in a boom of black smoke which would have made james bond envious as we accelerated away from a roundabout and limped onto the hard shoulder . like any man caught in a destructive affair , words meant nothing .
i was convinced it would all work out .
my hard earned cash went on a new engine and for a while we were happy together .
until the breakdowns started again and i knew it was over .
i managed to get her running long enough to sell her but she was cursed .
a few weeks later , i saw , from my hiding place , the new owner pushing the car along a street . what a fool i 'd been !
how could i have been so easily swayed ?
my next car would be a return to those warm and happy memories of my first love .
this time , the mini was newer , more sophisticated and considerably more expensive .
she was a dream to drive and i honestly felt sad to see her go as i departed for university some 18 months later . maybe it was the realization that you ca n't turn back time or that public transport is much cheaper than owning your own .
whatever it was , i have n't owned a car since . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a mini license for german teens starting tuesday , 16-year-old germans can drive so-called mini cars .
the controversial vehicles are not deemed safe by everyone but eu officials required germany to allow teens to drive them anyway .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 04.03.2005 the love-hate nature of car ownership großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sometimes happy , sometimes sad : car ownership is a complicated thing is a car just a means of transport or is it much more than that ?
surely it 's just a machine which makes some aspects of our lives easier .
or is it ? a car is something different for everyone .
it could just be a means to an end , the most convenient way of getting to where you want to go .
it could be your work ; it could be your life .
but whatever a car represents , it can be a reference point to a certain time , a reminder of days gone by just as a song or a place can take you back years . a first car is like a first love .
it is something you see others enjoying as you grow up and something that fills your heart with longing , expectation and a little trepidation .
you see the amount of time some drivers spend with their vehicles and you crave that connection ; you see the exhilaration on their faces as they drive and wonder if you will ever feel that joy .
in short , you just ca n't wait until you 're old enough to enjoy those same pleasures . in that way , owning your first car is like a coming of age .
in britain , where i spent the best part of 17 years preparing for the day i was handed the keys to the car door , the age at which you can legally drive comes amid the whirling maelstrom of late adolescence with all its raging hormones and soul-crushing melodrama . but in the eye of this hurricane , you have this proof that you are considered an adult .
you are allowed on the road with all the other grown-ups .
all of life 's troubles at that point can be solved as long as you have a steering wheel to grab and an accelerator to gun .
girlfriends can come and go but as long as you have a tank of gas at the time , so can you . my first getaway car was an austin mini and , i freely admit , i gave myself entirely to that car .
it was bought in a storm from a coastal village for the princely sum of ₤ 70 -lrb- € 101 , $ 133 -rrb- .
i had yet to pass my driving test and my extremely nervous but charitable mother agreed to co-pilot our return with me at the wheel , despite the sheets of rain and booming clouds above .
it was love at first sight .
royal blue flashed with sea air rust , it would be my escape route throughout my mid-teens . the curse of the boy racer or so i thought .
as with many young drivers , the car in its purest form was never enough .
in went the sunroof , on went the wide wheels and straight box double-shotgun exhaust and racing steering wheel .
and the stereo ?
if the gurgling pipes at the back were n't enough to signal my arrival , then my soundsystem would be .
but the love affair was not to last .
i got greedy .
i wanted more . to exchange one love for another always seems like a good idea at the time .
you 're moving on , older and wiser , to new horizons .
you feel you have outgrown your past .
but you soon realize that , as with all first loves , the cars that come after ' the one ' have the problem that they must always live in that shadow . my ford fiesta was an affair of the head , not of the heart .
the larger engine , the glossy red exterior , the boxy maturity it exuded in comparison to the bubble-shaped go-kart i had exchanged it for - i was seduced .
buying the fiesta felt like i was moving up the driving ladder .
i had been a fully licensed driver for a year and it was time to get serious .
however , i was left cold - literally . refrigerator on wheels or status symbol ? purchased during the waning weeks of autumn , the fiesta seemed an ideal chariot for the busy life i was now leading .
people with cars had a certain standing within a group of friends and the responsibility of being the designated driver at times was an added ego boost .
people wanted to drive with me . that is until winter hit and i found out that i had to do a steady 70 miles per hour -lrb- 112 kph -rrb- for at least 45 minutes before the heater would even begin to blow anything other than an icy chill into the car .
driving with me had turned into a recurring scene from the keanu reeves movie speed .
if the needle dropped below 70 , those on board were in danger of freezing to death .
however , negotiating roads in december at that speed was also life-threatening and the fiesta was soon in the classifieds and out of my life . but i had not learned my lesson .
again my head was turned .
this time a slinky german number caught my eye .
the teutonic charm of the volkswagen golf was too much and i took the next step up the auto evolutionary ladder … into a nightmare . the breakdown of a relationship within a day of ownership , she 'd died on me .
after suffering the ignominy of being towed back into town , we tried again .
this time the failure was more spectacular as we disappeared in a boom of black smoke which would have made james bond envious as we accelerated away from a roundabout and limped onto the hard shoulder . like any man caught in a destructive affair , words meant nothing .

surely it 's just a machine which makes some aspects of our lives easier .
or is it ? a car is something different for everyone .
it could just be a means to an end , the most convenient way of getting to where you want to go .
it could be your work ; it could be your life .
but whatever a car represents , it can be a reference point to a certain time , a reminder of days gone by just as a song or a place can take you back years . a first car is like a first love .
it is something you see others enjoying as you grow up and something that fills your heart with longing , expectation and a little trepidation .
you see the amount of time some drivers spend with their vehicles and you crave that connection ; you see the exhilaration on their faces as they drive and wonder if you will ever feel that joy .
in short , you just ca n't wait until you 're old enough to enjoy those same pleasures . in that way , owning your first car is like a coming of age .
in britain , where i spent the best part of 17 years preparing for the day i was handed the keys to the car door , the age at which you can legally drive comes amid the whirling maelstrom of late adolescence with all its raging hormones and soul-crushing melodrama . but in the eye of this hurricane , you have this proof that you are considered an adult .
you are allowed on the road with all the other grown-ups .
all of life 's troubles at that point can be solved as long as you have a steering wheel to grab and an accelerator to gun .
girlfriends can come and go but as long as you have a tank of gas at the time , so can you . my first getaway car was an austin mini and , i freely admit , i gave myself entirely to that car .
it was bought in a storm from a coastal village for the princely sum of ₤ 70 -lrb- € 101 , $ 133 -rrb- .
i had yet to pass my driving test and my extremely nervous but charitable mother agreed to co-pilot our return with me at the wheel , despite the sheets of rain and booming clouds above .
it was love at first sight .
royal blue flashed with sea air rust , it would be my escape route throughout my mid-teens . the curse of the boy racer or so i thought .
as with many young drivers , the car in its purest form was never enough .
in went the sunroof , on went the wide wheels and straight box double-shotgun exhaust and racing steering wheel .
and the stereo ?
if the gurgling pipes at the back were n't enough to signal my arrival , then my soundsystem would be .
but the love affair was not to last .
i got greedy .
i wanted more . to exchange one love for another always seems like a good idea at the time .
you 're moving on , older and wiser , to new horizons .
you feel you have outgrown your past .
but you soon realize that , as with all first loves , the cars that come after ' the one ' have the problem that they must always live in that shadow . my ford fiesta was an affair of the head , not of the heart .
the larger engine , the glossy red exterior , the boxy maturity it exuded in comparison to the bubble-shaped go-kart i had exchanged it for - i was seduced .
buying the fiesta felt like i was moving up the driving ladder .
i had been a fully licensed driver for a year and it was time to get serious .
however , i was left cold - literally . refrigerator on wheels or status symbol ? purchased during the waning weeks of autumn , the fiesta seemed an ideal chariot for the busy life i was now leading .
people with cars had a certain standing within a group of friends and the responsibility of being the designated driver at times was an added ego boost .
people wanted to drive with me . that is until winter hit and i found out that i had to do a steady 70 miles per hour -lrb- 112 kph -rrb- for at least 45 minutes before the heater would even begin to blow anything other than an icy chill into the car .
driving with me had turned into a recurring scene from the keanu reeves movie speed .
if the needle dropped below 70 , those on board were in danger of freezing to death .
however , negotiating roads in december at that speed was also life-threatening and the fiesta was soon in the classifieds and out of my life . but i had not learned my lesson .
again my head was turned .
this time a slinky german number caught my eye .
the teutonic charm of the volkswagen golf was too much and i took the next step up the auto evolutionary ladder … into a nightmare . the breakdown of a relationship within a day of ownership , she 'd died on me .
after suffering the ignominy of being towed back into town , we tried again .
this time the failure was more spectacular as we disappeared in a boom of black smoke which would have made james bond envious as we accelerated away from a roundabout and limped onto the hard shoulder . like any man caught in a destructive affair , words meant nothing .
i was convinced it would all work out .
my hard earned cash went on a new engine and for a while we were happy together .
until the breakdowns started again and i knew it was over .
i managed to get her running long enough to sell her but she was cursed .
a few weeks later , i saw , from my hiding place , the new owner pushing the car along a street . what a fool i 'd been !
how could i have been so easily swayed ?
my next car would be a return to those warm and happy memories of my first love .
this time , the mini was newer , more sophisticated and considerably more expensive .
she was a dream to drive and i honestly felt sad to see her go as i departed for university some 18 months later . maybe it was the realization that you ca n't turn back time or that public transport is much cheaper than owning your own .
whatever it was , i have n't owned a car since . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a mini license for german teens starting tuesday , 16-year-old germans can drive so-called mini cars .

surely it 's just a machine which makes some aspects of our lives easier .
or is it ? a car is something different for everyone .
it could just be a means to an end , the most convenient way of getting to where you want to go .
it could be your work ; it could be your life .
but whatever a car represents , it can be a reference point to a certain time , a reminder of days gone by just as a song or a place can take you back years . a first car is like a first love .
it is something you see others enjoying as you grow up and something that fills your heart with longing , expectation and a little trepidation .
you see the amount of time some drivers spend with their vehicles and you crave that connection ; you see the exhilaration on their faces as they drive and wonder if you will ever feel that joy .
in short , you just ca n't wait until you 're old enough to enjoy those same pleasures . in that way , owning your first car is like a coming of age .
in britain , where i spent the best part of 17 years preparing for the day i was handed the keys to the car door , the age at which you can legally drive comes amid the whirling maelstrom of late adolescence with all its raging hormones and soul-crushing melodrama . but in the eye of this hurricane , you have this proof that you are considered an adult .
you are allowed on the road with all the other grown-ups .
all of life 's troubles at that point can be solved as long as you have a steering wheel to grab and an accelerator to gun .
girlfriends can come and go but as long as you have a tank of gas at the time , so can you . my first getaway car was an austin mini and , i freely admit , i gave myself entirely to that car .

a german-american academic is one of the most likely candidates to become the us 's next top diplomat in germany . the new ambassador will have to know germany well , he or she should speak the language and have good connections in washington - these are some of the requirements experts in berlin and the us capital mention when asked about necessary qualifications for the job . this says a lot as coats , a former republican us senator from indiana , was friendly with the white house but did n't know that much about germany when he arrived in 2001 .
the latter especially became a problem during the rift between the us and germany over the war in iraq : coats was unable to be as involved as his predecessor because he lacked the language skills to do so . bildunterschrift : art rendering of the new us embassy at the paris square next to the brandenburg gate , left , in berlin .
construction is currently under way , with completion scheduled for spring 2008 but after us president george w. bush 's friendly praise during his visit to germany on feb .
23 , it seems like " old europe " might regain importance on washington 's political radar screen . professional or buddy ? that 's why the selection of a new ambassador will be an indicator for foreign policy plans during bush 's second term . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john kornblum after all , there 's two ways diplomatic posts are filled by countries around the world : picking a professional or rewarding a buddy , sending an experienced career diplomat from within the foreign ministry or installing a party member and friend .
coats fit the latter category while his predecessor , john kornblum -lrb- photo -rrb- , came from within the us state department . the choice will also show the extent of us secretary of state condoleezza rice 's influence .
the president usually picks ambassadors , but as rice has a very close relationship with bush , the appointment of a rice confidant could serve as a signal for her strong position of power within the administration . an academic ambassador ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard casper so far , the white house has not nominated anyone as coat 's successor .
but one name that keeps coming up is that of gerhard casper , the hamburg-born former president of stanford university .
casper -lrb- photo -rrb- , who emigrated to the us in 1964 , could be an ideal candidate : he knows germany and has a personal connection with rice .
as stanford president , he named her the university 's dean , the institution 's no. 2 job . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elizabeth jones along with casper , elizabeth jones -lrb- photo -rrb- and richard burt -lrb- photo , below -rrb- are also mentioned as potential ambassadors .
jones , the assistant secretary of european and eurasian affairs in the state department , had already been nominated by former president bill clinton to succeed kornblum as ambassador to germany .
but after bush 's election , the new president decided to send coats instead . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard burt burt already served as us ambassador to germany from 1985 to 1989 after he occupied jones ' current position .
while jones probably lacks the necessary ties to the white house and rice , burt 's disadvantage is that he was already in germany during the last phase of the cold war and could hardly be presented as a signal for a fresh start in us-german relations . michael knigge -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bush , schröder say past is past during bilateral talks in mainz , schröder said germany 's disputes with the united states over iraq were in the past .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 04.03.2005 germans agree to curb smoking großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soon a more common sight in german restaurants and bars moving to protect non-smokers in germany , the federal government and the country 's association of hotels and restaurants have signed an agreement which obliges owners to create non-smoking sections for their customers . the idea is to reserve at least half of the restaurant or hotel space for non-smokers with relevant sections to be created over the next three years .
the agreement came about quickly , as it is a far better option for the hotel business rather than facing draconian anti-smoking measures in public spaces , such as those that have been implemented recently in italy , malta and ireland . the latter countries have already completely banned smoking in public places despite large-scale opposition .
while tobacco-related diseases kill 650,000 eu citizens every year , a ban on smoking in public places has met with particularly fierce opposition in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italians puffed their last cigarettes inside restaurants and bars at the beginning of the year the government is aware of the fact that imposing a total ban on smoking for instance in hotels and restaurants is pretty well impossible .
and so it has been banking on voluntary agreements with corporations profiting from the multi-billion-euro tobacco business . both sides are happy it was a happy marion caspers-merk , under-secretary in the federal health ministry , who announced that the influential association of hotel and restaurant owners had agreed to set up smoke-free sections for their customers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german train stations have viturally banned smoking " we have regulations for the workplace which guarantee each employee a smoke-free environment , if he or she so wishes , " she said .
" we also have strict laws meant to protect young people under the age of 16 from getting hold of tobacco too easily .
and i ’ m glad that our anti-smoking campaign has now reached a new stage with the agreement that 's been signed between the government and the german association of hotels and restaurants . " the association ’ s president , ernst fischer , has promised to implement the agreement as quickly as possible . " people in our business don ’ t want to exclude anyone , " he said .
" we simply want both smokers and non-smokers to feel comfortable in our hotels and restaurants .
and certainly we want to do our best to fulfill the wishes of our customers .
but we don ’ t need a law to ensure this .
if you look around , the spirit of the new agreement is already present in most of the bigger hotels and restaurants where there are bound to be non-smoking sections already in place .
the agreement will make sure that this practice will expand to all of our hotels and restaurants . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : optional non-smoking rooms have become standard in germany marc scherr , press spokesman for the accor hotel chain , insisted that customers should continue to have the choice whether they want to smoke or not .
but his plea for individual freedom deliberately dodges health issues related to passive smoking . " it is praiseworthy to do something for the health of the people , but it is not possible to do that to the disadvantage of our enterprises , " he said , adding that restaurants lost a lot of business after the smoking ban went into effect in new york . " we believe the smoking and the non-smoking can only be solved by market powers , because right now we already have a lot of restaurants in german offering non-smoking zones , " scherr added . eu combats smoking the german government sees the new agreement as conforming with a fresh anti-smoking campaign launched by the european commission .
the campaign will tour all 25 eu capital cities until 2008 and will be coupled with anti-smoking tv ads . the eu campaign comes two days after the who ’ s framework convention on tobacco control went into force .
the treaty which was also signed by germany imposes a ban on tobacco company advertising as well as introducing international standards on labeling , pricing and taxes . hardy graupner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tough on smoking or tough on its ban ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 04.03.2005 germans agree to curb smoking großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soon a more common sight in german restaurants and bars moving to protect non-smokers in germany , the federal government and the country 's association of hotels and restaurants have signed an agreement which obliges owners to create non-smoking sections for their customers . the idea is to reserve at least half of the restaurant or hotel space for non-smokers with relevant sections to be created over the next three years .
the agreement came about quickly , as it is a far better option for the hotel business rather than facing draconian anti-smoking measures in public spaces , such as those that have been implemented recently in italy , malta and ireland . the latter countries have already completely banned smoking in public places despite large-scale opposition .
while tobacco-related diseases kill 650,000 eu citizens every year , a ban on smoking in public places has met with particularly fierce opposition in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italians puffed their last cigarettes inside restaurants and bars at the beginning of the year the government is aware of the fact that imposing a total ban on smoking for instance in hotels and restaurants is pretty well impossible .
and so it has been banking on voluntary agreements with corporations profiting from the multi-billion-euro tobacco business . both sides are happy it was a happy marion caspers-merk , under-secretary in the federal health ministry , who announced that the influential association of hotel and restaurant owners had agreed to set up smoke-free sections for their customers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german train stations have viturally banned smoking " we have regulations for the workplace which guarantee each employee a smoke-free environment , if he or she so wishes , " she said .
" we also have strict laws meant to protect young people under the age of 16 from getting hold of tobacco too easily .
and i ’ m glad that our anti-smoking campaign has now reached a new stage with the agreement that 's been signed between the government and the german association of hotels and restaurants . " the association ’ s president , ernst fischer , has promised to implement the agreement as quickly as possible . " people in our business don ’ t want to exclude anyone , " he said .
" we simply want both smokers and non-smokers to feel comfortable in our hotels and restaurants .
and certainly we want to do our best to fulfill the wishes of our customers .
but we don ’ t need a law to ensure this .
if you look around , the spirit of the new agreement is already present in most of the bigger hotels and restaurants where there are bound to be non-smoking sections already in place .
the agreement will make sure that this practice will expand to all of our hotels and restaurants . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : optional non-smoking rooms have become standard in germany marc scherr , press spokesman for the accor hotel chain , insisted that customers should continue to have the choice whether they want to smoke or not .
but his plea for individual freedom deliberately dodges health issues related to passive smoking . " it is praiseworthy to do something for the health of the people , but it is not possible to do that to the disadvantage of our enterprises , " he said , adding that restaurants lost a lot of business after the smoking ban went into effect in new york . " we believe the smoking and the non-smoking can only be solved by market powers , because right now we already have a lot of restaurants in german offering non-smoking zones , " scherr added . eu combats smoking the german government sees the new agreement as conforming with a fresh anti-smoking campaign launched by the european commission .
the campaign will tour all 25 eu capital cities until 2008 and will be coupled with anti-smoking tv ads . the eu campaign comes two days after the who ’ s framework convention on tobacco control went into force .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 04.03.2005 germans agree to curb smoking großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soon a more common sight in german restaurants and bars moving to protect non-smokers in germany , the federal government and the country 's association of hotels and restaurants have signed an agreement which obliges owners to create non-smoking sections for their customers . the idea is to reserve at least half of the restaurant or hotel space for non-smokers with relevant sections to be created over the next three years .
the agreement came about quickly , as it is a far better option for the hotel business rather than facing draconian anti-smoking measures in public spaces , such as those that have been implemented recently in italy , malta and ireland . the latter countries have already completely banned smoking in public places despite large-scale opposition .
while tobacco-related diseases kill 650,000 eu citizens every year , a ban on smoking in public places has met with particularly fierce opposition in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italians puffed their last cigarettes inside restaurants and bars at the beginning of the year the government is aware of the fact that imposing a total ban on smoking for instance in hotels and restaurants is pretty well impossible .
and so it has been banking on voluntary agreements with corporations profiting from the multi-billion-euro tobacco business . both sides are happy it was a happy marion caspers-merk , under-secretary in the federal health ministry , who announced that the influential association of hotel and restaurant owners had agreed to set up smoke-free sections for their customers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german train stations have viturally banned smoking " we have regulations for the workplace which guarantee each employee a smoke-free environment , if he or she so wishes , " she said .
" we also have strict laws meant to protect young people under the age of 16 from getting hold of tobacco too easily .
and i ’ m glad that our anti-smoking campaign has now reached a new stage with the agreement that 's been signed between the government and the german association of hotels and restaurants . " the association ’ s president , ernst fischer , has promised to implement the agreement as quickly as possible . " people in our business don ’ t want to exclude anyone , " he said .
" we simply want both smokers and non-smokers to feel comfortable in our hotels and restaurants .
and certainly we want to do our best to fulfill the wishes of our customers .
but we don ’ t need a law to ensure this .
if you look around , the spirit of the new agreement is already present in most of the bigger hotels and restaurants where there are bound to be non-smoking sections already in place .
the agreement will make sure that this practice will expand to all of our hotels and restaurants . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : optional non-smoking rooms have become standard in germany marc scherr , press spokesman for the accor hotel chain , insisted that customers should continue to have the choice whether they want to smoke or not .
but his plea for individual freedom deliberately dodges health issues related to passive smoking . " it is praiseworthy to do something for the health of the people , but it is not possible to do that to the disadvantage of our enterprises , " he said , adding that restaurants lost a lot of business after the smoking ban went into effect in new york . " we believe the smoking and the non-smoking can only be solved by market powers , because right now we already have a lot of restaurants in german offering non-smoking zones , " scherr added . eu combats smoking the german government sees the new agreement as conforming with a fresh anti-smoking campaign launched by the european commission .
the campaign will tour all 25 eu capital cities until 2008 and will be coupled with anti-smoking tv ads . the eu campaign comes two days after the who ’ s framework convention on tobacco control went into force .
the treaty which was also signed by germany imposes a ban on tobacco company advertising as well as introducing international standards on labeling , pricing and taxes . hardy graupner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tough on smoking or tough on its ban ?

he and another former offender , franck vergondy , are alleged to have founded the ring . according to the prosecution , between 1999 and 2002 , nearly 50 children were raped or abused - though the overall number could be much higher . the prosecution has gathered evidence said to show that parents bartered their own children for small sums of money , food parcels and cartons of cigarettes .

of the 39 accused who are in custody , 13 are women .

a german-american academic is one of the most likely candidates to become the us 's next top diplomat in germany . the new ambassador will have to know germany well , he or she should speak the language and have good connections in washington - these are some of the requirements experts in berlin and the us capital mention when asked about necessary qualifications for the job . this says a lot as coats , a former republican us senator from indiana , was friendly with the white house but did n't know that much about germany when he arrived in 2001 .
the latter especially became a problem during the rift between the us and germany over the war in iraq : coats was unable to be as involved as his predecessor because he lacked the language skills to do so . bildunterschrift : art rendering of the new us embassy at the paris square next to the brandenburg gate , left , in berlin .

a german-american academic is one of the most likely candidates to become the us 's next top diplomat in germany . the new ambassador will have to know germany well , he or she should speak the language and have good connections in washington - these are some of the requirements experts in berlin and the us capital mention when asked about necessary qualifications for the job . this says a lot as coats , a former republican us senator from indiana , was friendly with the white house but did n't know that much about germany when he arrived in 2001 .
the latter especially became a problem during the rift between the us and germany over the war in iraq : coats was unable to be as involved as his predecessor because he lacked the language skills to do so . bildunterschrift : art rendering of the new us embassy at the paris square next to the brandenburg gate , left , in berlin .
construction is currently under way , with completion scheduled for spring 2008 but after us president george w. bush 's friendly praise during his visit to germany on feb .
23 , it seems like " old europe " might regain importance on washington 's political radar screen . professional or buddy ? that 's why the selection of a new ambassador will be an indicator for foreign policy plans during bush 's second term . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john kornblum after all , there 's two ways diplomatic posts are filled by countries around the world : picking a professional or rewarding a buddy , sending an experienced career diplomat from within the foreign ministry or installing a party member and friend .
coats fit the latter category while his predecessor , john kornblum -lrb- photo -rrb- , came from within the us state department . the choice will also show the extent of us secretary of state condoleezza rice 's influence .
the president usually picks ambassadors , but as rice has a very close relationship with bush , the appointment of a rice confidant could serve as a signal for her strong position of power within the administration . an academic ambassador ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard casper so far , the white house has not nominated anyone as coat 's successor .
but one name that keeps coming up is that of gerhard casper , the hamburg-born former president of stanford university .
casper -lrb- photo -rrb- , who emigrated to the us in 1964 , could be an ideal candidate : he knows germany and has a personal connection with rice .
as stanford president , he named her the university 's dean , the institution 's no. 2 job . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elizabeth jones along with casper , elizabeth jones -lrb- photo -rrb- and richard burt -lrb- photo , below -rrb- are also mentioned as potential ambassadors .
jones , the assistant secretary of european and eurasian affairs in the state department , had already been nominated by former president bill clinton to succeed kornblum as ambassador to germany .
but after bush 's election , the new president decided to send coats instead . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard burt burt already served as us ambassador to germany from 1985 to 1989 after he occupied jones ' current position .
while jones probably lacks the necessary ties to the white house and rice , burt 's disadvantage is that he was already in germany during the last phase of the cold war and could hardly be presented as a signal for a fresh start in us-german relations . michael knigge -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bush , schröder say past is past during bilateral talks in mainz , schröder said germany 's disputes with the united states over iraq were in the past .

but is he too much of a good thing ? lagerfeld may be fashion 's busiest man .
after his brief flirtation with the world of mass market retail - climaxing with his phenomenally successful limited-edition line for swedish chain hennes & mauritz last november - the german designer has returned to the catwalk for the next leg of his bid for expansion . one of the most anticipated collections of the season , his lagerfeld gallery show on wednesday was his second of three in the space of two weeks .
he unveiled his work for fendi in milan last week and will hit the catwalk again for chanel on friday . " what i like is to be everywhere , " he told reuters .
" i like to have this kind of ubiquity in every sense of the word . " cash for cachet bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as one of the first designers to spark the growing " masstige " trend - the popularity of mass products with designer prestige - lagerfeld single-handedly showed the notoriously haughty world of haute couture that slumming it certainly does n't sully reputations . in paris this week , the german designer made a strong statement with his autumn-winter 2005-06 line , his first since us fashion giant tommy hilfiger bought the label in december . the us company has high hopes for lagerfeld gallery .
" we want to run it as a very upscale couture business , " ceo david dyer told reuters .
" we 're looking to be a multi-brand , multi-channel company .
i do n't think you can get any better than karl lagerfeld , so we think we started with the crown jewels . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : proving once again that his business sense is as impeccable as his taste , lagerfeld benefits from hilfiger 's financial clout and position in the key us market , while in return , the outfit gets to bask in the reflected glory of lagerfeld 's quintessentially european chic . an eye for the iconic bildunterschrift : as prince 's " u got the look " blared from the sound system , lagerfeld 's models strutted out in loads of fur , from sumptuous black astrakhan coats to short mink-covered boots to lush high collars that obscured the face . with his customary eye for the iconic , the designer even offered electronic message belts covered in fur that contained a tiny digital screen with the words " lagerfeld gallery " continuously scrolling by in red .
floppy fur hats added a finishing touch . lagerfeld sent out his signature slim-leg trousers and crisp white shirts , but the collection took on a generally softer silhouette , with laid-back denim skirts and sheer chiffon dresses with flower detailing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dusty rose and peacock blue added a more feminine allure to the standard black and white , especially for evening .
a full-length pleated goddess gown with a twisted halter neckline in chocolate silk fluttered to the floor . the audience loved it .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 04.03.2005 the love-hate nature of car ownership großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sometimes happy , sometimes sad : car ownership is a complicated thing is a car just a means of transport or is it much more than that ?
surely it 's just a machine which makes some aspects of our lives easier .
or is it ? a car is something different for everyone .
it could just be a means to an end , the most convenient way of getting to where you want to go .
it could be your work ; it could be your life .
but whatever a car represents , it can be a reference point to a certain time , a reminder of days gone by just as a song or a place can take you back years . a first car is like a first love .
it is something you see others enjoying as you grow up and something that fills your heart with longing , expectation and a little trepidation .
you see the amount of time some drivers spend with their vehicles and you crave that connection ; you see the exhilaration on their faces as they drive and wonder if you will ever feel that joy .
in short , you just ca n't wait until you 're old enough to enjoy those same pleasures . in that way , owning your first car is like a coming of age .
in britain , where i spent the best part of 17 years preparing for the day i was handed the keys to the car door , the age at which you can legally drive comes amid the whirling maelstrom of late adolescence with all its raging hormones and soul-crushing melodrama . but in the eye of this hurricane , you have this proof that you are considered an adult .
you are allowed on the road with all the other grown-ups .
all of life 's troubles at that point can be solved as long as you have a steering wheel to grab and an accelerator to gun .
girlfriends can come and go but as long as you have a tank of gas at the time , so can you . my first getaway car was an austin mini and , i freely admit , i gave myself entirely to that car .
it was bought in a storm from a coastal village for the princely sum of ₤ 70 -lrb- € 101 , $ 133 -rrb- .
i had yet to pass my driving test and my extremely nervous but charitable mother agreed to co-pilot our return with me at the wheel , despite the sheets of rain and booming clouds above .
it was love at first sight .
royal blue flashed with sea air rust , it would be my escape route throughout my mid-teens . the curse of the boy racer or so i thought .
as with many young drivers , the car in its purest form was never enough .
in went the sunroof , on went the wide wheels and straight box double-shotgun exhaust and racing steering wheel .
and the stereo ?
if the gurgling pipes at the back were n't enough to signal my arrival , then my soundsystem would be .
but the love affair was not to last .
i got greedy .
i wanted more . to exchange one love for another always seems like a good idea at the time .
you 're moving on , older and wiser , to new horizons .
you feel you have outgrown your past .
but you soon realize that , as with all first loves , the cars that come after ' the one ' have the problem that they must always live in that shadow . my ford fiesta was an affair of the head , not of the heart .
the larger engine , the glossy red exterior , the boxy maturity it exuded in comparison to the bubble-shaped go-kart i had exchanged it for - i was seduced .
buying the fiesta felt like i was moving up the driving ladder .
i had been a fully licensed driver for a year and it was time to get serious .
however , i was left cold - literally . refrigerator on wheels or status symbol ? purchased during the waning weeks of autumn , the fiesta seemed an ideal chariot for the busy life i was now leading .
people with cars had a certain standing within a group of friends and the responsibility of being the designated driver at times was an added ego boost .
people wanted to drive with me . that is until winter hit and i found out that i had to do a steady 70 miles per hour -lrb- 112 kph -rrb- for at least 45 minutes before the heater would even begin to blow anything other than an icy chill into the car .
driving with me had turned into a recurring scene from the keanu reeves movie speed .
if the needle dropped below 70 , those on board were in danger of freezing to death .
however , negotiating roads in december at that speed was also life-threatening and the fiesta was soon in the classifieds and out of my life . but i had not learned my lesson .
again my head was turned .
this time a slinky german number caught my eye .
the teutonic charm of the volkswagen golf was too much and i took the next step up the auto evolutionary ladder … into a nightmare . the breakdown of a relationship within a day of ownership , she 'd died on me .
after suffering the ignominy of being towed back into town , we tried again .
this time the failure was more spectacular as we disappeared in a boom of black smoke which would have made james bond envious as we accelerated away from a roundabout and limped onto the hard shoulder . like any man caught in a destructive affair , words meant nothing .
i was convinced it would all work out .
my hard earned cash went on a new engine and for a while we were happy together .
until the breakdowns started again and i knew it was over .
i managed to get her running long enough to sell her but she was cursed .
a few weeks later , i saw , from my hiding place , the new owner pushing the car along a street . what a fool i 'd been !
how could i have been so easily swayed ?
my next car would be a return to those warm and happy memories of my first love .
this time , the mini was newer , more sophisticated and considerably more expensive .
she was a dream to drive and i honestly felt sad to see her go as i departed for university some 18 months later . maybe it was the realization that you ca n't turn back time or that public transport is much cheaper than owning your own .
whatever it was , i have n't owned a car since . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a mini license for german teens starting tuesday , 16-year-old germans can drive so-called mini cars .

outside , police blocked the street and bystanders watched with curiosity as the defendants arrived in a number of vans . harrowing testimony the testimony to be heard from the victims , who were aged from six months to 12 years at the time , has been deemed so painful that jury members will have access to a special psychiatric team . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police officers guard the entrance to the courtroom in angers " i expect that first of all the children will be listened to , " said alain fouquet , one of the lawyers for the victims , outside the courthouse .

he and another former offender , franck vergondy , are alleged to have founded the ring . according to the prosecution , between 1999 and 2002 , nearly 50 children were raped or abused - though the overall number could be much higher . the prosecution has gathered evidence said to show that parents bartered their own children for small sums of money , food parcels and cartons of cigarettes .

of the 39 accused who are in custody , 13 are women .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 04.03.2005 germans agree to curb smoking großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soon a more common sight in german restaurants and bars moving to protect non-smokers in germany , the federal government and the country 's association of hotels and restaurants have signed an agreement which obliges owners to create non-smoking sections for their customers . the idea is to reserve at least half of the restaurant or hotel space for non-smokers with relevant sections to be created over the next three years .
the agreement came about quickly , as it is a far better option for the hotel business rather than facing draconian anti-smoking measures in public spaces , such as those that have been implemented recently in italy , malta and ireland . the latter countries have already completely banned smoking in public places despite large-scale opposition .
while tobacco-related diseases kill 650,000 eu citizens every year , a ban on smoking in public places has met with particularly fierce opposition in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italians puffed their last cigarettes inside restaurants and bars at the beginning of the year the government is aware of the fact that imposing a total ban on smoking for instance in hotels and restaurants is pretty well impossible .
and so it has been banking on voluntary agreements with corporations profiting from the multi-billion-euro tobacco business . both sides are happy it was a happy marion caspers-merk , under-secretary in the federal health ministry , who announced that the influential association of hotel and restaurant owners had agreed to set up smoke-free sections for their customers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german train stations have viturally banned smoking " we have regulations for the workplace which guarantee each employee a smoke-free environment , if he or she so wishes , " she said .
" we also have strict laws meant to protect young people under the age of 16 from getting hold of tobacco too easily .
and i ’ m glad that our anti-smoking campaign has now reached a new stage with the agreement that 's been signed between the government and the german association of hotels and restaurants . " the association ’ s president , ernst fischer , has promised to implement the agreement as quickly as possible . " people in our business don ’ t want to exclude anyone , " he said .
" we simply want both smokers and non-smokers to feel comfortable in our hotels and restaurants .
and certainly we want to do our best to fulfill the wishes of our customers .
but we don ’ t need a law to ensure this .
if you look around , the spirit of the new agreement is already present in most of the bigger hotels and restaurants where there are bound to be non-smoking sections already in place .
the agreement will make sure that this practice will expand to all of our hotels and restaurants . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : optional non-smoking rooms have become standard in germany marc scherr , press spokesman for the accor hotel chain , insisted that customers should continue to have the choice whether they want to smoke or not .
but his plea for individual freedom deliberately dodges health issues related to passive smoking . " it is praiseworthy to do something for the health of the people , but it is not possible to do that to the disadvantage of our enterprises , " he said , adding that restaurants lost a lot of business after the smoking ban went into effect in new york . " we believe the smoking and the non-smoking can only be solved by market powers , because right now we already have a lot of restaurants in german offering non-smoking zones , " scherr added . eu combats smoking the german government sees the new agreement as conforming with a fresh anti-smoking campaign launched by the european commission .
the campaign will tour all 25 eu capital cities until 2008 and will be coupled with anti-smoking tv ads . the eu campaign comes two days after the who ’ s framework convention on tobacco control went into force .
the treaty which was also signed by germany imposes a ban on tobacco company advertising as well as introducing international standards on labeling , pricing and taxes . hardy graupner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tough on smoking or tough on its ban ?

after a lengthy battle of wills , england coach sven-goran eriksson won his battle to secure a four-week gap before next year 's world cup finals . the fa announced on thursday that the fa cup final , the last game of the domestic season , will be held on saturday , may 13 , 2006 in the first match at the new wembley stadium . world soccer governing body fifa had allowed the fa special dispensation to play next season 's final on may 20 but eriksson maintained england needed the full four weeks ' preparation time . the fa decision to bring forward the date of the final by a week , and the knock-on effect of the premier league ending a week earlier than normal , is more than eriksson could have hoped for after a concerted campaign to give his players extra time to recover from the rigors of domestic action . other european leagues which are hoping to field their national teams in the 2006 spectacle may be less lucky if their 2005/06 fixtures are more or less similar to those of the current season .
fifa has recommended a four-week window between the end of domestic action and the world cup but if some countries fail to take advantage of this , england may have at least two weeks more preparation time than some of their continental rivals . european rivals may be at a disadvantage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany will have at least three weeks before they appear in their world cup .
in germany , the host nation , the bundesliga could come to a close on the weekend of may 20-21 , giving those players involved in jürgen klinsmann 's plans almost three weeks off before the opening game of the world cup in munich on june 9 .
those still involved in the german dfb cup final , which is always played a week after the last league game of the season , will still have two weeks to prepare and recover . ligue 1 in france traditionally comes to a close on the last weekend in may , with the french cup final already over with by the beginning of that month .
french national team players who still ply their trade at home will have a fortnight before the world cup .
italy 's serie a and the spanish primera liga also end on the last weekend in may with the copa italia decided in early may and the copa del rey out of the way in late march . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porto players celebrate as they lift the champions league trophy in 2004 .
players involved on the final in 2006 may have little time to rest before the world cup .
the european competitions also should be out of the way by the end of may 2006 with the champions league final being played in the middle of the last week of the month and the uefa cup a week earlier , around the 18th . while it all sounds rosy for the english , currently leading group six in qualifying , to accommodate this luxury european soccer has to implement some unpopular changes . fa plans have european implications to make sure that a fixture pile-up does n't undo the fa 's work , any fa cup replays in the fifth and sixth rounds of the 2005/06 competition will be scrapped for clubs still involved in european competitions .
teams in the uefa cup will not be required to play replays in the fifth round or quarter-finals .
those in the champions league will not have quarter-final replays and any ties affected will go to extra time and penalties if necessary . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rested players may make for a more exciting world cup in 2006 .
the fa said in a statement that the replay exemptions would only affect next season : " this follows continued positive talks involving the fa , premier league and football league to find an appropriate solution to protecting the tradition and heritage of the fa cup , while allowing for fifa 's four-week window between the end of all major domestic seasons and the start of the world cup . " " the fa believes it is crucial to allow the national team to be given equal preparation time to every other team competing in germany next summer , subject to qualification .
to allow for a full four-week break , the domestic season has to conclude by may 13 .

the berlin administrative court upheld a decision by the german government in 2001 to award the proceeds from the sale of property formerly owned by the wertheim family to the frankfurt-based jewish claims conference , which is working to recover the family 's assets . karstadtquelle , germany 's largest department store operator , which acquired the wertheim business in 1994 , said it would take its case to the federal administrative court to seek permission to appeal against the judgment .
the company maintains it can not be held liable for what happened under the nazis . the two sites in question on berlin 's leipziger strasse were once home to offices of the wertheim store chain but the nazis took them over in 1933 as part of their policy to seize jewish businesses .
after the war , however , the properties became part of communist east berlin , putting any claims to them on hold until after german reunification , in 1990 .

the berlin administrative court upheld a decision by the german government in 2001 to award the proceeds from the sale of property formerly owned by the wertheim family to the frankfurt-based jewish claims conference , which is working to recover the family 's assets . karstadtquelle , germany 's largest department store operator , which acquired the wertheim business in 1994 , said it would take its case to the federal administrative court to seek permission to appeal against the judgment .
the company maintains it can not be held liable for what happened under the nazis . the two sites in question on berlin 's leipziger strasse were once home to offices of the wertheim store chain but the nazis took them over in 1933 as part of their policy to seize jewish businesses .

after a lengthy battle of wills , england coach sven-goran eriksson won his battle to secure a four-week gap before next year 's world cup finals . the fa announced on thursday that the fa cup final , the last game of the domestic season , will be held on saturday , may 13 , 2006 in the first match at the new wembley stadium . world soccer governing body fifa had allowed the fa special dispensation to play next season 's final on may 20 but eriksson maintained england needed the full four weeks ' preparation time . the fa decision to bring forward the date of the final by a week , and the knock-on effect of the premier league ending a week earlier than normal , is more than eriksson could have hoped for after a concerted campaign to give his players extra time to recover from the rigors of domestic action . other european leagues which are hoping to field their national teams in the 2006 spectacle may be less lucky if their 2005/06 fixtures are more or less similar to those of the current season .
fifa has recommended a four-week window between the end of domestic action and the world cup but if some countries fail to take advantage of this , england may have at least two weeks more preparation time than some of their continental rivals . european rivals may be at a disadvantage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany will have at least three weeks before they appear in their world cup .
in germany , the host nation , the bundesliga could come to a close on the weekend of may 20-21 , giving those players involved in jürgen klinsmann 's plans almost three weeks off before the opening game of the world cup in munich on june 9 .
those still involved in the german dfb cup final , which is always played a week after the last league game of the season , will still have two weeks to prepare and recover . ligue 1 in france traditionally comes to a close on the last weekend in may , with the french cup final already over with by the beginning of that month .
french national team players who still ply their trade at home will have a fortnight before the world cup .
italy 's serie a and the spanish primera liga also end on the last weekend in may with the copa italia decided in early may and the copa del rey out of the way in late march . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porto players celebrate as they lift the champions league trophy in 2004 .
players involved on the final in 2006 may have little time to rest before the world cup .
the european competitions also should be out of the way by the end of may 2006 with the champions league final being played in the middle of the last week of the month and the uefa cup a week earlier , around the 18th . while it all sounds rosy for the english , currently leading group six in qualifying , to accommodate this luxury european soccer has to implement some unpopular changes . fa plans have european implications to make sure that a fixture pile-up does n't undo the fa 's work , any fa cup replays in the fifth and sixth rounds of the 2005/06 competition will be scrapped for clubs still involved in european competitions .
teams in the uefa cup will not be required to play replays in the fifth round or quarter-finals .
those in the champions league will not have quarter-final replays and any ties affected will go to extra time and penalties if necessary . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rested players may make for a more exciting world cup in 2006 .
the fa said in a statement that the replay exemptions would only affect next season : " this follows continued positive talks involving the fa , premier league and football league to find an appropriate solution to protecting the tradition and heritage of the fa cup , while allowing for fifa 's four-week window between the end of all major domestic seasons and the start of the world cup . " " the fa believes it is crucial to allow the national team to be given equal preparation time to every other team competing in germany next summer , subject to qualification .
to allow for a full four-week break , the domestic season has to conclude by may 13 .

the berlin administrative court upheld a decision by the german government in 2001 to award the proceeds from the sale of property formerly owned by the wertheim family to the frankfurt-based jewish claims conference , which is working to recover the family 's assets . karstadtquelle , germany 's largest department store operator , which acquired the wertheim business in 1994 , said it would take its case to the federal administrative court to seek permission to appeal against the judgment .
the company maintains it can not be held liable for what happened under the nazis . the two sites in question on berlin 's leipziger strasse were once home to offices of the wertheim store chain but the nazis took them over in 1933 as part of their policy to seize jewish businesses .
after the war , however , the properties became part of communist east berlin , putting any claims to them on hold until after german reunification , in 1990 .
further claims pending bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gideon taylor of the conference on jewish material claims gideon taylor -lrb- photo -rrb- , jewish claims conference executive vice president , welcomed the ruling . " we hope that , with other cases pending , karstadt will finally do the right thing and acknowledge the moral and financial claim on these properties , " he said in a statement .
" this would clear the way for the wertheim family 's stolen assets to be returned even sooner and for justice to finally be done . " the jcc represents wertheim heirs , many of whom now live in the united states .
barbara principe -lrb- photo -rrb- , a 72-year old new jersey grandmother and the oldest living heir , lauded the decision . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barbara principe , wertheim family spokeswoman " this is a great day for our family , " she said .
" it 's the victims and not the big company who were robbed . " the ruling in the test case has implications for another contested site on berlin 's prime-location potsdamer platz , which is now home to a ritz carlton hotel and a cluster of high-rise plush office buildings .
the heirs have contested ownership of seven central berlin properties , including real estate where germany built offices for the federal parliament .
the claims are expected to reach a total of € 400 million -lrb- $ 525 million -rrb- . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de compensation chance for jewish property heirs following a ruling by the federal administrative court , former owners of property at berlin 's newly modelled potsdamer platz can go ahead and officially apply for repatriation .

after a lengthy battle of wills , england coach sven-goran eriksson won his battle to secure a four-week gap before next year 's world cup finals . the fa announced on thursday that the fa cup final , the last game of the domestic season , will be held on saturday , may 13 , 2006 in the first match at the new wembley stadium . world soccer governing body fifa had allowed the fa special dispensation to play next season 's final on may 20 but eriksson maintained england needed the full four weeks ' preparation time . the fa decision to bring forward the date of the final by a week , and the knock-on effect of the premier league ending a week earlier than normal , is more than eriksson could have hoped for after a concerted campaign to give his players extra time to recover from the rigors of domestic action . other european leagues which are hoping to field their national teams in the 2006 spectacle may be less lucky if their 2005/06 fixtures are more or less similar to those of the current season .
fifa has recommended a four-week window between the end of domestic action and the world cup but if some countries fail to take advantage of this , england may have at least two weeks more preparation time than some of their continental rivals . european rivals may be at a disadvantage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany will have at least three weeks before they appear in their world cup .
in germany , the host nation , the bundesliga could come to a close on the weekend of may 20-21 , giving those players involved in jürgen klinsmann 's plans almost three weeks off before the opening game of the world cup in munich on june 9 .
those still involved in the german dfb cup final , which is always played a week after the last league game of the season , will still have two weeks to prepare and recover . ligue 1 in france traditionally comes to a close on the last weekend in may , with the french cup final already over with by the beginning of that month .
french national team players who still ply their trade at home will have a fortnight before the world cup .
italy 's serie a and the spanish primera liga also end on the last weekend in may with the copa italia decided in early may and the copa del rey out of the way in late march . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porto players celebrate as they lift the champions league trophy in 2004 .
players involved on the final in 2006 may have little time to rest before the world cup .
the european competitions also should be out of the way by the end of may 2006 with the champions league final being played in the middle of the last week of the month and the uefa cup a week earlier , around the 18th . while it all sounds rosy for the english , currently leading group six in qualifying , to accommodate this luxury european soccer has to implement some unpopular changes . fa plans have european implications to make sure that a fixture pile-up does n't undo the fa 's work , any fa cup replays in the fifth and sixth rounds of the 2005/06 competition will be scrapped for clubs still involved in european competitions .
teams in the uefa cup will not be required to play replays in the fifth round or quarter-finals .
those in the champions league will not have quarter-final replays and any ties affected will go to extra time and penalties if necessary . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rested players may make for a more exciting world cup in 2006 .
the fa said in a statement that the replay exemptions would only affect next season : " this follows continued positive talks involving the fa , premier league and football league to find an appropriate solution to protecting the tradition and heritage of the fa cup , while allowing for fifa 's four-week window between the end of all major domestic seasons and the start of the world cup . " " the fa believes it is crucial to allow the national team to be given equal preparation time to every other team competing in germany next summer , subject to qualification .
to allow for a full four-week break , the domestic season has to conclude by may 13 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 04.03.2005 germans agree to curb smoking großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soon a more common sight in german restaurants and bars moving to protect non-smokers in germany , the federal government and the country 's association of hotels and restaurants have signed an agreement which obliges owners to create non-smoking sections for their customers . the idea is to reserve at least half of the restaurant or hotel space for non-smokers with relevant sections to be created over the next three years .
the agreement came about quickly , as it is a far better option for the hotel business rather than facing draconian anti-smoking measures in public spaces , such as those that have been implemented recently in italy , malta and ireland . the latter countries have already completely banned smoking in public places despite large-scale opposition .
while tobacco-related diseases kill 650,000 eu citizens every year , a ban on smoking in public places has met with particularly fierce opposition in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italians puffed their last cigarettes inside restaurants and bars at the beginning of the year the government is aware of the fact that imposing a total ban on smoking for instance in hotels and restaurants is pretty well impossible .
and so it has been banking on voluntary agreements with corporations profiting from the multi-billion-euro tobacco business . both sides are happy it was a happy marion caspers-merk , under-secretary in the federal health ministry , who announced that the influential association of hotel and restaurant owners had agreed to set up smoke-free sections for their customers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german train stations have viturally banned smoking " we have regulations for the workplace which guarantee each employee a smoke-free environment , if he or she so wishes , " she said .
" we also have strict laws meant to protect young people under the age of 16 from getting hold of tobacco too easily .
and i ’ m glad that our anti-smoking campaign has now reached a new stage with the agreement that 's been signed between the government and the german association of hotels and restaurants . " the association ’ s president , ernst fischer , has promised to implement the agreement as quickly as possible . " people in our business don ’ t want to exclude anyone , " he said .
" we simply want both smokers and non-smokers to feel comfortable in our hotels and restaurants .
and certainly we want to do our best to fulfill the wishes of our customers .
but we don ’ t need a law to ensure this .
if you look around , the spirit of the new agreement is already present in most of the bigger hotels and restaurants where there are bound to be non-smoking sections already in place .
the agreement will make sure that this practice will expand to all of our hotels and restaurants . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : optional non-smoking rooms have become standard in germany marc scherr , press spokesman for the accor hotel chain , insisted that customers should continue to have the choice whether they want to smoke or not .
but his plea for individual freedom deliberately dodges health issues related to passive smoking . " it is praiseworthy to do something for the health of the people , but it is not possible to do that to the disadvantage of our enterprises , " he said , adding that restaurants lost a lot of business after the smoking ban went into effect in new york . " we believe the smoking and the non-smoking can only be solved by market powers , because right now we already have a lot of restaurants in german offering non-smoking zones , " scherr added . eu combats smoking the german government sees the new agreement as conforming with a fresh anti-smoking campaign launched by the european commission .
the campaign will tour all 25 eu capital cities until 2008 and will be coupled with anti-smoking tv ads . the eu campaign comes two days after the who ’ s framework convention on tobacco control went into force .
the treaty which was also signed by germany imposes a ban on tobacco company advertising as well as introducing international standards on labeling , pricing and taxes . hardy graupner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tough on smoking or tough on its ban ?

surely it 's just a machine which makes some aspects of our lives easier .
or is it ? a car is something different for everyone .
it could just be a means to an end , the most convenient way of getting to where you want to go .
it could be your work ; it could be your life .
but whatever a car represents , it can be a reference point to a certain time , a reminder of days gone by just as a song or a place can take you back years . a first car is like a first love .
it is something you see others enjoying as you grow up and something that fills your heart with longing , expectation and a little trepidation .
you see the amount of time some drivers spend with their vehicles and you crave that connection ; you see the exhilaration on their faces as they drive and wonder if you will ever feel that joy .
in short , you just ca n't wait until you 're old enough to enjoy those same pleasures . in that way , owning your first car is like a coming of age .
in britain , where i spent the best part of 17 years preparing for the day i was handed the keys to the car door , the age at which you can legally drive comes amid the whirling maelstrom of late adolescence with all its raging hormones and soul-crushing melodrama . but in the eye of this hurricane , you have this proof that you are considered an adult .
you are allowed on the road with all the other grown-ups .
all of life 's troubles at that point can be solved as long as you have a steering wheel to grab and an accelerator to gun .
girlfriends can come and go but as long as you have a tank of gas at the time , so can you . my first getaway car was an austin mini and , i freely admit , i gave myself entirely to that car .
it was bought in a storm from a coastal village for the princely sum of ₤ 70 -lrb- € 101 , $ 133 -rrb- .
i had yet to pass my driving test and my extremely nervous but charitable mother agreed to co-pilot our return with me at the wheel , despite the sheets of rain and booming clouds above .
it was love at first sight .
royal blue flashed with sea air rust , it would be my escape route throughout my mid-teens . the curse of the boy racer or so i thought .
as with many young drivers , the car in its purest form was never enough .
in went the sunroof , on went the wide wheels and straight box double-shotgun exhaust and racing steering wheel .
and the stereo ?
if the gurgling pipes at the back were n't enough to signal my arrival , then my soundsystem would be .
but the love affair was not to last .
i got greedy .
i wanted more . to exchange one love for another always seems like a good idea at the time .
you 're moving on , older and wiser , to new horizons .
you feel you have outgrown your past .
but you soon realize that , as with all first loves , the cars that come after ' the one ' have the problem that they must always live in that shadow . my ford fiesta was an affair of the head , not of the heart .
the larger engine , the glossy red exterior , the boxy maturity it exuded in comparison to the bubble-shaped go-kart i had exchanged it for - i was seduced .
buying the fiesta felt like i was moving up the driving ladder .
i had been a fully licensed driver for a year and it was time to get serious .
however , i was left cold - literally . refrigerator on wheels or status symbol ? purchased during the waning weeks of autumn , the fiesta seemed an ideal chariot for the busy life i was now leading .
people with cars had a certain standing within a group of friends and the responsibility of being the designated driver at times was an added ego boost .
people wanted to drive with me . that is until winter hit and i found out that i had to do a steady 70 miles per hour -lrb- 112 kph -rrb- for at least 45 minutes before the heater would even begin to blow anything other than an icy chill into the car .
driving with me had turned into a recurring scene from the keanu reeves movie speed .
if the needle dropped below 70 , those on board were in danger of freezing to death .
however , negotiating roads in december at that speed was also life-threatening and the fiesta was soon in the classifieds and out of my life . but i had not learned my lesson .
again my head was turned .
this time a slinky german number caught my eye .
the teutonic charm of the volkswagen golf was too much and i took the next step up the auto evolutionary ladder … into a nightmare . the breakdown of a relationship within a day of ownership , she 'd died on me .
after suffering the ignominy of being towed back into town , we tried again .
this time the failure was more spectacular as we disappeared in a boom of black smoke which would have made james bond envious as we accelerated away from a roundabout and limped onto the hard shoulder . like any man caught in a destructive affair , words meant nothing .
i was convinced it would all work out .
my hard earned cash went on a new engine and for a while we were happy together .
until the breakdowns started again and i knew it was over .
i managed to get her running long enough to sell her but she was cursed .
a few weeks later , i saw , from my hiding place , the new owner pushing the car along a street . what a fool i 'd been !
how could i have been so easily swayed ?
my next car would be a return to those warm and happy memories of my first love .
this time , the mini was newer , more sophisticated and considerably more expensive .
she was a dream to drive and i honestly felt sad to see her go as i departed for university some 18 months later . maybe it was the realization that you ca n't turn back time or that public transport is much cheaper than owning your own .
whatever it was , i have n't owned a car since . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a mini license for german teens starting tuesday , 16-year-old germans can drive so-called mini cars .

girlfriends can come and go but as long as you have a tank of gas at the time , so can you . my first getaway car was an austin mini and , i freely admit , i gave myself entirely to that car .
it was bought in a storm from a coastal village for the princely sum of ₤ 70 -lrb- € 101 , $ 133 -rrb- .
i had yet to pass my driving test and my extremely nervous but charitable mother agreed to co-pilot our return with me at the wheel , despite the sheets of rain and booming clouds above .
it was love at first sight .
royal blue flashed with sea air rust , it would be my escape route throughout my mid-teens . the curse of the boy racer or so i thought .
as with many young drivers , the car in its purest form was never enough .
in went the sunroof , on went the wide wheels and straight box double-shotgun exhaust and racing steering wheel .
and the stereo ?
if the gurgling pipes at the back were n't enough to signal my arrival , then my soundsystem would be .
but the love affair was not to last .
i got greedy .
i wanted more . to exchange one love for another always seems like a good idea at the time .
you 're moving on , older and wiser , to new horizons .
you feel you have outgrown your past .
but you soon realize that , as with all first loves , the cars that come after ' the one ' have the problem that they must always live in that shadow . my ford fiesta was an affair of the head , not of the heart .
the larger engine , the glossy red exterior , the boxy maturity it exuded in comparison to the bubble-shaped go-kart i had exchanged it for - i was seduced .
buying the fiesta felt like i was moving up the driving ladder .
i had been a fully licensed driver for a year and it was time to get serious .
however , i was left cold - literally . refrigerator on wheels or status symbol ? purchased during the waning weeks of autumn , the fiesta seemed an ideal chariot for the busy life i was now leading .
people with cars had a certain standing within a group of friends and the responsibility of being the designated driver at times was an added ego boost .
people wanted to drive with me . that is until winter hit and i found out that i had to do a steady 70 miles per hour -lrb- 112 kph -rrb- for at least 45 minutes before the heater would even begin to blow anything other than an icy chill into the car .
driving with me had turned into a recurring scene from the keanu reeves movie speed .
if the needle dropped below 70 , those on board were in danger of freezing to death .
however , negotiating roads in december at that speed was also life-threatening and the fiesta was soon in the classifieds and out of my life . but i had not learned my lesson .
again my head was turned .
this time a slinky german number caught my eye .
the teutonic charm of the volkswagen golf was too much and i took the next step up the auto evolutionary ladder … into a nightmare . the breakdown of a relationship within a day of ownership , she 'd died on me .
after suffering the ignominy of being towed back into town , we tried again .
this time the failure was more spectacular as we disappeared in a boom of black smoke which would have made james bond envious as we accelerated away from a roundabout and limped onto the hard shoulder . like any man caught in a destructive affair , words meant nothing .
i was convinced it would all work out .
my hard earned cash went on a new engine and for a while we were happy together .
until the breakdowns started again and i knew it was over .
i managed to get her running long enough to sell her but she was cursed .
a few weeks later , i saw , from my hiding place , the new owner pushing the car along a street . what a fool i 'd been !
how could i have been so easily swayed ?
my next car would be a return to those warm and happy memories of my first love .
this time , the mini was newer , more sophisticated and considerably more expensive .
she was a dream to drive and i honestly felt sad to see her go as i departed for university some 18 months later . maybe it was the realization that you ca n't turn back time or that public transport is much cheaper than owning your own .
whatever it was , i have n't owned a car since . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a mini license for german teens starting tuesday , 16-year-old germans can drive so-called mini cars .

the plan is not without its critics . in the northern german federal state of schleswig-holstein , the danish minority party ssw has become a decisive factor in forming a post-election coalition government .
social democrats and greens are now courting the small party - which , by agreeing to tolerate the coalition , is now in a position to ask for political favors in the interest of its own voters . the slavonic minority of the sorbs in eastern germany have a vested interest in what happens in schleswig holstein .
they also want to become more influential .
on wednesday , sorbian leaders announced they 'd be forming a minority party of their own before the end of march in a bid for more political clout . the desire for direct influence up to now , the 20,000 protestant sorbs in brandenburg and another 40,000 catholic sorbs in neighboring saxony are only represented by an umbrella organization called domovina , as well as sorbian councils in the state assemblies .
however , neither of the two offer any direct influence on decision-making . elke lorenz , a local counsellor in the sorbian stronghold of bautzen , views the sorbs ' endeavours to found a party of their own with suspicion , and plays down current difficulties . " i would n't say there have ever been grave conflicts between us germans and the sorbs living here , " she said .
" we can look back on many centuries of peaceful coexistence .
of course , the nazi period had a severe impact on our relationship in that the sorbian language and the sorbian party was banned .
but things have long returned to normal . " the next step for sorbian leaders such as hannes kell , though , the re-founding of a party is essential .
he says that increasingly , the sorbs are viewed as a mere folklore ensemble entitled to appear at cultural events in the region .
he calls for more political influence to make sure that sorbian traditions are preserved .
and money plays no small role in this . kell deplores the cutting of subsidies over the past few years .
in 2005 alone , the sorbian minority in brandenburg will get € 152,000 -lrb- $ 200,000 -rrb- less than previously promised by the regional government .
federal allocations are also going down with the government in berlin shelling out € 450,000 less than in the previous year . sorbs on the move bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan nuck leos shatava from the institute of sorbian culture is skeptical about the forming of a party , fearing that it might not get the desired backing from the population on the ground .
jan nuck -lrb- photo -rrb- from domowina also has his doubts , saying he does n't see " why it would lead to greater influence for the sorbs . " but hannes kell says it 's high time the sorbs entered uncharted territory in unified germany . he 's poised to form the party to be called " serbska ludowa strona , " or sorbian people 's party , in a few weeks ' time .
just like the danish minority party in schleswig-holstein , the sorbian party would not have to clear the five-percent hurdle at elections .
some 20,000 votes would entitle them to send a representative of their own into the regional parliament . hardy graupner -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's struggling ethnic minority on a modest stretch of land in germany 's east saxony and south brandenburg regions , a tiny slavonic nation continues to fight its corner for cultural recognition and " sorb " survival .

outside , police blocked the street and bystanders watched with curiosity as the defendants arrived in a number of vans . harrowing testimony the testimony to be heard from the victims , who were aged from six months to 12 years at the time , has been deemed so painful that jury members will have access to a special psychiatric team . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police officers guard the entrance to the courtroom in angers " i expect that first of all the children will be listened to , " said alain fouquet , one of the lawyers for the victims , outside the courthouse .
" they know what happened . " details of the allegations against the 39 men and 27 women make appalling reading . all come from the poorest and least educated sections of society , and lived in the saint-leonard quarter of angers , a largely pleasant and leafy historic town . at least 50 children abused investigators were alerted to the network when they decided to keep tabs on eric joubert , a former convicted sex offender released in 1999 who was supposed to be undergoing a course of psychiatry .
he and another former offender , franck vergondy , are alleged to have founded the ring . according to the prosecution , between 1999 and 2002 , nearly 50 children were raped or abused - though the overall number could be much higher . the prosecution has gathered evidence said to show that parents bartered their own children for small sums of money , food parcels and cartons of cigarettes .
one girl of 10 was allegedly raped by more than 30 adults . authorities failed to act ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an unidentified defendant , right , is brought by a police officer to the courthouse in angers most of the abuse took place in vergondy 's apartment , prosecutors say , but also in sheds by garden allotments on the outside of angers and in caravans .
locals said they were aware of a constant traffic of " voiturettes " - cheap electric cars that need no licence - but no one ever made a comment . for many in france , one of the shocking elements in the case is the number of women involved .
of the 39 accused who are in custody , 13 are women .
most of the accused lived off social welfare , and were thus in regular contact with french government agencies which failed to follow up warning signs of the suspected crimes . three of the defendants face life in prison if they are convicted , and the others lesser terms ranging from three to 20 years . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de jury convicts ' beast of belgium ' a belgian court finds marc dutroux guilty of a series of abductions and murders of teenage girls that rocked belgium for the greater part of the last decade and set the stage for the country 's trial of the century .

the agreement came about quickly , as it is a far better option for the hotel business rather than facing draconian anti-smoking measures in public spaces , such as those that have been implemented recently in italy , malta and ireland . the latter countries have already completely banned smoking in public places despite large-scale opposition .

the plan is not without its critics . in the northern german federal state of schleswig-holstein , the danish minority party ssw has become a decisive factor in forming a post-election coalition government .
social democrats and greens are now courting the small party - which , by agreeing to tolerate the coalition , is now in a position to ask for political favors in the interest of its own voters . the slavonic minority of the sorbs in eastern germany have a vested interest in what happens in schleswig holstein .
they also want to become more influential .
on wednesday , sorbian leaders announced they 'd be forming a minority party of their own before the end of march in a bid for more political clout . the desire for direct influence up to now , the 20,000 protestant sorbs in brandenburg and another 40,000 catholic sorbs in neighboring saxony are only represented by an umbrella organization called domovina , as well as sorbian councils in the state assemblies .
however , neither of the two offer any direct influence on decision-making . elke lorenz , a local counsellor in the sorbian stronghold of bautzen , views the sorbs ' endeavours to found a party of their own with suspicion , and plays down current difficulties . " i would n't say there have ever been grave conflicts between us germans and the sorbs living here , " she said .
" we can look back on many centuries of peaceful coexistence .
of course , the nazi period had a severe impact on our relationship in that the sorbian language and the sorbian party was banned .
but things have long returned to normal . " the next step for sorbian leaders such as hannes kell , though , the re-founding of a party is essential .
he says that increasingly , the sorbs are viewed as a mere folklore ensemble entitled to appear at cultural events in the region .
he calls for more political influence to make sure that sorbian traditions are preserved .
and money plays no small role in this . kell deplores the cutting of subsidies over the past few years .
in 2005 alone , the sorbian minority in brandenburg will get € 152,000 -lrb- $ 200,000 -rrb- less than previously promised by the regional government .
federal allocations are also going down with the government in berlin shelling out € 450,000 less than in the previous year . sorbs on the move bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan nuck leos shatava from the institute of sorbian culture is skeptical about the forming of a party , fearing that it might not get the desired backing from the population on the ground .
jan nuck -lrb- photo -rrb- from domowina also has his doubts , saying he does n't see " why it would lead to greater influence for the sorbs . " but hannes kell says it 's high time the sorbs entered uncharted territory in unified germany . he 's poised to form the party to be called " serbska ludowa strona , " or sorbian people 's party , in a few weeks ' time .
just like the danish minority party in schleswig-holstein , the sorbian party would not have to clear the five-percent hurdle at elections .
some 20,000 votes would entitle them to send a representative of their own into the regional parliament . hardy graupner -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's struggling ethnic minority on a modest stretch of land in germany 's east saxony and south brandenburg regions , a tiny slavonic nation continues to fight its corner for cultural recognition and " sorb " survival .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 04.03.2005 germans agree to curb smoking großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soon a more common sight in german restaurants and bars moving to protect non-smokers in germany , the federal government and the country 's association of hotels and restaurants have signed an agreement which obliges owners to create non-smoking sections for their customers . the idea is to reserve at least half of the restaurant or hotel space for non-smokers with relevant sections to be created over the next three years .
the agreement came about quickly , as it is a far better option for the hotel business rather than facing draconian anti-smoking measures in public spaces , such as those that have been implemented recently in italy , malta and ireland . the latter countries have already completely banned smoking in public places despite large-scale opposition .
while tobacco-related diseases kill 650,000 eu citizens every year , a ban on smoking in public places has met with particularly fierce opposition in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italians puffed their last cigarettes inside restaurants and bars at the beginning of the year the government is aware of the fact that imposing a total ban on smoking for instance in hotels and restaurants is pretty well impossible .
and so it has been banking on voluntary agreements with corporations profiting from the multi-billion-euro tobacco business . both sides are happy it was a happy marion caspers-merk , under-secretary in the federal health ministry , who announced that the influential association of hotel and restaurant owners had agreed to set up smoke-free sections for their customers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german train stations have viturally banned smoking " we have regulations for the workplace which guarantee each employee a smoke-free environment , if he or she so wishes , " she said .
" we also have strict laws meant to protect young people under the age of 16 from getting hold of tobacco too easily .
and i ’ m glad that our anti-smoking campaign has now reached a new stage with the agreement that 's been signed between the government and the german association of hotels and restaurants . " the association ’ s president , ernst fischer , has promised to implement the agreement as quickly as possible . " people in our business don ’ t want to exclude anyone , " he said .
" we simply want both smokers and non-smokers to feel comfortable in our hotels and restaurants .
and certainly we want to do our best to fulfill the wishes of our customers .
but we don ’ t need a law to ensure this .
if you look around , the spirit of the new agreement is already present in most of the bigger hotels and restaurants where there are bound to be non-smoking sections already in place .
the agreement will make sure that this practice will expand to all of our hotels and restaurants . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : optional non-smoking rooms have become standard in germany marc scherr , press spokesman for the accor hotel chain , insisted that customers should continue to have the choice whether they want to smoke or not .
but his plea for individual freedom deliberately dodges health issues related to passive smoking . " it is praiseworthy to do something for the health of the people , but it is not possible to do that to the disadvantage of our enterprises , " he said , adding that restaurants lost a lot of business after the smoking ban went into effect in new york . " we believe the smoking and the non-smoking can only be solved by market powers , because right now we already have a lot of restaurants in german offering non-smoking zones , " scherr added . eu combats smoking the german government sees the new agreement as conforming with a fresh anti-smoking campaign launched by the european commission .
the campaign will tour all 25 eu capital cities until 2008 and will be coupled with anti-smoking tv ads . the eu campaign comes two days after the who ’ s framework convention on tobacco control went into force .
the treaty which was also signed by germany imposes a ban on tobacco company advertising as well as introducing international standards on labeling , pricing and taxes . hardy graupner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tough on smoking or tough on its ban ?

the berlin administrative court upheld a decision by the german government in 2001 to award the proceeds from the sale of property formerly owned by the wertheim family to the frankfurt-based jewish claims conference , which is working to recover the family 's assets . karstadtquelle , germany 's largest department store operator , which acquired the wertheim business in 1994 , said it would take its case to the federal administrative court to seek permission to appeal against the judgment .
the company maintains it can not be held liable for what happened under the nazis . the two sites in question on berlin 's leipziger strasse were once home to offices of the wertheim store chain but the nazis took them over in 1933 as part of their policy to seize jewish businesses .
after the war , however , the properties became part of communist east berlin , putting any claims to them on hold until after german reunification , in 1990 .
further claims pending bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gideon taylor of the conference on jewish material claims gideon taylor -lrb- photo -rrb- , jewish claims conference executive vice president , welcomed the ruling . " we hope that , with other cases pending , karstadt will finally do the right thing and acknowledge the moral and financial claim on these properties , " he said in a statement .
" this would clear the way for the wertheim family 's stolen assets to be returned even sooner and for justice to finally be done . " the jcc represents wertheim heirs , many of whom now live in the united states .
barbara principe -lrb- photo -rrb- , a 72-year old new jersey grandmother and the oldest living heir , lauded the decision . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barbara principe , wertheim family spokeswoman " this is a great day for our family , " she said .
" it 's the victims and not the big company who were robbed . " the ruling in the test case has implications for another contested site on berlin 's prime-location potsdamer platz , which is now home to a ritz carlton hotel and a cluster of high-rise plush office buildings .
the heirs have contested ownership of seven central berlin properties , including real estate where germany built offices for the federal parliament .
the claims are expected to reach a total of € 400 million -lrb- $ 525 million -rrb- . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de compensation chance for jewish property heirs following a ruling by the federal administrative court , former owners of property at berlin 's newly modelled potsdamer platz can go ahead and officially apply for repatriation .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 04.03.2005 sorbs aim for party of their own großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sorb minority want more political clout the sorbs - a slavonic minority living in the eastern german federal states of brandenburg and saxony - are poised to found a political party .
the plan is not without its critics . in the northern german federal state of schleswig-holstein , the danish minority party ssw has become a decisive factor in forming a post-election coalition government .
social democrats and greens are now courting the small party - which , by agreeing to tolerate the coalition , is now in a position to ask for political favors in the interest of its own voters . the slavonic minority of the sorbs in eastern germany have a vested interest in what happens in schleswig holstein .
they also want to become more influential .
on wednesday , sorbian leaders announced they 'd be forming a minority party of their own before the end of march in a bid for more political clout . the desire for direct influence up to now , the 20,000 protestant sorbs in brandenburg and another 40,000 catholic sorbs in neighboring saxony are only represented by an umbrella organization called domovina , as well as sorbian councils in the state assemblies .
however , neither of the two offer any direct influence on decision-making . elke lorenz , a local counsellor in the sorbian stronghold of bautzen , views the sorbs ' endeavours to found a party of their own with suspicion , and plays down current difficulties . " i would n't say there have ever been grave conflicts between us germans and the sorbs living here , " she said .
" we can look back on many centuries of peaceful coexistence .
of course , the nazi period had a severe impact on our relationship in that the sorbian language and the sorbian party was banned .
but things have long returned to normal . " the next step for sorbian leaders such as hannes kell , though , the re-founding of a party is essential .
he says that increasingly , the sorbs are viewed as a mere folklore ensemble entitled to appear at cultural events in the region .
he calls for more political influence to make sure that sorbian traditions are preserved .
and money plays no small role in this . kell deplores the cutting of subsidies over the past few years .
in 2005 alone , the sorbian minority in brandenburg will get € 152,000 -lrb- $ 200,000 -rrb- less than previously promised by the regional government .
federal allocations are also going down with the government in berlin shelling out € 450,000 less than in the previous year . sorbs on the move bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan nuck leos shatava from the institute of sorbian culture is skeptical about the forming of a party , fearing that it might not get the desired backing from the population on the ground .
jan nuck -lrb- photo -rrb- from domowina also has his doubts , saying he does n't see " why it would lead to greater influence for the sorbs . " but hannes kell says it 's high time the sorbs entered uncharted territory in unified germany . he 's poised to form the party to be called " serbska ludowa strona , " or sorbian people 's party , in a few weeks ' time .
just like the danish minority party in schleswig-holstein , the sorbian party would not have to clear the five-percent hurdle at elections .
some 20,000 votes would entitle them to send a representative of their own into the regional parliament . hardy graupner -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's struggling ethnic minority on a modest stretch of land in germany 's east saxony and south brandenburg regions , a tiny slavonic nation continues to fight its corner for cultural recognition and " sorb " survival .
-lrb- jan .
8 , 2005 -rrb- opinion : who 's afraid of the sorbs ?
numerous politicians have recently called on muslims to increase their efforts to integrate into german society .
but germany should n't become fixated on the issue of parallel societies , according to dw 's peter philipp . -lrb- nov .
22 , 2004 -rrb- the major issue of minority languages the newly enlarged european union has a rich linguistic variety extending far beyond its official working languages .
but new efforts are being made to strenghten the bloc 's cultural diversity . -lrb- july 27 , 2004 -rrb- feedback do you think germany 's sorbian minority needs a political party of its own ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 04.03.2005 pedophile trial opens in france großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many of the defendants are women one of france 's biggest-ever criminal trials - a case in which 66 men and women are accused of raping children " sold " by their parents for small sums of money and cigarettes - has opened in the western city of angers . the case is expected to last four months and is being heard in a specially constructed wooden hall in the law courts built to accommodate the 60 lawyers , many of the 45 victims , and the accused , who face sentences ranging up to life imprisonment if convicted . sixty lawyers are involved in the trial , and the 430-page prosecution case will take four clerks three days to read out to the three judges and the nine-person jury to be selected . proceedings are closed to the public but covered by news reporters , 150 of whom have been accredited .
outside , police blocked the street and bystanders watched with curiosity as the defendants arrived in a number of vans . harrowing testimony the testimony to be heard from the victims , who were aged from six months to 12 years at the time , has been deemed so painful that jury members will have access to a special psychiatric team . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police officers guard the entrance to the courtroom in angers " i expect that first of all the children will be listened to , " said alain fouquet , one of the lawyers for the victims , outside the courthouse .
" they know what happened . " details of the allegations against the 39 men and 27 women make appalling reading . all come from the poorest and least educated sections of society , and lived in the saint-leonard quarter of angers , a largely pleasant and leafy historic town . at least 50 children abused investigators were alerted to the network when they decided to keep tabs on eric joubert , a former convicted sex offender released in 1999 who was supposed to be undergoing a course of psychiatry .
he and another former offender , franck vergondy , are alleged to have founded the ring . according to the prosecution , between 1999 and 2002 , nearly 50 children were raped or abused - though the overall number could be much higher . the prosecution has gathered evidence said to show that parents bartered their own children for small sums of money , food parcels and cartons of cigarettes .
one girl of 10 was allegedly raped by more than 30 adults . authorities failed to act ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an unidentified defendant , right , is brought by a police officer to the courthouse in angers most of the abuse took place in vergondy 's apartment , prosecutors say , but also in sheds by garden allotments on the outside of angers and in caravans .
locals said they were aware of a constant traffic of " voiturettes " - cheap electric cars that need no licence - but no one ever made a comment . for many in france , one of the shocking elements in the case is the number of women involved .
of the 39 accused who are in custody , 13 are women .
most of the accused lived off social welfare , and were thus in regular contact with french government agencies which failed to follow up warning signs of the suspected crimes . three of the defendants face life in prison if they are convicted , and the others lesser terms ranging from three to 20 years . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de jury convicts ' beast of belgium ' a belgian court finds marc dutroux guilty of a series of abductions and murders of teenage girls that rocked belgium for the greater part of the last decade and set the stage for the country 's trial of the century .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 04.03.2005 sorbs aim for party of their own großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sorb minority want more political clout the sorbs - a slavonic minority living in the eastern german federal states of brandenburg and saxony - are poised to found a political party .
the plan is not without its critics . in the northern german federal state of schleswig-holstein , the danish minority party ssw has become a decisive factor in forming a post-election coalition government .
social democrats and greens are now courting the small party - which , by agreeing to tolerate the coalition , is now in a position to ask for political favors in the interest of its own voters . the slavonic minority of the sorbs in eastern germany have a vested interest in what happens in schleswig holstein .
they also want to become more influential .
on wednesday , sorbian leaders announced they 'd be forming a minority party of their own before the end of march in a bid for more political clout . the desire for direct influence up to now , the 20,000 protestant sorbs in brandenburg and another 40,000 catholic sorbs in neighboring saxony are only represented by an umbrella organization called domovina , as well as sorbian councils in the state assemblies .
however , neither of the two offer any direct influence on decision-making . elke lorenz , a local counsellor in the sorbian stronghold of bautzen , views the sorbs ' endeavours to found a party of their own with suspicion , and plays down current difficulties . " i would n't say there have ever been grave conflicts between us germans and the sorbs living here , " she said .
" we can look back on many centuries of peaceful coexistence .
of course , the nazi period had a severe impact on our relationship in that the sorbian language and the sorbian party was banned .
but things have long returned to normal . " the next step for sorbian leaders such as hannes kell , though , the re-founding of a party is essential .
he says that increasingly , the sorbs are viewed as a mere folklore ensemble entitled to appear at cultural events in the region .
he calls for more political influence to make sure that sorbian traditions are preserved .
and money plays no small role in this . kell deplores the cutting of subsidies over the past few years .
in 2005 alone , the sorbian minority in brandenburg will get € 152,000 -lrb- $ 200,000 -rrb- less than previously promised by the regional government .
federal allocations are also going down with the government in berlin shelling out € 450,000 less than in the previous year . sorbs on the move bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan nuck leos shatava from the institute of sorbian culture is skeptical about the forming of a party , fearing that it might not get the desired backing from the population on the ground .
jan nuck -lrb- photo -rrb- from domowina also has his doubts , saying he does n't see " why it would lead to greater influence for the sorbs . " but hannes kell says it 's high time the sorbs entered uncharted territory in unified germany . he 's poised to form the party to be called " serbska ludowa strona , " or sorbian people 's party , in a few weeks ' time .
just like the danish minority party in schleswig-holstein , the sorbian party would not have to clear the five-percent hurdle at elections .
some 20,000 votes would entitle them to send a representative of their own into the regional parliament . hardy graupner -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's struggling ethnic minority on a modest stretch of land in germany 's east saxony and south brandenburg regions , a tiny slavonic nation continues to fight its corner for cultural recognition and " sorb " survival .

after a lengthy battle of wills , england coach sven-goran eriksson won his battle to secure a four-week gap before next year 's world cup finals . the fa announced on thursday that the fa cup final , the last game of the domestic season , will be held on saturday , may 13 , 2006 in the first match at the new wembley stadium . world soccer governing body fifa had allowed the fa special dispensation to play next season 's final on may 20 but eriksson maintained england needed the full four weeks ' preparation time . the fa decision to bring forward the date of the final by a week , and the knock-on effect of the premier league ending a week earlier than normal , is more than eriksson could have hoped for after a concerted campaign to give his players extra time to recover from the rigors of domestic action . other european leagues which are hoping to field their national teams in the 2006 spectacle may be less lucky if their 2005/06 fixtures are more or less similar to those of the current season .
fifa has recommended a four-week window between the end of domestic action and the world cup but if some countries fail to take advantage of this , england may have at least two weeks more preparation time than some of their continental rivals . european rivals may be at a disadvantage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany will have at least three weeks before they appear in their world cup .
in germany , the host nation , the bundesliga could come to a close on the weekend of may 20-21 , giving those players involved in jürgen klinsmann 's plans almost three weeks off before the opening game of the world cup in munich on june 9 .
those still involved in the german dfb cup final , which is always played a week after the last league game of the season , will still have two weeks to prepare and recover . ligue 1 in france traditionally comes to a close on the last weekend in may , with the french cup final already over with by the beginning of that month .
french national team players who still ply their trade at home will have a fortnight before the world cup .
italy 's serie a and the spanish primera liga also end on the last weekend in may with the copa italia decided in early may and the copa del rey out of the way in late march . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porto players celebrate as they lift the champions league trophy in 2004 .

" cash for cachet bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as one of the first designers to spark the growing " masstige " trend - the popularity of mass products with designer prestige - lagerfeld single-handedly showed the notoriously haughty world of haute couture that slumming it certainly does n't sully reputations . in paris this week , the german designer made a strong statement with his autumn-winter 2005-06 line , his first since us fashion giant tommy hilfiger bought the label in december . the us company has high hopes for lagerfeld gallery .

floppy fur hats added a finishing touch . lagerfeld sent out his signature slim-leg trousers and crisp white shirts , but the collection took on a generally softer silhouette , with laid-back denim skirts and sheer chiffon dresses with flower detailing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dusty rose and peacock blue added a more feminine allure to the standard black and white , especially for evening .
a full-length pleated goddess gown with a twisted halter neckline in chocolate silk fluttered to the floor . the audience loved it .

surely it 's just a machine which makes some aspects of our lives easier .
or is it ? a car is something different for everyone .
it could just be a means to an end , the most convenient way of getting to where you want to go .
it could be your work ; it could be your life .
but whatever a car represents , it can be a reference point to a certain time , a reminder of days gone by just as a song or a place can take you back years . a first car is like a first love .
it is something you see others enjoying as you grow up and something that fills your heart with longing , expectation and a little trepidation .
you see the amount of time some drivers spend with their vehicles and you crave that connection ; you see the exhilaration on their faces as they drive and wonder if you will ever feel that joy .
in short , you just ca n't wait until you 're old enough to enjoy those same pleasures . in that way , owning your first car is like a coming of age .
in britain , where i spent the best part of 17 years preparing for the day i was handed the keys to the car door , the age at which you can legally drive comes amid the whirling maelstrom of late adolescence with all its raging hormones and soul-crushing melodrama . but in the eye of this hurricane , you have this proof that you are considered an adult .
you are allowed on the road with all the other grown-ups .
all of life 's troubles at that point can be solved as long as you have a steering wheel to grab and an accelerator to gun .
girlfriends can come and go but as long as you have a tank of gas at the time , so can you . my first getaway car was an austin mini and , i freely admit , i gave myself entirely to that car .
it was bought in a storm from a coastal village for the princely sum of ₤ 70 -lrb- € 101 , $ 133 -rrb- .
i had yet to pass my driving test and my extremely nervous but charitable mother agreed to co-pilot our return with me at the wheel , despite the sheets of rain and booming clouds above .
it was love at first sight .
royal blue flashed with sea air rust , it would be my escape route throughout my mid-teens . the curse of the boy racer or so i thought .
as with many young drivers , the car in its purest form was never enough .
in went the sunroof , on went the wide wheels and straight box double-shotgun exhaust and racing steering wheel .
and the stereo ?
if the gurgling pipes at the back were n't enough to signal my arrival , then my soundsystem would be .
but the love affair was not to last .
i got greedy .
i wanted more . to exchange one love for another always seems like a good idea at the time .
you 're moving on , older and wiser , to new horizons .
you feel you have outgrown your past .
but you soon realize that , as with all first loves , the cars that come after ' the one ' have the problem that they must always live in that shadow . my ford fiesta was an affair of the head , not of the heart .
the larger engine , the glossy red exterior , the boxy maturity it exuded in comparison to the bubble-shaped go-kart i had exchanged it for - i was seduced .
buying the fiesta felt like i was moving up the driving ladder .
i had been a fully licensed driver for a year and it was time to get serious .
however , i was left cold - literally . refrigerator on wheels or status symbol ? purchased during the waning weeks of autumn , the fiesta seemed an ideal chariot for the busy life i was now leading .
people with cars had a certain standing within a group of friends and the responsibility of being the designated driver at times was an added ego boost .
people wanted to drive with me . that is until winter hit and i found out that i had to do a steady 70 miles per hour -lrb- 112 kph -rrb- for at least 45 minutes before the heater would even begin to blow anything other than an icy chill into the car .
driving with me had turned into a recurring scene from the keanu reeves movie speed .
if the needle dropped below 70 , those on board were in danger of freezing to death .
however , negotiating roads in december at that speed was also life-threatening and the fiesta was soon in the classifieds and out of my life . but i had not learned my lesson .
again my head was turned .
this time a slinky german number caught my eye .
the teutonic charm of the volkswagen golf was too much and i took the next step up the auto evolutionary ladder … into a nightmare . the breakdown of a relationship within a day of ownership , she 'd died on me .
after suffering the ignominy of being towed back into town , we tried again .
this time the failure was more spectacular as we disappeared in a boom of black smoke which would have made james bond envious as we accelerated away from a roundabout and limped onto the hard shoulder . like any man caught in a destructive affair , words meant nothing .
i was convinced it would all work out .
my hard earned cash went on a new engine and for a while we were happy together .
until the breakdowns started again and i knew it was over .
i managed to get her running long enough to sell her but she was cursed .
a few weeks later , i saw , from my hiding place , the new owner pushing the car along a street . what a fool i 'd been !
how could i have been so easily swayed ?
my next car would be a return to those warm and happy memories of my first love .
this time , the mini was newer , more sophisticated and considerably more expensive .
she was a dream to drive and i honestly felt sad to see her go as i departed for university some 18 months later . maybe it was the realization that you ca n't turn back time or that public transport is much cheaper than owning your own .
whatever it was , i have n't owned a car since . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a mini license for german teens starting tuesday , 16-year-old germans can drive so-called mini cars .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 04.03.2005 sorbs aim for party of their own großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sorb minority want more political clout the sorbs - a slavonic minority living in the eastern german federal states of brandenburg and saxony - are poised to found a political party .
the plan is not without its critics . in the northern german federal state of schleswig-holstein , the danish minority party ssw has become a decisive factor in forming a post-election coalition government .
social democrats and greens are now courting the small party - which , by agreeing to tolerate the coalition , is now in a position to ask for political favors in the interest of its own voters . the slavonic minority of the sorbs in eastern germany have a vested interest in what happens in schleswig holstein .
they also want to become more influential .
on wednesday , sorbian leaders announced they 'd be forming a minority party of their own before the end of march in a bid for more political clout . the desire for direct influence up to now , the 20,000 protestant sorbs in brandenburg and another 40,000 catholic sorbs in neighboring saxony are only represented by an umbrella organization called domovina , as well as sorbian councils in the state assemblies .
however , neither of the two offer any direct influence on decision-making . elke lorenz , a local counsellor in the sorbian stronghold of bautzen , views the sorbs ' endeavours to found a party of their own with suspicion , and plays down current difficulties . " i would n't say there have ever been grave conflicts between us germans and the sorbs living here , " she said .
" we can look back on many centuries of peaceful coexistence .
of course , the nazi period had a severe impact on our relationship in that the sorbian language and the sorbian party was banned .
but things have long returned to normal . " the next step for sorbian leaders such as hannes kell , though , the re-founding of a party is essential .
he says that increasingly , the sorbs are viewed as a mere folklore ensemble entitled to appear at cultural events in the region .
he calls for more political influence to make sure that sorbian traditions are preserved .
and money plays no small role in this . kell deplores the cutting of subsidies over the past few years .
in 2005 alone , the sorbian minority in brandenburg will get € 152,000 -lrb- $ 200,000 -rrb- less than previously promised by the regional government .
federal allocations are also going down with the government in berlin shelling out € 450,000 less than in the previous year . sorbs on the move bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan nuck leos shatava from the institute of sorbian culture is skeptical about the forming of a party , fearing that it might not get the desired backing from the population on the ground .
jan nuck -lrb- photo -rrb- from domowina also has his doubts , saying he does n't see " why it would lead to greater influence for the sorbs . " but hannes kell says it 's high time the sorbs entered uncharted territory in unified germany . he 's poised to form the party to be called " serbska ludowa strona , " or sorbian people 's party , in a few weeks ' time .
just like the danish minority party in schleswig-holstein , the sorbian party would not have to clear the five-percent hurdle at elections .
some 20,000 votes would entitle them to send a representative of their own into the regional parliament . hardy graupner -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's struggling ethnic minority on a modest stretch of land in germany 's east saxony and south brandenburg regions , a tiny slavonic nation continues to fight its corner for cultural recognition and " sorb " survival .

8 , 2005 -rrb- opinion : who 's afraid of the sorbs ?

in went the sunroof , on went the wide wheels and straight box double-shotgun exhaust and racing steering wheel .
and the stereo ?
if the gurgling pipes at the back were n't enough to signal my arrival , then my soundsystem would be .
but the love affair was not to last .
i got greedy .
i wanted more . to exchange one love for another always seems like a good idea at the time .
you 're moving on , older and wiser , to new horizons .
you feel you have outgrown your past .
but you soon realize that , as with all first loves , the cars that come after ' the one ' have the problem that they must always live in that shadow . my ford fiesta was an affair of the head , not of the heart .
the larger engine , the glossy red exterior , the boxy maturity it exuded in comparison to the bubble-shaped go-kart i had exchanged it for - i was seduced .
buying the fiesta felt like i was moving up the driving ladder .
i had been a fully licensed driver for a year and it was time to get serious .
however , i was left cold - literally . refrigerator on wheels or status symbol ? purchased during the waning weeks of autumn , the fiesta seemed an ideal chariot for the busy life i was now leading .
people with cars had a certain standing within a group of friends and the responsibility of being the designated driver at times was an added ego boost .
people wanted to drive with me . that is until winter hit and i found out that i had to do a steady 70 miles per hour -lrb- 112 kph -rrb- for at least 45 minutes before the heater would even begin to blow anything other than an icy chill into the car .
driving with me had turned into a recurring scene from the keanu reeves movie speed .
if the needle dropped below 70 , those on board were in danger of freezing to death .
however , negotiating roads in december at that speed was also life-threatening and the fiesta was soon in the classifieds and out of my life . but i had not learned my lesson .
again my head was turned .
this time a slinky german number caught my eye .
the teutonic charm of the volkswagen golf was too much and i took the next step up the auto evolutionary ladder … into a nightmare . the breakdown of a relationship within a day of ownership , she 'd died on me .
after suffering the ignominy of being towed back into town , we tried again .
this time the failure was more spectacular as we disappeared in a boom of black smoke which would have made james bond envious as we accelerated away from a roundabout and limped onto the hard shoulder . like any man caught in a destructive affair , words meant nothing .
i was convinced it would all work out .
my hard earned cash went on a new engine and for a while we were happy together .
until the breakdowns started again and i knew it was over .
i managed to get her running long enough to sell her but she was cursed .
a few weeks later , i saw , from my hiding place , the new owner pushing the car along a street . what a fool i 'd been !
how could i have been so easily swayed ?
my next car would be a return to those warm and happy memories of my first love .
this time , the mini was newer , more sophisticated and considerably more expensive .
she was a dream to drive and i honestly felt sad to see her go as i departed for university some 18 months later . maybe it was the realization that you ca n't turn back time or that public transport is much cheaper than owning your own .
whatever it was , i have n't owned a car since . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a mini license for german teens starting tuesday , 16-year-old germans can drive so-called mini cars .

after his brief flirtation with the world of mass market retail - climaxing with his phenomenally successful limited-edition line for swedish chain hennes & mauritz last november - the german designer has returned to the catwalk for the next leg of his bid for expansion . one of the most anticipated collections of the season , his lagerfeld gallery show on wednesday was his second of three in the space of two weeks .

floppy fur hats added a finishing touch . lagerfeld sent out his signature slim-leg trousers and crisp white shirts , but the collection took on a generally softer silhouette , with laid-back denim skirts and sheer chiffon dresses with flower detailing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dusty rose and peacock blue added a more feminine allure to the standard black and white , especially for evening .
a full-length pleated goddess gown with a twisted halter neckline in chocolate silk fluttered to the floor . the audience loved it .

the berlin administrative court upheld a decision by the german government in 2001 to award the proceeds from the sale of property formerly owned by the wertheim family to the frankfurt-based jewish claims conference , which is working to recover the family 's assets . karstadtquelle , germany 's largest department store operator , which acquired the wertheim business in 1994 , said it would take its case to the federal administrative court to seek permission to appeal against the judgment .
the company maintains it can not be held liable for what happened under the nazis . the two sites in question on berlin 's leipziger strasse were once home to offices of the wertheim store chain but the nazis took them over in 1933 as part of their policy to seize jewish businesses .
after the war , however , the properties became part of communist east berlin , putting any claims to them on hold until after german reunification , in 1990 .
further claims pending bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gideon taylor of the conference on jewish material claims gideon taylor -lrb- photo -rrb- , jewish claims conference executive vice president , welcomed the ruling . " we hope that , with other cases pending , karstadt will finally do the right thing and acknowledge the moral and financial claim on these properties , " he said in a statement .
" this would clear the way for the wertheim family 's stolen assets to be returned even sooner and for justice to finally be done . " the jcc represents wertheim heirs , many of whom now live in the united states .
barbara principe -lrb- photo -rrb- , a 72-year old new jersey grandmother and the oldest living heir , lauded the decision . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barbara principe , wertheim family spokeswoman " this is a great day for our family , " she said .
" it 's the victims and not the big company who were robbed . " the ruling in the test case has implications for another contested site on berlin 's prime-location potsdamer platz , which is now home to a ritz carlton hotel and a cluster of high-rise plush office buildings .
the heirs have contested ownership of seven central berlin properties , including real estate where germany built offices for the federal parliament .
the claims are expected to reach a total of € 400 million -lrb- $ 525 million -rrb- . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : compensation chance for jewish property heirs following a ruling by the federal administrative court , former owners of property at berlin 's newly modelled potsdamer platz can go ahead and officially apply for repatriation .

five weeks on from the elections , the new parliament has not yet convened .
the formation of a government has got bogged down in protracted and complex negotiations between the political factions which emerged from the polls with seats in the new assembly .
there are fears that a prolonged delay could signal a loss of momentum and play into the hands of the insurgents in the make-or-break weeks that lie ahead .
" the insurgency is already taking advantage of the paralysis in government , " a senior security official said .
" if there is more delay in forming a new administration , i have no doubt that there will be bad repercussions - there already are , and it 's getting bigger every day . "
swift action officials want to see swift action by the politicians to draw sunni leaders back into the political process , cutting some of the ground from under the insurgents within the partly alienated sunni community where they have their roots . "
having foreigners around is the wrong way to approach a disgruntled population - foreign armies are a problem , not a solution " iraqi official political drift is also having repercussions in the security arena , where the battle is to build up the iraqi police and army forces so that they can take on the insurgents .
recruiting centres are one of the prime targets for attack .
hundreds of police and army recruits have died .
" normally we have no problem filling the places of those who fall , " said a security source .
" but with officials feeling that everything is about to change , nobody is taking decisions they fear might be controversial , like approving the application of recruits who might have a baathist past .
so things are already slowing down because of the vacuum . "
although figures can be misleading , the general level of attacks since the 30 january elections is thought to have dropped a little from the highs recorded in the run-up to the poll .
suicide attacks one security analysis showed 727 insurgent attacks of one sort or another in february , with 627 people killed , including 42 members of the multi-national force , 213 iraqi security personnel , and 329 civilians .
security officials believe that three-quarters of the attacks are carried out by networks loyal to the former baathist regime , though they do not claim responsibility in their own name .
but most of the suicide bomb attacks - including the most deadly ever , at hilla on 28 february - are the work of the radical islamic strand of the insurgency , often carried out by non-iraqi arab militants .
the announcement by the iraqi authorities - just a day before the hilla blast - that saddam hussein 's half-brother sabawi ibrahim al-tikriti had been apprehended by the authorities was hailed as a victory in the battle against the insurgency .
his name was on two wanted lists - the us military 's " pack of cards " of the 55 figures deemed most culpable for the former regime 's crimes , and the list of people wanted for activities connected with the insurgency .
the interim iraqi government said he was operating out of neighbouring syria , and formally asked damascus to extradite him and a list of others .
senior officials say he was handed over by the syrians to american forces on the syrian-iraqi border , and he is still in us custody in iraq .
' no difference ' despite the optimistic note sounded by announcements about his detention , officials do not believe it will have a significant impact in diminishing the insurgency .
" it wo n't make any difference to the insurgency , though it may demoralise some people who trust syria , " said one senior source .
" he is one of so many , and not the one we would have chosen .
they just gave us one guy , for whom they had no further use .
" we came down to a list of a dozen most wanted , and all we got was him . "
" he was just a symbol , " said another security official .
" it 's more important to get the leaders of the insurgency .
there are cells everywhere , with shared objectives , and the funding is still coming in . "
iraqi officials are not optimistic that the handover of sabawi ibrahim heralds as new era of positive cooperation with the syrians , whom they blame for much of the insurgency .
" they know more about our internal situation than we do , " said one .
" if they really wanted to help us , we would have the best intelligence in the middle east .
but that 's not possible .
we do n't expect them to serve us , just not to hurt us .
but that would take a very long process for them to stop . "
intelligence security officials in the outgoing administration believe that , in addition to beefing up iraqi police and army forces , combating the insurgency needs an urgent improvement in iraqi intelligence information and assessment .
" a lot of information at the moment is wasted , in the provinces and elsewhere , " said one official .
" this is the number one priority . "
while they admit that iraqi security forces are not yet strong enough to take over from the us-led coalition , some officials would also like to see a change in the way the coalition troops - especially the americans - operate and interact with the iraqis .
" having foreigners around is the wrong way to approach a disgruntled population , " said one senior official .
" foreign armies are a problem , not a solution .
they should be kept in barracks to provide backup for the iraqi forces , which alone should have powers of arrest and detention . "

insurgents are determined not to be stopped by elections five weeks on from the elections , the new parliament has not yet convened .
the formation of a government has got bogged down in protracted and complex negotiations between the political factions which emerged from the polls with seats in the new assembly .
there are fears that a prolonged delay could signal a loss of momentum and play into the hands of the insurgents in the make-or-break weeks that lie ahead .
" the insurgency is already taking advantage of the paralysis in government , " a senior security official said .
" if there is more delay in forming a new administration , i have no doubt that there will be bad repercussions - there already are , and it 's getting bigger every day . "
swift action officials want to see swift action by the politicians to draw sunni leaders back into the political process , cutting some of the ground from under the insurgents within the partly alienated sunni community where they have their roots .
having foreigners around is the wrong way to approach a disgruntled population - foreign armies are a problem , not a solution iraqi official political drift is also having repercussions in the security arena , where the battle is to build up the iraqi police and army forces so that they can take on the insurgents .
recruiting centres are one of the prime targets for attack .
hundreds of police and army recruits have died .
" normally we have no problem filling the places of those who fall , " said a security source .
" but with officials feeling that everything is about to change , nobody is taking decisions they fear might be controversial , like approving the application of recruits who might have a baathist past .
so things are already slowing down because of the vacuum . "
although figures can be misleading , the general level of attacks since the 30 january elections is thought to have dropped a little from the highs recorded in the run-up to the poll .
suicide attacks one security analysis showed 727 insurgent attacks of one sort or another in february , with 627 people killed , including 42 members of the multi-national force , 213 iraqi security personnel , and 329 civilians .
security officials believe that three-quarters of the attacks are carried out by networks loyal to the former baathist regime , though they do not claim responsibility in their own name .
suicide bombers have carried out devastating attacks but most of the suicide bomb attacks - including the most deadly ever , at hilla on 28 february - are the work of the radical islamic strand of the insurgency , often carried out by non-iraqi arab militants .
the announcement by the iraqi authorities - just a day before the hilla blast - that saddam hussein 's half-brother sabawi ibrahim al-tikriti had been apprehended by the authorities was hailed as a victory in the battle against the insurgency .
his name was on two wanted lists - the us military 's " pack of cards " of the 55 figures deemed most culpable for the former regime 's crimes , and the list of people wanted for activities connected with the insurgency .
the interim iraqi government said he was operating out of neighbouring syria , and formally asked damascus to extradite him and a list of others .
senior officials say he was handed over by the syrians to american forces on the syrian-iraqi border , and he is still in us custody in iraq .
' no difference ' despite the optimistic note sounded by announcements about his detention , officials do not believe it will have a significant impact in diminishing the insurgency .
iraqis say the capture of saddam 's half-brother will make no difference " it wo n't make any difference to the insurgency , though it may demoralise some people who trust syria , " said one senior source .
" he is one of so many , and not the one we would have chosen .
they just gave us one guy , for whom they had no further use .
" we came down to a list of a dozen most wanted , and all we got was him . "
" he was just a symbol , " said another security official .
" it 's more important to get the leaders of the insurgency .
there are cells everywhere , with shared objectives , and the funding is still coming in . "
iraqi officials are not optimistic that the handover of sabawi ibrahim heralds as new era of positive cooperation with the syrians , whom they blame for much of the insurgency .
" they know more about our internal situation than we do , " said one .
" if they really wanted to help us , we would have the best intelligence in the middle east .
but that 's not possible .
we do n't expect them to serve us , just not to hurt us .
but that would take a very long process for them to stop . "
intelligence security officials in the outgoing administration believe that , in addition to beefing up iraqi police and army forces , combating the insurgency needs an urgent improvement in iraqi intelligence information and assessment .
there are concerns about how us soldiers interact with locals " a lot of information at the moment is wasted , in the provinces and elsewhere , " said one official .
" this is the number one priority . "
while they admit that iraqi security forces are not yet strong enough to take over from the us-led coalition , some officials would also like to see a change in the way the coalition troops - especially the americans - operate and interact with the iraqis .
" having foreigners around is the wrong way to approach a disgruntled population , " said one senior official .
" foreign armies are a problem , not a solution .
they should be kept in barracks to provide backup for the iraqi forces , which alone should have powers of arrest and detention . "

senior officials say he was handed over by the syrians to american forces on the syrian-iraqi border , and he is still in us custody in iraq .
' no difference ' despite the optimistic note sounded by announcements about his detention , officials do not believe it will have a significant impact in diminishing the insurgency .
iraqis say the capture of saddam 's half-brother will make no difference " it wo n't make any difference to the insurgency , though it may demoralise some people who trust syria , " said one senior source .
" he is one of so many , and not the one we would have chosen .
they just gave us one guy , for whom they had no further use .

" he was just a symbol , " said another security official .
" it 's more important to get the leaders of the insurgency .
there are cells everywhere , with shared objectives , and the funding is still coming in . "
iraqi officials are not optimistic that the handover of sabawi ibrahim heralds as new era of positive cooperation with the syrians , whom they blame for much of the insurgency .
" they know more about our internal situation than we do , " said one .
" if they really wanted to help us , we would have the best intelligence in the middle east .
but that 's not possible .
we do n't expect them to serve us , just not to hurt us .
but that would take a very long process for them to stop . "
intelligence security officials in the outgoing administration believe that , in addition to beefing up iraqi police and army forces , combating the insurgency needs an urgent improvement in iraqi intelligence information and assessment .
there are concerns about how us soldiers interact with locals " a lot of information at the moment is wasted , in the provinces and elsewhere , " said one official .
" this is the number one priority . "
while they admit that iraqi security forces are not yet strong enough to take over from the us-led coalition , some officials would also like to see a change in the way the coalition troops - especially the americans - operate and interact with the iraqis .
" having foreigners around is the wrong way to approach a disgruntled population , " said one senior official .
" foreign armies are a problem , not a solution .
they should be kept in barracks to provide backup for the iraqi forces , which alone should have powers of arrest and detention . "

abu bakar ba 'asyir was found guilty on thursday of conspiracy over the 2002 attacks , in which 202 people died .
but he was cleared of more serious anti-terrorism charges relating to an attack on jakarta 's marriott hotel .
the us and australia , which lost scores of citizens in bali , said ba 'asyir 's crime merited a longer jail sentence .
an indonesian foreign ministry spokesman hit back at the criticism , saying the independence of the judiciary should be respected .
marty natelagawa also defended his country 's record in prosecuting the " war on terror " , citing the 30-odd militants sentenced so far for the bali bombings .
he said it was understandable that some countries , especially australia , wanted to see justice done but they should " maintain a sense of perspective of how other terrorist cases elsewhere in the world are handled " .
" i know of many far more high-profile cases where the perpetrators are still at large , or if they have been caught remain incarcerated without any proper trial , " mr natelagawa said .
he also said washington 's refusal to hand over a top indonesian militant suspect , hambali , may have prevented prosecutors from making a stronger case against ba 'asyir .
" it 's a nagging question , what difference it could have made , " he said .
outrage at the end of the court case , a statement read out by the five judges said ba 'asyir had not been directly involved in carrying out the bali blasts , but had given his approval for the attacks .
australia , which lost 88 citizens in the bali attacks , was swift to comment on the relatively lenient sentence .
the cleric 's supporters say he is being persecuted to please the us foreign minister alexander downer told the bbc : " i have instructed our embassy in jakarta to raise the whole question of the short sentence with the indonesian authorities and to say that from our perspective , we would like to see a longer sentence , particularly bearing in mind that so many australians were killed in bali . "
a spokesman for the us embassy in jakarta , max kwak , agreed with the assessment .
" we respect the independence and judgement of the indonesian courts , " he said .
" but given the gravity of the charges on which he was convicted , we are disappointed at the length of the sentence . "
in contrast , many of ba 'asyir 's supporters were outraged that he had been convicted at all .
it will increase his martyr status , but yet it does n't cause him much discomfort greg barton , ji expert profile : abu bakar ba 'asyir verdict pleases no-one many in the courtroom raised their fists , shouting " allahu akbar " -lrb- " god is greatest " -rrb- when the sentence was handed out .
" smash america and its lackeys , " one supporter said .
case undermined the bbc 's rachel harvey in jakarta says it was always going to be a difficult and complex case for the prosecution to prove .
their case was undermined when witnesses gave contradictory testimony , and a former us state department interpreter gave evidence that appeared to back up the defence 's claims that the trial was a result of us pressure .
the cleric was convicted over the bali bombings under ordinary criminal legislation , rather than the harsher anti-terror laws , which were only brought in after the 2002 attacks .
police rearrested him in april 2004 after he completed a jail sentence for immigration violations , citing new evidence linking him to ji .
the us has alleged ji has ties to osama bin laden 's al-qaeda network .

it is a raw day and there is a layer of snow on the ground - something they have never seen in their lives before .
but there are squeals of delight as hani and medhanit are pushed down a slide by the brother they have just acquired , 10-year-old marvin , and their new sister , five-year-old alina .
looking on are stefan and miriam collet , who have joined the growing number of couples in europe and north america to adopt children from ethiopia .
it is helping ethiopia as the cost of caring for its estimated five million orphaned and adopted children soars .
it also reflects the fact that more and more couples in the west want to adopt .
the collets , who live near the eastern belgian town of eupen , had always wanted a larger family .
aids orphans marvin is their natural son .
alina is from haiti and was adopted four years ago .
they had thought they would look for another haitian child to adopt but the troubled situation in haiti has made that more difficult .
their local adoption agency suggested hani and medhanit , not wanting to put the two girls with different families .
the collets readily agreed .
one of the girls ' mothers has died after contracting hiv and the other mother is also hiv-positive and has become ill .
the collets had already adopted a haitian child there is a steady increase in the number of ethiopian children becoming orphans because of aids .
in the past it was mostly famine , conflict and other diseases that claimed the lives of parents .
then there are children abandoned by mothers who fear their poverty means they can look after them no longer .
the terrible famine of the mid-1980s left many children orphaned .
some went overseas for adoption then but many have been cared for and brought up in orphanages of various kinds .
today there are many agencies in addis ababa handling adoptions .
they are licensed by the ethiopian authorities , who say ethiopian orphans have a right to be adopted , but sending them abroad is a last resort because it is preferable for children to be brought up in their own culture .
before they flew to belgium , i saw hani and medhanit in a home in addis ababa that acts as a halfway house .
foreign adoptions they were among around 30 children who were waiting to be chosen by couples overseas - in this home all of them under three years old .
i was told children will usually spend three to six months there .
some will have come from orphanages .
others - like hani and medhanit - directly from families hit by hiv / aids .
children will not be sent overseas if they are found to be hiv-positive themselves .
adoptions are not very common in ethiopia some question remains on whether more could be done to encourage ethiopian families to adopt the orphans .
at present adoption is not widely practised in ethiopian society .
the government says it plans to do more to promote it .
one of the problems is placing older children with families in the west .
but the aids crisis is leaving children of all ages without one or both parents and with grandmothers , if they are still alive , often unable to bear the burden of looking after the children .
the number of children who already try to fend for themselves on the streets of addis ababa is testimony to the challenges before the ethiopian authorities .
but hani and medhanit , at least , have now began a new life more than 3,000 miles from their homeland .
is it right for them ?
the collets say they will know that from the two girls themselves when they are grown up .

one of the girls ' mothers has died after contracting hiv and the other mother is also hiv-positive and has become ill .
the collets had already adopted a haitian child there is a steady increase in the number of ethiopian children becoming orphans because of aids .
in the past it was mostly famine , conflict and other diseases that claimed the lives of parents .
then there are children abandoned by mothers who fear their poverty means they can look after them no longer .
the terrible famine of the mid-1980s left many children orphaned .
some went overseas for adoption then but many have been cared for and brought up in orphanages of various kinds .
today there are many agencies in addis ababa handling adoptions .
they are licensed by the ethiopian authorities , who say ethiopian orphans have a right to be adopted , but sending them abroad is a last resort because it is preferable for children to be brought up in their own culture .
before they flew to belgium , i saw hani and medhanit in a home in addis ababa that acts as a halfway house .
foreign adoptions they were among around 30 children who were waiting to be chosen by couples overseas - in this home all of them under three years old .
i was told children will usually spend three to six months there .
some will have come from orphanages .
others - like hani and medhanit - directly from families hit by hiv / aids .
children will not be sent overseas if they are found to be hiv-positive themselves .
adoptions are not very common in ethiopia some question remains on whether more could be done to encourage ethiopian families to adopt the orphans .

the number of children who already try to fend for themselves on the streets of addis ababa is testimony to the challenges before the ethiopian authorities .

it is a raw day and there is a layer of snow on the ground - something they have never seen in their lives before .
but there are squeals of delight as hani and medhanit are pushed down a slide by the brother they have just acquired , 10-year-old marvin , and their new sister , five-year-old alina .
looking on are stefan and miriam collet , who have joined the growing number of couples in europe and north america to adopt children from ethiopia .
it is helping ethiopia as the cost of caring for its estimated five million orphaned and adopted children soars .
it also reflects the fact that more and more couples in the west want to adopt .
the collets , who live near the eastern belgian town of eupen , had always wanted a larger family .

alina is from haiti and was adopted four years ago .

bbc news -pipe- europe -pipe- q & a : moldova election bbc news / europe graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- friday , 4 march , 2005 , 08:50 gmt q & a : moldova election moldovans vote on sunday in a parliamentary election which the ruling communists look set to win , though with less than the landslide that swept them to power in 2001 .
this time they reportedly face stiffer competition from pro-russia and pro-romania parties .
q : what does parliament do ?
one of parliament 's jobs is to elect the country 's president , who must have the backing of 61 deputies .
the communist party had 71 out of 101 seats in the outgoing parliament .
mps also appoint the government and can amend the constitution .
q : how did the last government fare ?
communist rule did not reverse moldova 's market reforms , nor its policy of european integration .
voted in by a disillusioned electorate , the party is seen to have benefited from unpopular reforms carried out by its right-wing predecessors .
economists say the communists managed to convert these policies into economic growth and a strong currency .
q : what of the separatist problem ?
the conflict with the dniester region , which broke away from moldova after a brief war in 1992 , has worsened .
talks on a future federation have stalled .
the region is home mainly to russians and ukrainians , who fear reunification with romania and count on russia 's support .
moldova 's communists want a complete withdrawal of russian troops and the deployment of european peacekeepers .
the dniester region fiercely opposes this .
moldovan president vladimir voronin calls the dniester leadership a " criminal gang " .
the dniester media label mr voronin a " hardcore nationalist " , keen to take over the region 's assets .
q : how does the system work ?
the 101-seat parliament is elected for four years by proportional representation .
western-funded poll 29 jan-8 feb communist party : 62 % democratic moldova bloc : 21 % christian democratic popular party : 12 % social democratic party : 4 % -lrb- moldovan institute of public policies -rrb- parties , alliances and independent candidates can stand .
parties must poll at least 6 % of the vote , blocs of two parties - 9 % , and blocs of three or more parties - 12 % .
the threshold for independent candidates is 3 % .
parties can gain extra seats from a redistribution of votes polled by candidates failing to cross the threshold .
elections are valid if turnout is over 50 % .
q : how many can vote ?
about 1.7m are eligible .
some 367,000 moldovans living abroad can vote at embassies .
the dniester region is not taking part , but residents can vote in villages on the border .
q : who is favourite ?
the communist party seems set to win the most votes .
its candidates include the party leader , president vladimir voronin , and prime minister vasile tarlev .
but observers doubt the communists will get the 61 seats required to name a president without backing from others .
q : who else is standing ?
the centrist democratic moldova bloc -lrb- bmd -rrb- .
led by former prime minister dumitru braghis and chisinau mayor serafim urechean .
pro-russian .
the rightist christian democratic popular party -lrb- ppcd -rrb- .
led by iurie rosca .
pro-romanian , nationalist , anti-communist .
said to be planning ukraine-style demos .
the social democratic party of moldova is the oldest party , set up in 1991 .
it has never polled more than 3 % .
but under its new leader , businessman ion musuc , it hopes to enter parliament for the first time .
altogether the central electoral commission has registered two alliances , nine parties and 12 independent candidates .
party manifestos are often broadly similar , pledging eu membership , more jobs , better pay and pensions .
this time opposition candidates are expected to do better , with more clearing the threshold .
q : how was the campaign ?
the opposition says the poll wo n't be fair because the election machinery and media are " monopolised " by the communists .
russian-funded poll 10-15 feb communist party : 48-49 % democratic moldova bloc : 25-26 % christian democratic popular party : 10-11 % social democratic party : 8-9 % -lrb- international institute of humanitarian and political studies -rrb- to counter such claims , the communists announced they did not want media coverage .
the election authorities even banned tv channels from showing state officials on the campaign trail in their bulletins .
nevertheless , the communists received generous exposure on the private nit channel .
televised debates often had the bigger parties facing fringe candidates .
newspapers followed events in tune with their party affiliation .
q : what is russia 's view ?
the communists have accused russia of interfering by supporting the democratic moldova bloc .
two groups of unregistered russian observers with large sums of cash were deported from moldova on charges of spying on communist candidates .
russian foreign minister sergey lavrov protested and the russian parliament called for trade sanctions .
prime minister tarlev has accused russia of using " criminal forces " in the dniester region to intimidate voters .
q : what is the west 's view ?
some 10 days before polling day us president george bush said : " moldova has the opportunity to place its democratic credentials beyond doubt as its people head to the polls . "
eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner has warned of an " abuse of administrative resources " , as well as of media bias .
q : will there be monitors ?
by late february , 109 observers were registered from the organisation for security and co-operation in europe and the council of europe .
exit polls will be conducted in 200 polling stations with the financial support of the soros-moldova foundation .
bbc monitoring selects and translates news from radio , television , press , news agencies and the internet from 150 countries in more than 70 languages .
it is based in caversham , uk , and has several bureaus abroad .

this time they reportedly face stiffer competition from pro-russia and pro-romania parties .
q : what does parliament do ?
one of parliament 's jobs is to elect the country 's president , who must have the backing of 61 deputies .
the communist party had 71 out of 101 seats in the outgoing parliament .
mps also appoint the government and can amend the constitution .
q : how did the last government fare ?
communist rule did not reverse moldova 's market reforms , nor its policy of european integration .
voted in by a disillusioned electorate , the party is seen to have benefited from unpopular reforms carried out by its right-wing predecessors .
economists say the communists managed to convert these policies into economic growth and a strong currency .
q : what of the separatist problem ?
the conflict with the dniester region , which broke away from moldova after a brief war in 1992 , has worsened .
talks on a future federation have stalled .
the region is home mainly to russians and ukrainians , who fear reunification with romania and count on russia 's support .
moldova 's communists want a complete withdrawal of russian troops and the deployment of european peacekeepers .
the dniester region fiercely opposes this .
moldovan president vladimir voronin calls the dniester leadership a " criminal gang " .
the dniester media label mr voronin a " hardcore nationalist " , keen to take over the region 's assets .
q : how does the system work ?
the 101-seat parliament is elected for four years by proportional representation .
western-funded poll 29 jan-8 feb communist party : 62 % democratic moldova bloc : 21 % christian democratic popular party : 12 % social democratic party : 4 % -lrb- moldovan institute of public policies -rrb- parties , alliances and independent candidates can stand .
parties must poll at least 6 % of the vote , blocs of two parties - 9 % , and blocs of three or more parties - 12 % .
the threshold for independent candidates is 3 % .
parties can gain extra seats from a redistribution of votes polled by candidates failing to cross the threshold .
elections are valid if turnout is over 50 % .
q : how many can vote ?
about 1.7m are eligible .
some 367,000 moldovans living abroad can vote at embassies .
the dniester region is not taking part , but residents can vote in villages on the border .
russia is accused of backing the democratic moldova bloc q : who is favourite ?
the communist party seems set to win the most votes .
its candidates include the party leader , president vladimir voronin , and prime minister vasile tarlev .
but observers doubt the communists will get the 61 seats required to name a president without backing from others .
q : who else is standing ?
the centrist democratic moldova bloc -lrb- bmd -rrb- .
led by former prime minister dumitru braghis and chisinau mayor serafim urechean .
pro-russian .
the rightist christian democratic popular party -lrb- ppcd -rrb- .
led by iurie rosca .
pro-romanian , nationalist , anti-communist .
said to be planning ukraine-style demos .
the social democratic party of moldova is the oldest party , set up in 1991 .
it has never polled more than 3 % .
but under its new leader , businessman ion musuc , it hopes to enter parliament for the first time .
altogether the central electoral commission has registered two alliances , nine parties and 12 independent candidates .
party manifestos are often broadly similar , pledging eu membership , more jobs , better pay and pensions .
this time opposition candidates are expected to do better , with more clearing the threshold .
q : how was the campaign ?
the opposition says the poll wo n't be fair because the election machinery and media are " monopolised " by the communists .
russian-funded poll 10-15 feb communist party : 48-49 % democratic moldova bloc : 25-26 % christian democratic popular party : 10-11 % social democratic party : 8-9 % -lrb- international institute of humanitarian and political studies -rrb- to counter such claims , the communists announced they did not want media coverage .
the election authorities even banned tv channels from showing state officials on the campaign trail in their bulletins .
nevertheless , the communists received generous exposure on the private nit channel .
televised debates often had the bigger parties facing fringe candidates .
newspapers followed events in tune with their party affiliation .
q : what is russia 's view ?
the communists have accused russia of interfering by supporting the democratic moldova bloc .
two groups of unregistered russian observers with large sums of cash were deported from moldova on charges of spying on communist candidates .
russian foreign minister sergey lavrov protested and the russian parliament called for trade sanctions .
prime minister tarlev has accused russia of using " criminal forces " in the dniester region to intimidate voters .
q : what is the west 's view ?
some 10 days before polling day us president george bush said : " moldova has the opportunity to place its democratic credentials beyond doubt as its people head to the polls . "
eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner has warned of an " abuse of administrative resources " , as well as of media bias .
q : will there be monitors ?
by late february , 109 observers were registered from the organisation for security and co-operation in europe and the council of europe .
exit polls will be conducted in 200 polling stations with the financial support of the soros-moldova foundation .
bbc monitoring selects and translates news from radio , television , press , news agencies and the internet from 150 countries in more than 70 languages .

council leader rodney chambers said the decision to pull out of the south east england regional assembly -lrb- seera -rrb- will save the council £ 22,000 per year .
mr chambers said he felt the money would be better spent elsewhere and that medway would still have a voice .
seera 's chief executive said it was a matter of regret when a council decided to withdraw from membership . "
this area is becoming a dumping ground for taking all the development in order to protect leafy areas " rodney chambers , council leader medway council is a statutory authority which means it must be consulted before any development can take place .
but mr chambers said medway can not always be sure that the consultation will act in medway 's best interest .
this is because the office of deputy prime minister and seera can overrule the public 's views .

the rise comes as parliament is set to debate a so called " anti-secession law " , aimed at curbing any bid by taiwan for formal independence .
china views taiwan as its territory , and regularly threatens to use force if the island declared independence .
the defence spending hike may renew us concerns at china 's military ambitions .
friday 's announcement is the latest in a series of regular cash infusions to try to upgrade and modernise china 's army .
but jiang enzhu , a spokesman for china 's parliament , played down the significance of the rise , which will take official military spending to 247.7bn yuan -lrb- $ 29.9bn -rrb- .
china 's military 2005 official budget of $ 30bn , though analysts say real figure is much higher compares to $ 400bn for us china has world 's largest standing army - 2.5m members plans to cut 200,000 troops spending instead on high-tech weapons , many from russia he said the money would help pay for more training and modern weapons , but stressed that much of it was needed to boost soldiers ' pay and cover the social costs of cutting 200,000 personnel .
he added that china 's defence spending was far lower than that of other major powers .
however , many hawkish voices on china in the us administration believe that beijing 's figures may understate the real level of military spending .
anti-secession law a bbc correspondent in beijing , francis markus , says they are concerned about the impact of europe 's moves towards lifting an arms embargo on china and they are closely watching a new anti-secession law set to be passed by the chinese parliament - the national people 's congress .
that will underpin beijing 's drive for peaceful reunification with taiwan and set out a red line against moves by the island towards formal independence .
mr jiang stressed in his news conference that it was not a " war mobilisation order " .
but he also warned : " taiwan independence forces and their adventurous moves have seriously threatened china 's state sovereignty and territorial integrity . "
the anti-secession law will be addressed in a speech by npc vice chairman wang zhaoguo on tuesday .
and analysts will also watch for any mention of it during premier wen jiabao 's work report on saturday .
the political future of hong kong chief executive tung chee-hwa , whom hong kong papers say is set to retire , will also be in the spotlight .
mr tung , who is in beijing for the meeting of the advisory body to the npc , the cppcc , is expected to meet chinese president hu jintao on saturday afternoon and probably return to hong kong on sunday , a government source told reuters news agency friday marked the formal resignation of another political leader - former chinese president jiang zemin .
he stood down from the last of his posts - chairman of the state central military commission , a largely ceremonial panel .
as is usual for china 's annual parliamentary session , security is tight in the capital .
cars are searched as they enter beijing , and there is a ban on hot air balloons , model aircraft and paragliders .
" more than 650,000 people will stand guard and go on patrol on the city 's streets and lanes every day to guarantee security , " the legal evening post quoted a public security bureau official as saying .

a new study on the 20th anniversary of the end of the 1984-5 dispute has found that more than 20,000 mining jobs in wales still have not been replaced .
the sheffield hallam university research also found lower pay and high levels of ill-health .
the welsh assembly government said it had created 122,000 jobs since 1999 .
professor stephen fothergill , who led the research , said the findings were a " sad reflection " on the scale of the job losses in the coal industry .
since the mines have closed , everyone has had to move out of the valleys to get work ex-miner terry hiatt the study said that only 60 % of coal job losses in england and wales since the early 1980s had been replaced by other forms of employment - often more poorly paid than work in the pits .
researchers fund 90,000 coal jobs throughout the uk have not been replaced - 22,000 in south wales .
while smaller mining areas in leicestershire and warwickshire were well on the way to full recovery , others , such as northumberland and , in particular , south wales , had made slow progress , the report said .
mr fothergill estimated it could take another 10 to 15 years for a full economic recovery .
' hard times ' the report also points to around a 100,000 former miners in the uk who are classed as " hidden unemployed " because they are claiming incapacity benefits .
former colliers in the garw valley , near bridgend , told bbc wales that unemployment had been a problem in the area since the end of the miners ' strike .
kevin beynon , a former miner in the valley 's ocean colliery , said : " a lot of people fell on hard times .
" there 's quite a number of boys -lrb- unemployed -rrb- .
some have gone with ill health - the majority ca n't find work . "
many miners have not worked since the pits closed former miner terry hiatt , who opened his own double glazing business in the aftermath of the pit closures , said more should be done to provide employment in coalfield areas .
he added : " since the mines have closed , everyone has had to move out of the valleys to get work .
" a lot have gone self-employed and retrained , some it 's worked for and some it has n't . "
ogmore mp huw irranca-davies added that the pool of potential workers in the south wales valleys should be used .
he said : : " we should be tapping into the entrepreneurship of the south wales valleys .
" we have so many people in the valleys who are untapped talent thrown on the scrapheap . "
a welsh assembly government spokesperson said action had been taken to regenerate coalfield areas .
a statement said : " since 1999 , 122,000 new jobs have been created by the welsh assembly government .
" recent figures show average earnings in wales have increased more than any other uk region demonstrating that we have not only dealt with the scourge of mass unemployment , but created high quality jobs which are transforming our economy . "
in 1981 , the coal industry employed 229,000 workers in england and wales , but just 7,000 are employed today .

a new study on the 20th anniversary of the end of the 1984-5 dispute has found that more than 20,000 mining jobs in wales still have not been replaced .
the sheffield hallam university research also found lower pay and high levels of ill-health .
the welsh assembly government said it had created 122,000 jobs since 1999 .
professor stephen fothergill , who led the research , said the findings were a " sad reflection " on the scale of the job losses in the coal industry .
since the mines have closed , everyone has had to move out of the valleys to get work ex-miner terry hiatt the study said that only 60 % of coal job losses in england and wales since the early 1980s had been replaced by other forms of employment - often more poorly paid than work in the pits .
researchers fund 90,000 coal jobs throughout the uk have not been replaced - 22,000 in south wales .
while smaller mining areas in leicestershire and warwickshire were well on the way to full recovery , others , such as northumberland and , in particular , south wales , had made slow progress , the report said .
mr fothergill estimated it could take another 10 to 15 years for a full economic recovery .
' hard times ' the report also points to around a 100,000 former miners in the uk who are classed as " hidden unemployed " because they are claiming incapacity benefits .
former colliers in the garw valley , near bridgend , told bbc wales that unemployment had been a problem in the area since the end of the miners ' strike .
kevin beynon , a former miner in the valley 's ocean colliery , said : " a lot of people fell on hard times .
" there 's quite a number of boys -lrb- unemployed -rrb- .
some have gone with ill health - the majority ca n't find work . "
many miners have not worked since the pits closed former miner terry hiatt , who opened his own double glazing business in the aftermath of the pit closures , said more should be done to provide employment in coalfield areas .
he added : " since the mines have closed , everyone has had to move out of the valleys to get work .
" a lot have gone self-employed and retrained , some it 's worked for and some it has n't . "
ogmore mp huw irranca-davies added that the pool of potential workers in the south wales valleys should be used .
he said : : " we should be tapping into the entrepreneurship of the south wales valleys .
" we have so many people in the valleys who are untapped talent thrown on the scrapheap . "

intel is developing ultra-wideband technology -lrb- uwb -rrb- which would allow fast data transfer but with low power needs .
uwb is tipped to be used for wireless transfer of video in the home or office and for use in wireless usb devices which need low power consumption .
a rival uwb standard is being developed by motorola and chip firm freescale .
at the mobile phone conference 3gsm in cannes last month samsung demonstrated a phone using uwb technology from freescale .
consumer electronics companies want uwb to replace cables and simplify set-up jeff ravencraft , intel at a press conference on thursday intel announced that two uwb groups , wimedia alliance and multi-band ofdm alliance had merged to support the technology .
uwb makes it possible to stream huge amounts of data through the air over short distances .
one of the more likely uses of uwb is to make it possible to send dvd quality video images wirelessly to tv screens or to let people beam music to media players around their home .

" consumer electronics companies want uwb to replace cables and simplify set-up , " jeff ravencraft , technology strategist at intel and chairman of the wireless usb promoter group , told technology site zdnet .
" thirty percent of consumer electronics returns are because the consumer could n't set up the equipment . "
the first products using uwb technology from intel are due to hit the market later this year .
initially they will be products using wireless usb 2.0 connections .
uwb could also be used to create so-called personal area networks that let a person 's gadgets quickly and easily swap data amongst themselves .
the technology works over a range up to 10 metres and uses billions of short radio pulses every second to carry data .
intel says the benefit of uwb is that it does not interfere with other wi-fi technologies already in use such as wi-fi , wimax and mobile phone networks .

intel says the benefit of uwb is that it does not interfere with other wi-fi technologies already in use such as wi-fi , wimax and mobile phone networks .

mr sinclair is alleged to have broken a restraining order and evaded security guards because he wanted the passion of the christ director to pray with him .
gibson said he had had uninvited guests at his home before , but mr sinclair gave him more cause for concern .
" he does n't appear to know his boundaries , " the star told the court .
unusual persistence the 49-year-old actor said that prior to his arrest in october last year , mr sinclair had appeared several times at the gates of gibson 's malibu home , showing " unusual persistence " .
" i found it odd someone would not have a sense of personal boundaries , and whether or not they were welcome , " said the braveheart star .
although gibson said mr sinclair did not appear to be threatening , he gave his wife robyn cause for concern .
" she did n't want to find him sitting in the living room drinking tea , " said gibson , who sought a restraining order against mr sinclair last year .
zach sinclair , 34 , faces 16 months in jail if found guilty however , mr sinclair is alleged to have approached the actor 's home within 24 hours of the order being imposed .
" i think he needs some help , but he worries my wife and other people around me , my family , " gibson said in court .
the idaho man is said to have begun writing to the actor in july 2004 after seeing gibson 's movie the passion of the christ , about the last 12 hours in christ 's life .
gibson 's security chief , jerry mckay , told the court the defendant had sent 12 letters to gibson which said god had sent him to california to pray with the star .
mr sinclair , who is defending himself , did not cross-examine gibson in court .
he is charged with one felony count of stalking .
if found guilty , mr sinclair faces up to 16 months in prison and probation .

the pupils , from st mary 's rc school in longbenton , north tyneside , were sent home on thursday afternoon .
motorists complained that youngsters had targeted passing cars during the school yard pitch battle .
deputy head teacher , kenneth dyer , said he thought the travelling public were " fed up to the back teeth " of the bad behaviour of some pupils .
the school suspended those involved for two days .
mr dyer said the children involved had broken a rule , which allowed them to play with snow on fields , but not in the yard .
he said he wanted the yard to be a " refuge " for students who did not want to play with snowballs .
' tiny minority ' last week a county durham school excluded eight pupils for throwing snowballs .
mr dyer said : " quite frankly , i think the travelling public are fed up to the back teeth with the bad behaviour of a tiny minority of students .
" at st mary 's we are in total agreement with education secretary ruth kelly that we take a zero tolerance approach to poor behaviour .
" at the same time we are not killjoys .
we provided a huge area where hundreds of children played safely in the snow .
" but you have to question the motivation of that tiny minority that chose to target people and property .
they were the ones that we punished . "
peter renwick from gosforth said he was caught in a crossfire of snowballs as he was driving past the school .

the pupils , from st mary 's rc school in longbenton , north tyneside , were sent home on thursday afternoon .
motorists complained that youngsters had targeted passing cars during the school yard pitch battle .
deputy head teacher , kenneth dyer , said he thought the travelling public were " fed up to the back teeth " of the bad behaviour of some pupils .
the school suspended those involved for two days .
mr dyer said the children involved had broken a rule , which allowed them to play with snow on fields , but not in the yard .
he said he wanted the yard to be a " refuge " for students who did not want to play with snowballs .
' tiny minority ' last week a county durham school excluded eight pupils for throwing snowballs .
mr dyer said : " quite frankly , i think the travelling public are fed up to the back teeth with the bad behaviour of a tiny minority of students .
" at st mary 's we are in total agreement with education secretary ruth kelly that we take a zero tolerance approach to poor behaviour .
" at the same time we are not killjoys .
we provided a huge area where hundreds of children played safely in the snow .
" but you have to question the motivation of that tiny minority that chose to target people and property .
they were the ones that we punished . "
peter renwick from gosforth said he was caught in a crossfire of snowballs as he was driving past the school .
he said : " there were at least 20 children throwing snowballs across the road and at cars .
" i thought that someone driving down could get agitated and swerve and possibly kill someone or be killed themselves . "

bbc news -pipe- have your say -pipe- are you convinced that mmr is safe ?
bbc news / have your say graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- friday , 4 march , 2005 , 10:43 gmt are you convinced that mmr is safe ?
scientists in japan have found that cases of autism kept rising after they withdrew the measles , mumps and rubella jab and replaced it with single jabs .
the study looked at the medical records of about 30,000 children and is the first report to examine autism rates after the withdrawal of the mmr vaccine .
the british government says this study adds to the wealth of evidence that there is no link between mmr and autism .
but critics say more conclusive proof from uk-based studies is needed .
does this report influence your attitude towards the mmr vaccine ?
if not - what would convince you that the jab was safe ?
have you let your children have the combined jab ?
send us your views using the form .
this debate is now closed .
read your comments below .
the following comments reflect the balance of opinion received so far : suggest a debate this topic was suggested by james edelman , uk " with new studies confirming no link between mmr and autism , do we see those who still campaign against mmr as being justified or not ? "
this is a mmr generation ; a generation that always believes in the latest conspiracy theory ; a generation that is so risk averse that they buy 4wd to " protect " their kids on the school run .
a generation that prefers to accept dubious science rather than overwhelming evidence , because it confirms their belief that politicians are corrupt .
a generation that puts at risk a whole new cohort of children simply to show how " caring " they are .
no doubt this new study will not be accepted by jabs as they have invested too much in their campaign to give up now .
david , beverley yorkshire trust is always very easy to lose and so hard to regain .
it would probably have helped if the government 's argument had n't been handled in such a doctrinaire manner and come over so much as being based on economics .
colin , norwich , uk i am a japanese paediatrician .
we are concerned about the possible risk of jabs while forgetting about its benefit .
measles is still epidemic in japan and many children die from it .
in the uk , measles will be epidemic soon because of the lower vaccination rate .
we should think more about protecting child from serious illness .
toshiko matsudaira , japan having had a mumps outbreak at my uni , i did n't hesitate for a second to go and get my jabs updated .
i think any parent who does n't vaccinate their child is not looking after that child 's best interests - some of the rarer complications of mumps and measles are very serious -lrb- such as meningitis and encephalitis -rrb- and could have possibly fatal consequences .
amy , reading , uk i fear i am not convinced of the safety of the mmr by the reported japanese study since we are not told the full constituents of the vaccines .
do we know if the vaccines used in japan , or the mmr varieties used in the uk , contain the preservatives and antibiotics that are known to induce autism and other problems in children ?
do we know if the mmr varieties used here in the uk are the same as those used in other parts of the world ?
most important of all perhaps are we permitted to know if the mmr varieties used here in the uk are the product of genetic engineering ?
richard bruce , yarmouth , isle of wight " a three-in-one jab is too much for some children 's bodies to cope with " chris , brighouse , uk in a word " no " ... my son has autism as a result of the mmr jab and nothing will convince me otherwise !
a three-in-one jab is too much for some children 's bodies to cope with -lrb- especially boys -rrb- - god help us with the five-in-one jab !
american studies show a reduction in autism once the mercury is removed .
it 's about time the government gave the parents what they want and stopped penny-pinching !
chris , brighouse , uk in response to those people who claim we should have separate vaccines to be ' better safe than sorry ' i 'd like to point out that doing so would inevitably cost a lot more than having a combined jab .
it 's very easy to say there should be no cost on a child 's health but unfortunately there has to be .
in an nhs with far more calls on its resources than there are resources to go around every treatment has its price - how else can you prioritise ?
is it worth denying someone life saving treatment for a ' just in case ' ?
ian , london , uk there is a small volume of anecdotal , unsubstantiated evidence - refuted by almost every expert in the country- that the mmr vaccination may cause autism in some children .
there is overwhelming evidence that measles can cause serious inflammation of the lung and the brain ; that mumps can cause infertility ; that rubella can cause deafness and congenital malformation .
the mmr helps protect against these diseases and their potentially fatal complications .
single vaccines , whilst as effective if used properly , have been shown to cause problems with patient compliance .
single vaccines are more expensive - the nhs has finite resources .
measles and mumps are on the increase .
the reduced uptake of the mmr in recent years has almost certainly contributed to this increase .
parents who fail to vaccinate their children are not only putting their own child 's health at risk but are detrimental the public health of the entire nation .
stuart , glasgow i would like to speak for those who for various reasons are unable to have the mmr jab .
i would have loved my son to have it but due to a liver transplant at 18-months-old he is unable to have live vaccines .
now , if there were to be an outbreak of measles or mumps , due to his suppressed immune system , he would be particularly at risk .
for many people who have had transplant surgery , who are having chemotherapy or who have suppressed immune systems for other reasons the results of a surge in diseases could be catastrophic .
i can understand people 's fears but surely the unproven risk to their child , does not compare with the proven risk to many other people in society .
we must vaccinate our children for the good of our society as a whole .
it 's not just about us .
we should be grateful for having the free , national immunisation programme many third world countries are desperate for .
some people do n't know how lucky they are .
sue , surrey " any mother who would risk allowing her child to catch measles , mumps or rubella is making a , possibly fatal , error " mike jones , cardiff , wales whether or not the mmr is 100 % safe the risks that accompany not having the vaccine are immeasurably worse .
any mother who would risk allowing her child to catch measles , mumps or rubella is making a , possibly fatal , error .
mike jones , cardiff , wales i suggest that these results are meaningless .
for example if the measles component alone is linked to autism .
it would not matter whether the jab was give as mmr or as a single vaccine .
the risk would be similar .
les kennedy , aylesbury i do n't know whether mmr jabs lead to autism .
all i do know is that my grandson had a night full of spasms after having the jab and has subsequently had problems at school !
he gets there in the end but is just a little bit slower in learning .
as a consequence , his younger sister wo n't be receiving any jabs at all in the future !
why not have separate jabs - it makes sense .
jo , brighton , east sussex one of the main problems is the media 's obsession with " balance " .
whenever this subject is reported , they give equal airtime and column inches to the medical expert who says mmr is safe and to the jabs representative who says it is dangerous , so it appears to be a 50/50 decision .
this is despite that fact that every credible study says it is safe , and jabs just has some anecdotes suggesting -lrb- but not proving -rrb- there may have been a link in a tiny proportion of cases .
chris , bracknell , uk " the sooner people wake up to the fact that there is no such thing as zero risk , the better " tim watkins , cardiff the sooner people wake up to the fact that there is no such thing as zero risk , the better .
the issue has always been about weighing the hypothetical risk of a link between mmr and autism against the very real risk of children being disabled by measles , mumps and rubella .
i only hope that the parents who did n't immunise their children are n't allowed to make a fuss or claim compensation when their children get ill .
tim watkins , cardiff if you look on the jabs website , they cite the example of japan withdrawing mmr in favour of single vaccines as evidence to support their case .
they can hardly now come out and say that the japanese situation , and specifically this research , is not applicable as it is " foreign " and retain any credibility .
mark gillespie , manchester , england despite the overwhelming evidence that the mmr jab is safe , i 'm astonished to still see people on this site questioning it .
as a result of ignorant , irresponsible people choosing to believe bad science , superstition and tabloid hype over clear evidence , many children will have been unnecessarily put at great risk from theses potentially nasty illnesses .
any parent who does n't have their child vaccinated is guilty of child neglect .
peter , telford , uk it still boils down to the same issue .
why does the government refuse to give parents the option of multiple jabs instead of mmr ?
in short it boils down to budgetary cost and stubbornness on the part of the establishment .
charles smith , london england why are people still more convinced by the conjecture of one man 's article than by the catalogue of scientific study that has been undertaken ?
oliver , cardiff , wales injecting a child with mmr is potentially still dangerous in my opinion .
injecting a child with a tendency towards autism is potentially catastrophic , bearing in mind the problems autistic children have with their gut , which is where the mmr cocktail resides .
why ca n't the scientists and so-called experts see this ?
simon ward , bradford simon ward of bradford exemplifies the whole problem here ; it does n't matter how much scientific evidence you put in front of some people if they 've already had enough exposure to a plausible scare story .
perhaps those responsible for presenting one dodgy study in the media as if it were conclusive proof of the damage caused by mmr might like to start apologising to those who contract diseases as a result .
and to those who say that tony blair should reveal whether his youngest son had the jab - how convinced were you about beef when john gummer fed his daughter a burger ?
mark dungworth , london , uk what does this study actually tell us ?
it definitely shows single jabs to be more likely to cause autism than mmr , but does n't it also suggest there is some kind of connection between vaccinations and autism ?
it most certainly does n't prove that there is ' no link between mmr and autism ' , as reported on the bbc news most of today .
to do that would require a large scale study of non-vaccinated children .
darren jones , st annes , lancashire " i have suffered social exclusion due to a lack of understanding for the condition " nigel r yearsley , cornwall , england as a person born in 1955 with autism and suffered social exclusion due to a lack of understanding for the condition .
this recent research does not in any way absolve mmr .
as there are many possible causes of autism , from the mother having thyroid problems to the child getting meningitis .
hence researchers now need to look at membranes and how osmosis occurs if there is damage .
do note it was not until the age of 48 years that a doctor discovered i had autism .
and there could be over one million others in the uk being treated for non existent mental health problems , which are in fact allergy induced autism !
nigel r yearsley , cornwall , england its time for the media to step up and accept their part in this fiasco .
there are dozens of reports stating that mmr is safe and one that it is linked to autism .
what do the media decide to do - go for the scare story ?
i just hope we do not all pay the price for their scaremongering and that we do not experience any epidemics related to this .
mike , liverpool i had the mmr quite late on not long after it was introduced -lrb- aged about 8 -rrb- , and -lrb- while i 've never been diagnosed officially -rrb- do show slight symptoms of asperger 's -lrb- rather than full autism -rrb- .
while it 's been in the back of my mind , i doubt , however , that it has anything to do with mmr , as my parents do n't recall any real change in me at the time .
neil , uk " we know that a cocktail of medicines sometimes do interact with each other " carl , bristol , uk as a " scientist " in drug discovery , we know that a cocktail of medicines sometimes do interact with each other .
i believe the mmr jab is safe , but more research should have been carried out before giving this cocktail .
and stop blaming " scientists " -lrb- who believe it or not are human too ! -rrb- - it is the government who should be clear and stop being evasive !
carl , bristol , uk perhaps the reason for the increase in diagnoses of autism is simply that we are getting better at identifying the ' symptoms ' rather than anything to do with the mmr vaccine .
louise , oxford , uk how much more convincing do people need ?
there was never any firm evidence in the first place .
alison , leeds , uk this is old news and i do n't consider it to be an issue .
the very fact that this ever became an issue is a mystery .
anyone that looks at it even slightly closely can realise that .
joel , skelmersdale , lancashire why does tony blair not say whether his child was immunised using the mmr ?
if he did not , then it clearly something is amiss .
he may well hide behind privacy laws , but who better to set an example .
after all he is right behind the mmr vaccination .
leaders must set the example .

chris kisch , milton keynes , uk " i am relieved that my children are protected from these potentially life threatening illnesses " emma , cambridge both my children received the mmr jab and my eldest has also received the pre-school booster .
there was no hesitation on my part - i am convinced the vaccine is safe and feel relieved that my children are protected from these potentially life threatening illnesses .
i get so cross with the attitudes of parents who do not immunise their children .
every day we expose our children to a series of events , any of which could result in death or disability .
going out in the car is far more dangerous than the mmr jab !

aj , england i was immunised as a baby with the mmr jab .
i did n't have any side effects what-so-ever .
all my kids will be immunised .
the risk of these diseases is far greater than the risk of autism .
th , teesside , england " there was never a convincing argument of a link with autism " david hazel , fareham , uk i 've been convinced it was safe ever since i heard the earliest arguments on this matter .
there was never a convincing argument of a link with autism , and the whole issue revolved around the fact that parents -lrb- quite understandably -rrb- do n't want to take any risks with their children .
as time has gone by , i have become increasingly persuaded that the original " research " that raised the fears was extremely irresponsible .
i would be interested to know how many children have suffered and even died because of that research .
david hazel , fareham , uk the original study that stated that mmr " might " be linked to autism looked at a sample size of less than 20 children and therefore can not be considered reliable .
this latest research has looked at the population of an entire city .
all other research has denied the link between mmr and autism .
what 's wrong with " foreign " research anyway ?
tan , uk the research as described does not prove mmr is safe , it merely proves that the chosen single vaccines can not be assumed to represent less of a threat than mmr .
as is typical the government hails their interpretation of the findings and pats itself on the back while watching take-up rates continue to decline .
jonny , england what is fascinating about this debacle is the fact that no one has ever shown that there may be a link between mmr and autism .
just the possibility there may be a link .
in my view , jabs is risking many lives on a whim !
tom potts , harlow , uk " numerous studies from all over the world , have showed no link at all " steve , london one flawed study on 12 non-autistic children , which has since been discredited and dismissed even by many of its original authors and backers showed a link with autism .
numerous studies from all over the world , have showed no link at all .
how much more convincing do people need ?
steve , london yet another report showing no connection between mmr and autism .
i expect the opponents will still say it 's a threat though .
what will it take to satisfy them ?
iain , uk what would convince me of the safety of mmr would be to see proof that leo blair , the prime minister 's son had been given the jab .
dave tankard , uk my friend 's father is on the autistic spectrum - he is now in his 70s .
he never had the mmr .
another friend insisted on giving her son the single vaccines - he 's also been diagnosed as being on the autistic spectrum .
i 'm staggered that people were sucked in by this ' argument ' when it first arose .
karen , berkshire we let our daughter have the mmr - i very much doubt that doctors and nurses would use this if it was unsafe .
it is also better to get your child immunised as there is more risk there than a very small , unclear link to autism alan , scotland there 's about a 100 studies now that show mmr is safe compared with one , flawed and withdrawn study suggesting a risk .
the evidence for the safety of mmr is about as strong as the proof that the earth is round .
claims that we need a " british " study is ridiculous as it implies that japanese -lrb- or finnish -rrb- science is some how inferior to our own .
peter , nottingham " the jab is given at precisely the time the child develops in language and social skills " rob , london , uk if you install new software on your computer , and it suddenly starts playing up , then it is perfectly logical to assume the new software is the cause of the problem .
if your computer stays fine for six months , then you are far less likely to link the problems with the new software .
my son developed autistic symptoms immediately after having the mmr jab , so naturally we assumed that the mmr jab was to blame .
however , the jab is given at precisely the time that the child 's development in language and social skills has reached the point where it is measurable , and i think that this is the reason for the link .
if the mmr jab was given six months later than it currently is , then any problems that the child has can be detected first , and it would be clear that there is no link .
if , on the other hand , the child can be measured as within the normal range before the jab , and then after the jab exhibits autistic symptoms , then it is clear there must be a link .
it is the timing of the jab that causes the confusion .

scientists in japan have found that cases of autism kept rising after they withdrew the measles , mumps and rubella jab and replaced it with single jabs .
the study looked at the medical records of about 30,000 children and is the first report to examine autism rates after the withdrawal of the mmr vaccine .
the british government says this study adds to the wealth of evidence that there is no link between mmr and autism .
but critics say more conclusive proof from uk-based studies is needed .
does this report influence your attitude towards the mmr vaccine ?
if not - what would convince you that the jab was safe ?
have you let your children have the combined jab ?
send us your views using the form .
this debate is now closed .
read your comments below .
the following comments reflect the balance of opinion received so far : suggest a debate this topic was suggested by james edelman , uk with new studies confirming no link between mmr and autism , do we see those who still campaign against mmr as being justified or not ?
send us your suggestions for have your say debates this is a mmr generation ; a generation that always believes in the latest conspiracy theory ; a generation that is so risk averse that they buy 4wd to " protect " their kids on the school run .
a generation that prefers to accept dubious science rather than overwhelming evidence , because it confirms their belief that politicians are corrupt .
a generation that puts at risk a whole new cohort of children simply to show how " caring " they are .
no doubt this new study will not be accepted by jabs as they have invested too much in their campaign to give up now .
david , beverley yorkshire trust is always very easy to lose and so hard to regain .
it would probably have helped if the government 's argument had n't been handled in such a doctrinaire manner and come over so much as being based on economics .
colin , norwich , uk i am a japanese paediatrician .
we are concerned about the possible risk of jabs while forgetting about its benefit .
measles is still epidemic in japan and many children die from it .
in the uk , measles will be epidemic soon because of the lower vaccination rate .
we should think more about protecting child from serious illness .
toshiko matsudaira , japan having had a mumps outbreak at my uni , i did n't hesitate for a second to go and get my jabs updated .
i think any parent who does n't vaccinate their child is not looking after that child 's best interests - some of the rarer complications of mumps and measles are very serious -lrb- such as meningitis and encephalitis -rrb- and could have possibly fatal consequences .
amy , reading , uk i fear i am not convinced of the safety of the mmr by the reported japanese study since we are not told the full constituents of the vaccines .
do we know if the vaccines used in japan , or the mmr varieties used in the uk , contain the preservatives and antibiotics that are known to induce autism and other problems in children ?
do we know if the mmr varieties used here in the uk are the same as those used in other parts of the world ?
most important of all perhaps are we permitted to know if the mmr varieties used here in the uk are the product of genetic engineering ?
richard bruce , yarmouth , isle of wight a three-in-one jab is too much for some children 's bodies to cope with chris , brighouse , uk in a word " no " ... my son has autism as a result of the mmr jab and nothing will convince me otherwise !
a three-in-one jab is too much for some children 's bodies to cope with -lrb- especially boys -rrb- - god help us with the five-in-one jab !
american studies show a reduction in autism once the mercury is removed .
it 's about time the government gave the parents what they want and stopped penny-pinching !
chris , brighouse , uk in response to those people who claim we should have separate vaccines to be ' better safe than sorry ' i 'd like to point out that doing so would inevitably cost a lot more than having a combined jab .
it 's very easy to say there should be no cost on a child 's health but unfortunately there has to be .
in an nhs with far more calls on its resources than there are resources to go around every treatment has its price - how else can you prioritise ?
is it worth denying someone life saving treatment for a ' just in case ' ?
ian , london , uk there is a small volume of anecdotal , unsubstantiated evidence - refuted by almost every expert in the country- that the mmr vaccination may cause autism in some children .
there is overwhelming evidence that measles can cause serious inflammation of the lung and the brain ; that mumps can cause infertility ; that rubella can cause deafness and congenital malformation .
the mmr helps protect against these diseases and their potentially fatal complications .
single vaccines , whilst as effective if used properly , have been shown to cause problems with patient compliance .
single vaccines are more expensive - the nhs has finite resources .
measles and mumps are on the increase .
the reduced uptake of the mmr in recent years has almost certainly contributed to this increase .
parents who fail to vaccinate their children are not only putting their own child 's health at risk but are detrimental the public health of the entire nation .
stuart , glasgow i would like to speak for those who for various reasons are unable to have the mmr jab .
i would have loved my son to have it but due to a liver transplant at 18-months-old he is unable to have live vaccines .
now , if there were to be an outbreak of measles or mumps , due to his suppressed immune system , he would be particularly at risk .
for many people who have had transplant surgery , who are having chemotherapy or who have suppressed immune systems for other reasons the results of a surge in diseases could be catastrophic .
i can understand people 's fears but surely the unproven risk to their child , does not compare with the proven risk to many other people in society .
we must vaccinate our children for the good of our society as a whole .
it 's not just about us .
we should be grateful for having the free , national immunisation programme many third world countries are desperate for .
some people do n't know how lucky they are .
sue , surrey any mother who would risk allowing her child to catch measles , mumps or rubella is making a , possibly fatal , error mike jones , cardiff , wales whether or not the mmr is 100 % safe the risks that accompany not having the vaccine are immeasurably worse .
any mother who would risk allowing her child to catch measles , mumps or rubella is making a , possibly fatal , error .
mike jones , cardiff , wales i suggest that these results are meaningless .
for example if the measles component alone is linked to autism .
it would not matter whether the jab was give as mmr or as a single vaccine .
the risk would be similar .
les kennedy , aylesbury i do n't know whether mmr jabs lead to autism .
all i do know is that my grandson had a night full of spasms after having the jab and has subsequently had problems at school !
he gets there in the end but is just a little bit slower in learning .
as a consequence , his younger sister wo n't be receiving any jabs at all in the future !
why not have separate jabs - it makes sense .
jo , brighton , east sussex one of the main problems is the media 's obsession with " balance " .
whenever this subject is reported , they give equal airtime and column inches to the medical expert who says mmr is safe and to the jabs representative who says it is dangerous , so it appears to be a 50/50 decision .
this is despite that fact that every credible study says it is safe , and jabs just has some anecdotes suggesting -lrb- but not proving -rrb- there may have been a link in a tiny proportion of cases .
chris , bracknell , uk the sooner people wake up to the fact that there is no such thing as zero risk , the better tim watkins , cardiff the sooner people wake up to the fact that there is no such thing as zero risk , the better .
the issue has always been about weighing the hypothetical risk of a link between mmr and autism against the very real risk of children being disabled by measles , mumps and rubella .
i only hope that the parents who did n't immunise their children are n't allowed to make a fuss or claim compensation when their children get ill .
tim watkins , cardiff if you look on the jabs website , they cite the example of japan withdrawing mmr in favour of single vaccines as evidence to support their case .
they can hardly now come out and say that the japanese situation , and specifically this research , is not applicable as it is " foreign " and retain any credibility .
mark gillespie , manchester , england despite the overwhelming evidence that the mmr jab is safe , i 'm astonished to still see people on this site questioning it .
as a result of ignorant , irresponsible people choosing to believe bad science , superstition and tabloid hype over clear evidence , many children will have been unnecessarily put at great risk from theses potentially nasty illnesses .
any parent who does n't have their child vaccinated is guilty of child neglect .
peter , telford , uk it still boils down to the same issue .
why does the government refuse to give parents the option of multiple jabs instead of mmr ?
in short it boils down to budgetary cost and stubbornness on the part of the establishment .
charles smith , london england why are people still more convinced by the conjecture of one man 's article than by the catalogue of scientific study that has been undertaken ?
oliver , cardiff , wales injecting a child with mmr is potentially still dangerous in my opinion .
injecting a child with a tendency towards autism is potentially catastrophic , bearing in mind the problems autistic children have with their gut , which is where the mmr cocktail resides .
why ca n't the scientists and so-called experts see this ?
simon ward , bradford simon ward of bradford exemplifies the whole problem here ; it does n't matter how much scientific evidence you put in front of some people if they 've already had enough exposure to a plausible scare story .
perhaps those responsible for presenting one dodgy study in the media as if it were conclusive proof of the damage caused by mmr might like to start apologising to those who contract diseases as a result .
and to those who say that tony blair should reveal whether his youngest son had the jab - how convinced were you about beef when john gummer fed his daughter a burger ?
mark dungworth , london , uk what does this study actually tell us ?
it definitely shows single jabs to be more likely to cause autism than mmr , but does n't it also suggest there is some kind of connection between vaccinations and autism ?
it most certainly does n't prove that there is ' no link between mmr and autism ' , as reported on the bbc news most of today .
to do that would require a large scale study of non-vaccinated children .
darren jones , st annes , lancashire i have suffered social exclusion due to a lack of understanding for the condition nigel r yearsley , cornwall , england as a person born in 1955 with autism and suffered social exclusion due to a lack of understanding for the condition .
this recent research does not in any way absolve mmr .
as there are many possible causes of autism , from the mother having thyroid problems to the child getting meningitis .
hence researchers now need to look at membranes and how osmosis occurs if there is damage .
do note it was not until the age of 48 years that a doctor discovered i had autism .
and there could be over one million others in the uk being treated for non existent mental health problems , which are in fact allergy induced autism !
nigel r yearsley , cornwall , england its time for the media to step up and accept their part in this fiasco .
there are dozens of reports stating that mmr is safe and one that it is linked to autism .
what do the media decide to do - go for the scare story ?
i just hope we do not all pay the price for their scaremongering and that we do not experience any epidemics related to this .
mike , liverpool i had the mmr quite late on not long after it was introduced -lrb- aged about 8 -rrb- , and -lrb- while i 've never been diagnosed officially -rrb- do show slight symptoms of asperger 's -lrb- rather than full autism -rrb- .
while it 's been in the back of my mind , i doubt , however , that it has anything to do with mmr , as my parents do n't recall any real change in me at the time .
neil , uk we know that a cocktail of medicines sometimes do interact with each other carl , bristol , uk as a " scientist " in drug discovery , we know that a cocktail of medicines sometimes do interact with each other .
i believe the mmr jab is safe , but more research should have been carried out before giving this cocktail .
and stop blaming " scientists " -lrb- who believe it or not are human too ! -rrb- - it is the government who should be clear and stop being evasive !
carl , bristol , uk perhaps the reason for the increase in diagnoses of autism is simply that we are getting better at identifying the ' symptoms ' rather than anything to do with the mmr vaccine .
louise , oxford , uk how much more convincing do people need ?
there was never any firm evidence in the first place .
alison , leeds , uk this is old news and i do n't consider it to be an issue .
the very fact that this ever became an issue is a mystery .
anyone that looks at it even slightly closely can realise that .
joel , skelmersdale , lancashire why does tony blair not say whether his child was immunised using the mmr ?
if he did not , then it clearly something is amiss .
he may well hide behind privacy laws , but who better to set an example .
after all he is right behind the mmr vaccination .
leaders must set the example .
the rest will follow .
