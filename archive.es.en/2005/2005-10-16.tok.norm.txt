program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : death and dying in germany end-of-life care neglected in germany germans too quiet about suicide when life becomes worse than death choosing physician-assisted death germany -pipe- 16.10.2005 filling the final days with laughter großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children 's hospices : a vital support network for kids and families children will get sick from time to time but we do n't expect them to die .
however , the sad fact is this happens .
hospices help sick children through their last days and make them bearable for patient and family alike . norbert neubauer 's son niklaus suffers from a rare genetic disorder called " mucopolysaccharidosis " or mps .
usually , this condition results in various genetic deformities such as skeletal deformities , mental retardation , and decreased life expectancy .
when norbert 's son was diagnosed 8 years ago , he says , " at that time there was just nowhere to turn , we were in this situation and we felt completely alone . when we did finally did find out about child hospice care … we really had to struggle to get accepted . " the neubauer 's dilemma is unfortunately typical of an already painful and distressing situation .
in germany every year approximately 3,000 parents are given a diagnosis confirming that their child will soon die or have a dramatically shortened life span . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sonnenhoff children 's hospice in berlin such was the reasoning behind a conference that took place in cologne on october 14-15 . the event , called the erste deutsche kinderhospiztage , or " first german child hospice days " was a gathering of child hospice workers , managers and lobbyists that are collectively trying to erase the taboo surrounding death and children and create new services for german families . a unique challenge children living with terminal illnesses provide a unique and particularly difficult challenge for families and healthcare providers .
children are not " little adults " .
and solutions for children living in the shadow of death can not be simply extrapolated from adult hospice programs .
end-of-life care for children must not only manage the physical symptoms of the child , but address social and psychological demands of the whole family . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sleeping room at the " rainbowland " childrens hospice in düsseldorf margret hartkopf , is a board member of the child hospice association of germany , and herself a mother of a terminally ill child . " it 's such a difficult situation , the parents feel guilty that they ca n't heal their child , and the physical and emotional burden of constantly attending to a sick child can be overwhelming for the entire family . " according to hartkopf , hospice care is , " meant to be flexible , the services are there to help the families , provide medical care , counselling and also educate others .
for instance , grandparents , social workers - even teachers have contacted us saying , ' a child in my class has died and i feel helpless … what do i do ? " ' need for inpatient and outpatient services germany currently maintains five stationary child hospice clinics compared to 26 in england , three in canada and one in the united states . the german child hospice movement was launched in 1990 by a group of parents living in the sauerland region .
the first children 's hospice clinic in germany was opened in 1998 in the town of ople .
" at first we had to overcome the enormous stereotype the hospices were ' death houses ' , or that hospices were related only to cancer , " explains dr. franco rest , director of the dietrich-oppenberg hospice academy in essen . bildunterschrift : rainbowland children 's hospice in düsseldorf children 's hospice 's are meant to be small , with a capacity of about 8 children ; more like staying with family and friends rather than a hospital .
according to federal statistics , there are estimated to be some 22,000 children in germany that are in need of hospice care . given this limited capacity the demand for new services and trained staff is enormous . lots of living to do the sad reality about children stricken with debilitating and life-shortening illness is that as other children become more and more independent , they become more dependent .
within this grim calculus the parents are the ones the children turn to . as germany rushes to create more inpatient and outpatient hospice services for children and families , and also grapple with the complex emotions at the core of the issue , it 's extremely important to remember that the point of this care is to help the child live life not prepare for death . " they want to be taken seriously , " explains hartkopf .

dw-world.de explains what podcasting is , how it works and how you can listen to podcasts . where does the expression " podcasting " come from ?
" podcasting " comes from mixing " broadcasting " with apple 's now-famous ipod mp3 player and amounts to radio you can download and listen to whenever you want .
so what does that mean to me ?
with podcasting you can download deutsche welle radio programs to your own mp3 player - no , it does n't have to be an ipod - and listen to them wherever and whenever you want .
you 're no longer bound to deutsche welle 's programming schedule .
how technically inclined do i have to be ?
not very .
you just need a computer with an internet connection and software that plays mp3 files , which usually comes pre-installed .
to make the process easier , you can download free podcasting clients that will , in turn , download your favorite podcasts from the internet and transfer them to your mp3 player. ipodder is the original podcasting client , but there are plenty available , including apple 's itunes .
what do i need to listen to a deutsche welle podcast ?
every deutsche welle podcast has an rss feed .
these feeds were first used in blogs but have also become an important part of news web sites .
podcast feeds contain the so-called " tags " that link to the audio files .
you just need to copy the rss tag into your podcasting client and let it do the work . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw podcast selection the deutsche welle lets you get the radio news and features you want - whenever you want to hear them .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the westward migration of bird flu bird flu reaches europe germans move to prevent bird flu what is bird flu ?
fearing bird flu , germans stockpile meds europe -pipe- 16.10.2005 eu leaders to hold bird flu crisis talks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drastic culling continues as europe fights the threat of contagion the growing threat of lethal bird flu spreading across europe will top the agendas of eu leaders this week , after the deadly asian strain of the virus landed on the continent for the first time . scientists and the european union 's political chiefs are trying to ease public concern after the h5n1 virus was confirmed in romania at the weekend , only two days after its presence was identified in turkey . eu foreign ministers will discuss the outbreak at emergency talks in luxembourg on tuesday , while the bird flu scare will dominate the agenda of a meeting of health ministers later in the week . on wednesday , health commissioner markos kyprianou will present a pandemic simulation exercise aimed at testing the preparedness of the bloc 's 25 members for such an outbreak .
the scenario will be played out by year 's end . the world health organization immediately voiced concern at the romanian outbreak and admitted that the risk of bird-to-human transfer had increased .
" the presence of this virus in romania worries us , because it proves that it is in the birds ' environment , and that increases the possibility of transmission to humans , " said a spokesman in geneva . but it has kept its pandemic alert at phase three - the middle of its scale - as " a virus new to humans is causing infections , but does not spread easily from one person to another . " virus on the doorstep bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poultry are being destroyed or quarantined the eu banned imports of birds and poultry products from romania and turkey last week after the presence of bird flu was confirmed .
it was thought to have arrived via migratory birds from further east . but on saturday the scientists confirmed fears that the highly pathogenic asian strain had been found in three ducks found dead in the danube delta , on romania 's black sea coast . " the virus taken from -lrb- the village of -rrb- ceamurlia de jos is indeed the h5n1 , " romanian farm minister gheorghe flutur said .
" we are discussing what measures are needed to strengthen the protection zone around the source . " some good news surfaced on sunday , when he announced that a number of swans which had died in the delta did not have the virus , and turkish officials ruled out a second possible case there . killer h5n1 strain heads to europe from asia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bird influenza virus strain h5n1 , seen in gold .
while avian influenza primarily affects birds , the h5n1 strain has killed more than 60 people in southeast asia since 2003 - around half those who have contracted it .
the big fear is that h5n1 may mutate , acquiring genes from the human flu virus that would make it highly infectious as well as lethal - possibly killing millions worldwide as the influenza pandemic of 1918 did . citing such precedents , britain 's chief medical officer said on sunday that bird flu would inevitably combine with a human variety and cause a pandemic that would kill around 50,000 people in his country alone . " the significance of it is n't that there will be a pandemic of bird flu itself , the significance of it is that at some point , and we go by the lessons of history , the bird flu virus will combine with a human flu virus and then it will become easily transmissible , " liam donaldson told bbc television .
he noted that common winter flu kills more than 12,000 britons each year . massive research activity offers hope countries from germany to vietnam to the united states are busy looking for a remedy .
hungary expects to know within two weeks whether human trials of its vaccine have been successful . the european commission , meanwhile , has urged member states to stockpile anti-viral drugs , and says people at risk should ensure they are vaccinated against regular flu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the race is on to prevent a european outbreak of bird flu eu veterinary experts have also demanded immediate action to prevent migratory birds which could carry the virus from coming into contact with poultry , including moving farmed birds indoors . public told not to panic while they are keen not to spark panic , official calls for calm have not prevented a rush for anti-viral drugs and stocks in some countries are reported to be running short . fueling further concern , a study released friday said researchers had identified a mutated form of h5n1 bird flu that is resistant to tamiflu , the drug being stockpiled around the world to counter a feared pandemic . european commission head jose manuel barroso said at the weekend that the eu was ready to take " more drastic and radical measures " if necessary , depending on how the situation evolves . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deadly bird flu strain confirmed in europe hopes that the deadly h5n1 strain of avian flu had not yet reached mainland europe were dashed saturday after samples from romanian ducks proved positive .
this follows a similar confirmation in turkey on friday .

the scenario will be played out by year 's end . the world health organization immediately voiced concern at the romanian outbreak and admitted that the risk of bird-to-human transfer had increased .
" the presence of this virus in romania worries us , because it proves that it is in the birds ' environment , and that increases the possibility of transmission to humans , " said a spokesman in geneva . but it has kept its pandemic alert at phase three - the middle of its scale - as " a virus new to humans is causing infections , but does not spread easily from one person to another . " virus on the doorstep bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poultry are being destroyed or quarantined the eu banned imports of birds and poultry products from romania and turkey last week after the presence of bird flu was confirmed .
it was thought to have arrived via migratory birds from further east . but on saturday the scientists confirmed fears that the highly pathogenic asian strain had been found in three ducks found dead in the danube delta , on romania 's black sea coast . " the virus taken from -lrb- the village of -rrb- ceamurlia de jos is indeed the h5n1 , " romanian farm minister gheorghe flutur said .
" we are discussing what measures are needed to strengthen the protection zone around the source . " some good news surfaced on sunday , when he announced that a number of swans which had died in the delta did not have the virus , and turkish officials ruled out a second possible case there . killer h5n1 strain heads to europe from asia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bird influenza virus strain h5n1 , seen in gold .

" we have to see things as they really are .
our year has been anything other than good , " said the german ace who went into the chinese grand prix this weekend in an uncharacteristic third place in the drivers ' standings . schumacher spun out of the final race of the season leaving him in third and giving him no chance of catching kimi raikkonen who finished as runner up to fernando alonso in shanghai and the world championship . " we have never been competitive and never really been in a position to compete for the title , one that has been ours in recent times , " said schumacher . " i am still in third place in the drivers ' standings .
it has never been this bad .

but who the 84-race winner will be driving for when he finally calls it a day is up in the air . there has been talk of him possibly leaving ferrari and ending his career with the mclaren team , although this was quickly quashed by webber .
" let 's put an end to this rumor : i can categorically exclude -lrb- the possibility of -rrb- michael schumacher leaving ferrari for mclaren-mercedes , " he told the stuttgarter nachrichten . the rumor began because schumacher , who won the last five world championships before alonso dethroned him , had rejected a fresh contract from ferrari .
" first of all , michael is doing fine at ferrari and secondly , his image is much more in line with ferrari and their sport cars than mercedes and their luxury cars .

unfortunately , the race ended in the same way as his season : in disappointment . ferrari boss jean todt still has every faith in his star driver and believes that by the time the 2006 season gets underway his car , which will be launched early to accelerate the italian giant 's fight back , will be back to its best . " i can ’ t say that we can prepare more thoroughly , but we are attempting to reply to the problems that we ’ ve had this year , " he said . " even if next year 's car won ’ t be in its latest specification for the beginning of the season , considering the introduction of the new v8 , 2.4 liter engine , we have decided to introduce the car as early as possible which is why we will introduce it by mid-january 06 . " third place in constructors ' table tells own story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ferrari 's season is winding down ferrari also finished third in the constructors ' championship , behind renault and mclaren , todt expressed mixed feelings about the season that ended after 19 races on sunday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the westward migration of bird flu bird flu reaches europe germans move to prevent bird flu what is bird flu ?
fearing bird flu , germans stockpile meds europe -pipe- 16.10.2005 eu leaders to hold bird flu crisis talks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drastic culling continues as europe fights the threat of contagion the growing threat of lethal bird flu spreading across europe will top the agendas of eu leaders this week , after the deadly asian strain of the virus landed on the continent for the first time . scientists and the european union 's political chiefs are trying to ease public concern after the h5n1 virus was confirmed in romania at the weekend , only two days after its presence was identified in turkey . eu foreign ministers will discuss the outbreak at emergency talks in luxembourg on tuesday , while the bird flu scare will dominate the agenda of a meeting of health ministers later in the week . on wednesday , health commissioner markos kyprianou will present a pandemic simulation exercise aimed at testing the preparedness of the bloc 's 25 members for such an outbreak .
the scenario will be played out by year 's end . the world health organization immediately voiced concern at the romanian outbreak and admitted that the risk of bird-to-human transfer had increased .
" the presence of this virus in romania worries us , because it proves that it is in the birds ' environment , and that increases the possibility of transmission to humans , " said a spokesman in geneva . but it has kept its pandemic alert at phase three - the middle of its scale - as " a virus new to humans is causing infections , but does not spread easily from one person to another . " virus on the doorstep bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poultry are being destroyed or quarantined the eu banned imports of birds and poultry products from romania and turkey last week after the presence of bird flu was confirmed .
it was thought to have arrived via migratory birds from further east . but on saturday the scientists confirmed fears that the highly pathogenic asian strain had been found in three ducks found dead in the danube delta , on romania 's black sea coast . " the virus taken from -lrb- the village of -rrb- ceamurlia de jos is indeed the h5n1 , " romanian farm minister gheorghe flutur said .
" we are discussing what measures are needed to strengthen the protection zone around the source . " some good news surfaced on sunday , when he announced that a number of swans which had died in the delta did not have the virus , and turkish officials ruled out a second possible case there . killer h5n1 strain heads to europe from asia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bird influenza virus strain h5n1 , seen in gold .
while avian influenza primarily affects birds , the h5n1 strain has killed more than 60 people in southeast asia since 2003 - around half those who have contracted it .
the big fear is that h5n1 may mutate , acquiring genes from the human flu virus that would make it highly infectious as well as lethal - possibly killing millions worldwide as the influenza pandemic of 1918 did . citing such precedents , britain 's chief medical officer said on sunday that bird flu would inevitably combine with a human variety and cause a pandemic that would kill around 50,000 people in his country alone . " the significance of it is n't that there will be a pandemic of bird flu itself , the significance of it is that at some point , and we go by the lessons of history , the bird flu virus will combine with a human flu virus and then it will become easily transmissible , " liam donaldson told bbc television .
he noted that common winter flu kills more than 12,000 britons each year . massive research activity offers hope countries from germany to vietnam to the united states are busy looking for a remedy .
hungary expects to know within two weeks whether human trials of its vaccine have been successful . the european commission , meanwhile , has urged member states to stockpile anti-viral drugs , and says people at risk should ensure they are vaccinated against regular flu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the race is on to prevent a european outbreak of bird flu eu veterinary experts have also demanded immediate action to prevent migratory birds which could carry the virus from coming into contact with poultry , including moving farmed birds indoors . public told not to panic while they are keen not to spark panic , official calls for calm have not prevented a rush for anti-viral drugs and stocks in some countries are reported to be running short . fueling further concern , a study released friday said researchers had identified a mutated form of h5n1 bird flu that is resistant to tamiflu , the drug being stockpiled around the world to counter a feared pandemic . european commission head jose manuel barroso said at the weekend that the eu was ready to take " more drastic and radical measures " if necessary , depending on how the situation evolves . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deadly bird flu strain confirmed in europe hopes that the deadly h5n1 strain of avian flu had not yet reached mainland europe were dashed saturday after samples from romanian ducks proved positive .
this follows a similar confirmation in turkey on friday .

hospices help sick children through their last days and make them bearable for patient and family alike . norbert neubauer 's son niklaus suffers from a rare genetic disorder called " mucopolysaccharidosis " or mps .

within this grim calculus the parents are the ones the children turn to . as germany rushes to create more inpatient and outpatient hospice services for children and families , and also grapple with the complex emotions at the core of the issue , it 's extremely important to remember that the point of this care is to help the child live life not prepare for death .

it charts the efforts of a hapless group of ruddy-cheeked swains to find a wife , and farmers ' associations say it 's offensive . perhaps taking a cue from paris hilton 's hugely successful " the simple life " now airing on german television , producers have woken up to the dramatic potential of life on the farm . " farmer seeks wife , " the latest reality show to grace the nation 's screens , follows the romantic shenanigans of seven single farmers desperately seeking love . patronizing but farmers ' associations are outraged and have called the show " demeaning " and " misleading . " their first objection is what they describe as the show 's inaccurate portrayal of rustic rough and tumble . " i 'm not saying that 's not what it 's like , " michael lohse from the farmers ' association told spiegel online .
but generally , he insisted , most farmyards look pretty different to rtl 's vision of fields of golden wheat , romantic moonlight horse-and-cart rides , village fairs and strapping young hillbillies . poetic licence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the seven likely lads the show also claims that 70 percent of farmers are single .
not true , insists lohse .
" according to our statistics , the figure is more like 30 percent , which is perfectly normal . " the protagonists are hardly a cross-section of germany 's farmers , either .
from the dashing organic farmer karl to shy stephan the pig farmer and herbert the hobby astrologist , the candidates allegedly make farmers look less like capable professionals and more like village idiots .
one of them asks his mother to choose his bride-to-be for him , while another proudly reveals he has n't left his farmyard in 28 years . " these are extreme cases , " said lohse .
" they do n't reflect reality . " viewers obviously do n't mind the fanciful take on rural life .

" farmer seeks wife , " the latest reality show to grace the nation 's screens , follows the romantic shenanigans of seven single farmers desperately seeking love . patronizing but farmers ' associations are outraged and have called the show " demeaning " and " misleading . " their first objection is what they describe as the show 's inaccurate portrayal of rustic rough and tumble . " i 'm not saying that 's not what it 's like , " michael lohse from the farmers ' association told spiegel online .
but generally , he insisted , most farmyards look pretty different to rtl 's vision of fields of golden wheat , romantic moonlight horse-and-cart rides , village fairs and strapping young hillbillies . poetic licence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the seven likely lads the show also claims that 70 percent of farmers are single .
not true , insists lohse .
" according to our statistics , the figure is more like 30 percent , which is perfectly normal . " the protagonists are hardly a cross-section of germany 's farmers , either .
from the dashing organic farmer karl to shy stephan the pig farmer and herbert the hobby astrologist , the candidates allegedly make farmers look less like capable professionals and more like village idiots .
one of them asks his mother to choose his bride-to-be for him , while another proudly reveals he has n't left his farmyard in 28 years . " these are extreme cases , " said lohse .
" they do n't reflect reality . " viewers obviously do n't mind the fanciful take on rural life .

the conference presented the former junior coalition partner with the opportunity to look back over the last seven years of power-sharing in the government while planning ahead for a future back in opposition . however , a more productive use of the meeting would have been for the party to take a long , hard look at where the green dream went wrong , not only at the last election but in german , and european , politics in general over the past half a decade . at the turn of the century , the greens were not only part of a serving government in germany but in four other european countries .
france , italy , finland and belgium all had parties pushing environmental issues closer to the forefront of policy-making through their green representatives . the news this week that germany would be governed by a grand coalition of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- saw that era finally come to a close as germany 's greens succumbed to the fate that others had suffered as the sunflower started to wilt across europe . the retreat of germany 's greens ends an era bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the greens are left looking for someone to replace fischer the return of the greens to opposition in germany , and the self-imposed exile to the back benches of the party 's most high profile minister joschka fischer , left western european governments without a green representative . having been ejected from government in finland , france , italy , belgium and now germany , the green movement could not be blamed for being disheartened at the apparent failure of an environmental revolution in the corridors of european power .

" during the last five years there have been more defeats than victories .
and i think this -lrb- german result -rrb- is the biggest one . "
the greens were overtaken by the liberal free democrats and the new left , even though their share of the vote fell only about 0.5 percent . former euro green chief says no need to panic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european parliamentarian juan behrend co-secretary general of the greens juan behrend , the former secretary general of the green federation in the european parliament who once saw the rise of the greens as " a luminous sunflower was hanging in the grey sky , " refused to be downcast by the german result . he admitted that the election result had been a " blow " but was adamant that the policies behind the greens would survive .
coming back to opposition would be " an opportunity " adding that the greens were specialists at making opposition politics and would be able to " articulate a very coherent green policy . " all is far from lost .
there may be shoots of re-growth for the green movement in other areas of europe .
the greens play a role in romano prodi 's left-wing alliance in italy , a partnership which looks set to challenge hard in the elections next year , while in france the greens are expected to be part of the left-wing bloc competing in the 2007 campaign . solid policies , awareness the green lagacy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even without the greens in power , renewable energy research will continue however , the fact remains that there is no current green representation in the big western europe governments and as a result there will be no green ministers at cabinet tables or eu ministerial meetings .

will all that the movement , specifically in germany , achieved be undone ? political analysts believe that it is unlikely that the shutting down of nuclear energy plants and the huge increase in the use of renewable energy in germany will be reversed without the green party , who instigated these policies , in power . on the one hand , these ideas are now entrenched in the political mainstream and on the other , the european electorate realizes the importance of environmental protection , and they will not allow any political party to neglect that in its policy making . the green party 's sunflower may have wilted but there seems to be enough of a reservoir of belief and support around to keep it alive .

" those are results that we are n't unhappy with , " said bremen coach thomas schaaf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's croatian forward ivan klasnic has eight goals so far this season german international miroslav klose was a one-man wrecking crew against the south germans from nuremberg , scoring a first-half hat trick to seal the game in the first 45 minutes .
the three goals put klose at the top of the league 's goalscorers with ten strikes .
klose 's potent partner , croatian international ivan klasnic , found the net two times and midfielder tim borowski scored the sixth goal for the bundesliga 's most powerful offense with 27 goals . emotional draw for schalke bayern munich had been hoping for their first victory in six tries at the arena aufschalke .
the champions ' dream was being fulfilled for 93 minutes .
roque santa cruz put the bavarians on top in the 19th minute thanks to a very questionable no-call by referee michael weiner . bayern then did everything possible in the second-half to let schalke back into the game .
they still almost came away with three points - until the 93rd minute .
weiner , who denied a penalty kick for the hosts earlier , was again in the spotlight and gave a penalty to schalke on a very generous call three minutes after regulation .
danish striker sören larsen snatched the ball away from teammate lincoln , converted and 62,000 schalke supporters erupted in joy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke 's danish sören larsen -lrb- l -rrb- would draw the foul and convert the penalty kick to save a draw for schalke against bayern munich " that was n't a penalty , " was bayern coach felix magath 's clear judgment but he admitted that his side had done little in the second-half to seal the victory .
nevertheless , munich broke a five-game losing streak at schalke .
larsen 's late heroics helped schalke to remain the only bundesliga club without a loss this season , but are still five points behind the leaders . frustrated hamburg lose for first time dutch international rafael van der vaart has been the focal point of hamburg 's rise to second-place in the bundesliga after eight weeks .
coolly , he had scored five times and assisted on six further strikes .
the club of the 70 's was again impressive .
going back to last season , hamburg sv had gone 19 matches without a defeat but that came to an end when wolfsburg beat the hosts 1-0 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaiserslautern 's halil altintop -lrb- l -rrb- leaves dortmund keeper roman weidenfeller without a chance in scoring the equalizer the league 's fans , sometimes forced to suffer through tedious goalless matches , were treated to 26 goals on saturday .
in kaiserslautern , halil altintop and ebi smolarek both scored a hat trick as the hosts came from a two-goal deficit to draw with dortmund .
the supporters of the red devils vented their frustration with their team 's poor league start by remaining outside the stadium the first five minutes of the match and could only be happy that turkish striker altintop , like klose with ten goals to his credit , found the net as successfully as he did for his national squad against germany last weekend . bayer leverkusen hired a new coach this week , michael skibbe .
the move , frequently one that management hopes will shake a squad out of complacency , did n't work .
mainz played a strong second-half to win 3-1 as the crisis for leverkusen continues .
skibbe may have his hands full in turning around the fate of the club . berlin humiliated in bielefeld bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen 's clemens fritz -lrb- l -rrb- tries his best to get around mainz 05 's michael thurk .
thurk would score as mainz won 3-1 one of the league 's presumed title contenders berlin were caught unawares at the schüco arena in bielefeld as the capital city club suffered a deserved 3-0 defeat against one of the league 's " dwarves . "
marcio borges and heiko westermann celebrated their first goals in the bundesliga in a game that berlin coach falko götz said was lost in the first 45 minutes . mönchengladbach had surprisingly zoomed up to sixth-place after a shaky season start .
for 89 minutes , coach horst köppel 's team was poised to improve their position even more but a late own-goal by jeff strasser gave them only a draw at stuttgart .
despite the defender 's fatal goal , gladbach could move up a place in the standings . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bremen celebrate dramatic win in berlin bremen pulled off a dramatic late-match comeback to knock off berlin .

what is less known is the fact that abuse of prescribed medication is also widespread . the german head office for dependency matters , the dhs , estimates that between 1.4 and 1.9 million people in germany are dependent on prescribed drugs , considerably more than the numbers of those addicted to cannabis , cocaine , heroin or other illegal substances .
in short , levels of addiction to legal medication are topped only by a dependency on alcohol and tobacco .
but while those addictions are often discussed in the media , there is relatively little public discussion about addiction to legal substances . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : addiction to medication , a women 's thing ?
the most abused medication are the benzodiazepines , such as valium , which are often used as tranquilizers and sleeping pills , primarily by women .
according to bruno müller-oerlinghausen , a doctor with the drug commission of the german medical association , that fact could be attributed to the physical changes which women undergo during the menopause , and to the reality that women are more prone to depression than men and less likely to use alcohol when the going gets tough . the fact that problems with abuse of this medication are more frequent among females has not helped to bring it to light . " unfortunately it has long been considered a women 's issue and has been neglected , " said karin mohn of the dhs . she said she hopes that a number of new measures , including increasing public awareness and improving early recognition and intervention methods , will help to reverse the trend . prevention is better than a cure johannes lindenmeyer , a psychologist who specializes in addiction , says it is quite clearly a case of prevention being better than a cure , but adds that both doctors and patients need to change their thinking in order for the problem to be addressed in a serious way . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : therapy offers prevention " people need psychotherapy instead of medication , but doctors do n't get paid much for just talking about problems and patients generally prefer to go home with a prescription in their hands , " he said .
" so the doctors give medication instead of analyzing their psychological needs and assessing how their patients could benefit from such things as behavioral therapy . " in the case of insomnia for example , lindenmeyer explains that sufferers have to learn how to get rid of the problem rather than chemically suppressing it , not least because such relief is only temporary . " unlike alcohol , people take addictive medicines because they have a complaint , " he said .
" they take it and it makes them feel better , but once that sensation has worn off , the original complaint comes back more acutely . " for example , the insomniac taking medication to induce sleep will build up a tolerance over time and have to increase the dosage over time to achieve the same effect .
a psychological dependency on the drug can easily take root . the route to dependency with some medications is incredibly fast , with users becoming addicted after just weeks of regular use .
once the addiction to medication has taken hold , it is much harder to break the cycle than with alcohol , according to lindenmeyer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drug addiction claims less victims than medication dependency " people find it harder to believe that they have an addiction problem , because they have been prescribed their medication by doctors , " he said . " by the same token , we do n't have any clinics which deal specifically with medication addiction , they are put together with other addicts and feel misunderstood .
all this means that the success rate of programs to break medication addiction is about ten percent lower than anti-alcoholism schemes . " stricter controls necessary ? if the estimates of 1.4 to 1.9 million addicts are accurate , and if it is so hard to cure them once they have fallen prey to legal pharmaceuticals , should there be tighter controls on what doctors can and do prescribe ?
müller-oerlinghausen does not think so .
he believes the path away from the addictive trend is to continue training doctors and informing the public about the dangers of tranquilizers . " over the past 10-20 years , german doctors have learnt how to use these substances in a restrictive way in order to prevent addiction , " he said .
" there are clear guidelines and the annual report on prescribed medicines proves that the number of tranquilizers being handed out by doctors gets smaller every year . " nonetheless , mohn of the dhs says there has not been much change in the estimated number of patients addicted to medication over the past few years and that the consumption of legal drugs remains a cause for concern . " some patients alternately pick up prescriptions from several different doctors , " she said . and with germany 's strict data protection laws , it is difficult to trace such strategy .

" unfortunately it has long been considered a women 's issue and has been neglected , " said karin mohn of the dhs . she said she hopes that a number of new measures , including increasing public awareness and improving early recognition and intervention methods , will help to reverse the trend . prevention is better than a cure johannes lindenmeyer , a psychologist who specializes in addiction , says it is quite clearly a case of prevention being better than a cure , but adds that both doctors and patients need to change their thinking in order for the problem to be addressed in a serious way . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : therapy offers prevention " people need psychotherapy instead of medication , but doctors do n't get paid much for just talking about problems and patients generally prefer to go home with a prescription in their hands , " he said .
" so the doctors give medication instead of analyzing their psychological needs and assessing how their patients could benefit from such things as behavioral therapy . " in the case of insomnia for example , lindenmeyer explains that sufferers have to learn how to get rid of the problem rather than chemically suppressing it , not least because such relief is only temporary . " unlike alcohol , people take addictive medicines because they have a complaint , " he said .
" they take it and it makes them feel better , but once that sensation has worn off , the original complaint comes back more acutely . " for example , the insomniac taking medication to induce sleep will build up a tolerance over time and have to increase the dosage over time to achieve the same effect .
a psychological dependency on the drug can easily take root . the route to dependency with some medications is incredibly fast , with users becoming addicted after just weeks of regular use .
once the addiction to medication has taken hold , it is much harder to break the cycle than with alcohol , according to lindenmeyer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drug addiction claims less victims than medication dependency " people find it harder to believe that they have an addiction problem , because they have been prescribed their medication by doctors , " he said . " by the same token , we do n't have any clinics which deal specifically with medication addiction , they are put together with other addicts and feel misunderstood .
all this means that the success rate of programs to break medication addiction is about ten percent lower than anti-alcoholism schemes . " stricter controls necessary ? if the estimates of 1.4 to 1.9 million addicts are accurate , and if it is so hard to cure them once they have fallen prey to legal pharmaceuticals , should there be tighter controls on what doctors can and do prescribe ?
müller-oerlinghausen does not think so .
he believes the path away from the addictive trend is to continue training doctors and informing the public about the dangers of tranquilizers . " over the past 10-20 years , german doctors have learnt how to use these substances in a restrictive way in order to prevent addiction , " he said .
" there are clear guidelines and the annual report on prescribed medicines proves that the number of tranquilizers being handed out by doctors gets smaller every year . " nonetheless , mohn of the dhs says there has not been much change in the estimated number of patients addicted to medication over the past few years and that the consumption of legal drugs remains a cause for concern . " some patients alternately pick up prescriptions from several different doctors , " she said . and with germany 's strict data protection laws , it is difficult to trace such strategy . " controlling patients 100 percent just is n't possible , " müller-oerlinghausen said . tamsin walker , dw-world .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de newsletters -pipe- 16.10.2005 what 's podcasting ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as mp3 players become more and more ubiquitous , podcasts are becoming more and more popular .
dw-world.de explains what podcasting is , how it works and how you can listen to podcasts . where does the expression " podcasting " come from ?
" podcasting " comes from mixing " broadcasting " with apple 's now-famous ipod mp3 player and amounts to radio you can download and listen to whenever you want .
so what does that mean to me ?
with podcasting you can download deutsche welle radio programs to your own mp3 player - no , it does n't have to be an ipod - and listen to them wherever and whenever you want .
you 're no longer bound to deutsche welle 's programming schedule .
how technically inclined do i have to be ?
not very .
you just need a computer with an internet connection and software that plays mp3 files , which usually comes pre-installed .
to make the process easier , you can download free podcasting clients that will , in turn , download your favorite podcasts from the internet and transfer them to your mp3 player. ipodder is the original podcasting client , but there are plenty available , including apple 's itunes .
what do i need to listen to a deutsche welle podcast ?
every deutsche welle podcast has an rss feed .
these feeds were first used in blogs but have also become an important part of news web sites .
podcast feeds contain the so-called " tags " that link to the audio files .
you just need to copy the rss tag into your podcasting client and let it do the work . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw podcast selection the deutsche welle lets you get the radio news and features you want - whenever you want to hear them .

what is less known is the fact that abuse of prescribed medication is also widespread . the german head office for dependency matters , the dhs , estimates that between 1.4 and 1.9 million people in germany are dependent on prescribed drugs , considerably more than the numbers of those addicted to cannabis , cocaine , heroin or other illegal substances .
in short , levels of addiction to legal medication are topped only by a dependency on alcohol and tobacco .
but while those addictions are often discussed in the media , there is relatively little public discussion about addiction to legal substances . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : addiction to medication , a women 's thing ?
the most abused medication are the benzodiazepines , such as valium , which are often used as tranquilizers and sleeping pills , primarily by women .
according to bruno müller-oerlinghausen , a doctor with the drug commission of the german medical association , that fact could be attributed to the physical changes which women undergo during the menopause , and to the reality that women are more prone to depression than men and less likely to use alcohol when the going gets tough . the fact that problems with abuse of this medication are more frequent among females has not helped to bring it to light . " unfortunately it has long been considered a women 's issue and has been neglected , " said karin mohn of the dhs . she said she hopes that a number of new measures , including increasing public awareness and improving early recognition and intervention methods , will help to reverse the trend . prevention is better than a cure johannes lindenmeyer , a psychologist who specializes in addiction , says it is quite clearly a case of prevention being better than a cure , but adds that both doctors and patients need to change their thinking in order for the problem to be addressed in a serious way . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : therapy offers prevention " people need psychotherapy instead of medication , but doctors do n't get paid much for just talking about problems and patients generally prefer to go home with a prescription in their hands , " he said .
" so the doctors give medication instead of analyzing their psychological needs and assessing how their patients could benefit from such things as behavioral therapy . " in the case of insomnia for example , lindenmeyer explains that sufferers have to learn how to get rid of the problem rather than chemically suppressing it , not least because such relief is only temporary . " unlike alcohol , people take addictive medicines because they have a complaint , " he said .
" they take it and it makes them feel better , but once that sensation has worn off , the original complaint comes back more acutely . " for example , the insomniac taking medication to induce sleep will build up a tolerance over time and have to increase the dosage over time to achieve the same effect .
a psychological dependency on the drug can easily take root . the route to dependency with some medications is incredibly fast , with users becoming addicted after just weeks of regular use .
once the addiction to medication has taken hold , it is much harder to break the cycle than with alcohol , according to lindenmeyer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drug addiction claims less victims than medication dependency " people find it harder to believe that they have an addiction problem , because they have been prescribed their medication by doctors , " he said . " by the same token , we do n't have any clinics which deal specifically with medication addiction , they are put together with other addicts and feel misunderstood .
all this means that the success rate of programs to break medication addiction is about ten percent lower than anti-alcoholism schemes . " stricter controls necessary ? if the estimates of 1.4 to 1.9 million addicts are accurate , and if it is so hard to cure them once they have fallen prey to legal pharmaceuticals , should there be tighter controls on what doctors can and do prescribe ?
müller-oerlinghausen does not think so .
he believes the path away from the addictive trend is to continue training doctors and informing the public about the dangers of tranquilizers . " over the past 10-20 years , german doctors have learnt how to use these substances in a restrictive way in order to prevent addiction , " he said .
" there are clear guidelines and the annual report on prescribed medicines proves that the number of tranquilizers being handed out by doctors gets smaller every year . " nonetheless , mohn of the dhs says there has not been much change in the estimated number of patients addicted to medication over the past few years and that the consumption of legal drugs remains a cause for concern . " some patients alternately pick up prescriptions from several different doctors , " she said . and with germany 's strict data protection laws , it is difficult to trace such strategy . " controlling patients 100 percent just is n't possible , " müller-oerlinghausen said . tamsin walker , dw-world .

" we have to see things as they really are .
our year has been anything other than good , " said the german ace who went into the chinese grand prix this weekend in an uncharacteristic third place in the drivers ' standings . schumacher spun out of the final race of the season leaving him in third and giving him no chance of catching kimi raikkonen who finished as runner up to fernando alonso in shanghai and the world championship . " we have never been competitive and never really been in a position to compete for the title , one that has been ours in recent times , " said schumacher . " i am still in third place in the drivers ' standings .
it has never been this bad . " ferrari won 15 of the 18 races last year but have only won once this time around , in the controversial six-car united states grand prix , and schumacher 's best ' real ' result has been a second place finish . as career nears end , speculation remains bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite a rough season , ferarri wants schumacher to keep driving while schumacher , 36 , is clearly heading towards the twilight of his career , he has at least two more seasons left in him , his agent willi webber told the german press this week .
but who the 84-race winner will be driving for when he finally calls it a day is up in the air . there has been talk of him possibly leaving ferrari and ending his career with the mclaren team , although this was quickly quashed by webber .
" let 's put an end to this rumor : i can categorically exclude -lrb- the possibility of -rrb- michael schumacher leaving ferrari for mclaren-mercedes , " he told the stuttgarter nachrichten . the rumor began because schumacher , who won the last five world championships before alonso dethroned him , had rejected a fresh contract from ferrari .
" first of all , michael is doing fine at ferrari and secondly , his image is much more in line with ferrari and their sport cars than mercedes and their luxury cars . " he added : " i ca n't say for definite but it 's likely that 2008 will be his final season .

" a podium at the end of the season would bewonderful but we have to realize that the chances of obtaining that are not too high , " he said before the race . " in any case , we will be trying our best to end the season in the best of ways . "
unfortunately , the race ended in the same way as his season : in disappointment . ferrari boss jean todt still has every faith in his star driver and believes that by the time the 2006 season gets underway his car , which will be launched early to accelerate the italian giant 's fight back , will be back to its best . " i can ’ t say that we can prepare more thoroughly , but we are attempting to reply to the problems that we ’ ve had this year , " he said . " even if next year 's car won ’ t be in its latest specification for the beginning of the season , considering the introduction of the new v8 , 2.4 liter engine , we have decided to introduce the car as early as possible which is why we will introduce it by mid-january 06 . " third place in constructors ' table tells own story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ferrari 's season is winding down ferrari also finished third in the constructors ' championship , behind renault and mclaren , todt expressed mixed feelings about the season that ended after 19 races on sunday .

" we have to see things as they really are .
our year has been anything other than good , " said the german ace who went into the chinese grand prix this weekend in an uncharacteristic third place in the drivers ' standings . schumacher spun out of the final race of the season leaving him in third and giving him no chance of catching kimi raikkonen who finished as runner up to fernando alonso in shanghai and the world championship . " we have never been competitive and never really been in a position to compete for the title , one that has been ours in recent times , " said schumacher . " i am still in third place in the drivers ' standings .
it has never been this bad . " ferrari won 15 of the 18 races last year but have only won once this time around , in the controversial six-car united states grand prix , and schumacher 's best ' real ' result has been a second place finish . as career nears end , speculation remains bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite a rough season , ferarri wants schumacher to keep driving while schumacher , 36 , is clearly heading towards the twilight of his career , he has at least two more seasons left in him , his agent willi webber told the german press this week .
but who the 84-race winner will be driving for when he finally calls it a day is up in the air . there has been talk of him possibly leaving ferrari and ending his career with the mclaren team , although this was quickly quashed by webber .
" let 's put an end to this rumor : i can categorically exclude -lrb- the possibility of -rrb- michael schumacher leaving ferrari for mclaren-mercedes , " he told the stuttgarter nachrichten . the rumor began because schumacher , who won the last five world championships before alonso dethroned him , had rejected a fresh contract from ferrari .
" first of all , michael is doing fine at ferrari and secondly , his image is much more in line with ferrari and their sport cars than mercedes and their luxury cars . " he added : " i ca n't say for definite but it 's likely that 2008 will be his final season . " current ferrari not up to the job bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a different car may help solve schumacher 's problems schumacher then has time to regain his crown , but he was not confident that he could produce his old magic in shanghai in the current ferrari car , a prediction that was proved tamely correct .
" a podium at the end of the season would bewonderful but we have to realize that the chances of obtaining that are not too high , " he said before the race . " in any case , we will be trying our best to end the season in the best of ways . "
unfortunately , the race ended in the same way as his season : in disappointment . ferrari boss jean todt still has every faith in his star driver and believes that by the time the 2006 season gets underway his car , which will be launched early to accelerate the italian giant 's fight back , will be back to its best . " i can ’ t say that we can prepare more thoroughly , but we are attempting to reply to the problems that we ’ ve had this year , " he said . " even if next year 's car won ’ t be in its latest specification for the beginning of the season , considering the introduction of the new v8 , 2.4 liter engine , we have decided to introduce the car as early as possible which is why we will introduce it by mid-january 06 . " third place in constructors ' table tells own story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ferrari 's season is winding down ferrari also finished third in the constructors ' championship , behind renault and mclaren , todt expressed mixed feelings about the season that ended after 19 races on sunday . " we know that formula one is a mechanical sport where to win a race or score a good result you need a good package : reliability , team , chassis , tyres and engine , " he said .
" so our third place in the constructors ’ championship is fairly significant . " having said that , two teams have been more competitive than ferrari-bridgestone so we knew that it ’ s something that could happen one day . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de who 's afraid of michael schumacher ?
the race for the formula 1 crown starts on sunday with the australian grand prix , and michael schumacher is expecting a difficult start .
that should offer fans a change of pace , but can anyone dethrone the german champ ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 16.10.2005 addicted to medication großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : time to turn over a new leaf that germany is home to high levels of alcoholism and tobacco addiction is a well-established , if unhappy fact .
what is less known is the fact that abuse of prescribed medication is also widespread . the german head office for dependency matters , the dhs , estimates that between 1.4 and 1.9 million people in germany are dependent on prescribed drugs , considerably more than the numbers of those addicted to cannabis , cocaine , heroin or other illegal substances .
in short , levels of addiction to legal medication are topped only by a dependency on alcohol and tobacco .
but while those addictions are often discussed in the media , there is relatively little public discussion about addiction to legal substances . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : addiction to medication , a women 's thing ?
the most abused medication are the benzodiazepines , such as valium , which are often used as tranquilizers and sleeping pills , primarily by women .
according to bruno müller-oerlinghausen , a doctor with the drug commission of the german medical association , that fact could be attributed to the physical changes which women undergo during the menopause , and to the reality that women are more prone to depression than men and less likely to use alcohol when the going gets tough . the fact that problems with abuse of this medication are more frequent among females has not helped to bring it to light . " unfortunately it has long been considered a women 's issue and has been neglected , " said karin mohn of the dhs . she said she hopes that a number of new measures , including increasing public awareness and improving early recognition and intervention methods , will help to reverse the trend . prevention is better than a cure johannes lindenmeyer , a psychologist who specializes in addiction , says it is quite clearly a case of prevention being better than a cure , but adds that both doctors and patients need to change their thinking in order for the problem to be addressed in a serious way . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : therapy offers prevention " people need psychotherapy instead of medication , but doctors do n't get paid much for just talking about problems and patients generally prefer to go home with a prescription in their hands , " he said .
" so the doctors give medication instead of analyzing their psychological needs and assessing how their patients could benefit from such things as behavioral therapy . " in the case of insomnia for example , lindenmeyer explains that sufferers have to learn how to get rid of the problem rather than chemically suppressing it , not least because such relief is only temporary . " unlike alcohol , people take addictive medicines because they have a complaint , " he said .
" they take it and it makes them feel better , but once that sensation has worn off , the original complaint comes back more acutely . " for example , the insomniac taking medication to induce sleep will build up a tolerance over time and have to increase the dosage over time to achieve the same effect .
a psychological dependency on the drug can easily take root . the route to dependency with some medications is incredibly fast , with users becoming addicted after just weeks of regular use .
once the addiction to medication has taken hold , it is much harder to break the cycle than with alcohol , according to lindenmeyer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drug addiction claims less victims than medication dependency " people find it harder to believe that they have an addiction problem , because they have been prescribed their medication by doctors , " he said . " by the same token , we do n't have any clinics which deal specifically with medication addiction , they are put together with other addicts and feel misunderstood .
all this means that the success rate of programs to break medication addiction is about ten percent lower than anti-alcoholism schemes . " stricter controls necessary ? if the estimates of 1.4 to 1.9 million addicts are accurate , and if it is so hard to cure them once they have fallen prey to legal pharmaceuticals , should there be tighter controls on what doctors can and do prescribe ?
müller-oerlinghausen does not think so .
he believes the path away from the addictive trend is to continue training doctors and informing the public about the dangers of tranquilizers . " over the past 10-20 years , german doctors have learnt how to use these substances in a restrictive way in order to prevent addiction , " he said .
" there are clear guidelines and the annual report on prescribed medicines proves that the number of tranquilizers being handed out by doctors gets smaller every year . " nonetheless , mohn of the dhs says there has not been much change in the estimated number of patients addicted to medication over the past few years and that the consumption of legal drugs remains a cause for concern . " some patients alternately pick up prescriptions from several different doctors , " she said . and with germany 's strict data protection laws , it is difficult to trace such strategy . " controlling patients 100 percent just is n't possible , " müller-oerlinghausen said . tamsin walker , dw-world .

however , the sad fact is this happens .
hospices help sick children through their last days and make them bearable for patient and family alike . norbert neubauer 's son niklaus suffers from a rare genetic disorder called " mucopolysaccharidosis " or mps .
usually , this condition results in various genetic deformities such as skeletal deformities , mental retardation , and decreased life expectancy .

according to federal statistics , there are estimated to be some 22,000 children in germany that are in need of hospice care . given this limited capacity the demand for new services and trained staff is enormous . lots of living to do the sad reality about children stricken with debilitating and life-shortening illness is that as other children become more and more independent , they become more dependent .

fearing bird flu , germans stockpile meds europe -pipe- 16.10.2005 eu leaders to hold bird flu crisis talks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drastic culling continues as europe fights the threat of contagion the growing threat of lethal bird flu spreading across europe will top the agendas of eu leaders this week , after the deadly asian strain of the virus landed on the continent for the first time . scientists and the european union 's political chiefs are trying to ease public concern after the h5n1 virus was confirmed in romania at the weekend , only two days after its presence was identified in turkey . eu foreign ministers will discuss the outbreak at emergency talks in luxembourg on tuesday , while the bird flu scare will dominate the agenda of a meeting of health ministers later in the week . on wednesday , health commissioner markos kyprianou will present a pandemic simulation exercise aimed at testing the preparedness of the bloc 's 25 members for such an outbreak .
the scenario will be played out by year 's end . the world health organization immediately voiced concern at the romanian outbreak and admitted that the risk of bird-to-human transfer had increased .
" the presence of this virus in romania worries us , because it proves that it is in the birds ' environment , and that increases the possibility of transmission to humans , " said a spokesman in geneva . but it has kept its pandemic alert at phase three - the middle of its scale - as " a virus new to humans is causing infections , but does not spread easily from one person to another .

while avian influenza primarily affects birds , the h5n1 strain has killed more than 60 people in southeast asia since 2003 - around half those who have contracted it .
the big fear is that h5n1 may mutate , acquiring genes from the human flu virus that would make it highly infectious as well as lethal - possibly killing millions worldwide as the influenza pandemic of 1918 did . citing such precedents , britain 's chief medical officer said on sunday that bird flu would inevitably combine with a human variety and cause a pandemic that would kill around 50,000 people in his country alone . " the significance of it is n't that there will be a pandemic of bird flu itself , the significance of it is that at some point , and we go by the lessons of history , the bird flu virus will combine with a human flu virus and then it will become easily transmissible , " liam donaldson told bbc television .
he noted that common winter flu kills more than 12,000 britons each year . massive research activity offers hope countries from germany to vietnam to the united states are busy looking for a remedy .
hungary expects to know within two weeks whether human trials of its vaccine have been successful . the european commission , meanwhile , has urged member states to stockpile anti-viral drugs , and says people at risk should ensure they are vaccinated against regular flu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the race is on to prevent a european outbreak of bird flu eu veterinary experts have also demanded immediate action to prevent migratory birds which could carry the virus from coming into contact with poultry , including moving farmed birds indoors . public told not to panic while they are keen not to spark panic , official calls for calm have not prevented a rush for anti-viral drugs and stocks in some countries are reported to be running short . fueling further concern , a study released friday said researchers had identified a mutated form of h5n1 bird flu that is resistant to tamiflu , the drug being stockpiled around the world to counter a feared pandemic . european commission head jose manuel barroso said at the weekend that the eu was ready to take " more drastic and radical measures " if necessary , depending on how the situation evolves . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deadly bird flu strain confirmed in europe hopes that the deadly h5n1 strain of avian flu had not yet reached mainland europe were dashed saturday after samples from romanian ducks proved positive .

the conference presented the former junior coalition partner with the opportunity to look back over the last seven years of power-sharing in the government while planning ahead for a future back in opposition . however , a more productive use of the meeting would have been for the party to take a long , hard look at where the green dream went wrong , not only at the last election but in german , and european , politics in general over the past half a decade . at the turn of the century , the greens were not only part of a serving government in germany but in four other european countries .
france , italy , finland and belgium all had parties pushing environmental issues closer to the forefront of policy-making through their green representatives . the news this week that germany would be governed by a grand coalition of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- saw that era finally come to a close as germany 's greens succumbed to the fate that others had suffered as the sunflower started to wilt across europe . the retreat of germany 's greens ends an era bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the greens are left looking for someone to replace fischer the return of the greens to opposition in germany , and the self-imposed exile to the back benches of the party 's most high profile minister joschka fischer , left western european governments without a green representative . having been ejected from government in finland , france , italy , belgium and now germany , the green movement could not be blamed for being disheartened at the apparent failure of an environmental revolution in the corridors of european power . " these are setbacks , clearly , in every case .
greens are not now shaping policy , " said hubert kleinert , once a german green mp now a political scientist , in an interview with the bbc .
" during the last five years there have been more defeats than victories .
and i think this -lrb- german result -rrb- is the biggest one . "
the greens were overtaken by the liberal free democrats and the new left , even though their share of the vote fell only about 0.5 percent . former euro green chief says no need to panic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european parliamentarian juan behrend co-secretary general of the greens juan behrend , the former secretary general of the green federation in the european parliament who once saw the rise of the greens as " a luminous sunflower was hanging in the grey sky , " refused to be downcast by the german result . he admitted that the election result had been a " blow " but was adamant that the policies behind the greens would survive .
coming back to opposition would be " an opportunity " adding that the greens were specialists at making opposition politics and would be able to " articulate a very coherent green policy . " all is far from lost .
there may be shoots of re-growth for the green movement in other areas of europe .
the greens play a role in romano prodi 's left-wing alliance in italy , a partnership which looks set to challenge hard in the elections next year , while in france the greens are expected to be part of the left-wing bloc competing in the 2007 campaign . solid policies , awareness the green lagacy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even without the greens in power , renewable energy research will continue however , the fact remains that there is no current green representation in the big western europe governments and as a result there will be no green ministers at cabinet tables or eu ministerial meetings .
who will be the force of environmental change without the greens in power ?
will all that the movement , specifically in germany , achieved be undone ? political analysts believe that it is unlikely that the shutting down of nuclear energy plants and the huge increase in the use of renewable energy in germany will be reversed without the green party , who instigated these policies , in power . on the one hand , these ideas are now entrenched in the political mainstream and on the other , the european electorate realizes the importance of environmental protection , and they will not allow any political party to neglect that in its policy making . the green party 's sunflower may have wilted but there seems to be enough of a reservoir of belief and support around to keep it alive .

fearing bird flu , germans stockpile meds europe -pipe- 16.10.2005 eu leaders to hold bird flu crisis talks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drastic culling continues as europe fights the threat of contagion the growing threat of lethal bird flu spreading across europe will top the agendas of eu leaders this week , after the deadly asian strain of the virus landed on the continent for the first time . scientists and the european union 's political chiefs are trying to ease public concern after the h5n1 virus was confirmed in romania at the weekend , only two days after its presence was identified in turkey . eu foreign ministers will discuss the outbreak at emergency talks in luxembourg on tuesday , while the bird flu scare will dominate the agenda of a meeting of health ministers later in the week . on wednesday , health commissioner markos kyprianou will present a pandemic simulation exercise aimed at testing the preparedness of the bloc 's 25 members for such an outbreak .
the scenario will be played out by year 's end . the world health organization immediately voiced concern at the romanian outbreak and admitted that the risk of bird-to-human transfer had increased .
" the presence of this virus in romania worries us , because it proves that it is in the birds ' environment , and that increases the possibility of transmission to humans , " said a spokesman in geneva . but it has kept its pandemic alert at phase three - the middle of its scale - as " a virus new to humans is causing infections , but does not spread easily from one person to another .

it was thought to have arrived via migratory birds from further east . but on saturday the scientists confirmed fears that the highly pathogenic asian strain had been found in three ducks found dead in the danube delta , on romania 's black sea coast . " the virus taken from -lrb- the village of -rrb- ceamurlia de jos is indeed the h5n1 , " romanian farm minister gheorghe flutur said .
" we are discussing what measures are needed to strengthen the protection zone around the source .

while avian influenza primarily affects birds , the h5n1 strain has killed more than 60 people in southeast asia since 2003 - around half those who have contracted it .
the big fear is that h5n1 may mutate , acquiring genes from the human flu virus that would make it highly infectious as well as lethal - possibly killing millions worldwide as the influenza pandemic of 1918 did . citing such precedents , britain 's chief medical officer said on sunday that bird flu would inevitably combine with a human variety and cause a pandemic that would kill around 50,000 people in his country alone .

he noted that common winter flu kills more than 12,000 britons each year . massive research activity offers hope countries from germany to vietnam to the united states are busy looking for a remedy .
hungary expects to know within two weeks whether human trials of its vaccine have been successful . the european commission , meanwhile , has urged member states to stockpile anti-viral drugs , and says people at risk should ensure they are vaccinated against regular flu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the race is on to prevent a european outbreak of bird flu eu veterinary experts have also demanded immediate action to prevent migratory birds which could carry the virus from coming into contact with poultry , including moving farmed birds indoors . public told not to panic while they are keen not to spark panic , official calls for calm have not prevented a rush for anti-viral drugs and stocks in some countries are reported to be running short . fueling further concern , a study released friday said researchers had identified a mutated form of h5n1 bird flu that is resistant to tamiflu , the drug being stockpiled around the world to counter a feared pandemic . european commission head jose manuel barroso said at the weekend that the eu was ready to take " more drastic and radical measures " if necessary , depending on how the situation evolves . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deadly bird flu strain confirmed in europe hopes that the deadly h5n1 strain of avian flu had not yet reached mainland europe were dashed saturday after samples from romanian ducks proved positive .

fearing bird flu , germans stockpile meds europe -pipe- 16.10.2005 eu leaders to hold bird flu crisis talks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drastic culling continues as europe fights the threat of contagion the growing threat of lethal bird flu spreading across europe will top the agendas of eu leaders this week , after the deadly asian strain of the virus landed on the continent for the first time . scientists and the european union 's political chiefs are trying to ease public concern after the h5n1 virus was confirmed in romania at the weekend , only two days after its presence was identified in turkey . eu foreign ministers will discuss the outbreak at emergency talks in luxembourg on tuesday , while the bird flu scare will dominate the agenda of a meeting of health ministers later in the week . on wednesday , health commissioner markos kyprianou will present a pandemic simulation exercise aimed at testing the preparedness of the bloc 's 25 members for such an outbreak .
the scenario will be played out by year 's end . the world health organization immediately voiced concern at the romanian outbreak and admitted that the risk of bird-to-human transfer had increased .
" the presence of this virus in romania worries us , because it proves that it is in the birds ' environment , and that increases the possibility of transmission to humans , " said a spokesman in geneva . but it has kept its pandemic alert at phase three - the middle of its scale - as " a virus new to humans is causing infections , but does not spread easily from one person to another . " virus on the doorstep bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poultry are being destroyed or quarantined the eu banned imports of birds and poultry products from romania and turkey last week after the presence of bird flu was confirmed .
it was thought to have arrived via migratory birds from further east . but on saturday the scientists confirmed fears that the highly pathogenic asian strain had been found in three ducks found dead in the danube delta , on romania 's black sea coast . " the virus taken from -lrb- the village of -rrb- ceamurlia de jos is indeed the h5n1 , " romanian farm minister gheorghe flutur said .
" we are discussing what measures are needed to strengthen the protection zone around the source . " some good news surfaced on sunday , when he announced that a number of swans which had died in the delta did not have the virus , and turkish officials ruled out a second possible case there . killer h5n1 strain heads to europe from asia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bird influenza virus strain h5n1 , seen in gold .
while avian influenza primarily affects birds , the h5n1 strain has killed more than 60 people in southeast asia since 2003 - around half those who have contracted it .
the big fear is that h5n1 may mutate , acquiring genes from the human flu virus that would make it highly infectious as well as lethal - possibly killing millions worldwide as the influenza pandemic of 1918 did . citing such precedents , britain 's chief medical officer said on sunday that bird flu would inevitably combine with a human variety and cause a pandemic that would kill around 50,000 people in his country alone . " the significance of it is n't that there will be a pandemic of bird flu itself , the significance of it is that at some point , and we go by the lessons of history , the bird flu virus will combine with a human flu virus and then it will become easily transmissible , " liam donaldson told bbc television .
he noted that common winter flu kills more than 12,000 britons each year . massive research activity offers hope countries from germany to vietnam to the united states are busy looking for a remedy .
hungary expects to know within two weeks whether human trials of its vaccine have been successful . the european commission , meanwhile , has urged member states to stockpile anti-viral drugs , and says people at risk should ensure they are vaccinated against regular flu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the race is on to prevent a european outbreak of bird flu eu veterinary experts have also demanded immediate action to prevent migratory birds which could carry the virus from coming into contact with poultry , including moving farmed birds indoors . public told not to panic while they are keen not to spark panic , official calls for calm have not prevented a rush for anti-viral drugs and stocks in some countries are reported to be running short . fueling further concern , a study released friday said researchers had identified a mutated form of h5n1 bird flu that is resistant to tamiflu , the drug being stockpiled around the world to counter a feared pandemic . european commission head jose manuel barroso said at the weekend that the eu was ready to take " more drastic and radical measures " if necessary , depending on how the situation evolves . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deadly bird flu strain confirmed in europe hopes that the deadly h5n1 strain of avian flu had not yet reached mainland europe were dashed saturday after samples from romanian ducks proved positive .

" i am thinking about the development of the national team twenty four seven whether i am in germany , the united states or somewhere else , " added klinsmann . klinsmann , 41 , has made a habit of jetting back to his california home after international matches but rubbished claims he was not making time to see bundesliga officials .

the league 's nightmare did n't come true , however .
hamburg defeated their rivals on the seventh match day and after nine games , there is a new leader - werder bremen . the champions from 2003-04 thrashed nuremberg 6-2 and thanks to a munich draw at schalke , and hamburg 's loss to wolfsburg , bremen found themselves at the top of the bundesliga standings ahead of bayern based on a better goal difference .

the three goals put klose at the top of the league 's goalscorers with ten strikes .
klose 's potent partner , croatian international ivan klasnic , found the net two times and midfielder tim borowski scored the sixth goal for the bundesliga 's most powerful offense with 27 goals . emotional draw for schalke bayern munich had been hoping for their first victory in six tries at the arena aufschalke .
the champions ' dream was being fulfilled for 93 minutes .
roque santa cruz put the bavarians on top in the 19th minute thanks to a very questionable no-call by referee michael weiner . bayern then did everything possible in the second-half to let schalke back into the game .
they still almost came away with three points - until the 93rd minute .

nevertheless , munich broke a five-game losing streak at schalke .
larsen 's late heroics helped schalke to remain the only bundesliga club without a loss this season , but are still five points behind the leaders . frustrated hamburg lose for first time dutch international rafael van der vaart has been the focal point of hamburg 's rise to second-place in the bundesliga after eight weeks .

in kaiserslautern , halil altintop and ebi smolarek both scored a hat trick as the hosts came from a two-goal deficit to draw with dortmund .
the supporters of the red devils vented their frustration with their team 's poor league start by remaining outside the stadium the first five minutes of the match and could only be happy that turkish striker altintop , like klose with ten goals to his credit , found the net as successfully as he did for his national squad against germany last weekend . bayer leverkusen hired a new coach this week , michael skibbe .
the move , frequently one that management hopes will shake a squad out of complacency , did n't work .

marcio borges and heiko westermann celebrated their first goals in the bundesliga in a game that berlin coach falko götz said was lost in the first 45 minutes . mönchengladbach had surprisingly zoomed up to sixth-place after a shaky season start .
for 89 minutes , coach horst köppel 's team was poised to improve their position even more but a late own-goal by jeff strasser gave them only a draw at stuttgart .

the three goals put klose at the top of the league 's goalscorers with ten strikes .

it charts the efforts of a hapless group of ruddy-cheeked swains to find a wife , and farmers ' associations say it 's offensive . perhaps taking a cue from paris hilton 's hugely successful " the simple life " now airing on german television , producers have woken up to the dramatic potential of life on the farm . " farmer seeks wife , " the latest reality show to grace the nation 's screens , follows the romantic shenanigans of seven single farmers desperately seeking love . patronizing but farmers ' associations are outraged and have called the show " demeaning " and " misleading . " their first objection is what they describe as the show 's inaccurate portrayal of rustic rough and tumble . " i 'm not saying that 's not what it 's like , " michael lohse from the farmers ' association told spiegel online .
but generally , he insisted , most farmyards look pretty different to rtl 's vision of fields of golden wheat , romantic moonlight horse-and-cart rides , village fairs and strapping young hillbillies . poetic licence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the seven likely lads the show also claims that 70 percent of farmers are single .
not true , insists lohse .
" according to our statistics , the figure is more like 30 percent , which is perfectly normal . " the protagonists are hardly a cross-section of germany 's farmers , either .
from the dashing organic farmer karl to shy stephan the pig farmer and herbert the hobby astrologist , the candidates allegedly make farmers look less like capable professionals and more like village idiots .
one of them asks his mother to choose his bride-to-be for him , while another proudly reveals he has n't left his farmyard in 28 years . " these are extreme cases , " said lohse .
" they do n't reflect reality . " viewers obviously do n't mind the fanciful take on rural life .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 16.10.2005 addicted to medication großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : time to turn over a new leaf that germany is home to high levels of alcoholism and tobacco addiction is a well-established , if unhappy fact .
what is less known is the fact that abuse of prescribed medication is also widespread . the german head office for dependency matters , the dhs , estimates that between 1.4 and 1.9 million people in germany are dependent on prescribed drugs , considerably more than the numbers of those addicted to cannabis , cocaine , heroin or other illegal substances .
in short , levels of addiction to legal medication are topped only by a dependency on alcohol and tobacco .
but while those addictions are often discussed in the media , there is relatively little public discussion about addiction to legal substances . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : addiction to medication , a women 's thing ?
the most abused medication are the benzodiazepines , such as valium , which are often used as tranquilizers and sleeping pills , primarily by women .
according to bruno müller-oerlinghausen , a doctor with the drug commission of the german medical association , that fact could be attributed to the physical changes which women undergo during the menopause , and to the reality that women are more prone to depression than men and less likely to use alcohol when the going gets tough . the fact that problems with abuse of this medication are more frequent among females has not helped to bring it to light . " unfortunately it has long been considered a women 's issue and has been neglected , " said karin mohn of the dhs . she said she hopes that a number of new measures , including increasing public awareness and improving early recognition and intervention methods , will help to reverse the trend . prevention is better than a cure johannes lindenmeyer , a psychologist who specializes in addiction , says it is quite clearly a case of prevention being better than a cure , but adds that both doctors and patients need to change their thinking in order for the problem to be addressed in a serious way . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : therapy offers prevention " people need psychotherapy instead of medication , but doctors do n't get paid much for just talking about problems and patients generally prefer to go home with a prescription in their hands , " he said .
" so the doctors give medication instead of analyzing their psychological needs and assessing how their patients could benefit from such things as behavioral therapy . " in the case of insomnia for example , lindenmeyer explains that sufferers have to learn how to get rid of the problem rather than chemically suppressing it , not least because such relief is only temporary . " unlike alcohol , people take addictive medicines because they have a complaint , " he said .
" they take it and it makes them feel better , but once that sensation has worn off , the original complaint comes back more acutely . " for example , the insomniac taking medication to induce sleep will build up a tolerance over time and have to increase the dosage over time to achieve the same effect .
a psychological dependency on the drug can easily take root . the route to dependency with some medications is incredibly fast , with users becoming addicted after just weeks of regular use .
once the addiction to medication has taken hold , it is much harder to break the cycle than with alcohol , according to lindenmeyer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drug addiction claims less victims than medication dependency " people find it harder to believe that they have an addiction problem , because they have been prescribed their medication by doctors , " he said . " by the same token , we do n't have any clinics which deal specifically with medication addiction , they are put together with other addicts and feel misunderstood .
all this means that the success rate of programs to break medication addiction is about ten percent lower than anti-alcoholism schemes . " stricter controls necessary ? if the estimates of 1.4 to 1.9 million addicts are accurate , and if it is so hard to cure them once they have fallen prey to legal pharmaceuticals , should there be tighter controls on what doctors can and do prescribe ?
müller-oerlinghausen does not think so .
he believes the path away from the addictive trend is to continue training doctors and informing the public about the dangers of tranquilizers . " over the past 10-20 years , german doctors have learnt how to use these substances in a restrictive way in order to prevent addiction , " he said .
" there are clear guidelines and the annual report on prescribed medicines proves that the number of tranquilizers being handed out by doctors gets smaller every year . " nonetheless , mohn of the dhs says there has not been much change in the estimated number of patients addicted to medication over the past few years and that the consumption of legal drugs remains a cause for concern . " some patients alternately pick up prescriptions from several different doctors , " she said . and with germany 's strict data protection laws , it is difficult to trace such strategy . " controlling patients 100 percent just is n't possible , " müller-oerlinghausen said . tamsin walker , dw-world .

when norbert 's son was diagnosed 8 years ago , he says , " at that time there was just nowhere to turn , we were in this situation and we felt completely alone . when we did finally did find out about child hospice care … we really had to struggle to get accepted . " the neubauer 's dilemma is unfortunately typical of an already painful and distressing situation .
in germany every year approximately 3,000 parents are given a diagnosis confirming that their child will soon die or have a dramatically shortened life span . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sonnenhoff children 's hospice in berlin such was the reasoning behind a conference that took place in cologne on october 14-15 . the event , called the erste deutsche kinderhospiztage , or " first german child hospice days " was a gathering of child hospice workers , managers and lobbyists that are collectively trying to erase the taboo surrounding death and children and create new services for german families . a unique challenge children living with terminal illnesses provide a unique and particularly difficult challenge for families and healthcare providers .
children are not " little adults " .
and solutions for children living in the shadow of death can not be simply extrapolated from adult hospice programs .
end-of-life care for children must not only manage the physical symptoms of the child , but address social and psychological demands of the whole family . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sleeping room at the " rainbowland " childrens hospice in düsseldorf margret hartkopf , is a board member of the child hospice association of germany , and herself a mother of a terminally ill child . " it 's such a difficult situation , the parents feel guilty that they ca n't heal their child , and the physical and emotional burden of constantly attending to a sick child can be overwhelming for the entire family . " according to hartkopf , hospice care is , " meant to be flexible , the services are there to help the families , provide medical care , counselling and also educate others .
for instance , grandparents , social workers - even teachers have contacted us saying , ' a child in my class has died and i feel helpless … what do i do ? " ' need for inpatient and outpatient services germany currently maintains five stationary child hospice clinics compared to 26 in england , three in canada and one in the united states . the german child hospice movement was launched in 1990 by a group of parents living in the sauerland region .
the first children 's hospice clinic in germany was opened in 1998 in the town of ople .
" at first we had to overcome the enormous stereotype the hospices were ' death houses ' , or that hospices were related only to cancer , " explains dr. franco rest , director of the dietrich-oppenberg hospice academy in essen . bildunterschrift : rainbowland children 's hospice in düsseldorf children 's hospice 's are meant to be small , with a capacity of about 8 children ; more like staying with family and friends rather than a hospital .
according to federal statistics , there are estimated to be some 22,000 children in germany that are in need of hospice care . given this limited capacity the demand for new services and trained staff is enormous . lots of living to do the sad reality about children stricken with debilitating and life-shortening illness is that as other children become more and more independent , they become more dependent .
within this grim calculus the parents are the ones the children turn to . as germany rushes to create more inpatient and outpatient hospice services for children and families , and also grapple with the complex emotions at the core of the issue , it 's extremely important to remember that the point of this care is to help the child live life not prepare for death . " they want to be taken seriously , " explains hartkopf .
" they ask questions and they expect answers . they want friends , they want to laugh and they want to take part in public life .

" we have to see things as they really are .
our year has been anything other than good , " said the german ace who went into the chinese grand prix this weekend in an uncharacteristic third place in the drivers ' standings . schumacher spun out of the final race of the season leaving him in third and giving him no chance of catching kimi raikkonen who finished as runner up to fernando alonso in shanghai and the world championship . " we have never been competitive and never really been in a position to compete for the title , one that has been ours in recent times , " said schumacher . " i am still in third place in the drivers ' standings .
it has never been this bad .

but who the 84-race winner will be driving for when he finally calls it a day is up in the air . there has been talk of him possibly leaving ferrari and ending his career with the mclaren team , although this was quickly quashed by webber .
" let 's put an end to this rumor : i can categorically exclude -lrb- the possibility of -rrb- michael schumacher leaving ferrari for mclaren-mercedes , " he told the stuttgarter nachrichten . the rumor began because schumacher , who won the last five world championships before alonso dethroned him , had rejected a fresh contract from ferrari .
" first of all , michael is doing fine at ferrari and secondly , his image is much more in line with ferrari and their sport cars than mercedes and their luxury cars .

" i can ’ t say that we can prepare more thoroughly , but we are attempting to reply to the problems that we ’ ve had this year , " he said . " even if next year 's car won ’ t be in its latest specification for the beginning of the season , considering the introduction of the new v8 , 2.4 liter engine , we have decided to introduce the car as early as possible which is why we will introduce it by mid-january 06 . " third place in constructors ' table tells own story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ferrari 's season is winding down ferrari also finished third in the constructors ' championship , behind renault and mclaren , todt expressed mixed feelings about the season that ended after 19 races on sunday .

" we have to see things as they really are .
our year has been anything other than good , " said the german ace who went into the chinese grand prix this weekend in an uncharacteristic third place in the drivers ' standings . schumacher spun out of the final race of the season leaving him in third and giving him no chance of catching kimi raikkonen who finished as runner up to fernando alonso in shanghai and the world championship . " we have never been competitive and never really been in a position to compete for the title , one that has been ours in recent times , " said schumacher . " i am still in third place in the drivers ' standings .
it has never been this bad . " ferrari won 15 of the 18 races last year but have only won once this time around , in the controversial six-car united states grand prix , and schumacher 's best ' real ' result has been a second place finish . as career nears end , speculation remains bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite a rough season , ferarri wants schumacher to keep driving while schumacher , 36 , is clearly heading towards the twilight of his career , he has at least two more seasons left in him , his agent willi webber told the german press this week .
but who the 84-race winner will be driving for when he finally calls it a day is up in the air . there has been talk of him possibly leaving ferrari and ending his career with the mclaren team , although this was quickly quashed by webber .
" let 's put an end to this rumor : i can categorically exclude -lrb- the possibility of -rrb- michael schumacher leaving ferrari for mclaren-mercedes , " he told the stuttgarter nachrichten . the rumor began because schumacher , who won the last five world championships before alonso dethroned him , had rejected a fresh contract from ferrari .
" first of all , michael is doing fine at ferrari and secondly , his image is much more in line with ferrari and their sport cars than mercedes and their luxury cars . " he added : " i ca n't say for definite but it 's likely that 2008 will be his final season .

" a podium at the end of the season would bewonderful but we have to realize that the chances of obtaining that are not too high , " he said before the race . " in any case , we will be trying our best to end the season in the best of ways . "
unfortunately , the race ended in the same way as his season : in disappointment . ferrari boss jean todt still has every faith in his star driver and believes that by the time the 2006 season gets underway his car , which will be launched early to accelerate the italian giant 's fight back , will be back to its best . " i can ’ t say that we can prepare more thoroughly , but we are attempting to reply to the problems that we ’ ve had this year , " he said . " even if next year 's car won ’ t be in its latest specification for the beginning of the season , considering the introduction of the new v8 , 2.4 liter engine , we have decided to introduce the car as early as possible which is why we will introduce it by mid-january 06 . " third place in constructors ' table tells own story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ferrari 's season is winding down ferrari also finished third in the constructors ' championship , behind renault and mclaren , todt expressed mixed feelings about the season that ended after 19 races on sunday . " we know that formula one is a mechanical sport where to win a race or score a good result you need a good package : reliability , team , chassis , tyres and engine , " he said .

however , the sad fact is this happens .
hospices help sick children through their last days and make them bearable for patient and family alike . norbert neubauer 's son niklaus suffers from a rare genetic disorder called " mucopolysaccharidosis " or mps .
usually , this condition results in various genetic deformities such as skeletal deformities , mental retardation , and decreased life expectancy .

within this grim calculus the parents are the ones the children turn to . as germany rushes to create more inpatient and outpatient hospice services for children and families , and also grapple with the complex emotions at the core of the issue , it 's extremely important to remember that the point of this care is to help the child live life not prepare for death . " they want to be taken seriously , " explains hartkopf .
" they ask questions and they expect answers . they want friends , they want to laugh and they want to take part in public life .

the scenario will be played out by year 's end . the world health organization immediately voiced concern at the romanian outbreak and admitted that the risk of bird-to-human transfer had increased .
" the presence of this virus in romania worries us , because it proves that it is in the birds ' environment , and that increases the possibility of transmission to humans , " said a spokesman in geneva . but it has kept its pandemic alert at phase three - the middle of its scale - as " a virus new to humans is causing infections , but does not spread easily from one person to another .

the big fear is that h5n1 may mutate , acquiring genes from the human flu virus that would make it highly infectious as well as lethal - possibly killing millions worldwide as the influenza pandemic of 1918 did . citing such precedents , britain 's chief medical officer said on sunday that bird flu would inevitably combine with a human variety and cause a pandemic that would kill around 50,000 people in his country alone . " the significance of it is n't that there will be a pandemic of bird flu itself , the significance of it is that at some point , and we go by the lessons of history , the bird flu virus will combine with a human flu virus and then it will become easily transmissible , " liam donaldson told bbc television .

" we have to see things as they really are .
our year has been anything other than good , " said the german ace who went into the chinese grand prix this weekend in an uncharacteristic third place in the drivers ' standings . schumacher spun out of the final race of the season leaving him in third and giving him no chance of catching kimi raikkonen who finished as runner up to fernando alonso in shanghai and the world championship . " we have never been competitive and never really been in a position to compete for the title , one that has been ours in recent times , " said schumacher . " i am still in third place in the drivers ' standings .
it has never been this bad . " ferrari won 15 of the 18 races last year but have only won once this time around , in the controversial six-car united states grand prix , and schumacher 's best ' real ' result has been a second place finish . as career nears end , speculation remains bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite a rough season , ferarri wants schumacher to keep driving while schumacher , 36 , is clearly heading towards the twilight of his career , he has at least two more seasons left in him , his agent willi webber told the german press this week .
but who the 84-race winner will be driving for when he finally calls it a day is up in the air . there has been talk of him possibly leaving ferrari and ending his career with the mclaren team , although this was quickly quashed by webber .
" let 's put an end to this rumor : i can categorically exclude -lrb- the possibility of -rrb- michael schumacher leaving ferrari for mclaren-mercedes , " he told the stuttgarter nachrichten . the rumor began because schumacher , who won the last five world championships before alonso dethroned him , had rejected a fresh contract from ferrari .
" first of all , michael is doing fine at ferrari and secondly , his image is much more in line with ferrari and their sport cars than mercedes and their luxury cars . " he added : " i ca n't say for definite but it 's likely that 2008 will be his final season . " current ferrari not up to the job bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a different car may help solve schumacher 's problems schumacher then has time to regain his crown , but he was not confident that he could produce his old magic in shanghai in the current ferrari car , a prediction that was proved tamely correct .
" a podium at the end of the season would bewonderful but we have to realize that the chances of obtaining that are not too high , " he said before the race . " in any case , we will be trying our best to end the season in the best of ways . "
unfortunately , the race ended in the same way as his season : in disappointment . ferrari boss jean todt still has every faith in his star driver and believes that by the time the 2006 season gets underway his car , which will be launched early to accelerate the italian giant 's fight back , will be back to its best . " i can ’ t say that we can prepare more thoroughly , but we are attempting to reply to the problems that we ’ ve had this year , " he said . " even if next year 's car won ’ t be in its latest specification for the beginning of the season , considering the introduction of the new v8 , 2.4 liter engine , we have decided to introduce the car as early as possible which is why we will introduce it by mid-january 06 . " third place in constructors ' table tells own story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ferrari 's season is winding down ferrari also finished third in the constructors ' championship , behind renault and mclaren , todt expressed mixed feelings about the season that ended after 19 races on sunday . " we know that formula one is a mechanical sport where to win a race or score a good result you need a good package : reliability , team , chassis , tyres and engine , " he said .
" so our third place in the constructors ’ championship is fairly significant . " having said that , two teams have been more competitive than ferrari-bridgestone so we knew that it ’ s something that could happen one day . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de who 's afraid of michael schumacher ?
the race for the formula 1 crown starts on sunday with the australian grand prix , and michael schumacher is expecting a difficult start .
that should offer fans a change of pace , but can anyone dethrone the german champ ?

what is less known is the fact that abuse of prescribed medication is also widespread . the german head office for dependency matters , the dhs , estimates that between 1.4 and 1.9 million people in germany are dependent on prescribed drugs , considerably more than the numbers of those addicted to cannabis , cocaine , heroin or other illegal substances .
in short , levels of addiction to legal medication are topped only by a dependency on alcohol and tobacco .
but while those addictions are often discussed in the media , there is relatively little public discussion about addiction to legal substances . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : addiction to medication , a women 's thing ?
the most abused medication are the benzodiazepines , such as valium , which are often used as tranquilizers and sleeping pills , primarily by women .
according to bruno müller-oerlinghausen , a doctor with the drug commission of the german medical association , that fact could be attributed to the physical changes which women undergo during the menopause , and to the reality that women are more prone to depression than men and less likely to use alcohol when the going gets tough . the fact that problems with abuse of this medication are more frequent among females has not helped to bring it to light . " unfortunately it has long been considered a women 's issue and has been neglected , " said karin mohn of the dhs . she said she hopes that a number of new measures , including increasing public awareness and improving early recognition and intervention methods , will help to reverse the trend . prevention is better than a cure johannes lindenmeyer , a psychologist who specializes in addiction , says it is quite clearly a case of prevention being better than a cure , but adds that both doctors and patients need to change their thinking in order for the problem to be addressed in a serious way . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : therapy offers prevention " people need psychotherapy instead of medication , but doctors do n't get paid much for just talking about problems and patients generally prefer to go home with a prescription in their hands , " he said .
" so the doctors give medication instead of analyzing their psychological needs and assessing how their patients could benefit from such things as behavioral therapy . " in the case of insomnia for example , lindenmeyer explains that sufferers have to learn how to get rid of the problem rather than chemically suppressing it , not least because such relief is only temporary . " unlike alcohol , people take addictive medicines because they have a complaint , " he said .
" they take it and it makes them feel better , but once that sensation has worn off , the original complaint comes back more acutely . " for example , the insomniac taking medication to induce sleep will build up a tolerance over time and have to increase the dosage over time to achieve the same effect .
a psychological dependency on the drug can easily take root . the route to dependency with some medications is incredibly fast , with users becoming addicted after just weeks of regular use .
once the addiction to medication has taken hold , it is much harder to break the cycle than with alcohol , according to lindenmeyer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drug addiction claims less victims than medication dependency " people find it harder to believe that they have an addiction problem , because they have been prescribed their medication by doctors , " he said . " by the same token , we do n't have any clinics which deal specifically with medication addiction , they are put together with other addicts and feel misunderstood .
all this means that the success rate of programs to break medication addiction is about ten percent lower than anti-alcoholism schemes . " stricter controls necessary ? if the estimates of 1.4 to 1.9 million addicts are accurate , and if it is so hard to cure them once they have fallen prey to legal pharmaceuticals , should there be tighter controls on what doctors can and do prescribe ?
müller-oerlinghausen does not think so .
he believes the path away from the addictive trend is to continue training doctors and informing the public about the dangers of tranquilizers . " over the past 10-20 years , german doctors have learnt how to use these substances in a restrictive way in order to prevent addiction , " he said .
" there are clear guidelines and the annual report on prescribed medicines proves that the number of tranquilizers being handed out by doctors gets smaller every year . " nonetheless , mohn of the dhs says there has not been much change in the estimated number of patients addicted to medication over the past few years and that the consumption of legal drugs remains a cause for concern . " some patients alternately pick up prescriptions from several different doctors , " she said . and with germany 's strict data protection laws , it is difficult to trace such strategy . " controlling patients 100 percent just is n't possible , " müller-oerlinghausen said . tamsin walker , dw-world .

in short , levels of addiction to legal medication are topped only by a dependency on alcohol and tobacco .
but while those addictions are often discussed in the media , there is relatively little public discussion about addiction to legal substances . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : addiction to medication , a women 's thing ?
the most abused medication are the benzodiazepines , such as valium , which are often used as tranquilizers and sleeping pills , primarily by women .
according to bruno müller-oerlinghausen , a doctor with the drug commission of the german medical association , that fact could be attributed to the physical changes which women undergo during the menopause , and to the reality that women are more prone to depression than men and less likely to use alcohol when the going gets tough . the fact that problems with abuse of this medication are more frequent among females has not helped to bring it to light . " unfortunately it has long been considered a women 's issue and has been neglected , " said karin mohn of the dhs . she said she hopes that a number of new measures , including increasing public awareness and improving early recognition and intervention methods , will help to reverse the trend . prevention is better than a cure johannes lindenmeyer , a psychologist who specializes in addiction , says it is quite clearly a case of prevention being better than a cure , but adds that both doctors and patients need to change their thinking in order for the problem to be addressed in a serious way . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : therapy offers prevention " people need psychotherapy instead of medication , but doctors do n't get paid much for just talking about problems and patients generally prefer to go home with a prescription in their hands , " he said .
" so the doctors give medication instead of analyzing their psychological needs and assessing how their patients could benefit from such things as behavioral therapy . " in the case of insomnia for example , lindenmeyer explains that sufferers have to learn how to get rid of the problem rather than chemically suppressing it , not least because such relief is only temporary . " unlike alcohol , people take addictive medicines because they have a complaint , " he said .
" they take it and it makes them feel better , but once that sensation has worn off , the original complaint comes back more acutely . " for example , the insomniac taking medication to induce sleep will build up a tolerance over time and have to increase the dosage over time to achieve the same effect .
a psychological dependency on the drug can easily take root . the route to dependency with some medications is incredibly fast , with users becoming addicted after just weeks of regular use .
once the addiction to medication has taken hold , it is much harder to break the cycle than with alcohol , according to lindenmeyer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drug addiction claims less victims than medication dependency " people find it harder to believe that they have an addiction problem , because they have been prescribed their medication by doctors , " he said . " by the same token , we do n't have any clinics which deal specifically with medication addiction , they are put together with other addicts and feel misunderstood .
all this means that the success rate of programs to break medication addiction is about ten percent lower than anti-alcoholism schemes . " stricter controls necessary ? if the estimates of 1.4 to 1.9 million addicts are accurate , and if it is so hard to cure them once they have fallen prey to legal pharmaceuticals , should there be tighter controls on what doctors can and do prescribe ?
müller-oerlinghausen does not think so .
he believes the path away from the addictive trend is to continue training doctors and informing the public about the dangers of tranquilizers . " over the past 10-20 years , german doctors have learnt how to use these substances in a restrictive way in order to prevent addiction , " he said .
" there are clear guidelines and the annual report on prescribed medicines proves that the number of tranquilizers being handed out by doctors gets smaller every year . " nonetheless , mohn of the dhs says there has not been much change in the estimated number of patients addicted to medication over the past few years and that the consumption of legal drugs remains a cause for concern . " some patients alternately pick up prescriptions from several different doctors , " she said . and with germany 's strict data protection laws , it is difficult to trace such strategy . " controlling patients 100 percent just is n't possible , " müller-oerlinghausen said . tamsin walker , dw-world .

the conference presented the former junior coalition partner with the opportunity to look back over the last seven years of power-sharing in the government while planning ahead for a future back in opposition . however , a more productive use of the meeting would have been for the party to take a long , hard look at where the green dream went wrong , not only at the last election but in german , and european , politics in general over the past half a decade . at the turn of the century , the greens were not only part of a serving government in germany but in four other european countries .
france , italy , finland and belgium all had parties pushing environmental issues closer to the forefront of policy-making through their green representatives . the news this week that germany would be governed by a grand coalition of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- saw that era finally come to a close as germany 's greens succumbed to the fate that others had suffered as the sunflower started to wilt across europe . the retreat of germany 's greens ends an era bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the greens are left looking for someone to replace fischer the return of the greens to opposition in germany , and the self-imposed exile to the back benches of the party 's most high profile minister joschka fischer , left western european governments without a green representative . having been ejected from government in finland , france , italy , belgium and now germany , the green movement could not be blamed for being disheartened at the apparent failure of an environmental revolution in the corridors of european power . " these are setbacks , clearly , in every case .
greens are not now shaping policy , " said hubert kleinert , once a german green mp now a political scientist , in an interview with the bbc .
" during the last five years there have been more defeats than victories .
and i think this -lrb- german result -rrb- is the biggest one . "
the greens were overtaken by the liberal free democrats and the new left , even though their share of the vote fell only about 0.5 percent . former euro green chief says no need to panic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european parliamentarian juan behrend co-secretary general of the greens juan behrend , the former secretary general of the green federation in the european parliament who once saw the rise of the greens as " a luminous sunflower was hanging in the grey sky , " refused to be downcast by the german result . he admitted that the election result had been a " blow " but was adamant that the policies behind the greens would survive .
coming back to opposition would be " an opportunity " adding that the greens were specialists at making opposition politics and would be able to " articulate a very coherent green policy . " all is far from lost .
there may be shoots of re-growth for the green movement in other areas of europe .
the greens play a role in romano prodi 's left-wing alliance in italy , a partnership which looks set to challenge hard in the elections next year , while in france the greens are expected to be part of the left-wing bloc competing in the 2007 campaign . solid policies , awareness the green lagacy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even without the greens in power , renewable energy research will continue however , the fact remains that there is no current green representation in the big western europe governments and as a result there will be no green ministers at cabinet tables or eu ministerial meetings .
who will be the force of environmental change without the greens in power ?
will all that the movement , specifically in germany , achieved be undone ? political analysts believe that it is unlikely that the shutting down of nuclear energy plants and the huge increase in the use of renewable energy in germany will be reversed without the green party , who instigated these policies , in power . on the one hand , these ideas are now entrenched in the political mainstream and on the other , the european electorate realizes the importance of environmental protection , and they will not allow any political party to neglect that in its policy making . the green party 's sunflower may have wilted but there seems to be enough of a reservoir of belief and support around to keep it alive .
and who knows , the shoots of recovery may start to appear again in time . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany sheds the spirit of ' 68 with the country turning away from the red-green government and poised for a new political departure , dw-world spoke to green party politician hans-christian ströbele about the legacy of the late ' 60s .

" the presence of this virus in romania worries us , because it proves that it is in the birds ' environment , and that increases the possibility of transmission to humans , " said a spokesman in geneva . but it has kept its pandemic alert at phase three - the middle of its scale - as " a virus new to humans is causing infections , but does not spread easily from one person to another .

the big fear is that h5n1 may mutate , acquiring genes from the human flu virus that would make it highly infectious as well as lethal - possibly killing millions worldwide as the influenza pandemic of 1918 did . citing such precedents , britain 's chief medical officer said on sunday that bird flu would inevitably combine with a human variety and cause a pandemic that would kill around 50,000 people in his country alone .

dw-world looks at its deadly journey from asia . it is the scenario that european officials and health experts were dreading : avian - or bird - flu is on europe ’ s doorsteps and forecasts are doom-laden .
scientists believe that , in respect to a european outbreak of the disease , it is a case of when not if .
while such an outbreak would result in the culling of thousands of birds , the biggest fear is that it would begin to claim human lives across europe .
bird flu has infected 119 people since the first case was detected in hong kong in 1997 and tens of millions of birds have been killed by the disease .

however , the sad fact is this happens .
hospices help sick children through their last days and make them bearable for patient and family alike . norbert neubauer 's son niklaus suffers from a rare genetic disorder called " mucopolysaccharidosis " or mps .
usually , this condition results in various genetic deformities such as skeletal deformities , mental retardation , and decreased life expectancy .
when norbert 's son was diagnosed 8 years ago , he says , " at that time there was just nowhere to turn , we were in this situation and we felt completely alone . when we did finally did find out about child hospice care … we really had to struggle to get accepted . " the neubauer 's dilemma is unfortunately typical of an already painful and distressing situation .
in germany every year approximately 3,000 parents are given a diagnosis confirming that their child will soon die or have a dramatically shortened life span . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sonnenhoff children 's hospice in berlin such was the reasoning behind a conference that took place in cologne on october 14-15 . the event , called the erste deutsche kinderhospiztage , or " first german child hospice days " was a gathering of child hospice workers , managers and lobbyists that are collectively trying to erase the taboo surrounding death and children and create new services for german families . a unique challenge children living with terminal illnesses provide a unique and particularly difficult challenge for families and healthcare providers .
children are not " little adults " .
and solutions for children living in the shadow of death can not be simply extrapolated from adult hospice programs .
end-of-life care for children must not only manage the physical symptoms of the child , but address social and psychological demands of the whole family . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sleeping room at the " rainbowland " childrens hospice in düsseldorf margret hartkopf , is a board member of the child hospice association of germany , and herself a mother of a terminally ill child . " it 's such a difficult situation , the parents feel guilty that they ca n't heal their child , and the physical and emotional burden of constantly attending to a sick child can be overwhelming for the entire family . " according to hartkopf , hospice care is , " meant to be flexible , the services are there to help the families , provide medical care , counselling and also educate others .
for instance , grandparents , social workers - even teachers have contacted us saying , ' a child in my class has died and i feel helpless … what do i do ? " ' need for inpatient and outpatient services germany currently maintains five stationary child hospice clinics compared to 26 in england , three in canada and one in the united states . the german child hospice movement was launched in 1990 by a group of parents living in the sauerland region .
the first children 's hospice clinic in germany was opened in 1998 in the town of ople .
" at first we had to overcome the enormous stereotype the hospices were ' death houses ' , or that hospices were related only to cancer , " explains dr. franco rest , director of the dietrich-oppenberg hospice academy in essen . bildunterschrift : rainbowland children 's hospice in düsseldorf children 's hospice 's are meant to be small , with a capacity of about 8 children ; more like staying with family and friends rather than a hospital .
according to federal statistics , there are estimated to be some 22,000 children in germany that are in need of hospice care . given this limited capacity the demand for new services and trained staff is enormous . lots of living to do the sad reality about children stricken with debilitating and life-shortening illness is that as other children become more and more independent , they become more dependent .
within this grim calculus the parents are the ones the children turn to . as germany rushes to create more inpatient and outpatient hospice services for children and families , and also grapple with the complex emotions at the core of the issue , it 's extremely important to remember that the point of this care is to help the child live life not prepare for death . " they want to be taken seriously , " explains hartkopf .
" they ask questions and they expect answers . they want friends , they want to laugh and they want to take part in public life . " adam allington , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german hospice movement seeks to make " dying a part of life " death remains a taboo topic , causing many to die alone - in hospitals or nursing homes .
since the late sixties , the german hospice movement has been trying to change this , showing people that " dying is a part of life . "

" the neubauer 's dilemma is unfortunately typical of an already painful and distressing situation .
in germany every year approximately 3,000 parents are given a diagnosis confirming that their child will soon die or have a dramatically shortened life span . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sonnenhoff children 's hospice in berlin such was the reasoning behind a conference that took place in cologne on october 14-15 . the event , called the erste deutsche kinderhospiztage , or " first german child hospice days " was a gathering of child hospice workers , managers and lobbyists that are collectively trying to erase the taboo surrounding death and children and create new services for german families . a unique challenge children living with terminal illnesses provide a unique and particularly difficult challenge for families and healthcare providers .
children are not " little adults " .
and solutions for children living in the shadow of death can not be simply extrapolated from adult hospice programs .
end-of-life care for children must not only manage the physical symptoms of the child , but address social and psychological demands of the whole family . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sleeping room at the " rainbowland " childrens hospice in düsseldorf margret hartkopf , is a board member of the child hospice association of germany , and herself a mother of a terminally ill child . " it 's such a difficult situation , the parents feel guilty that they ca n't heal their child , and the physical and emotional burden of constantly attending to a sick child can be overwhelming for the entire family . " according to hartkopf , hospice care is , " meant to be flexible , the services are there to help the families , provide medical care , counselling and also educate others .
for instance , grandparents , social workers - even teachers have contacted us saying , ' a child in my class has died and i feel helpless … what do i do ? " ' need for inpatient and outpatient services germany currently maintains five stationary child hospice clinics compared to 26 in england , three in canada and one in the united states . the german child hospice movement was launched in 1990 by a group of parents living in the sauerland region .
the first children 's hospice clinic in germany was opened in 1998 in the town of ople .
" at first we had to overcome the enormous stereotype the hospices were ' death houses ' , or that hospices were related only to cancer , " explains dr. franco rest , director of the dietrich-oppenberg hospice academy in essen . bildunterschrift : rainbowland children 's hospice in düsseldorf children 's hospice 's are meant to be small , with a capacity of about 8 children ; more like staying with family and friends rather than a hospital .
according to federal statistics , there are estimated to be some 22,000 children in germany that are in need of hospice care . given this limited capacity the demand for new services and trained staff is enormous . lots of living to do the sad reality about children stricken with debilitating and life-shortening illness is that as other children become more and more independent , they become more dependent .
within this grim calculus the parents are the ones the children turn to . as germany rushes to create more inpatient and outpatient hospice services for children and families , and also grapple with the complex emotions at the core of the issue , it 's extremely important to remember that the point of this care is to help the child live life not prepare for death . " they want to be taken seriously , " explains hartkopf .
" they ask questions and they expect answers . they want friends , they want to laugh and they want to take part in public life .

" we have to see things as they really are .
our year has been anything other than good , " said the german ace who went into the chinese grand prix this weekend in an uncharacteristic third place in the drivers ' standings . schumacher spun out of the final race of the season leaving him in third and giving him no chance of catching kimi raikkonen who finished as runner up to fernando alonso in shanghai and the world championship . " we have never been competitive and never really been in a position to compete for the title , one that has been ours in recent times , " said schumacher . " i am still in third place in the drivers ' standings .
it has never been this bad .

but who the 84-race winner will be driving for when he finally calls it a day is up in the air . there has been talk of him possibly leaving ferrari and ending his career with the mclaren team , although this was quickly quashed by webber .
" let 's put an end to this rumor : i can categorically exclude -lrb- the possibility of -rrb- michael schumacher leaving ferrari for mclaren-mercedes , " he told the stuttgarter nachrichten . the rumor began because schumacher , who won the last five world championships before alonso dethroned him , had rejected a fresh contract from ferrari .
" first of all , michael is doing fine at ferrari and secondly , his image is much more in line with ferrari and their sport cars than mercedes and their luxury cars .

unfortunately , the race ended in the same way as his season : in disappointment . ferrari boss jean todt still has every faith in his star driver and believes that by the time the 2006 season gets underway his car , which will be launched early to accelerate the italian giant 's fight back , will be back to its best . " i can ’ t say that we can prepare more thoroughly , but we are attempting to reply to the problems that we ’ ve had this year , " he said . " even if next year 's car won ’ t be in its latest specification for the beginning of the season , considering the introduction of the new v8 , 2.4 liter engine , we have decided to introduce the car as early as possible which is why we will introduce it by mid-january 06 . " third place in constructors ' table tells own story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ferrari 's season is winding down ferrari also finished third in the constructors ' championship , behind renault and mclaren , todt expressed mixed feelings about the season that ended after 19 races on sunday .

dw-world.de explains what podcasting is , how it works and how you can listen to podcasts . where does the expression " podcasting " come from ?
" podcasting " comes from mixing " broadcasting " with apple 's now-famous ipod mp3 player and amounts to radio you can download and listen to whenever you want .
so what does that mean to me ?
with podcasting you can download deutsche welle radio programs to your own mp3 player - no , it does n't have to be an ipod - and listen to them wherever and whenever you want .
you 're no longer bound to deutsche welle 's programming schedule .
how technically inclined do i have to be ?
not very .
you just need a computer with an internet connection and software that plays mp3 files , which usually comes pre-installed .
to make the process easier , you can download free podcasting clients that will , in turn , download your favorite podcasts from the internet and transfer them to your mp3 player. ipodder is the original podcasting client , but there are plenty available , including apple 's itunes .
what do i need to listen to a deutsche welle podcast ?
every deutsche welle podcast has an rss feed .
these feeds were first used in blogs but have also become an important part of news web sites .
podcast feeds contain the so-called " tags " that link to the audio files .
you just need to copy the rss tag into your podcasting client and let it do the work . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw podcast selection the deutsche welle lets you get the radio news and features you want - whenever you want to hear them .

fearing bird flu , germans stockpile meds europe -pipe- 16.10.2005 eu leaders to hold bird flu crisis talks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drastic culling continues as europe fights the threat of contagion the growing threat of lethal bird flu spreading across europe will top the agendas of eu leaders this week , after the deadly asian strain of the virus landed on the continent for the first time . scientists and the european union 's political chiefs are trying to ease public concern after the h5n1 virus was confirmed in romania at the weekend , only two days after its presence was identified in turkey . eu foreign ministers will discuss the outbreak at emergency talks in luxembourg on tuesday , while the bird flu scare will dominate the agenda of a meeting of health ministers later in the week . on wednesday , health commissioner markos kyprianou will present a pandemic simulation exercise aimed at testing the preparedness of the bloc 's 25 members for such an outbreak .
the scenario will be played out by year 's end . the world health organization immediately voiced concern at the romanian outbreak and admitted that the risk of bird-to-human transfer had increased .
" the presence of this virus in romania worries us , because it proves that it is in the birds ' environment , and that increases the possibility of transmission to humans , " said a spokesman in geneva . but it has kept its pandemic alert at phase three - the middle of its scale - as " a virus new to humans is causing infections , but does not spread easily from one person to another . " virus on the doorstep bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poultry are being destroyed or quarantined the eu banned imports of birds and poultry products from romania and turkey last week after the presence of bird flu was confirmed .
it was thought to have arrived via migratory birds from further east . but on saturday the scientists confirmed fears that the highly pathogenic asian strain had been found in three ducks found dead in the danube delta , on romania 's black sea coast . " the virus taken from -lrb- the village of -rrb- ceamurlia de jos is indeed the h5n1 , " romanian farm minister gheorghe flutur said .
" we are discussing what measures are needed to strengthen the protection zone around the source . " some good news surfaced on sunday , when he announced that a number of swans which had died in the delta did not have the virus , and turkish officials ruled out a second possible case there . killer h5n1 strain heads to europe from asia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bird influenza virus strain h5n1 , seen in gold .
while avian influenza primarily affects birds , the h5n1 strain has killed more than 60 people in southeast asia since 2003 - around half those who have contracted it .
the big fear is that h5n1 may mutate , acquiring genes from the human flu virus that would make it highly infectious as well as lethal - possibly killing millions worldwide as the influenza pandemic of 1918 did . citing such precedents , britain 's chief medical officer said on sunday that bird flu would inevitably combine with a human variety and cause a pandemic that would kill around 50,000 people in his country alone . " the significance of it is n't that there will be a pandemic of bird flu itself , the significance of it is that at some point , and we go by the lessons of history , the bird flu virus will combine with a human flu virus and then it will become easily transmissible , " liam donaldson told bbc television .
he noted that common winter flu kills more than 12,000 britons each year . massive research activity offers hope countries from germany to vietnam to the united states are busy looking for a remedy .
hungary expects to know within two weeks whether human trials of its vaccine have been successful . the european commission , meanwhile , has urged member states to stockpile anti-viral drugs , and says people at risk should ensure they are vaccinated against regular flu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the race is on to prevent a european outbreak of bird flu eu veterinary experts have also demanded immediate action to prevent migratory birds which could carry the virus from coming into contact with poultry , including moving farmed birds indoors . public told not to panic while they are keen not to spark panic , official calls for calm have not prevented a rush for anti-viral drugs and stocks in some countries are reported to be running short . fueling further concern , a study released friday said researchers had identified a mutated form of h5n1 bird flu that is resistant to tamiflu , the drug being stockpiled around the world to counter a feared pandemic . european commission head jose manuel barroso said at the weekend that the eu was ready to take " more drastic and radical measures " if necessary , depending on how the situation evolves . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deadly bird flu strain confirmed in europe hopes that the deadly h5n1 strain of avian flu had not yet reached mainland europe were dashed saturday after samples from romanian ducks proved positive .

" the neubauer 's dilemma is unfortunately typical of an already painful and distressing situation .
in germany every year approximately 3,000 parents are given a diagnosis confirming that their child will soon die or have a dramatically shortened life span . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sonnenhoff children 's hospice in berlin such was the reasoning behind a conference that took place in cologne on october 14-15 . the event , called the erste deutsche kinderhospiztage , or " first german child hospice days " was a gathering of child hospice workers , managers and lobbyists that are collectively trying to erase the taboo surrounding death and children and create new services for german families . a unique challenge children living with terminal illnesses provide a unique and particularly difficult challenge for families and healthcare providers .

within this grim calculus the parents are the ones the children turn to . as germany rushes to create more inpatient and outpatient hospice services for children and families , and also grapple with the complex emotions at the core of the issue , it 's extremely important to remember that the point of this care is to help the child live life not prepare for death .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 16.10.2005 addicted to medication großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : time to turn over a new leaf that germany is home to high levels of alcoholism and tobacco addiction is a well-established , if unhappy fact .
what is less known is the fact that abuse of prescribed medication is also widespread . the german head office for dependency matters , the dhs , estimates that between 1.4 and 1.9 million people in germany are dependent on prescribed drugs , considerably more than the numbers of those addicted to cannabis , cocaine , heroin or other illegal substances .
in short , levels of addiction to legal medication are topped only by a dependency on alcohol and tobacco .
but while those addictions are often discussed in the media , there is relatively little public discussion about addiction to legal substances . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : addiction to medication , a women 's thing ?
the most abused medication are the benzodiazepines , such as valium , which are often used as tranquilizers and sleeping pills , primarily by women .
according to bruno müller-oerlinghausen , a doctor with the drug commission of the german medical association , that fact could be attributed to the physical changes which women undergo during the menopause , and to the reality that women are more prone to depression than men and less likely to use alcohol when the going gets tough . the fact that problems with abuse of this medication are more frequent among females has not helped to bring it to light . " unfortunately it has long been considered a women 's issue and has been neglected , " said karin mohn of the dhs . she said she hopes that a number of new measures , including increasing public awareness and improving early recognition and intervention methods , will help to reverse the trend . prevention is better than a cure johannes lindenmeyer , a psychologist who specializes in addiction , says it is quite clearly a case of prevention being better than a cure , but adds that both doctors and patients need to change their thinking in order for the problem to be addressed in a serious way . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : therapy offers prevention " people need psychotherapy instead of medication , but doctors do n't get paid much for just talking about problems and patients generally prefer to go home with a prescription in their hands , " he said .
" so the doctors give medication instead of analyzing their psychological needs and assessing how their patients could benefit from such things as behavioral therapy . " in the case of insomnia for example , lindenmeyer explains that sufferers have to learn how to get rid of the problem rather than chemically suppressing it , not least because such relief is only temporary . " unlike alcohol , people take addictive medicines because they have a complaint , " he said .
" they take it and it makes them feel better , but once that sensation has worn off , the original complaint comes back more acutely . " for example , the insomniac taking medication to induce sleep will build up a tolerance over time and have to increase the dosage over time to achieve the same effect .
a psychological dependency on the drug can easily take root . the route to dependency with some medications is incredibly fast , with users becoming addicted after just weeks of regular use .
once the addiction to medication has taken hold , it is much harder to break the cycle than with alcohol , according to lindenmeyer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drug addiction claims less victims than medication dependency " people find it harder to believe that they have an addiction problem , because they have been prescribed their medication by doctors , " he said . " by the same token , we do n't have any clinics which deal specifically with medication addiction , they are put together with other addicts and feel misunderstood .
all this means that the success rate of programs to break medication addiction is about ten percent lower than anti-alcoholism schemes . " stricter controls necessary ? if the estimates of 1.4 to 1.9 million addicts are accurate , and if it is so hard to cure them once they have fallen prey to legal pharmaceuticals , should there be tighter controls on what doctors can and do prescribe ?
müller-oerlinghausen does not think so .
he believes the path away from the addictive trend is to continue training doctors and informing the public about the dangers of tranquilizers . " over the past 10-20 years , german doctors have learnt how to use these substances in a restrictive way in order to prevent addiction , " he said .
" there are clear guidelines and the annual report on prescribed medicines proves that the number of tranquilizers being handed out by doctors gets smaller every year . " nonetheless , mohn of the dhs says there has not been much change in the estimated number of patients addicted to medication over the past few years and that the consumption of legal drugs remains a cause for concern . " some patients alternately pick up prescriptions from several different doctors , " she said . and with germany 's strict data protection laws , it is difficult to trace such strategy . " controlling patients 100 percent just is n't possible , " müller-oerlinghausen said . tamsin walker , dw-world .

the most abused medication are the benzodiazepines , such as valium , which are often used as tranquilizers and sleeping pills , primarily by women .
according to bruno müller-oerlinghausen , a doctor with the drug commission of the german medical association , that fact could be attributed to the physical changes which women undergo during the menopause , and to the reality that women are more prone to depression than men and less likely to use alcohol when the going gets tough . the fact that problems with abuse of this medication are more frequent among females has not helped to bring it to light . " unfortunately it has long been considered a women 's issue and has been neglected , " said karin mohn of the dhs . she said she hopes that a number of new measures , including increasing public awareness and improving early recognition and intervention methods , will help to reverse the trend . prevention is better than a cure johannes lindenmeyer , a psychologist who specializes in addiction , says it is quite clearly a case of prevention being better than a cure , but adds that both doctors and patients need to change their thinking in order for the problem to be addressed in a serious way . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : therapy offers prevention " people need psychotherapy instead of medication , but doctors do n't get paid much for just talking about problems and patients generally prefer to go home with a prescription in their hands , " he said .
" so the doctors give medication instead of analyzing their psychological needs and assessing how their patients could benefit from such things as behavioral therapy . " in the case of insomnia for example , lindenmeyer explains that sufferers have to learn how to get rid of the problem rather than chemically suppressing it , not least because such relief is only temporary . " unlike alcohol , people take addictive medicines because they have a complaint , " he said .
" they take it and it makes them feel better , but once that sensation has worn off , the original complaint comes back more acutely . " for example , the insomniac taking medication to induce sleep will build up a tolerance over time and have to increase the dosage over time to achieve the same effect .
a psychological dependency on the drug can easily take root . the route to dependency with some medications is incredibly fast , with users becoming addicted after just weeks of regular use .
once the addiction to medication has taken hold , it is much harder to break the cycle than with alcohol , according to lindenmeyer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drug addiction claims less victims than medication dependency " people find it harder to believe that they have an addiction problem , because they have been prescribed their medication by doctors , " he said . " by the same token , we do n't have any clinics which deal specifically with medication addiction , they are put together with other addicts and feel misunderstood .
all this means that the success rate of programs to break medication addiction is about ten percent lower than anti-alcoholism schemes . " stricter controls necessary ? if the estimates of 1.4 to 1.9 million addicts are accurate , and if it is so hard to cure them once they have fallen prey to legal pharmaceuticals , should there be tighter controls on what doctors can and do prescribe ?
müller-oerlinghausen does not think so .
he believes the path away from the addictive trend is to continue training doctors and informing the public about the dangers of tranquilizers . " over the past 10-20 years , german doctors have learnt how to use these substances in a restrictive way in order to prevent addiction , " he said .
" there are clear guidelines and the annual report on prescribed medicines proves that the number of tranquilizers being handed out by doctors gets smaller every year . " nonetheless , mohn of the dhs says there has not been much change in the estimated number of patients addicted to medication over the past few years and that the consumption of legal drugs remains a cause for concern . " some patients alternately pick up prescriptions from several different doctors , " she said . and with germany 's strict data protection laws , it is difficult to trace such strategy . " controlling patients 100 percent just is n't possible , " müller-oerlinghausen said . tamsin walker , dw-world .

a psychological dependency on the drug can easily take root . the route to dependency with some medications is incredibly fast , with users becoming addicted after just weeks of regular use .
once the addiction to medication has taken hold , it is much harder to break the cycle than with alcohol , according to lindenmeyer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drug addiction claims less victims than medication dependency " people find it harder to believe that they have an addiction problem , because they have been prescribed their medication by doctors , " he said . " by the same token , we do n't have any clinics which deal specifically with medication addiction , they are put together with other addicts and feel misunderstood .
all this means that the success rate of programs to break medication addiction is about ten percent lower than anti-alcoholism schemes . " stricter controls necessary ? if the estimates of 1.4 to 1.9 million addicts are accurate , and if it is so hard to cure them once they have fallen prey to legal pharmaceuticals , should there be tighter controls on what doctors can and do prescribe ?
müller-oerlinghausen does not think so .
he believes the path away from the addictive trend is to continue training doctors and informing the public about the dangers of tranquilizers . " over the past 10-20 years , german doctors have learnt how to use these substances in a restrictive way in order to prevent addiction , " he said .
" there are clear guidelines and the annual report on prescribed medicines proves that the number of tranquilizers being handed out by doctors gets smaller every year . " nonetheless , mohn of the dhs says there has not been much change in the estimated number of patients addicted to medication over the past few years and that the consumption of legal drugs remains a cause for concern . " some patients alternately pick up prescriptions from several different doctors , " she said . and with germany 's strict data protection laws , it is difficult to trace such strategy . " controlling patients 100 percent just is n't possible , " müller-oerlinghausen said . tamsin walker , dw-world .

it charts the efforts of a hapless group of ruddy-cheeked swains to find a wife , and farmers ' associations say it 's offensive . perhaps taking a cue from paris hilton 's hugely successful " the simple life " now airing on german television , producers have woken up to the dramatic potential of life on the farm . " farmer seeks wife , " the latest reality show to grace the nation 's screens , follows the romantic shenanigans of seven single farmers desperately seeking love . patronizing but farmers ' associations are outraged and have called the show " demeaning " and " misleading . " their first objection is what they describe as the show 's inaccurate portrayal of rustic rough and tumble . " i 'm not saying that 's not what it 's like , " michael lohse from the farmers ' association told spiegel online .
but generally , he insisted , most farmyards look pretty different to rtl 's vision of fields of golden wheat , romantic moonlight horse-and-cart rides , village fairs and strapping young hillbillies . poetic licence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the seven likely lads the show also claims that 70 percent of farmers are single .
not true , insists lohse .
" according to our statistics , the figure is more like 30 percent , which is perfectly normal . " the protagonists are hardly a cross-section of germany 's farmers , either .
from the dashing organic farmer karl to shy stephan the pig farmer and herbert the hobby astrologist , the candidates allegedly make farmers look less like capable professionals and more like village idiots .
one of them asks his mother to choose his bride-to-be for him , while another proudly reveals he has n't left his farmyard in 28 years . " these are extreme cases , " said lohse .
" they do n't reflect reality . " viewers obviously do n't mind the fanciful take on rural life .

however , the sad fact is this happens .
hospices help sick children through their last days and make them bearable for patient and family alike . norbert neubauer 's son niklaus suffers from a rare genetic disorder called " mucopolysaccharidosis " or mps .
usually , this condition results in various genetic deformities such as skeletal deformities , mental retardation , and decreased life expectancy .
when norbert 's son was diagnosed 8 years ago , he says , " at that time there was just nowhere to turn , we were in this situation and we felt completely alone . when we did finally did find out about child hospice care … we really had to struggle to get accepted . " the neubauer 's dilemma is unfortunately typical of an already painful and distressing situation .
in germany every year approximately 3,000 parents are given a diagnosis confirming that their child will soon die or have a dramatically shortened life span . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sonnenhoff children 's hospice in berlin such was the reasoning behind a conference that took place in cologne on october 14-15 . the event , called the erste deutsche kinderhospiztage , or " first german child hospice days " was a gathering of child hospice workers , managers and lobbyists that are collectively trying to erase the taboo surrounding death and children and create new services for german families . a unique challenge children living with terminal illnesses provide a unique and particularly difficult challenge for families and healthcare providers .
children are not " little adults " .
and solutions for children living in the shadow of death can not be simply extrapolated from adult hospice programs .
end-of-life care for children must not only manage the physical symptoms of the child , but address social and psychological demands of the whole family . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sleeping room at the " rainbowland " childrens hospice in düsseldorf margret hartkopf , is a board member of the child hospice association of germany , and herself a mother of a terminally ill child . " it 's such a difficult situation , the parents feel guilty that they ca n't heal their child , and the physical and emotional burden of constantly attending to a sick child can be overwhelming for the entire family . " according to hartkopf , hospice care is , " meant to be flexible , the services are there to help the families , provide medical care , counselling and also educate others .
for instance , grandparents , social workers - even teachers have contacted us saying , ' a child in my class has died and i feel helpless … what do i do ? " ' need for inpatient and outpatient services germany currently maintains five stationary child hospice clinics compared to 26 in england , three in canada and one in the united states . the german child hospice movement was launched in 1990 by a group of parents living in the sauerland region .
the first children 's hospice clinic in germany was opened in 1998 in the town of ople .
" at first we had to overcome the enormous stereotype the hospices were ' death houses ' , or that hospices were related only to cancer , " explains dr. franco rest , director of the dietrich-oppenberg hospice academy in essen . bildunterschrift : rainbowland children 's hospice in düsseldorf children 's hospice 's are meant to be small , with a capacity of about 8 children ; more like staying with family and friends rather than a hospital .
according to federal statistics , there are estimated to be some 22,000 children in germany that are in need of hospice care . given this limited capacity the demand for new services and trained staff is enormous . lots of living to do the sad reality about children stricken with debilitating and life-shortening illness is that as other children become more and more independent , they become more dependent .
within this grim calculus the parents are the ones the children turn to . as germany rushes to create more inpatient and outpatient hospice services for children and families , and also grapple with the complex emotions at the core of the issue , it 's extremely important to remember that the point of this care is to help the child live life not prepare for death . " they want to be taken seriously , " explains hartkopf .
" they ask questions and they expect answers . they want friends , they want to laugh and they want to take part in public life . " adam allington , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german hospice movement seeks to make " dying a part of life " death remains a taboo topic , causing many to die alone - in hospitals or nursing homes .

" we are discussing what measures are needed to strengthen the protection zone around the source . " some good news surfaced on sunday , when he announced that a number of swans which had died in the delta did not have the virus , and turkish officials ruled out a second possible case there . killer h5n1 strain heads to europe from asia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bird influenza virus strain h5n1 , seen in gold .
while avian influenza primarily affects birds , the h5n1 strain has killed more than 60 people in southeast asia since 2003 - around half those who have contracted it .
the big fear is that h5n1 may mutate , acquiring genes from the human flu virus that would make it highly infectious as well as lethal - possibly killing millions worldwide as the influenza pandemic of 1918 did . citing such precedents , britain 's chief medical officer said on sunday that bird flu would inevitably combine with a human variety and cause a pandemic that would kill around 50,000 people in his country alone . " the significance of it is n't that there will be a pandemic of bird flu itself , the significance of it is that at some point , and we go by the lessons of history , the bird flu virus will combine with a human flu virus and then it will become easily transmissible , " liam donaldson told bbc television .
he noted that common winter flu kills more than 12,000 britons each year . massive research activity offers hope countries from germany to vietnam to the united states are busy looking for a remedy .
hungary expects to know within two weeks whether human trials of its vaccine have been successful . the european commission , meanwhile , has urged member states to stockpile anti-viral drugs , and says people at risk should ensure they are vaccinated against regular flu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the race is on to prevent a european outbreak of bird flu eu veterinary experts have also demanded immediate action to prevent migratory birds which could carry the virus from coming into contact with poultry , including moving farmed birds indoors . public told not to panic while they are keen not to spark panic , official calls for calm have not prevented a rush for anti-viral drugs and stocks in some countries are reported to be running short . fueling further concern , a study released friday said researchers had identified a mutated form of h5n1 bird flu that is resistant to tamiflu , the drug being stockpiled around the world to counter a feared pandemic . european commission head jose manuel barroso said at the weekend that the eu was ready to take " more drastic and radical measures " if necessary , depending on how the situation evolves . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deadly bird flu strain confirmed in europe hopes that the deadly h5n1 strain of avian flu had not yet reached mainland europe were dashed saturday after samples from romanian ducks proved positive .

" we have to see things as they really are .
our year has been anything other than good , " said the german ace who went into the chinese grand prix this weekend in an uncharacteristic third place in the drivers ' standings . schumacher spun out of the final race of the season leaving him in third and giving him no chance of catching kimi raikkonen who finished as runner up to fernando alonso in shanghai and the world championship . " we have never been competitive and never really been in a position to compete for the title , one that has been ours in recent times , " said schumacher . " i am still in third place in the drivers ' standings .
it has never been this bad . " ferrari won 15 of the 18 races last year but have only won once this time around , in the controversial six-car united states grand prix , and schumacher 's best ' real ' result has been a second place finish . as career nears end , speculation remains bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite a rough season , ferarri wants schumacher to keep driving while schumacher , 36 , is clearly heading towards the twilight of his career , he has at least two more seasons left in him , his agent willi webber told the german press this week .
but who the 84-race winner will be driving for when he finally calls it a day is up in the air . there has been talk of him possibly leaving ferrari and ending his career with the mclaren team , although this was quickly quashed by webber .
" let 's put an end to this rumor : i can categorically exclude -lrb- the possibility of -rrb- michael schumacher leaving ferrari for mclaren-mercedes , " he told the stuttgarter nachrichten . the rumor began because schumacher , who won the last five world championships before alonso dethroned him , had rejected a fresh contract from ferrari .
" first of all , michael is doing fine at ferrari and secondly , his image is much more in line with ferrari and their sport cars than mercedes and their luxury cars . " he added : " i ca n't say for definite but it 's likely that 2008 will be his final season . " current ferrari not up to the job bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a different car may help solve schumacher 's problems schumacher then has time to regain his crown , but he was not confident that he could produce his old magic in shanghai in the current ferrari car , a prediction that was proved tamely correct .
" a podium at the end of the season would bewonderful but we have to realize that the chances of obtaining that are not too high , " he said before the race . " in any case , we will be trying our best to end the season in the best of ways . "
unfortunately , the race ended in the same way as his season : in disappointment . ferrari boss jean todt still has every faith in his star driver and believes that by the time the 2006 season gets underway his car , which will be launched early to accelerate the italian giant 's fight back , will be back to its best . " i can ’ t say that we can prepare more thoroughly , but we are attempting to reply to the problems that we ’ ve had this year , " he said . " even if next year 's car won ’ t be in its latest specification for the beginning of the season , considering the introduction of the new v8 , 2.4 liter engine , we have decided to introduce the car as early as possible which is why we will introduce it by mid-january 06 . " third place in constructors ' table tells own story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ferrari 's season is winding down ferrari also finished third in the constructors ' championship , behind renault and mclaren , todt expressed mixed feelings about the season that ended after 19 races on sunday . " we know that formula one is a mechanical sport where to win a race or score a good result you need a good package : reliability , team , chassis , tyres and engine , " he said .
" so our third place in the constructors ’ championship is fairly significant .

" we have to see things as they really are .
our year has been anything other than good , " said the german ace who went into the chinese grand prix this weekend in an uncharacteristic third place in the drivers ' standings . schumacher spun out of the final race of the season leaving him in third and giving him no chance of catching kimi raikkonen who finished as runner up to fernando alonso in shanghai and the world championship . " we have never been competitive and never really been in a position to compete for the title , one that has been ours in recent times , " said schumacher . " i am still in third place in the drivers ' standings .
it has never been this bad . " ferrari won 15 of the 18 races last year but have only won once this time around , in the controversial six-car united states grand prix , and schumacher 's best ' real ' result has been a second place finish . as career nears end , speculation remains bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite a rough season , ferarri wants schumacher to keep driving while schumacher , 36 , is clearly heading towards the twilight of his career , he has at least two more seasons left in him , his agent willi webber told the german press this week .
but who the 84-race winner will be driving for when he finally calls it a day is up in the air . there has been talk of him possibly leaving ferrari and ending his career with the mclaren team , although this was quickly quashed by webber .
" let 's put an end to this rumor : i can categorically exclude -lrb- the possibility of -rrb- michael schumacher leaving ferrari for mclaren-mercedes , " he told the stuttgarter nachrichten . the rumor began because schumacher , who won the last five world championships before alonso dethroned him , had rejected a fresh contract from ferrari .
" first of all , michael is doing fine at ferrari and secondly , his image is much more in line with ferrari and their sport cars than mercedes and their luxury cars . " he added : " i ca n't say for definite but it 's likely that 2008 will be his final season . " current ferrari not up to the job bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a different car may help solve schumacher 's problems schumacher then has time to regain his crown , but he was not confident that he could produce his old magic in shanghai in the current ferrari car , a prediction that was proved tamely correct .
" a podium at the end of the season would bewonderful but we have to realize that the chances of obtaining that are not too high , " he said before the race . " in any case , we will be trying our best to end the season in the best of ways . "
unfortunately , the race ended in the same way as his season : in disappointment . ferrari boss jean todt still has every faith in his star driver and believes that by the time the 2006 season gets underway his car , which will be launched early to accelerate the italian giant 's fight back , will be back to its best . " i can ’ t say that we can prepare more thoroughly , but we are attempting to reply to the problems that we ’ ve had this year , " he said . " even if next year 's car won ’ t be in its latest specification for the beginning of the season , considering the introduction of the new v8 , 2.4 liter engine , we have decided to introduce the car as early as possible which is why we will introduce it by mid-january 06 . " third place in constructors ' table tells own story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ferrari 's season is winding down ferrari also finished third in the constructors ' championship , behind renault and mclaren , todt expressed mixed feelings about the season that ended after 19 races on sunday . " we know that formula one is a mechanical sport where to win a race or score a good result you need a good package : reliability , team , chassis , tyres and engine , " he said .
" so our third place in the constructors ’ championship is fairly significant . " having said that , two teams have been more competitive than ferrari-bridgestone so we knew that it ’ s something that could happen one day . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de who 's afraid of michael schumacher ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 16.10.2005 europe 's green dream wilts but wo n't die großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sun has set on the european green movement 's days in power greens in europe lost power when the german party returned to the opposition , but parties elsewhere offer hope . germany 's green party held a one day conference in the city of oldenburg on saturday .
the conference presented the former junior coalition partner with the opportunity to look back over the last seven years of power-sharing in the government while planning ahead for a future back in opposition . however , a more productive use of the meeting would have been for the party to take a long , hard look at where the green dream went wrong , not only at the last election but in german , and european , politics in general over the past half a decade . at the turn of the century , the greens were not only part of a serving government in germany but in four other european countries .
france , italy , finland and belgium all had parties pushing environmental issues closer to the forefront of policy-making through their green representatives . the news this week that germany would be governed by a grand coalition of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- saw that era finally come to a close as germany 's greens succumbed to the fate that others had suffered as the sunflower started to wilt across europe . the retreat of germany 's greens ends an era bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the greens are left looking for someone to replace fischer the return of the greens to opposition in germany , and the self-imposed exile to the back benches of the party 's most high profile minister joschka fischer , left western european governments without a green representative . having been ejected from government in finland , france , italy , belgium and now germany , the green movement could not be blamed for being disheartened at the apparent failure of an environmental revolution in the corridors of european power . " these are setbacks , clearly , in every case .
greens are not now shaping policy , " said hubert kleinert , once a german green mp now a political scientist , in an interview with the bbc .
" during the last five years there have been more defeats than victories .
and i think this -lrb- german result -rrb- is the biggest one . "
the greens were overtaken by the liberal free democrats and the new left , even though their share of the vote fell only about 0.5 percent . former euro green chief says no need to panic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european parliamentarian juan behrend co-secretary general of the greens juan behrend , the former secretary general of the green federation in the european parliament who once saw the rise of the greens as " a luminous sunflower was hanging in the grey sky , " refused to be downcast by the german result . he admitted that the election result had been a " blow " but was adamant that the policies behind the greens would survive .
coming back to opposition would be " an opportunity " adding that the greens were specialists at making opposition politics and would be able to " articulate a very coherent green policy . " all is far from lost .
there may be shoots of re-growth for the green movement in other areas of europe .
the greens play a role in romano prodi 's left-wing alliance in italy , a partnership which looks set to challenge hard in the elections next year , while in france the greens are expected to be part of the left-wing bloc competing in the 2007 campaign . solid policies , awareness the green lagacy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even without the greens in power , renewable energy research will continue however , the fact remains that there is no current green representation in the big western europe governments and as a result there will be no green ministers at cabinet tables or eu ministerial meetings .
who will be the force of environmental change without the greens in power ?
will all that the movement , specifically in germany , achieved be undone ? political analysts believe that it is unlikely that the shutting down of nuclear energy plants and the huge increase in the use of renewable energy in germany will be reversed without the green party , who instigated these policies , in power . on the one hand , these ideas are now entrenched in the political mainstream and on the other , the european electorate realizes the importance of environmental protection , and they will not allow any political party to neglect that in its policy making . the green party 's sunflower may have wilted but there seems to be enough of a reservoir of belief and support around to keep it alive .
and who knows , the shoots of recovery may start to appear again in time . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany sheds the spirit of ' 68 with the country turning away from the red-green government and poised for a new political departure , dw-world spoke to green party politician hans-christian ströbele about the legacy of the late ' 60s .

france , italy , finland and belgium all had parties pushing environmental issues closer to the forefront of policy-making through their green representatives . the news this week that germany would be governed by a grand coalition of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- saw that era finally come to a close as germany 's greens succumbed to the fate that others had suffered as the sunflower started to wilt across europe . the retreat of germany 's greens ends an era bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the greens are left looking for someone to replace fischer the return of the greens to opposition in germany , and the self-imposed exile to the back benches of the party 's most high profile minister joschka fischer , left western european governments without a green representative . having been ejected from government in finland , france , italy , belgium and now germany , the green movement could not be blamed for being disheartened at the apparent failure of an environmental revolution in the corridors of european power . " these are setbacks , clearly , in every case .
greens are not now shaping policy , " said hubert kleinert , once a german green mp now a political scientist , in an interview with the bbc .
" during the last five years there have been more defeats than victories .
and i think this -lrb- german result -rrb- is the biggest one . "
the greens were overtaken by the liberal free democrats and the new left , even though their share of the vote fell only about 0.5 percent . former euro green chief says no need to panic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european parliamentarian juan behrend co-secretary general of the greens juan behrend , the former secretary general of the green federation in the european parliament who once saw the rise of the greens as " a luminous sunflower was hanging in the grey sky , " refused to be downcast by the german result . he admitted that the election result had been a " blow " but was adamant that the policies behind the greens would survive .
coming back to opposition would be " an opportunity " adding that the greens were specialists at making opposition politics and would be able to " articulate a very coherent green policy . " all is far from lost .
there may be shoots of re-growth for the green movement in other areas of europe .
the greens play a role in romano prodi 's left-wing alliance in italy , a partnership which looks set to challenge hard in the elections next year , while in france the greens are expected to be part of the left-wing bloc competing in the 2007 campaign . solid policies , awareness the green lagacy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even without the greens in power , renewable energy research will continue however , the fact remains that there is no current green representation in the big western europe governments and as a result there will be no green ministers at cabinet tables or eu ministerial meetings .
who will be the force of environmental change without the greens in power ?
will all that the movement , specifically in germany , achieved be undone ? political analysts believe that it is unlikely that the shutting down of nuclear energy plants and the huge increase in the use of renewable energy in germany will be reversed without the green party , who instigated these policies , in power . on the one hand , these ideas are now entrenched in the political mainstream and on the other , the european electorate realizes the importance of environmental protection , and they will not allow any political party to neglect that in its policy making . the green party 's sunflower may have wilted but there seems to be enough of a reservoir of belief and support around to keep it alive .
and who knows , the shoots of recovery may start to appear again in time . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany sheds the spirit of ' 68 with the country turning away from the red-green government and poised for a new political departure , dw-world spoke to green party politician hans-christian ströbele about the legacy of the late ' 60s .

" i am in germany twice a month and can explain things face to face , " klinsmann told bild daily . " i do not ask other people about their schedules .
i am open to advice but it should be given to me straight not via the media . " i think about germany 24/7 , says coach klinsmann came in for more criticism after missing the bayern munich-schalke 04 title clash on saturday but insisted he was constantly thinking of how to improve the national team .
" i am thinking about the development of the national team twenty four seven whether i am in germany , the united states or somewhere else , " added klinsmann . klinsmann , 41 , has made a habit of jetting back to his california home after international matches but rubbished claims he was not making time to see bundesliga officials .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 16.10.2005 addicted to medication großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : time to turn over a new leaf that germany is home to high levels of alcoholism and tobacco addiction is a well-established , if unhappy fact .
what is less known is the fact that abuse of prescribed medication is also widespread . the german head office for dependency matters , the dhs , estimates that between 1.4 and 1.9 million people in germany are dependent on prescribed drugs , considerably more than the numbers of those addicted to cannabis , cocaine , heroin or other illegal substances .
in short , levels of addiction to legal medication are topped only by a dependency on alcohol and tobacco .
but while those addictions are often discussed in the media , there is relatively little public discussion about addiction to legal substances . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : addiction to medication , a women 's thing ?
the most abused medication are the benzodiazepines , such as valium , which are often used as tranquilizers and sleeping pills , primarily by women .
according to bruno müller-oerlinghausen , a doctor with the drug commission of the german medical association , that fact could be attributed to the physical changes which women undergo during the menopause , and to the reality that women are more prone to depression than men and less likely to use alcohol when the going gets tough . the fact that problems with abuse of this medication are more frequent among females has not helped to bring it to light . " unfortunately it has long been considered a women 's issue and has been neglected , " said karin mohn of the dhs . she said she hopes that a number of new measures , including increasing public awareness and improving early recognition and intervention methods , will help to reverse the trend . prevention is better than a cure johannes lindenmeyer , a psychologist who specializes in addiction , says it is quite clearly a case of prevention being better than a cure , but adds that both doctors and patients need to change their thinking in order for the problem to be addressed in a serious way . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : therapy offers prevention " people need psychotherapy instead of medication , but doctors do n't get paid much for just talking about problems and patients generally prefer to go home with a prescription in their hands , " he said .
" so the doctors give medication instead of analyzing their psychological needs and assessing how their patients could benefit from such things as behavioral therapy . " in the case of insomnia for example , lindenmeyer explains that sufferers have to learn how to get rid of the problem rather than chemically suppressing it , not least because such relief is only temporary . " unlike alcohol , people take addictive medicines because they have a complaint , " he said .
" they take it and it makes them feel better , but once that sensation has worn off , the original complaint comes back more acutely . " for example , the insomniac taking medication to induce sleep will build up a tolerance over time and have to increase the dosage over time to achieve the same effect .
a psychological dependency on the drug can easily take root . the route to dependency with some medications is incredibly fast , with users becoming addicted after just weeks of regular use .
once the addiction to medication has taken hold , it is much harder to break the cycle than with alcohol , according to lindenmeyer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drug addiction claims less victims than medication dependency " people find it harder to believe that they have an addiction problem , because they have been prescribed their medication by doctors , " he said . " by the same token , we do n't have any clinics which deal specifically with medication addiction , they are put together with other addicts and feel misunderstood .
all this means that the success rate of programs to break medication addiction is about ten percent lower than anti-alcoholism schemes . " stricter controls necessary ? if the estimates of 1.4 to 1.9 million addicts are accurate , and if it is so hard to cure them once they have fallen prey to legal pharmaceuticals , should there be tighter controls on what doctors can and do prescribe ?
müller-oerlinghausen does not think so .
he believes the path away from the addictive trend is to continue training doctors and informing the public about the dangers of tranquilizers . " over the past 10-20 years , german doctors have learnt how to use these substances in a restrictive way in order to prevent addiction , " he said .
" there are clear guidelines and the annual report on prescribed medicines proves that the number of tranquilizers being handed out by doctors gets smaller every year . " nonetheless , mohn of the dhs says there has not been much change in the estimated number of patients addicted to medication over the past few years and that the consumption of legal drugs remains a cause for concern . " some patients alternately pick up prescriptions from several different doctors , " she said . and with germany 's strict data protection laws , it is difficult to trace such strategy . " controlling patients 100 percent just is n't possible , " müller-oerlinghausen said . tamsin walker , dw-world .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 16.10.2005 addicted to medication großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : time to turn over a new leaf that germany is home to high levels of alcoholism and tobacco addiction is a well-established , if unhappy fact .
what is less known is the fact that abuse of prescribed medication is also widespread . the german head office for dependency matters , the dhs , estimates that between 1.4 and 1.9 million people in germany are dependent on prescribed drugs , considerably more than the numbers of those addicted to cannabis , cocaine , heroin or other illegal substances .
in short , levels of addiction to legal medication are topped only by a dependency on alcohol and tobacco .
but while those addictions are often discussed in the media , there is relatively little public discussion about addiction to legal substances . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : addiction to medication , a women 's thing ?
the most abused medication are the benzodiazepines , such as valium , which are often used as tranquilizers and sleeping pills , primarily by women .
according to bruno müller-oerlinghausen , a doctor with the drug commission of the german medical association , that fact could be attributed to the physical changes which women undergo during the menopause , and to the reality that women are more prone to depression than men and less likely to use alcohol when the going gets tough . the fact that problems with abuse of this medication are more frequent among females has not helped to bring it to light . " unfortunately it has long been considered a women 's issue and has been neglected , " said karin mohn of the dhs . she said she hopes that a number of new measures , including increasing public awareness and improving early recognition and intervention methods , will help to reverse the trend . prevention is better than a cure johannes lindenmeyer , a psychologist who specializes in addiction , says it is quite clearly a case of prevention being better than a cure , but adds that both doctors and patients need to change their thinking in order for the problem to be addressed in a serious way . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : therapy offers prevention " people need psychotherapy instead of medication , but doctors do n't get paid much for just talking about problems and patients generally prefer to go home with a prescription in their hands , " he said .
" so the doctors give medication instead of analyzing their psychological needs and assessing how their patients could benefit from such things as behavioral therapy . " in the case of insomnia for example , lindenmeyer explains that sufferers have to learn how to get rid of the problem rather than chemically suppressing it , not least because such relief is only temporary . " unlike alcohol , people take addictive medicines because they have a complaint , " he said .
" they take it and it makes them feel better , but once that sensation has worn off , the original complaint comes back more acutely . " for example , the insomniac taking medication to induce sleep will build up a tolerance over time and have to increase the dosage over time to achieve the same effect .
a psychological dependency on the drug can easily take root . the route to dependency with some medications is incredibly fast , with users becoming addicted after just weeks of regular use .
once the addiction to medication has taken hold , it is much harder to break the cycle than with alcohol , according to lindenmeyer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drug addiction claims less victims than medication dependency " people find it harder to believe that they have an addiction problem , because they have been prescribed their medication by doctors , " he said . " by the same token , we do n't have any clinics which deal specifically with medication addiction , they are put together with other addicts and feel misunderstood .
all this means that the success rate of programs to break medication addiction is about ten percent lower than anti-alcoholism schemes . " stricter controls necessary ? if the estimates of 1.4 to 1.9 million addicts are accurate , and if it is so hard to cure them once they have fallen prey to legal pharmaceuticals , should there be tighter controls on what doctors can and do prescribe ?
müller-oerlinghausen does not think so .
he believes the path away from the addictive trend is to continue training doctors and informing the public about the dangers of tranquilizers . " over the past 10-20 years , german doctors have learnt how to use these substances in a restrictive way in order to prevent addiction , " he said .
" there are clear guidelines and the annual report on prescribed medicines proves that the number of tranquilizers being handed out by doctors gets smaller every year . " nonetheless , mohn of the dhs says there has not been much change in the estimated number of patients addicted to medication over the past few years and that the consumption of legal drugs remains a cause for concern . " some patients alternately pick up prescriptions from several different doctors , " she said . and with germany 's strict data protection laws , it is difficult to trace such strategy . " controlling patients 100 percent just is n't possible , " müller-oerlinghausen said . tamsin walker , dw-world .

" we have to see things as they really are .
our year has been anything other than good , " said the german ace who went into the chinese grand prix this weekend in an uncharacteristic third place in the drivers ' standings . schumacher spun out of the final race of the season leaving him in third and giving him no chance of catching kimi raikkonen who finished as runner up to fernando alonso in shanghai and the world championship . " we have never been competitive and never really been in a position to compete for the title , one that has been ours in recent times , " said schumacher . " i am still in third place in the drivers ' standings .
it has never been this bad . " ferrari won 15 of the 18 races last year but have only won once this time around , in the controversial six-car united states grand prix , and schumacher 's best ' real ' result has been a second place finish . as career nears end , speculation remains bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite a rough season , ferarri wants schumacher to keep driving while schumacher , 36 , is clearly heading towards the twilight of his career , he has at least two more seasons left in him , his agent willi webber told the german press this week .
but who the 84-race winner will be driving for when he finally calls it a day is up in the air . there has been talk of him possibly leaving ferrari and ending his career with the mclaren team , although this was quickly quashed by webber .
" let 's put an end to this rumor : i can categorically exclude -lrb- the possibility of -rrb- michael schumacher leaving ferrari for mclaren-mercedes , " he told the stuttgarter nachrichten . the rumor began because schumacher , who won the last five world championships before alonso dethroned him , had rejected a fresh contract from ferrari .
" first of all , michael is doing fine at ferrari and secondly , his image is much more in line with ferrari and their sport cars than mercedes and their luxury cars . " he added : " i ca n't say for definite but it 's likely that 2008 will be his final season . " current ferrari not up to the job bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a different car may help solve schumacher 's problems schumacher then has time to regain his crown , but he was not confident that he could produce his old magic in shanghai in the current ferrari car , a prediction that was proved tamely correct .
" a podium at the end of the season would bewonderful but we have to realize that the chances of obtaining that are not too high , " he said before the race . " in any case , we will be trying our best to end the season in the best of ways . "
unfortunately , the race ended in the same way as his season : in disappointment . ferrari boss jean todt still has every faith in his star driver and believes that by the time the 2006 season gets underway his car , which will be launched early to accelerate the italian giant 's fight back , will be back to its best . " i can ’ t say that we can prepare more thoroughly , but we are attempting to reply to the problems that we ’ ve had this year , " he said . " even if next year 's car won ’ t be in its latest specification for the beginning of the season , considering the introduction of the new v8 , 2.4 liter engine , we have decided to introduce the car as early as possible which is why we will introduce it by mid-january 06 . " third place in constructors ' table tells own story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ferrari 's season is winding down ferrari also finished third in the constructors ' championship , behind renault and mclaren , todt expressed mixed feelings about the season that ended after 19 races on sunday . " we know that formula one is a mechanical sport where to win a race or score a good result you need a good package : reliability , team , chassis , tyres and engine , " he said .
" so our third place in the constructors ’ championship is fairly significant . " having said that , two teams have been more competitive than ferrari-bridgestone so we knew that it ’ s something that could happen one day . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de who 's afraid of michael schumacher ?
the race for the formula 1 crown starts on sunday with the australian grand prix , and michael schumacher is expecting a difficult start .
that should offer fans a change of pace , but can anyone dethrone the german champ ?

fearing bird flu , germans stockpile meds europe -pipe- 16.10.2005 eu leaders to hold bird flu crisis talks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drastic culling continues as europe fights the threat of contagion the growing threat of lethal bird flu spreading across europe will top the agendas of eu leaders this week , after the deadly asian strain of the virus landed on the continent for the first time . scientists and the european union 's political chiefs are trying to ease public concern after the h5n1 virus was confirmed in romania at the weekend , only two days after its presence was identified in turkey . eu foreign ministers will discuss the outbreak at emergency talks in luxembourg on tuesday , while the bird flu scare will dominate the agenda of a meeting of health ministers later in the week . on wednesday , health commissioner markos kyprianou will present a pandemic simulation exercise aimed at testing the preparedness of the bloc 's 25 members for such an outbreak .
the scenario will be played out by year 's end . the world health organization immediately voiced concern at the romanian outbreak and admitted that the risk of bird-to-human transfer had increased .
" the presence of this virus in romania worries us , because it proves that it is in the birds ' environment , and that increases the possibility of transmission to humans , " said a spokesman in geneva . but it has kept its pandemic alert at phase three - the middle of its scale - as " a virus new to humans is causing infections , but does not spread easily from one person to another . " virus on the doorstep bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poultry are being destroyed or quarantined the eu banned imports of birds and poultry products from romania and turkey last week after the presence of bird flu was confirmed .
it was thought to have arrived via migratory birds from further east . but on saturday the scientists confirmed fears that the highly pathogenic asian strain had been found in three ducks found dead in the danube delta , on romania 's black sea coast . " the virus taken from -lrb- the village of -rrb- ceamurlia de jos is indeed the h5n1 , " romanian farm minister gheorghe flutur said .
" we are discussing what measures are needed to strengthen the protection zone around the source . " some good news surfaced on sunday , when he announced that a number of swans which had died in the delta did not have the virus , and turkish officials ruled out a second possible case there . killer h5n1 strain heads to europe from asia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bird influenza virus strain h5n1 , seen in gold .
while avian influenza primarily affects birds , the h5n1 strain has killed more than 60 people in southeast asia since 2003 - around half those who have contracted it .
the big fear is that h5n1 may mutate , acquiring genes from the human flu virus that would make it highly infectious as well as lethal - possibly killing millions worldwide as the influenza pandemic of 1918 did . citing such precedents , britain 's chief medical officer said on sunday that bird flu would inevitably combine with a human variety and cause a pandemic that would kill around 50,000 people in his country alone . " the significance of it is n't that there will be a pandemic of bird flu itself , the significance of it is that at some point , and we go by the lessons of history , the bird flu virus will combine with a human flu virus and then it will become easily transmissible , " liam donaldson told bbc television .
he noted that common winter flu kills more than 12,000 britons each year . massive research activity offers hope countries from germany to vietnam to the united states are busy looking for a remedy .
hungary expects to know within two weeks whether human trials of its vaccine have been successful . the european commission , meanwhile , has urged member states to stockpile anti-viral drugs , and says people at risk should ensure they are vaccinated against regular flu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the race is on to prevent a european outbreak of bird flu eu veterinary experts have also demanded immediate action to prevent migratory birds which could carry the virus from coming into contact with poultry , including moving farmed birds indoors . public told not to panic while they are keen not to spark panic , official calls for calm have not prevented a rush for anti-viral drugs and stocks in some countries are reported to be running short . fueling further concern , a study released friday said researchers had identified a mutated form of h5n1 bird flu that is resistant to tamiflu , the drug being stockpiled around the world to counter a feared pandemic . european commission head jose manuel barroso said at the weekend that the eu was ready to take " more drastic and radical measures " if necessary , depending on how the situation evolves . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deadly bird flu strain confirmed in europe hopes that the deadly h5n1 strain of avian flu had not yet reached mainland europe were dashed saturday after samples from romanian ducks proved positive .

the league 's nightmare did n't come true , however .
hamburg defeated their rivals on the seventh match day and after nine games , there is a new leader - werder bremen . the champions from 2003-04 thrashed nuremberg 6-2 and thanks to a munich draw at schalke , and hamburg 's loss to wolfsburg , bremen found themselves at the top of the bundesliga standings ahead of bayern based on a better goal difference . " those are results that we are n't unhappy with , " said bremen coach thomas schaaf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's croatian forward ivan klasnic has eight goals so far this season german international miroslav klose was a one-man wrecking crew against the south germans from nuremberg , scoring a first-half hat trick to seal the game in the first 45 minutes .
the three goals put klose at the top of the league 's goalscorers with ten strikes .
klose 's potent partner , croatian international ivan klasnic , found the net two times and midfielder tim borowski scored the sixth goal for the bundesliga 's most powerful offense with 27 goals . emotional draw for schalke bayern munich had been hoping for their first victory in six tries at the arena aufschalke .
the champions ' dream was being fulfilled for 93 minutes .
roque santa cruz put the bavarians on top in the 19th minute thanks to a very questionable no-call by referee michael weiner . bayern then did everything possible in the second-half to let schalke back into the game .
they still almost came away with three points - until the 93rd minute .
weiner , who denied a penalty kick for the hosts earlier , was again in the spotlight and gave a penalty to schalke on a very generous call three minutes after regulation .
danish striker sören larsen snatched the ball away from teammate lincoln , converted and 62,000 schalke supporters erupted in joy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke 's danish sören larsen -lrb- l -rrb- would draw the foul and convert the penalty kick to save a draw for schalke against bayern munich " that was n't a penalty , " was bayern coach felix magath 's clear judgment but he admitted that his side had done little in the second-half to seal the victory .
nevertheless , munich broke a five-game losing streak at schalke .
larsen 's late heroics helped schalke to remain the only bundesliga club without a loss this season , but are still five points behind the leaders . frustrated hamburg lose for first time dutch international rafael van der vaart has been the focal point of hamburg 's rise to second-place in the bundesliga after eight weeks .
coolly , he had scored five times and assisted on six further strikes .
the club of the 70 's was again impressive .
going back to last season , hamburg sv had gone 19 matches without a defeat but that came to an end when wolfsburg beat the hosts 1-0 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaiserslautern 's halil altintop -lrb- l -rrb- leaves dortmund keeper roman weidenfeller without a chance in scoring the equalizer the league 's fans , sometimes forced to suffer through tedious goalless matches , were treated to 26 goals on saturday .
in kaiserslautern , halil altintop and ebi smolarek both scored a hat trick as the hosts came from a two-goal deficit to draw with dortmund .
the supporters of the red devils vented their frustration with their team 's poor league start by remaining outside the stadium the first five minutes of the match and could only be happy that turkish striker altintop , like klose with ten goals to his credit , found the net as successfully as he did for his national squad against germany last weekend . bayer leverkusen hired a new coach this week , michael skibbe .

" those are results that we are n't unhappy with , " said bremen coach thomas schaaf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's croatian forward ivan klasnic has eight goals so far this season german international miroslav klose was a one-man wrecking crew against the south germans from nuremberg , scoring a first-half hat trick to seal the game in the first 45 minutes .
the three goals put klose at the top of the league 's goalscorers with ten strikes .
klose 's potent partner , croatian international ivan klasnic , found the net two times and midfielder tim borowski scored the sixth goal for the bundesliga 's most powerful offense with 27 goals . emotional draw for schalke bayern munich had been hoping for their first victory in six tries at the arena aufschalke .
the champions ' dream was being fulfilled for 93 minutes .
roque santa cruz put the bavarians on top in the 19th minute thanks to a very questionable no-call by referee michael weiner . bayern then did everything possible in the second-half to let schalke back into the game .
they still almost came away with three points - until the 93rd minute .
weiner , who denied a penalty kick for the hosts earlier , was again in the spotlight and gave a penalty to schalke on a very generous call three minutes after regulation .
danish striker sören larsen snatched the ball away from teammate lincoln , converted and 62,000 schalke supporters erupted in joy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke 's danish sören larsen -lrb- l -rrb- would draw the foul and convert the penalty kick to save a draw for schalke against bayern munich " that was n't a penalty , " was bayern coach felix magath 's clear judgment but he admitted that his side had done little in the second-half to seal the victory .
nevertheless , munich broke a five-game losing streak at schalke .
larsen 's late heroics helped schalke to remain the only bundesliga club without a loss this season , but are still five points behind the leaders . frustrated hamburg lose for first time dutch international rafael van der vaart has been the focal point of hamburg 's rise to second-place in the bundesliga after eight weeks .
coolly , he had scored five times and assisted on six further strikes .
the club of the 70 's was again impressive .
going back to last season , hamburg sv had gone 19 matches without a defeat but that came to an end when wolfsburg beat the hosts 1-0 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaiserslautern 's halil altintop -lrb- l -rrb- leaves dortmund keeper roman weidenfeller without a chance in scoring the equalizer the league 's fans , sometimes forced to suffer through tedious goalless matches , were treated to 26 goals on saturday .
in kaiserslautern , halil altintop and ebi smolarek both scored a hat trick as the hosts came from a two-goal deficit to draw with dortmund .
the supporters of the red devils vented their frustration with their team 's poor league start by remaining outside the stadium the first five minutes of the match and could only be happy that turkish striker altintop , like klose with ten goals to his credit , found the net as successfully as he did for his national squad against germany last weekend . bayer leverkusen hired a new coach this week , michael skibbe .
the move , frequently one that management hopes will shake a squad out of complacency , did n't work .
mainz played a strong second-half to win 3-1 as the crisis for leverkusen continues .
skibbe may have his hands full in turning around the fate of the club . berlin humiliated in bielefeld bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen 's clemens fritz -lrb- l -rrb- tries his best to get around mainz 05 's michael thurk .
thurk would score as mainz won 3-1 one of the league 's presumed title contenders berlin were caught unawares at the schüco arena in bielefeld as the capital city club suffered a deserved 3-0 defeat against one of the league 's " dwarves . "
marcio borges and heiko westermann celebrated their first goals in the bundesliga in a game that berlin coach falko götz said was lost in the first 45 minutes . mönchengladbach had surprisingly zoomed up to sixth-place after a shaky season start .
for 89 minutes , coach horst köppel 's team was poised to improve their position even more but a late own-goal by jeff strasser gave them only a draw at stuttgart .
despite the defender 's fatal goal , gladbach could move up a place in the standings . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bremen celebrate dramatic win in berlin bremen pulled off a dramatic late-match comeback to knock off berlin .

what is less known is the fact that abuse of prescribed medication is also widespread . the german head office for dependency matters , the dhs , estimates that between 1.4 and 1.9 million people in germany are dependent on prescribed drugs , considerably more than the numbers of those addicted to cannabis , cocaine , heroin or other illegal substances .
in short , levels of addiction to legal medication are topped only by a dependency on alcohol and tobacco .
but while those addictions are often discussed in the media , there is relatively little public discussion about addiction to legal substances . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : addiction to medication , a women 's thing ?
the most abused medication are the benzodiazepines , such as valium , which are often used as tranquilizers and sleeping pills , primarily by women .
according to bruno müller-oerlinghausen , a doctor with the drug commission of the german medical association , that fact could be attributed to the physical changes which women undergo during the menopause , and to the reality that women are more prone to depression than men and less likely to use alcohol when the going gets tough . the fact that problems with abuse of this medication are more frequent among females has not helped to bring it to light . " unfortunately it has long been considered a women 's issue and has been neglected , " said karin mohn of the dhs . she said she hopes that a number of new measures , including increasing public awareness and improving early recognition and intervention methods , will help to reverse the trend . prevention is better than a cure johannes lindenmeyer , a psychologist who specializes in addiction , says it is quite clearly a case of prevention being better than a cure , but adds that both doctors and patients need to change their thinking in order for the problem to be addressed in a serious way . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : therapy offers prevention " people need psychotherapy instead of medication , but doctors do n't get paid much for just talking about problems and patients generally prefer to go home with a prescription in their hands , " he said .
" so the doctors give medication instead of analyzing their psychological needs and assessing how their patients could benefit from such things as behavioral therapy . " in the case of insomnia for example , lindenmeyer explains that sufferers have to learn how to get rid of the problem rather than chemically suppressing it , not least because such relief is only temporary . " unlike alcohol , people take addictive medicines because they have a complaint , " he said .
" they take it and it makes them feel better , but once that sensation has worn off , the original complaint comes back more acutely . " for example , the insomniac taking medication to induce sleep will build up a tolerance over time and have to increase the dosage over time to achieve the same effect .
a psychological dependency on the drug can easily take root . the route to dependency with some medications is incredibly fast , with users becoming addicted after just weeks of regular use .
once the addiction to medication has taken hold , it is much harder to break the cycle than with alcohol , according to lindenmeyer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drug addiction claims less victims than medication dependency " people find it harder to believe that they have an addiction problem , because they have been prescribed their medication by doctors , " he said . " by the same token , we do n't have any clinics which deal specifically with medication addiction , they are put together with other addicts and feel misunderstood .
all this means that the success rate of programs to break medication addiction is about ten percent lower than anti-alcoholism schemes . " stricter controls necessary ? if the estimates of 1.4 to 1.9 million addicts are accurate , and if it is so hard to cure them once they have fallen prey to legal pharmaceuticals , should there be tighter controls on what doctors can and do prescribe ?
müller-oerlinghausen does not think so .
he believes the path away from the addictive trend is to continue training doctors and informing the public about the dangers of tranquilizers . " over the past 10-20 years , german doctors have learnt how to use these substances in a restrictive way in order to prevent addiction , " he said .
" there are clear guidelines and the annual report on prescribed medicines proves that the number of tranquilizers being handed out by doctors gets smaller every year . " nonetheless , mohn of the dhs says there has not been much change in the estimated number of patients addicted to medication over the past few years and that the consumption of legal drugs remains a cause for concern . " some patients alternately pick up prescriptions from several different doctors , " she said . and with germany 's strict data protection laws , it is difficult to trace such strategy .

" unfortunately it has long been considered a women 's issue and has been neglected , " said karin mohn of the dhs . she said she hopes that a number of new measures , including increasing public awareness and improving early recognition and intervention methods , will help to reverse the trend . prevention is better than a cure johannes lindenmeyer , a psychologist who specializes in addiction , says it is quite clearly a case of prevention being better than a cure , but adds that both doctors and patients need to change their thinking in order for the problem to be addressed in a serious way . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : therapy offers prevention " people need psychotherapy instead of medication , but doctors do n't get paid much for just talking about problems and patients generally prefer to go home with a prescription in their hands , " he said .
" so the doctors give medication instead of analyzing their psychological needs and assessing how their patients could benefit from such things as behavioral therapy . " in the case of insomnia for example , lindenmeyer explains that sufferers have to learn how to get rid of the problem rather than chemically suppressing it , not least because such relief is only temporary . " unlike alcohol , people take addictive medicines because they have a complaint , " he said .
" they take it and it makes them feel better , but once that sensation has worn off , the original complaint comes back more acutely . " for example , the insomniac taking medication to induce sleep will build up a tolerance over time and have to increase the dosage over time to achieve the same effect .
a psychological dependency on the drug can easily take root . the route to dependency with some medications is incredibly fast , with users becoming addicted after just weeks of regular use .
once the addiction to medication has taken hold , it is much harder to break the cycle than with alcohol , according to lindenmeyer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drug addiction claims less victims than medication dependency " people find it harder to believe that they have an addiction problem , because they have been prescribed their medication by doctors , " he said . " by the same token , we do n't have any clinics which deal specifically with medication addiction , they are put together with other addicts and feel misunderstood .
all this means that the success rate of programs to break medication addiction is about ten percent lower than anti-alcoholism schemes . " stricter controls necessary ? if the estimates of 1.4 to 1.9 million addicts are accurate , and if it is so hard to cure them once they have fallen prey to legal pharmaceuticals , should there be tighter controls on what doctors can and do prescribe ?
müller-oerlinghausen does not think so .
he believes the path away from the addictive trend is to continue training doctors and informing the public about the dangers of tranquilizers . " over the past 10-20 years , german doctors have learnt how to use these substances in a restrictive way in order to prevent addiction , " he said .
" there are clear guidelines and the annual report on prescribed medicines proves that the number of tranquilizers being handed out by doctors gets smaller every year . " nonetheless , mohn of the dhs says there has not been much change in the estimated number of patients addicted to medication over the past few years and that the consumption of legal drugs remains a cause for concern . " some patients alternately pick up prescriptions from several different doctors , " she said . and with germany 's strict data protection laws , it is difficult to trace such strategy . " controlling patients 100 percent just is n't possible , " müller-oerlinghausen said . tamsin walker , dw-world .

the league 's nightmare did n't come true , however .
hamburg defeated their rivals on the seventh match day and after nine games , there is a new leader - werder bremen . the champions from 2003-04 thrashed nuremberg 6-2 and thanks to a munich draw at schalke , and hamburg 's loss to wolfsburg , bremen found themselves at the top of the bundesliga standings ahead of bayern based on a better goal difference . " those are results that we are n't unhappy with , " said bremen coach thomas schaaf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's croatian forward ivan klasnic has eight goals so far this season german international miroslav klose was a one-man wrecking crew against the south germans from nuremberg , scoring a first-half hat trick to seal the game in the first 45 minutes .
the three goals put klose at the top of the league 's goalscorers with ten strikes .
klose 's potent partner , croatian international ivan klasnic , found the net two times and midfielder tim borowski scored the sixth goal for the bundesliga 's most powerful offense with 27 goals . emotional draw for schalke bayern munich had been hoping for their first victory in six tries at the arena aufschalke .
the champions ' dream was being fulfilled for 93 minutes .
roque santa cruz put the bavarians on top in the 19th minute thanks to a very questionable no-call by referee michael weiner . bayern then did everything possible in the second-half to let schalke back into the game .
they still almost came away with three points - until the 93rd minute .
weiner , who denied a penalty kick for the hosts earlier , was again in the spotlight and gave a penalty to schalke on a very generous call three minutes after regulation .
danish striker sören larsen snatched the ball away from teammate lincoln , converted and 62,000 schalke supporters erupted in joy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke 's danish sören larsen -lrb- l -rrb- would draw the foul and convert the penalty kick to save a draw for schalke against bayern munich " that was n't a penalty , " was bayern coach felix magath 's clear judgment but he admitted that his side had done little in the second-half to seal the victory .
nevertheless , munich broke a five-game losing streak at schalke .
larsen 's late heroics helped schalke to remain the only bundesliga club without a loss this season , but are still five points behind the leaders . frustrated hamburg lose for first time dutch international rafael van der vaart has been the focal point of hamburg 's rise to second-place in the bundesliga after eight weeks .
coolly , he had scored five times and assisted on six further strikes .
the club of the 70 's was again impressive .
going back to last season , hamburg sv had gone 19 matches without a defeat but that came to an end when wolfsburg beat the hosts 1-0 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaiserslautern 's halil altintop -lrb- l -rrb- leaves dortmund keeper roman weidenfeller without a chance in scoring the equalizer the league 's fans , sometimes forced to suffer through tedious goalless matches , were treated to 26 goals on saturday .
in kaiserslautern , halil altintop and ebi smolarek both scored a hat trick as the hosts came from a two-goal deficit to draw with dortmund .
the supporters of the red devils vented their frustration with their team 's poor league start by remaining outside the stadium the first five minutes of the match and could only be happy that turkish striker altintop , like klose with ten goals to his credit , found the net as successfully as he did for his national squad against germany last weekend . bayer leverkusen hired a new coach this week , michael skibbe .
the move , frequently one that management hopes will shake a squad out of complacency , did n't work .
mainz played a strong second-half to win 3-1 as the crisis for leverkusen continues .
skibbe may have his hands full in turning around the fate of the club . berlin humiliated in bielefeld bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen 's clemens fritz -lrb- l -rrb- tries his best to get around mainz 05 's michael thurk .
thurk would score as mainz won 3-1 one of the league 's presumed title contenders berlin were caught unawares at the schüco arena in bielefeld as the capital city club suffered a deserved 3-0 defeat against one of the league 's " dwarves . "
marcio borges and heiko westermann celebrated their first goals in the bundesliga in a game that berlin coach falko götz said was lost in the first 45 minutes . mönchengladbach had surprisingly zoomed up to sixth-place after a shaky season start .
for 89 minutes , coach horst köppel 's team was poised to improve their position even more but a late own-goal by jeff strasser gave them only a draw at stuttgart .

the supporters of the red devils vented their frustration with their team 's poor league start by remaining outside the stadium the first five minutes of the match and could only be happy that turkish striker altintop , like klose with ten goals to his credit , found the net as successfully as he did for his national squad against germany last weekend . bayer leverkusen hired a new coach this week , michael skibbe .

" we have to see things as they really are .
our year has been anything other than good , " said the german ace who went into the chinese grand prix this weekend in an uncharacteristic third place in the drivers ' standings . schumacher spun out of the final race of the season leaving him in third and giving him no chance of catching kimi raikkonen who finished as runner up to fernando alonso in shanghai and the world championship . " we have never been competitive and never really been in a position to compete for the title , one that has been ours in recent times , " said schumacher . " i am still in third place in the drivers ' standings .
it has never been this bad . " ferrari won 15 of the 18 races last year but have only won once this time around , in the controversial six-car united states grand prix , and schumacher 's best ' real ' result has been a second place finish . as career nears end , speculation remains bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite a rough season , ferarri wants schumacher to keep driving while schumacher , 36 , is clearly heading towards the twilight of his career , he has at least two more seasons left in him , his agent willi webber told the german press this week .
but who the 84-race winner will be driving for when he finally calls it a day is up in the air . there has been talk of him possibly leaving ferrari and ending his career with the mclaren team , although this was quickly quashed by webber .
" let 's put an end to this rumor : i can categorically exclude -lrb- the possibility of -rrb- michael schumacher leaving ferrari for mclaren-mercedes , " he told the stuttgarter nachrichten . the rumor began because schumacher , who won the last five world championships before alonso dethroned him , had rejected a fresh contract from ferrari .
" first of all , michael is doing fine at ferrari and secondly , his image is much more in line with ferrari and their sport cars than mercedes and their luxury cars . " he added : " i ca n't say for definite but it 's likely that 2008 will be his final season . " current ferrari not up to the job bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a different car may help solve schumacher 's problems schumacher then has time to regain his crown , but he was not confident that he could produce his old magic in shanghai in the current ferrari car , a prediction that was proved tamely correct .
" a podium at the end of the season would bewonderful but we have to realize that the chances of obtaining that are not too high , " he said before the race . " in any case , we will be trying our best to end the season in the best of ways . "
unfortunately , the race ended in the same way as his season : in disappointment . ferrari boss jean todt still has every faith in his star driver and believes that by the time the 2006 season gets underway his car , which will be launched early to accelerate the italian giant 's fight back , will be back to its best . " i can ’ t say that we can prepare more thoroughly , but we are attempting to reply to the problems that we ’ ve had this year , " he said . " even if next year 's car won ’ t be in its latest specification for the beginning of the season , considering the introduction of the new v8 , 2.4 liter engine , we have decided to introduce the car as early as possible which is why we will introduce it by mid-january 06 . " third place in constructors ' table tells own story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ferrari 's season is winding down ferrari also finished third in the constructors ' championship , behind renault and mclaren , todt expressed mixed feelings about the season that ended after 19 races on sunday . " we know that formula one is a mechanical sport where to win a race or score a good result you need a good package : reliability , team , chassis , tyres and engine , " he said .
" so our third place in the constructors ’ championship is fairly significant . " having said that , two teams have been more competitive than ferrari-bridgestone so we knew that it ’ s something that could happen one day . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de who 's afraid of michael schumacher ?
the race for the formula 1 crown starts on sunday with the australian grand prix , and michael schumacher is expecting a difficult start .
that should offer fans a change of pace , but can anyone dethrone the german champ ?

the league 's nightmare did n't come true , however .
hamburg defeated their rivals on the seventh match day and after nine games , there is a new leader - werder bremen . the champions from 2003-04 thrashed nuremberg 6-2 and thanks to a munich draw at schalke , and hamburg 's loss to wolfsburg , bremen found themselves at the top of the bundesliga standings ahead of bayern based on a better goal difference . " those are results that we are n't unhappy with , " said bremen coach thomas schaaf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's croatian forward ivan klasnic has eight goals so far this season german international miroslav klose was a one-man wrecking crew against the south germans from nuremberg , scoring a first-half hat trick to seal the game in the first 45 minutes .
the three goals put klose at the top of the league 's goalscorers with ten strikes .
klose 's potent partner , croatian international ivan klasnic , found the net two times and midfielder tim borowski scored the sixth goal for the bundesliga 's most powerful offense with 27 goals . emotional draw for schalke bayern munich had been hoping for their first victory in six tries at the arena aufschalke .
the champions ' dream was being fulfilled for 93 minutes .
roque santa cruz put the bavarians on top in the 19th minute thanks to a very questionable no-call by referee michael weiner . bayern then did everything possible in the second-half to let schalke back into the game .
they still almost came away with three points - until the 93rd minute .
weiner , who denied a penalty kick for the hosts earlier , was again in the spotlight and gave a penalty to schalke on a very generous call three minutes after regulation .
danish striker sören larsen snatched the ball away from teammate lincoln , converted and 62,000 schalke supporters erupted in joy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke 's danish sören larsen -lrb- l -rrb- would draw the foul and convert the penalty kick to save a draw for schalke against bayern munich " that was n't a penalty , " was bayern coach felix magath 's clear judgment but he admitted that his side had done little in the second-half to seal the victory .
nevertheless , munich broke a five-game losing streak at schalke .
larsen 's late heroics helped schalke to remain the only bundesliga club without a loss this season , but are still five points behind the leaders . frustrated hamburg lose for first time dutch international rafael van der vaart has been the focal point of hamburg 's rise to second-place in the bundesliga after eight weeks .
coolly , he had scored five times and assisted on six further strikes .
the club of the 70 's was again impressive .
going back to last season , hamburg sv had gone 19 matches without a defeat but that came to an end when wolfsburg beat the hosts 1-0 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaiserslautern 's halil altintop -lrb- l -rrb- leaves dortmund keeper roman weidenfeller without a chance in scoring the equalizer the league 's fans , sometimes forced to suffer through tedious goalless matches , were treated to 26 goals on saturday .
in kaiserslautern , halil altintop and ebi smolarek both scored a hat trick as the hosts came from a two-goal deficit to draw with dortmund .
the supporters of the red devils vented their frustration with their team 's poor league start by remaining outside the stadium the first five minutes of the match and could only be happy that turkish striker altintop , like klose with ten goals to his credit , found the net as successfully as he did for his national squad against germany last weekend . bayer leverkusen hired a new coach this week , michael skibbe .
the move , frequently one that management hopes will shake a squad out of complacency , did n't work .
mainz played a strong second-half to win 3-1 as the crisis for leverkusen continues .
skibbe may have his hands full in turning around the fate of the club . berlin humiliated in bielefeld bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen 's clemens fritz -lrb- l -rrb- tries his best to get around mainz 05 's michael thurk .
thurk would score as mainz won 3-1 one of the league 's presumed title contenders berlin were caught unawares at the schüco arena in bielefeld as the capital city club suffered a deserved 3-0 defeat against one of the league 's " dwarves . "
marcio borges and heiko westermann celebrated their first goals in the bundesliga in a game that berlin coach falko götz said was lost in the first 45 minutes . mönchengladbach had surprisingly zoomed up to sixth-place after a shaky season start .
for 89 minutes , coach horst köppel 's team was poised to improve their position even more but a late own-goal by jeff strasser gave them only a draw at stuttgart .
despite the defender 's fatal goal , gladbach could move up a place in the standings . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bremen celebrate dramatic win in berlin bremen pulled off a dramatic late-match comeback to knock off berlin .

however , the sad fact is this happens .
hospices help sick children through their last days and make them bearable for patient and family alike . norbert neubauer 's son niklaus suffers from a rare genetic disorder called " mucopolysaccharidosis " or mps .
usually , this condition results in various genetic deformities such as skeletal deformities , mental retardation , and decreased life expectancy .
when norbert 's son was diagnosed 8 years ago , he says , " at that time there was just nowhere to turn , we were in this situation and we felt completely alone . when we did finally did find out about child hospice care … we really had to struggle to get accepted . " the neubauer 's dilemma is unfortunately typical of an already painful and distressing situation .
in germany every year approximately 3,000 parents are given a diagnosis confirming that their child will soon die or have a dramatically shortened life span . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sonnenhoff children 's hospice in berlin such was the reasoning behind a conference that took place in cologne on october 14-15 . the event , called the erste deutsche kinderhospiztage , or " first german child hospice days " was a gathering of child hospice workers , managers and lobbyists that are collectively trying to erase the taboo surrounding death and children and create new services for german families . a unique challenge children living with terminal illnesses provide a unique and particularly difficult challenge for families and healthcare providers .
children are not " little adults " .
and solutions for children living in the shadow of death can not be simply extrapolated from adult hospice programs .
end-of-life care for children must not only manage the physical symptoms of the child , but address social and psychological demands of the whole family . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sleeping room at the " rainbowland " childrens hospice in düsseldorf margret hartkopf , is a board member of the child hospice association of germany , and herself a mother of a terminally ill child . " it 's such a difficult situation , the parents feel guilty that they ca n't heal their child , and the physical and emotional burden of constantly attending to a sick child can be overwhelming for the entire family . " according to hartkopf , hospice care is , " meant to be flexible , the services are there to help the families , provide medical care , counselling and also educate others .
for instance , grandparents , social workers - even teachers have contacted us saying , ' a child in my class has died and i feel helpless … what do i do ? " ' need for inpatient and outpatient services germany currently maintains five stationary child hospice clinics compared to 26 in england , three in canada and one in the united states . the german child hospice movement was launched in 1990 by a group of parents living in the sauerland region .
the first children 's hospice clinic in germany was opened in 1998 in the town of ople .
" at first we had to overcome the enormous stereotype the hospices were ' death houses ' , or that hospices were related only to cancer , " explains dr. franco rest , director of the dietrich-oppenberg hospice academy in essen . bildunterschrift : rainbowland children 's hospice in düsseldorf children 's hospice 's are meant to be small , with a capacity of about 8 children ; more like staying with family and friends rather than a hospital .
according to federal statistics , there are estimated to be some 22,000 children in germany that are in need of hospice care . given this limited capacity the demand for new services and trained staff is enormous . lots of living to do the sad reality about children stricken with debilitating and life-shortening illness is that as other children become more and more independent , they become more dependent .
within this grim calculus the parents are the ones the children turn to . as germany rushes to create more inpatient and outpatient hospice services for children and families , and also grapple with the complex emotions at the core of the issue , it 's extremely important to remember that the point of this care is to help the child live life not prepare for death . " they want to be taken seriously , " explains hartkopf .
" they ask questions and they expect answers . they want friends , they want to laugh and they want to take part in public life .

" i can ’ t say that we can prepare more thoroughly , but we are attempting to reply to the problems that we ’ ve had this year , " he said . " even if next year 's car won ’ t be in its latest specification for the beginning of the season , considering the introduction of the new v8 , 2.4 liter engine , we have decided to introduce the car as early as possible which is why we will introduce it by mid-january 06 .

the conference presented the former junior coalition partner with the opportunity to look back over the last seven years of power-sharing in the government while planning ahead for a future back in opposition . however , a more productive use of the meeting would have been for the party to take a long , hard look at where the green dream went wrong , not only at the last election but in german , and european , politics in general over the past half a decade . at the turn of the century , the greens were not only part of a serving government in germany but in four other european countries .
france , italy , finland and belgium all had parties pushing environmental issues closer to the forefront of policy-making through their green representatives . the news this week that germany would be governed by a grand coalition of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- saw that era finally come to a close as germany 's greens succumbed to the fate that others had suffered as the sunflower started to wilt across europe . the retreat of germany 's greens ends an era bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the greens are left looking for someone to replace fischer the return of the greens to opposition in germany , and the self-imposed exile to the back benches of the party 's most high profile minister joschka fischer , left western european governments without a green representative . having been ejected from government in finland , france , italy , belgium and now germany , the green movement could not be blamed for being disheartened at the apparent failure of an environmental revolution in the corridors of european power . " these are setbacks , clearly , in every case .
greens are not now shaping policy , " said hubert kleinert , once a german green mp now a political scientist , in an interview with the bbc .
" during the last five years there have been more defeats than victories .
and i think this -lrb- german result -rrb- is the biggest one . "
the greens were overtaken by the liberal free democrats and the new left , even though their share of the vote fell only about 0.5 percent . former euro green chief says no need to panic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european parliamentarian juan behrend co-secretary general of the greens juan behrend , the former secretary general of the green federation in the european parliament who once saw the rise of the greens as " a luminous sunflower was hanging in the grey sky , " refused to be downcast by the german result . he admitted that the election result had been a " blow " but was adamant that the policies behind the greens would survive .
coming back to opposition would be " an opportunity " adding that the greens were specialists at making opposition politics and would be able to " articulate a very coherent green policy . " all is far from lost .
there may be shoots of re-growth for the green movement in other areas of europe .
the greens play a role in romano prodi 's left-wing alliance in italy , a partnership which looks set to challenge hard in the elections next year , while in france the greens are expected to be part of the left-wing bloc competing in the 2007 campaign . solid policies , awareness the green lagacy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even without the greens in power , renewable energy research will continue however , the fact remains that there is no current green representation in the big western europe governments and as a result there will be no green ministers at cabinet tables or eu ministerial meetings .
who will be the force of environmental change without the greens in power ?
will all that the movement , specifically in germany , achieved be undone ? political analysts believe that it is unlikely that the shutting down of nuclear energy plants and the huge increase in the use of renewable energy in germany will be reversed without the green party , who instigated these policies , in power . on the one hand , these ideas are now entrenched in the political mainstream and on the other , the european electorate realizes the importance of environmental protection , and they will not allow any political party to neglect that in its policy making . the green party 's sunflower may have wilted but there seems to be enough of a reservoir of belief and support around to keep it alive .
and who knows , the shoots of recovery may start to appear again in time . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany sheds the spirit of ' 68 with the country turning away from the red-green government and poised for a new political departure , dw-world spoke to green party politician hans-christian ströbele about the legacy of the late ' 60s .

the scenario will be played out by year 's end . the world health organization immediately voiced concern at the romanian outbreak and admitted that the risk of bird-to-human transfer had increased .
" the presence of this virus in romania worries us , because it proves that it is in the birds ' environment , and that increases the possibility of transmission to humans , " said a spokesman in geneva . but it has kept its pandemic alert at phase three - the middle of its scale - as " a virus new to humans is causing infections , but does not spread easily from one person to another . " virus on the doorstep bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poultry are being destroyed or quarantined the eu banned imports of birds and poultry products from romania and turkey last week after the presence of bird flu was confirmed .
it was thought to have arrived via migratory birds from further east . but on saturday the scientists confirmed fears that the highly pathogenic asian strain had been found in three ducks found dead in the danube delta , on romania 's black sea coast . " the virus taken from -lrb- the village of -rrb- ceamurlia de jos is indeed the h5n1 , " romanian farm minister gheorghe flutur said .
" we are discussing what measures are needed to strengthen the protection zone around the source . " some good news surfaced on sunday , when he announced that a number of swans which had died in the delta did not have the virus , and turkish officials ruled out a second possible case there . killer h5n1 strain heads to europe from asia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bird influenza virus strain h5n1 , seen in gold .
while avian influenza primarily affects birds , the h5n1 strain has killed more than 60 people in southeast asia since 2003 - around half those who have contracted it .
the big fear is that h5n1 may mutate , acquiring genes from the human flu virus that would make it highly infectious as well as lethal - possibly killing millions worldwide as the influenza pandemic of 1918 did . citing such precedents , britain 's chief medical officer said on sunday that bird flu would inevitably combine with a human variety and cause a pandemic that would kill around 50,000 people in his country alone . " the significance of it is n't that there will be a pandemic of bird flu itself , the significance of it is that at some point , and we go by the lessons of history , the bird flu virus will combine with a human flu virus and then it will become easily transmissible , " liam donaldson told bbc television .
he noted that common winter flu kills more than 12,000 britons each year . massive research activity offers hope countries from germany to vietnam to the united states are busy looking for a remedy .
hungary expects to know within two weeks whether human trials of its vaccine have been successful . the european commission , meanwhile , has urged member states to stockpile anti-viral drugs , and says people at risk should ensure they are vaccinated against regular flu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the race is on to prevent a european outbreak of bird flu eu veterinary experts have also demanded immediate action to prevent migratory birds which could carry the virus from coming into contact with poultry , including moving farmed birds indoors . public told not to panic while they are keen not to spark panic , official calls for calm have not prevented a rush for anti-viral drugs and stocks in some countries are reported to be running short . fueling further concern , a study released friday said researchers had identified a mutated form of h5n1 bird flu that is resistant to tamiflu , the drug being stockpiled around the world to counter a feared pandemic . european commission head jose manuel barroso said at the weekend that the eu was ready to take " more drastic and radical measures " if necessary , depending on how the situation evolves . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deadly bird flu strain confirmed in europe hopes that the deadly h5n1 strain of avian flu had not yet reached mainland europe were dashed saturday after samples from romanian ducks proved positive .

fearing bird flu , germans stockpile meds europe -pipe- 16.10.2005 eu leaders to hold bird flu crisis talks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drastic culling continues as europe fights the threat of contagion the growing threat of lethal bird flu spreading across europe will top the agendas of eu leaders this week , after the deadly asian strain of the virus landed on the continent for the first time . scientists and the european union 's political chiefs are trying to ease public concern after the h5n1 virus was confirmed in romania at the weekend , only two days after its presence was identified in turkey . eu foreign ministers will discuss the outbreak at emergency talks in luxembourg on tuesday , while the bird flu scare will dominate the agenda of a meeting of health ministers later in the week . on wednesday , health commissioner markos kyprianou will present a pandemic simulation exercise aimed at testing the preparedness of the bloc 's 25 members for such an outbreak .
the scenario will be played out by year 's end . the world health organization immediately voiced concern at the romanian outbreak and admitted that the risk of bird-to-human transfer had increased .
" the presence of this virus in romania worries us , because it proves that it is in the birds ' environment , and that increases the possibility of transmission to humans , " said a spokesman in geneva . but it has kept its pandemic alert at phase three - the middle of its scale - as " a virus new to humans is causing infections , but does not spread easily from one person to another . " virus on the doorstep bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poultry are being destroyed or quarantined the eu banned imports of birds and poultry products from romania and turkey last week after the presence of bird flu was confirmed .
it was thought to have arrived via migratory birds from further east . but on saturday the scientists confirmed fears that the highly pathogenic asian strain had been found in three ducks found dead in the danube delta , on romania 's black sea coast . " the virus taken from -lrb- the village of -rrb- ceamurlia de jos is indeed the h5n1 , " romanian farm minister gheorghe flutur said .
" we are discussing what measures are needed to strengthen the protection zone around the source . " some good news surfaced on sunday , when he announced that a number of swans which had died in the delta did not have the virus , and turkish officials ruled out a second possible case there . killer h5n1 strain heads to europe from asia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bird influenza virus strain h5n1 , seen in gold .
while avian influenza primarily affects birds , the h5n1 strain has killed more than 60 people in southeast asia since 2003 - around half those who have contracted it .
the big fear is that h5n1 may mutate , acquiring genes from the human flu virus that would make it highly infectious as well as lethal - possibly killing millions worldwide as the influenza pandemic of 1918 did . citing such precedents , britain 's chief medical officer said on sunday that bird flu would inevitably combine with a human variety and cause a pandemic that would kill around 50,000 people in his country alone . " the significance of it is n't that there will be a pandemic of bird flu itself , the significance of it is that at some point , and we go by the lessons of history , the bird flu virus will combine with a human flu virus and then it will become easily transmissible , " liam donaldson told bbc television .
he noted that common winter flu kills more than 12,000 britons each year . massive research activity offers hope countries from germany to vietnam to the united states are busy looking for a remedy .
hungary expects to know within two weeks whether human trials of its vaccine have been successful . the european commission , meanwhile , has urged member states to stockpile anti-viral drugs , and says people at risk should ensure they are vaccinated against regular flu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the race is on to prevent a european outbreak of bird flu eu veterinary experts have also demanded immediate action to prevent migratory birds which could carry the virus from coming into contact with poultry , including moving farmed birds indoors . public told not to panic while they are keen not to spark panic , official calls for calm have not prevented a rush for anti-viral drugs and stocks in some countries are reported to be running short . fueling further concern , a study released friday said researchers had identified a mutated form of h5n1 bird flu that is resistant to tamiflu , the drug being stockpiled around the world to counter a feared pandemic . european commission head jose manuel barroso said at the weekend that the eu was ready to take " more drastic and radical measures " if necessary , depending on how the situation evolves . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deadly bird flu strain confirmed in europe hopes that the deadly h5n1 strain of avian flu had not yet reached mainland europe were dashed saturday after samples from romanian ducks proved positive .
this follows a similar confirmation in turkey on friday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 16.10.2005 addicted to medication großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : time to turn over a new leaf that germany is home to high levels of alcoholism and tobacco addiction is a well-established , if unhappy fact .
what is less known is the fact that abuse of prescribed medication is also widespread . the german head office for dependency matters , the dhs , estimates that between 1.4 and 1.9 million people in germany are dependent on prescribed drugs , considerably more than the numbers of those addicted to cannabis , cocaine , heroin or other illegal substances .
in short , levels of addiction to legal medication are topped only by a dependency on alcohol and tobacco .
but while those addictions are often discussed in the media , there is relatively little public discussion about addiction to legal substances . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : addiction to medication , a women 's thing ?
the most abused medication are the benzodiazepines , such as valium , which are often used as tranquilizers and sleeping pills , primarily by women .
according to bruno müller-oerlinghausen , a doctor with the drug commission of the german medical association , that fact could be attributed to the physical changes which women undergo during the menopause , and to the reality that women are more prone to depression than men and less likely to use alcohol when the going gets tough . the fact that problems with abuse of this medication are more frequent among females has not helped to bring it to light . " unfortunately it has long been considered a women 's issue and has been neglected , " said karin mohn of the dhs . she said she hopes that a number of new measures , including increasing public awareness and improving early recognition and intervention methods , will help to reverse the trend . prevention is better than a cure johannes lindenmeyer , a psychologist who specializes in addiction , says it is quite clearly a case of prevention being better than a cure , but adds that both doctors and patients need to change their thinking in order for the problem to be addressed in a serious way . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : therapy offers prevention " people need psychotherapy instead of medication , but doctors do n't get paid much for just talking about problems and patients generally prefer to go home with a prescription in their hands , " he said .
" so the doctors give medication instead of analyzing their psychological needs and assessing how their patients could benefit from such things as behavioral therapy . " in the case of insomnia for example , lindenmeyer explains that sufferers have to learn how to get rid of the problem rather than chemically suppressing it , not least because such relief is only temporary . " unlike alcohol , people take addictive medicines because they have a complaint , " he said .
" they take it and it makes them feel better , but once that sensation has worn off , the original complaint comes back more acutely . " for example , the insomniac taking medication to induce sleep will build up a tolerance over time and have to increase the dosage over time to achieve the same effect .
a psychological dependency on the drug can easily take root . the route to dependency with some medications is incredibly fast , with users becoming addicted after just weeks of regular use .
once the addiction to medication has taken hold , it is much harder to break the cycle than with alcohol , according to lindenmeyer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drug addiction claims less victims than medication dependency " people find it harder to believe that they have an addiction problem , because they have been prescribed their medication by doctors , " he said . " by the same token , we do n't have any clinics which deal specifically with medication addiction , they are put together with other addicts and feel misunderstood .
all this means that the success rate of programs to break medication addiction is about ten percent lower than anti-alcoholism schemes . " stricter controls necessary ? if the estimates of 1.4 to 1.9 million addicts are accurate , and if it is so hard to cure them once they have fallen prey to legal pharmaceuticals , should there be tighter controls on what doctors can and do prescribe ?
müller-oerlinghausen does not think so .
he believes the path away from the addictive trend is to continue training doctors and informing the public about the dangers of tranquilizers . " over the past 10-20 years , german doctors have learnt how to use these substances in a restrictive way in order to prevent addiction , " he said .
" there are clear guidelines and the annual report on prescribed medicines proves that the number of tranquilizers being handed out by doctors gets smaller every year . " nonetheless , mohn of the dhs says there has not been much change in the estimated number of patients addicted to medication over the past few years and that the consumption of legal drugs remains a cause for concern . " some patients alternately pick up prescriptions from several different doctors , " she said . and with germany 's strict data protection laws , it is difficult to trace such strategy . " controlling patients 100 percent just is n't possible , " müller-oerlinghausen said . tamsin walker , dw-world .

once the addiction to medication has taken hold , it is much harder to break the cycle than with alcohol , according to lindenmeyer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drug addiction claims less victims than medication dependency " people find it harder to believe that they have an addiction problem , because they have been prescribed their medication by doctors , " he said . " by the same token , we do n't have any clinics which deal specifically with medication addiction , they are put together with other addicts and feel misunderstood .
all this means that the success rate of programs to break medication addiction is about ten percent lower than anti-alcoholism schemes . " stricter controls necessary ? if the estimates of 1.4 to 1.9 million addicts are accurate , and if it is so hard to cure them once they have fallen prey to legal pharmaceuticals , should there be tighter controls on what doctors can and do prescribe ?
müller-oerlinghausen does not think so .
he believes the path away from the addictive trend is to continue training doctors and informing the public about the dangers of tranquilizers . " over the past 10-20 years , german doctors have learnt how to use these substances in a restrictive way in order to prevent addiction , " he said .
" there are clear guidelines and the annual report on prescribed medicines proves that the number of tranquilizers being handed out by doctors gets smaller every year . " nonetheless , mohn of the dhs says there has not been much change in the estimated number of patients addicted to medication over the past few years and that the consumption of legal drugs remains a cause for concern . " some patients alternately pick up prescriptions from several different doctors , " she said . and with germany 's strict data protection laws , it is difficult to trace such strategy . " controlling patients 100 percent just is n't possible , " müller-oerlinghausen said . tamsin walker , dw-world .

the league 's nightmare did n't come true , however .
hamburg defeated their rivals on the seventh match day and after nine games , there is a new leader - werder bremen . the champions from 2003-04 thrashed nuremberg 6-2 and thanks to a munich draw at schalke , and hamburg 's loss to wolfsburg , bremen found themselves at the top of the bundesliga standings ahead of bayern based on a better goal difference . " those are results that we are n't unhappy with , " said bremen coach thomas schaaf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's croatian forward ivan klasnic has eight goals so far this season german international miroslav klose was a one-man wrecking crew against the south germans from nuremberg , scoring a first-half hat trick to seal the game in the first 45 minutes .
the three goals put klose at the top of the league 's goalscorers with ten strikes .
klose 's potent partner , croatian international ivan klasnic , found the net two times and midfielder tim borowski scored the sixth goal for the bundesliga 's most powerful offense with 27 goals . emotional draw for schalke bayern munich had been hoping for their first victory in six tries at the arena aufschalke .
the champions ' dream was being fulfilled for 93 minutes .
roque santa cruz put the bavarians on top in the 19th minute thanks to a very questionable no-call by referee michael weiner . bayern then did everything possible in the second-half to let schalke back into the game .
they still almost came away with three points - until the 93rd minute .
weiner , who denied a penalty kick for the hosts earlier , was again in the spotlight and gave a penalty to schalke on a very generous call three minutes after regulation .
danish striker sören larsen snatched the ball away from teammate lincoln , converted and 62,000 schalke supporters erupted in joy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke 's danish sören larsen -lrb- l -rrb- would draw the foul and convert the penalty kick to save a draw for schalke against bayern munich " that was n't a penalty , " was bayern coach felix magath 's clear judgment but he admitted that his side had done little in the second-half to seal the victory .
nevertheless , munich broke a five-game losing streak at schalke .
larsen 's late heroics helped schalke to remain the only bundesliga club without a loss this season , but are still five points behind the leaders . frustrated hamburg lose for first time dutch international rafael van der vaart has been the focal point of hamburg 's rise to second-place in the bundesliga after eight weeks .
coolly , he had scored five times and assisted on six further strikes .
the club of the 70 's was again impressive .
going back to last season , hamburg sv had gone 19 matches without a defeat but that came to an end when wolfsburg beat the hosts 1-0 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaiserslautern 's halil altintop -lrb- l -rrb- leaves dortmund keeper roman weidenfeller without a chance in scoring the equalizer the league 's fans , sometimes forced to suffer through tedious goalless matches , were treated to 26 goals on saturday .
in kaiserslautern , halil altintop and ebi smolarek both scored a hat trick as the hosts came from a two-goal deficit to draw with dortmund .
the supporters of the red devils vented their frustration with their team 's poor league start by remaining outside the stadium the first five minutes of the match and could only be happy that turkish striker altintop , like klose with ten goals to his credit , found the net as successfully as he did for his national squad against germany last weekend . bayer leverkusen hired a new coach this week , michael skibbe .
the move , frequently one that management hopes will shake a squad out of complacency , did n't work .
mainz played a strong second-half to win 3-1 as the crisis for leverkusen continues .
skibbe may have his hands full in turning around the fate of the club . berlin humiliated in bielefeld bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen 's clemens fritz -lrb- l -rrb- tries his best to get around mainz 05 's michael thurk .
thurk would score as mainz won 3-1 one of the league 's presumed title contenders berlin were caught unawares at the schüco arena in bielefeld as the capital city club suffered a deserved 3-0 defeat against one of the league 's " dwarves . "
marcio borges and heiko westermann celebrated their first goals in the bundesliga in a game that berlin coach falko götz said was lost in the first 45 minutes . mönchengladbach had surprisingly zoomed up to sixth-place after a shaky season start .
for 89 minutes , coach horst köppel 's team was poised to improve their position even more but a late own-goal by jeff strasser gave them only a draw at stuttgart .
despite the defender 's fatal goal , gladbach could move up a place in the standings . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bremen celebrate dramatic win in berlin bremen pulled off a dramatic late-match comeback to knock off berlin .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 16.10.2005 europe 's green dream wilts but wo n't die großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sun has set on the european green movement 's days in power greens in europe lost power when the german party returned to the opposition , but parties elsewhere offer hope . germany 's green party held a one day conference in the city of oldenburg on saturday .
the conference presented the former junior coalition partner with the opportunity to look back over the last seven years of power-sharing in the government while planning ahead for a future back in opposition . however , a more productive use of the meeting would have been for the party to take a long , hard look at where the green dream went wrong , not only at the last election but in german , and european , politics in general over the past half a decade . at the turn of the century , the greens were not only part of a serving government in germany but in four other european countries .
france , italy , finland and belgium all had parties pushing environmental issues closer to the forefront of policy-making through their green representatives . the news this week that germany would be governed by a grand coalition of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- saw that era finally come to a close as germany 's greens succumbed to the fate that others had suffered as the sunflower started to wilt across europe . the retreat of germany 's greens ends an era bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the greens are left looking for someone to replace fischer the return of the greens to opposition in germany , and the self-imposed exile to the back benches of the party 's most high profile minister joschka fischer , left western european governments without a green representative . having been ejected from government in finland , france , italy , belgium and now germany , the green movement could not be blamed for being disheartened at the apparent failure of an environmental revolution in the corridors of european power . " these are setbacks , clearly , in every case .
greens are not now shaping policy , " said hubert kleinert , once a german green mp now a political scientist , in an interview with the bbc .
" during the last five years there have been more defeats than victories .
and i think this -lrb- german result -rrb- is the biggest one . "
the greens were overtaken by the liberal free democrats and the new left , even though their share of the vote fell only about 0.5 percent . former euro green chief says no need to panic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european parliamentarian juan behrend co-secretary general of the greens juan behrend , the former secretary general of the green federation in the european parliament who once saw the rise of the greens as " a luminous sunflower was hanging in the grey sky , " refused to be downcast by the german result . he admitted that the election result had been a " blow " but was adamant that the policies behind the greens would survive .
coming back to opposition would be " an opportunity " adding that the greens were specialists at making opposition politics and would be able to " articulate a very coherent green policy . " all is far from lost .
there may be shoots of re-growth for the green movement in other areas of europe .
the greens play a role in romano prodi 's left-wing alliance in italy , a partnership which looks set to challenge hard in the elections next year , while in france the greens are expected to be part of the left-wing bloc competing in the 2007 campaign . solid policies , awareness the green lagacy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even without the greens in power , renewable energy research will continue however , the fact remains that there is no current green representation in the big western europe governments and as a result there will be no green ministers at cabinet tables or eu ministerial meetings .
who will be the force of environmental change without the greens in power ?
will all that the movement , specifically in germany , achieved be undone ? political analysts believe that it is unlikely that the shutting down of nuclear energy plants and the huge increase in the use of renewable energy in germany will be reversed without the green party , who instigated these policies , in power . on the one hand , these ideas are now entrenched in the political mainstream and on the other , the european electorate realizes the importance of environmental protection , and they will not allow any political party to neglect that in its policy making . the green party 's sunflower may have wilted but there seems to be enough of a reservoir of belief and support around to keep it alive .

the league 's nightmare did n't come true , however .
hamburg defeated their rivals on the seventh match day and after nine games , there is a new leader - werder bremen . the champions from 2003-04 thrashed nuremberg 6-2 and thanks to a munich draw at schalke , and hamburg 's loss to wolfsburg , bremen found themselves at the top of the bundesliga standings ahead of bayern based on a better goal difference . " those are results that we are n't unhappy with , " said bremen coach thomas schaaf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's croatian forward ivan klasnic has eight goals so far this season german international miroslav klose was a one-man wrecking crew against the south germans from nuremberg , scoring a first-half hat trick to seal the game in the first 45 minutes .
the three goals put klose at the top of the league 's goalscorers with ten strikes .
klose 's potent partner , croatian international ivan klasnic , found the net two times and midfielder tim borowski scored the sixth goal for the bundesliga 's most powerful offense with 27 goals . emotional draw for schalke bayern munich had been hoping for their first victory in six tries at the arena aufschalke .
the champions ' dream was being fulfilled for 93 minutes .
roque santa cruz put the bavarians on top in the 19th minute thanks to a very questionable no-call by referee michael weiner . bayern then did everything possible in the second-half to let schalke back into the game .
they still almost came away with three points - until the 93rd minute .
weiner , who denied a penalty kick for the hosts earlier , was again in the spotlight and gave a penalty to schalke on a very generous call three minutes after regulation .

what is less known is the fact that abuse of prescribed medication is also widespread . the german head office for dependency matters , the dhs , estimates that between 1.4 and 1.9 million people in germany are dependent on prescribed drugs , considerably more than the numbers of those addicted to cannabis , cocaine , heroin or other illegal substances .
in short , levels of addiction to legal medication are topped only by a dependency on alcohol and tobacco .
but while those addictions are often discussed in the media , there is relatively little public discussion about addiction to legal substances . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : addiction to medication , a women 's thing ?
the most abused medication are the benzodiazepines , such as valium , which are often used as tranquilizers and sleeping pills , primarily by women .
according to bruno müller-oerlinghausen , a doctor with the drug commission of the german medical association , that fact could be attributed to the physical changes which women undergo during the menopause , and to the reality that women are more prone to depression than men and less likely to use alcohol when the going gets tough . the fact that problems with abuse of this medication are more frequent among females has not helped to bring it to light . " unfortunately it has long been considered a women 's issue and has been neglected , " said karin mohn of the dhs . she said she hopes that a number of new measures , including increasing public awareness and improving early recognition and intervention methods , will help to reverse the trend . prevention is better than a cure johannes lindenmeyer , a psychologist who specializes in addiction , says it is quite clearly a case of prevention being better than a cure , but adds that both doctors and patients need to change their thinking in order for the problem to be addressed in a serious way . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : therapy offers prevention " people need psychotherapy instead of medication , but doctors do n't get paid much for just talking about problems and patients generally prefer to go home with a prescription in their hands , " he said .
" so the doctors give medication instead of analyzing their psychological needs and assessing how their patients could benefit from such things as behavioral therapy . " in the case of insomnia for example , lindenmeyer explains that sufferers have to learn how to get rid of the problem rather than chemically suppressing it , not least because such relief is only temporary . " unlike alcohol , people take addictive medicines because they have a complaint , " he said .
" they take it and it makes them feel better , but once that sensation has worn off , the original complaint comes back more acutely . " for example , the insomniac taking medication to induce sleep will build up a tolerance over time and have to increase the dosage over time to achieve the same effect .
a psychological dependency on the drug can easily take root . the route to dependency with some medications is incredibly fast , with users becoming addicted after just weeks of regular use .
once the addiction to medication has taken hold , it is much harder to break the cycle than with alcohol , according to lindenmeyer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drug addiction claims less victims than medication dependency " people find it harder to believe that they have an addiction problem , because they have been prescribed their medication by doctors , " he said . " by the same token , we do n't have any clinics which deal specifically with medication addiction , they are put together with other addicts and feel misunderstood .
all this means that the success rate of programs to break medication addiction is about ten percent lower than anti-alcoholism schemes . " stricter controls necessary ? if the estimates of 1.4 to 1.9 million addicts are accurate , and if it is so hard to cure them once they have fallen prey to legal pharmaceuticals , should there be tighter controls on what doctors can and do prescribe ?
müller-oerlinghausen does not think so .
he believes the path away from the addictive trend is to continue training doctors and informing the public about the dangers of tranquilizers . " over the past 10-20 years , german doctors have learnt how to use these substances in a restrictive way in order to prevent addiction , " he said .
" there are clear guidelines and the annual report on prescribed medicines proves that the number of tranquilizers being handed out by doctors gets smaller every year . " nonetheless , mohn of the dhs says there has not been much change in the estimated number of patients addicted to medication over the past few years and that the consumption of legal drugs remains a cause for concern . " some patients alternately pick up prescriptions from several different doctors , " she said . and with germany 's strict data protection laws , it is difficult to trace such strategy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 16.10.2005 fooling around on the farm großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and they 're off in search of love a new reality tv show launched by private network rtl has got farmers up in arms .
it charts the efforts of a hapless group of ruddy-cheeked swains to find a wife , and farmers ' associations say it 's offensive . perhaps taking a cue from paris hilton 's hugely successful " the simple life " now airing on german television , producers have woken up to the dramatic potential of life on the farm . " farmer seeks wife , " the latest reality show to grace the nation 's screens , follows the romantic shenanigans of seven single farmers desperately seeking love . patronizing but farmers ' associations are outraged and have called the show " demeaning " and " misleading . " their first objection is what they describe as the show 's inaccurate portrayal of rustic rough and tumble . " i 'm not saying that 's not what it 's like , " michael lohse from the farmers ' association told spiegel online .
but generally , he insisted , most farmyards look pretty different to rtl 's vision of fields of golden wheat , romantic moonlight horse-and-cart rides , village fairs and strapping young hillbillies . poetic licence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the seven likely lads the show also claims that 70 percent of farmers are single .
not true , insists lohse .
" according to our statistics , the figure is more like 30 percent , which is perfectly normal . " the protagonists are hardly a cross-section of germany 's farmers , either .

what is less known is the fact that abuse of prescribed medication is also widespread . the german head office for dependency matters , the dhs , estimates that between 1.4 and 1.9 million people in germany are dependent on prescribed drugs , considerably more than the numbers of those addicted to cannabis , cocaine , heroin or other illegal substances .
in short , levels of addiction to legal medication are topped only by a dependency on alcohol and tobacco .
but while those addictions are often discussed in the media , there is relatively little public discussion about addiction to legal substances . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : addiction to medication , a women 's thing ?
the most abused medication are the benzodiazepines , such as valium , which are often used as tranquilizers and sleeping pills , primarily by women .
according to bruno müller-oerlinghausen , a doctor with the drug commission of the german medical association , that fact could be attributed to the physical changes which women undergo during the menopause , and to the reality that women are more prone to depression than men and less likely to use alcohol when the going gets tough . the fact that problems with abuse of this medication are more frequent among females has not helped to bring it to light . " unfortunately it has long been considered a women 's issue and has been neglected , " said karin mohn of the dhs . she said she hopes that a number of new measures , including increasing public awareness and improving early recognition and intervention methods , will help to reverse the trend . prevention is better than a cure johannes lindenmeyer , a psychologist who specializes in addiction , says it is quite clearly a case of prevention being better than a cure , but adds that both doctors and patients need to change their thinking in order for the problem to be addressed in a serious way . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : therapy offers prevention " people need psychotherapy instead of medication , but doctors do n't get paid much for just talking about problems and patients generally prefer to go home with a prescription in their hands , " he said .
" so the doctors give medication instead of analyzing their psychological needs and assessing how their patients could benefit from such things as behavioral therapy . " in the case of insomnia for example , lindenmeyer explains that sufferers have to learn how to get rid of the problem rather than chemically suppressing it , not least because such relief is only temporary . " unlike alcohol , people take addictive medicines because they have a complaint , " he said .
" they take it and it makes them feel better , but once that sensation has worn off , the original complaint comes back more acutely . " for example , the insomniac taking medication to induce sleep will build up a tolerance over time and have to increase the dosage over time to achieve the same effect .
a psychological dependency on the drug can easily take root . the route to dependency with some medications is incredibly fast , with users becoming addicted after just weeks of regular use .
once the addiction to medication has taken hold , it is much harder to break the cycle than with alcohol , according to lindenmeyer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drug addiction claims less victims than medication dependency " people find it harder to believe that they have an addiction problem , because they have been prescribed their medication by doctors , " he said . " by the same token , we do n't have any clinics which deal specifically with medication addiction , they are put together with other addicts and feel misunderstood .
all this means that the success rate of programs to break medication addiction is about ten percent lower than anti-alcoholism schemes . " stricter controls necessary ? if the estimates of 1.4 to 1.9 million addicts are accurate , and if it is so hard to cure them once they have fallen prey to legal pharmaceuticals , should there be tighter controls on what doctors can and do prescribe ?
müller-oerlinghausen does not think so .
he believes the path away from the addictive trend is to continue training doctors and informing the public about the dangers of tranquilizers . " over the past 10-20 years , german doctors have learnt how to use these substances in a restrictive way in order to prevent addiction , " he said .
" there are clear guidelines and the annual report on prescribed medicines proves that the number of tranquilizers being handed out by doctors gets smaller every year . " nonetheless , mohn of the dhs says there has not been much change in the estimated number of patients addicted to medication over the past few years and that the consumption of legal drugs remains a cause for concern . " some patients alternately pick up prescriptions from several different doctors , " she said . and with germany 's strict data protection laws , it is difficult to trace such strategy .

it charts the efforts of a hapless group of ruddy-cheeked swains to find a wife , and farmers ' associations say it 's offensive . perhaps taking a cue from paris hilton 's hugely successful " the simple life " now airing on german television , producers have woken up to the dramatic potential of life on the farm . " farmer seeks wife , " the latest reality show to grace the nation 's screens , follows the romantic shenanigans of seven single farmers desperately seeking love . patronizing but farmers ' associations are outraged and have called the show " demeaning " and " misleading . " their first objection is what they describe as the show 's inaccurate portrayal of rustic rough and tumble . " i 'm not saying that 's not what it 's like , " michael lohse from the farmers ' association told spiegel online .
but generally , he insisted , most farmyards look pretty different to rtl 's vision of fields of golden wheat , romantic moonlight horse-and-cart rides , village fairs and strapping young hillbillies . poetic licence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the seven likely lads the show also claims that 70 percent of farmers are single .
not true , insists lohse .
" according to our statistics , the figure is more like 30 percent , which is perfectly normal . " the protagonists are hardly a cross-section of germany 's farmers , either .
from the dashing organic farmer karl to shy stephan the pig farmer and herbert the hobby astrologist , the candidates allegedly make farmers look less like capable professionals and more like village idiots .
one of them asks his mother to choose his bride-to-be for him , while another proudly reveals he has n't left his farmyard in 28 years . " these are extreme cases , " said lohse .
" they do n't reflect reality . " viewers obviously do n't mind the fanciful take on rural life .

wayne cater was asked to master one of shakespeare 's most challenging roles in both languages in a wales theatre company production .
now a colleague has taken on the welsh version , and the company has delayed the first shows in swansea to saturday .
director michael bogdanov said cater had battled fantastically , but it was always going to be a big challenge .
' to be or not to be ' ...
in english and welsh to be or not to be , that is the question / whether ' tis nobler in the mind to suffer / the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune ?

the company had planned to put on preview performances from 19 october at swansea 's grand theatre , but the first night has been put back to 22 october to allow more rehearsal time .
the welsh translation has been done by playwright gareth miles , and the cast had just five weeks to crack both versions .
cater said : " it was going to be difficult but the challenge was offered up to me and i took it .
" unfortunately it did n't quite work out that way . "
he discussed the problem with bogdanov , and they decided that gareth bale should become the welsh-language hamlet , with cater taking on his colleague 's lesser role .
" i 'm not going to feel like i 've been kicked out of one of the plays - i 'm still part of the company and i 'm very glad about that and i 'm going to enjoy experiencing gareth 's hamlet on stage in the welsh one . "
cater said he was happier now that he had the breathing space to do the english hamlet justice .
bogdanov , a co-founder of the english shakespeare company and an olivier award winner , said : " if you do n't risk something you never gain something " .
he said he had watched cater " battle " with hamlet , but the role had proved too much for many actors in one language alone . "
the challenge was offered up to me and i took it ... unfortunately it did n't quite work out " wayne cater bogdanov recalled how oscar-winner daniel day-lewis had walked off stage at the national theatre while playing hamlet and then disappeared for months .
" so not being able to get two hamlets under your belt in five weeks ' rehearsal is no disgrace , " said bogdanov .
" i think the problem that none of us really took on board is that welsh and english are so different as languages that when you try to learn it in both of them the sense of the english is there in welsh , but of course gareth miles has come up with a completely different script , so the thoughts are going off to the sides .
" so the difficulty of learning it in both languages is compounded . "
bale said the welsh version had been very difficult to learn .
" i 'm trying to get my head around it now , so i 'm not sure how much acting i 'll be able to do .
" i think it will be a case of learning the lines and not falling over the furniture . "
hamlet will be at the grand theatre , swansea from 22-29 oct ; new theatre , cardiff 2-12 nov ; torch theatre , milford haven 14-16 nov ; theatre brycheiniog , brecon 17-19 nov , and north wales theatre , llandudno 21-24 nov .

the charity says the stringent conditions applied to those who pose the greatest concern should also be applied to all " medium risk " offenders .
the nspcc also wants more funds for the police and probation service to monitor sex offenders in england and wales .
the home office said sex offenders were " tightly managed " and resources were focused on public safety .
the call from the nspcc comes as ministers prepare to reveal the number of sex offenders under surveillance in the community . "
there is a high risk they could be deteriorating in their behaviour , they could be beginning to track potential victims " wes kewell nspcc wes kewell , the director of services for children at the charity , told bbc radio five live : " if you 're a medium risk offender you 'll be expected to report from time to time , but otherwise , basically , you will be left to get on with it , with severe warnings about your conduct .
" and what it really means is there is a high risk they could be deteriorating in their behaviour , they could be beginning to track potential victims . "
covert surveillance currently high-risk sex offenders in england and wales are monitored by police and probation officers under arrangements known as multi-agency public protection arrangements -lrb- mappas -rrb- .
they are subjected to strict licence conditions on release from prison , and can be sent back to jail if they fail to co-operate .
they can even face covert surveillance by detectives .
the nspcc wants to see mappas given more resources so these stringent conditions can be extended to all medium-risk sex offenders .
the charity says the probation service in particular is understaffed and under-resourced .
public safety a spokeswoman for the home office said all sex offenders , at all levels of risk , were tightly managed .
she added : " the probation service takes seriously the management of all sex offenders under its supervision .
" through mappas , violent and sexual offenders are being identified and better managed than ever before . "
the sex offender register meant the police were kept informed of their whereabouts , she said .
" the probation service , working closely with the police and prison service , aims to ensure that resources are focused where they can have the biggest impact on public safety . "
re-offending rates the assistant general secretary of probation union napo , harry fletcher , said he estimated the nspcc 's demands would involve the monitoring of an extra 20,000 offenders , at a cost of about £ 25m . "
an expansion such as this would need to be properly funded to reflect what could be a tripled workload " harry fletcher probation union napo " the mappas are an excellent way of protecting the public and evidence shows they work well , " he said .
" but the constant complaint from staff is that they are under-resourced , and an expansion such as this would need to be properly funded to reflect what could be a tripled workload . "
the nspcc has also called upon the government to publish an annual report on the monitoring and supervision of child sex offenders across the country .
it would include statistics on the re-offending rates of all violent , sex and other dangerous offenders .
last year , a report by mappas showed there were 24,572 on the sex offender register in england and wales compared with 21,413 a year earlier .

the helicopters have been called " angels " by villagers what went unnoticed was the tireless effort made by a handful of nameless and faceless people that eventually set the ground rules for what is shaping up into one of the largest relief and rescue operations since the asian tsunami .
these men are the helicopter pilots of pakistan 's armed forces - perhaps the only people who have delivered more than was expected of them .
while those in cities and towns - helped mostly by road transport - have perhaps not even noticed their presence beyond the deafening hum of the rotors on their flying machines , villagers call them angels .
" if it had n't been for these helicopters , about 600 people in my village who survived would surely have died , " says abdul ghafoor , a resident of chikothi .
chikothi is a border town 62 kilometres northeast of muzaffarabad .
the road is so badly damaged that its restoration would perhaps take several months .
locals say the choppers were there on the second day after the quake .
sea change one of the pakistan army 's most senior helicopter pilots says he saw a " sea change " in the pilots under his command after their first trip to muzaffarabad .
some of the slopes are so steep ... that most of our airdrops just roll down to the river below pilot in pictures : helicopter mission " aviators are pampered brats because of the nature of their job , " says this officer .
" you try and stretch them beyond regular hours and they throw the rule book at you . "
yet each one of the 20-odd chopper pilots employed by the pakistan army has been doing 12 to 16 hour days since the quake struck .
for the first two days , they were even flying during the night - a practice strictly forbidden under normal circumstances .
helicopters arrived in chikhoti two days after the earthquake pilots recall those critical 48 hours as a period of " blind flights . "
but while that pressure eased with the commissioning of more choppers , the pressure to evacuate the injured has only mounted with time .
pakistan army spokesman shaukat sultan says the army 's fleet of 10 russian-built mi-17s - along with a few smaller ones - has rescued 6,000 people so far .
the commanders of these pilots say they will not stop their aid efforts , and when ordered to do so they fight and resist to the point of insubordination .
" there were hundreds of people standing amid the rubble , waving to me , motioning me to come down , " says one mi-17 pilot describing his first view of muzaffarabad - only about four hours after the quake .
" but at that stage , we had only been sent out to assess the situation , not to intervene .
" now we can and i am not stopping till i drop . "
highest battlefield during their typical 12-hour day , about half the time is spent in the air .
it must be tough staying up for such a long time , especially given the hilly terrain .
" the terrain is the least of their problems , " says one senior commander .
according to him , pakistani chopper pilots have had extensive experience of hostile conditions because of the conflict in siachen glacier .
" they have been dumping combat supplies at the world 's highest battlefield for more than 20 years now , " he says .
the pilots have also had vast experience of operating in hilly areas because of pakistan 's 25-year-old involvement in afghanistan .
so it is not the terrain that is the issue .
" it is the people , " says one pilot .
he says one of the trickiest problems he has faced in relief and rescue work so far is airdropping supplies .
the hastily put together relief packages in the initial days could weigh in excess of 40 kilos .
" can you believe that old men , women and children would run directly under the choppers , trying to catch the drops , " he says .
" from a height of 20 to 25 metres , they would have been crushed under their weight . "
often , the pilots would have to return without dropping supplies - a complaint that was heard from many villagers once the land routes opened .
" what could we do ?
we were carrying only the minimum possible fuel so we could carry more supplies .
" and if the people in one village held us up for more than a few minutes , we would just fly on to the next . "
super mules particularly problematic for the choppers was to drop relief supplies at villages - tiny settlements really , often not larger than a dozen houses - close to mountain tops .
these areas have traditionally been served - in severe weather conditions for example - by the army 's animal transport units -lrb- atus -rrb- made up of mules .
the mules are amazing animals .
each one of them is trained to carry particular kinds of supplies .
those trained in carrying ammunition will not carry guns and the ones trained to carry clothes will not transport food - each of these mules is a specialist .
the pakistani army 's animal transport units -lrb- atus -rrb- .
and they can find their destination without human assistance .
they have been a critical part of military logistics for more than 50 years and the only means of helping villagers trapped in snowstorms in the harsh winter months .
the quake has reduced the atus to a fraction of their original strength , leaving the relief work entirely dependent on choppers .
" some of the slopes are so steep - especially where levelled clearings have been swept down to the valley by the quake - that most of our airdrops just roll down to the river below , " says one pilot .
" we do n't want to hover too close to the survivors either , as the rotors would blow away whatever little shelter they are left with . "
indeed , at the muzaffarabad chopper base set up inside a stadium , people toppling over as mammoth us blackhawks touch down or take off is a regular sight .
thank you the hardest part by far , say the pilots , is evacuating casualties .
one of the hardest hit areas away from the towns and cities is lipa valley .
the quake seems to have inflicted 100 % damage here .
from the tiniest of sheds to the brigade headquarters , nothing has been left standing .
entire hillsides have caved in .
even the walkways leading up the hills have disappeared .
a medecins sans frontieres doctor , who had set up a medical camp at a small clearing , said even a week after the quake , between 100 to 150 people - most with fractures - were still making their way down the hills every day .
as the soldiers started bringing in casualties , it was easy to understand the pilots ' consternation .
on the 13-minute flight from lipa valley back to muzaffarabad , and the 32 minutes from there to rawalpindi , the copter resembled a nightmare tomb .
the wounds of many among them have begun to fester and the aircraft stinks unbearably .
the casualties are packed like sardines and when rough winds shake the copter , many of them cry out in pain .
" this is the only thing that i still have n't gotten used to , " says one of the crew .
" but we know that there are many more - hundreds or may be thousands - who still await evacuation . "
by the evening , the chopper has evacuated 95 casualties and dropped nearly 10 tonnes of relief supplies across the lipa valley .
" no matter how much we do , we know there is still a lot more to be done , " says one of the crew .
" how can we even think of giving ourselves a break ? "

according to him , pakistani chopper pilots have had extensive experience of hostile conditions because of the conflict in siachen glacier .

the pilots have also had vast experience of operating in hilly areas because of pakistan 's 25-year-old involvement in afghanistan .

" it is the people , " says one pilot .
he says one of the trickiest problems he has faced in relief and rescue work so far is airdropping supplies .
the hastily put together relief packages in the initial days could weigh in excess of 40 kilos .
" can you believe that old men , women and children would run directly under the choppers , trying to catch the drops , " he says .
" from a height of 20 to 25 metres , they would have been crushed under their weight . "
often , the pilots would have to return without dropping supplies - a complaint that was heard from many villagers once the land routes opened .

we were carrying only the minimum possible fuel so we could carry more supplies .
" and if the people in one village held us up for more than a few minutes , we would just fly on to the next . "

they have been a critical part of military logistics for more than 50 years and the only means of helping villagers trapped in snowstorms in the harsh winter months .
the quake has reduced the atus to a fraction of their original strength , leaving the relief work entirely dependent on choppers .

a medecins sans frontieres doctor , who had set up a medical camp at a small clearing , said even a week after the quake , between 100 to 150 people - most with fractures - were still making their way down the hills every day .

some of the slopes are so steep ... that most of our airdrops just roll down to the river below " pilot " aviators are pampered brats because of the nature of their job , " says this officer .
" you try and stretch them beyond regular hours and they throw the rule book at you . "
yet each one of the 20-odd chopper pilots employed by the pakistan army has been doing 12 to 16 hour days since the quake struck .
for the first two days , they were even flying during the night - a practice strictly forbidden under normal circumstances .
pilots recall those critical 48 hours as a period of " blind flights . "
but while that pressure eased with the commissioning of more choppers , the pressure to evacuate the injured has only mounted with time .
pakistan army spokesman shaukat sultan says the army 's fleet of 10 russian-built mi-17s - along with a few smaller ones - has rescued 6,000 people so far .
the commanders of these pilots say they will not stop their aid efforts , and when ordered to do so they fight and resist to the point of insubordination .
" there were hundreds of people standing amid the rubble , waving to me , motioning me to come down , " says one mi-17 pilot describing his first view of muzaffarabad - only about four hours after the quake .
" but at that stage , we had only been sent out to assess the situation , not to intervene .
" now we can and i am not stopping till i drop . "
highest battlefield during their typical 12-hour day , about half the time is spent in the air .
it must be tough staying up for such a long time , especially given the hilly terrain .
" the terrain is the least of their problems , " says one senior commander .
according to him , pakistani chopper pilots have had extensive experience of hostile conditions because of the conflict in siachen glacier .
" they have been dumping combat supplies at the world 's highest battlefield for more than 20 years now , " he says .
the pilots have also had vast experience of operating in hilly areas because of pakistan 's 25-year-old involvement in afghanistan .
so it is not the terrain that is the issue .
" it is the people , " says one pilot .
he says one of the trickiest problems he has faced in relief and rescue work so far is airdropping supplies .
the hastily put together relief packages in the initial days could weigh in excess of 40 kilos .
" can you believe that old men , women and children would run directly under the choppers , trying to catch the drops , " he says .
" from a height of 20 to 25 metres , they would have been crushed under their weight . "
often , the pilots would have to return without dropping supplies - a complaint that was heard from many villagers once the land routes opened .
" what could we do ?
we were carrying only the minimum possible fuel so we could carry more supplies .
" and if the people in one village held us up for more than a few minutes , we would just fly on to the next . "
super mules particularly problematic for the choppers was to drop relief supplies at villages - tiny settlements really , often not larger than a dozen houses - close to mountain tops .
these areas have traditionally been served - in severe weather conditions for example - by the army 's animal transport units -lrb- atus -rrb- made up of mules .
the mules are amazing animals .
each one of them is trained to carry particular kinds of supplies .
those trained in carrying ammunition will not carry guns and the ones trained to carry clothes will not transport food - each of these mules is a specialist .
and they can find their destination without human assistance .
they have been a critical part of military logistics for more than 50 years and the only means of helping villagers trapped in snowstorms in the harsh winter months .
the quake has reduced the atus to a fraction of their original strength , leaving the relief work entirely dependent on choppers .
" some of the slopes are so steep - especially where levelled clearings have been swept down to the valley by the quake - that most of our airdrops just roll down to the river below , " says one pilot .
" we do n't want to hover too close to the survivors either , as the rotors would blow away whatever little shelter they are left with . "
indeed , at the muzaffarabad chopper base set up inside a stadium , people toppling over as mammoth us blackhawks touch down or take off is a regular sight .
thank you the hardest part by far , say the pilots , is evacuating casualties .
one of the hardest hit areas away from the towns and cities is lipa valley .
the quake seems to have inflicted 100 % damage here .
from the tiniest of sheds to the brigade headquarters , nothing has been left standing .
entire hillsides have caved in .
even the walkways leading up the hills have disappeared .
a medecins sans frontieres doctor , who had set up a medical camp at a small clearing , said even a week after the quake , between 100 to 150 people - most with fractures - were still making their way down the hills every day .
as the soldiers started bringing in casualties , it was easy to understand the pilots ' consternation .
on the 13-minute flight from lipa valley back to muzaffarabad , and the 32 minutes from there to rawalpindi , the copter resembled a nightmare tomb .
the wounds of many among them have begun to fester and the aircraft stinks unbearably .
the casualties are packed like sardines and when rough winds shake the copter , many of them cry out in pain .
" this is the only thing that i still have n't gotten used to , " says one of the crew .
" but we know that there are many more - hundreds or may be thousands - who still await evacuation . "
by the evening , the chopper has evacuated 95 casualties and dropped nearly 10 tonnes of relief supplies across the lipa valley .
" no matter how much we do , we know there is still a lot more to be done , " says one of the crew .
" how can we even think of giving ourselves a break ? "

she was just 11 months old when she had her first seizure , but it was another 24 years before doctors finally diagnosed her with epilepsy .
she was sent for psychiatric treatment , told she was suffering from vertigo and panic attacks , and put on anti-depressants .
but it was not until her father died from a hereditary tumour that doctors finally scanned her and diagnosed epilepsy .
and it was nearly two months before she saw a specialist .
psychiatrist " it got to the point that they told me it was all in my head .
" my teenage years and my childhood were stolen from me .
if i had been diagnosed younger , i would have come to terms with it more easily and would have learnt to take my medication , but as an adult i felt that my whole world had been rocked .
" they sent me to a child psychiatrist and i was told that it was all in my head .
i know so many people who have gone through so many similar scenarios .
it is frightening that it is one of the most serious neurological disorders but people know nothing about it nicola howells " my mum tried to fight my corner and she is riddled with guilt because when they said it was all in my mind she began to think it was . "
epilepsy experts say nicola 's story is not uncommon .
they are calling for more money and expertise to be ploughed into the uk 's services .
national institute for health and clinical excellence -lrb- nice -rrb- guidance states that misdiagnosis rates for epilepsy in the uk are between 20-31 % .
patients currently have to wait between eight to 10 weeks from diagnosis until their first hospital appointment .
they wait about five weeks for an eeg -lrb- to monitor electrical activity in the brain -rrb- and 24 weeks for a magnetic resonance imaging scan -lrb- mri -rrb- , which can reveal structural abnormalities in the brain .
nice standards call for waiting times of no more than a month .
neurologists , nurses and epilepsy charities say the specialty needs an investment of £ 150 million to overcome serious gaps in the service .
guidelines and they say there needs to be an increase in the number of specialist nurses from 140 to 600 .
they say the nice guidelines will take at least another four years to be implemented .

nhs greater glasgow said the step was a deterrent which would only be used in the most extreme circumstances .
patients would be given a written " yellow card " warning for unacceptable violence or aggression .
if their behaviour continued they would be handed a " red card " which barred them from treatment on that occasion .
the case would be reviewed every time the patient returned for treatment .
citywide policy the decision to withhold treatment could only be taken by a senior clinician .
glasgow 's first citywide policy on dealing with violence and aggression towards healthcare staff covers hospitals , gp surgeries and clinics .
treatment will not be refused to emergency patients , people with head injuries and those not responsible for their own actions , such as those with learning disabilities . "
incidents of violent and aggressive abuse are a serious factor for healthcare workers in our hospitals and communities " sir john arbuthnott nhs greater glasgow 's chairman there were an average of three assaults a day on staff in glasgow 's hospitals over the year ending in march , and about 20 incidents of physical violence daily in community-based settings .
nhs greater glasgow 's chairman , professor sir john arbuthnott , said : " unfortunately evidence shows that incidents of violent and aggressive abuse are a serious factor for healthcare workers in our hospitals and communities .
" this is clearly unacceptable , and nhs greater glasgow is totally committed to reducing and deterring such incidents as well as ensuring staff are trained to deal with situations when they do arise . "
staff are also to receive advice and guidance on dealing with difficult situations .
sir john added : " it is our preference that we never reach the situation where we have to withhold treatment ; preferring instead to de-escalate a situation before it gets to that stage . "
" this policy sends out the message that violence against healthcare staff will not be tolerated under any circumstances " joe gallagher royal college of nursing the policy was welcomed by dr phil munro , an accident and emergency consultant at the southern general hospital .
he said staff deserved the chance to work without fear of intimidation , abuse or violence .
" my colleagues and i are all too aware from personal experience what it is like to deal with an aggressive situation , " he said .
" the new policy therefore is helpful to us as it is clear , pragmatic and based on common sense . "
the royal college of nursing 's officer for greater glasgow , joe gallagher , said : " this policy sends out the message that violence against healthcare staff will not be tolerated under any circumstances . "
unison 's scottish organiser for health , glyn hawker , said the policy would " help to create a safer environment for staff and patients alike " .
