with a long line of dramatic wins and losses , the arch-rivalry between the two neighbors always guarantees a sensational game . german-dutch soccer matches , even if they 're just friendlies , are seldom nice .
with a long line of dramatic wins and losses , the arch-rivalry between the two neighbors always guarantees a sensational game .
the german national soccer team will be braced for a tough show when they face-off against marco van basten 's netherlands wednesday night in rotterdam .
victories against the oranje have been few and far between in the past two decades , with just three in 11 encounters .
the last one was in 1996 at de kuip stadium in rotterdam , when the german team managed to squeeze out a 1-0 win thanks to jürgen klinsmann 's penalty conversion in the 19th minute .
but besides the fact of beating an old foe , klinsmann , the former striker-turned coach , would like for his side to do something a german team has not accomplished since october 2000 - that is to finally beat one of the world 's top teams .
since their 1-0 victory over england five years ago , germany has reeled off a string of 14 losses or draws against quality competition .
a third-place finish at the confederations cup in june may look impressive in the record books , but wins against australia , tunisia or mexico wo n't keep the experts quiet for long .
klinsmann , usually the epitome of sunshine and optimism – a carry-over from his year-round home in california – is not upbeat about wednesday 's match .
" this game has come too early for us , " he said .
" a lot of our players have just got back into training after the confederations cup . "
the return of experience the big stars of the confed cup were youngsters - the 20-year-old striker lukas podolski and the year-older midfielder bastian schweinsteiger - who are being left behind for the rotterdam game . according to the coaching staff , the two are getting well-deserved breaks .
their absence may be the break some of the players from years past have been waiting for .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : didi hamann -lrb- l -rrb- in his last apperance in german national uniform against latvia at euro 2004 for wednesday 's friendly , liverpool midfielder dietmar " didi " hamann , has been called back into the national squad after recovering from a foot injury , and more than a year after a less than stellar performance at the euro 2004 .
" he is the kind of player who despite a few injuries in the past few months has played the style that fits him , " klinsmann told kicker magazine .
" and he had a great deal to do with fc liverpool 's victory in the champions league . "
the 33-year-old defender christian wörns is also ready to play again after injuries sidelined him for months .
it should be a welcome return in the eyes of goalkeeper oliver kahn .
he and his colleagues jens lehmann and timo hildebrand had to fetch the ball from out of the net 11 times in five games at the confed cup .
miroslav klose , already with three goals in the bundesliga , also missed the confed cup .
the starter-status of the six-goal scorer at the world cup 2002 has been threatened by the rise of lukas podolski .
tops in the bundesliga does n't mean tops in holland bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roy makaay : flying high with bayern munich but grounded on dutch national team on the opposite side , the fate of dutch striker roy makaay , who leads the german bundesliga with five strikes in two matches , looks to be the one sitting on the bench .
the traditional dutch 4-3-3 with just one true striker means that , just as in years past , makaay will be watching from the sidelines most of the match .
ruud van nistelrooy has the better cards in the mind of coach van basten .
the statistics speak loads against makaay : only six goals in 42 matches for oranje .
still , german coaches think he should be a starter .
" if van basten wants to make things difficult for -lrb- german -rrb- goalkeeper kahn , then he should start makaay , " bayern coach felix magath commented .
high-risk match in rotterdam regardless of the line-up and the plays on the field , the historic rivalry between germany and the netherlands guarantees a full stadium , with thousands of fans crossing the border into " enemy " territory to cheer on their favorites .
because the animosity runs deep among soccer fans , security officials are taking no chances .
many remember all-to-well the 1996 riot in rotterdam when three people were stabbed and some 70 taken into custody following clashes between german hooligans and dutch police .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans can expect a strong police presence in rotterdam this time around , authorities from both countries are cooperating in patrolling the 572-kilometer border , stopping cars and trains for suspected hooligans .
dutch police have also been given the authority to search visitors in the city 's downtown .
there will be no alcohol consumption in or around the de kuip stadium .
and some 2,000 german fans will be escorted to the ahoy complex in the southern part of the city to pick up their tickets , thereby avoiding the city center and any possible mingling with dutch fans .
such security precautions have grown more and more common in the world of european soccer , where nationalist sentiments combine with sports fever to reach dangerous levels .
the open borders and ease of transportation between rival countries also means that fans can follow their teams almost anywhere .
just this past march , german hooligans brought shame on their country when they clashed with slovenians during an away match . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the specter of hooliganism returns german soccer hooligans have made a violent return to the international stage with just over a year to go before germany hosts the 2006 world cup .

coming from a country such as the philippines , whose population is so high and the rate of hiv-aids is increasing , i definitely agree with this concept ! - sam , philippines police should be distributing the rosary ! - pachla how stupid ! it would be like having a bikini contest during the muslim pilgrimage in mecca or a pig roast at the wailing wall . - p.cassidy how dare they even think of such a thing !
this is a religious gathering of young people who are faithful to the catholic church , if they were n't they would n't bother to travel the distances some are traveling or live under the conditions they will be living under for the days of wyd .
this should not be treated like any other gathering of young people such as a rock concert , etc . - anita wyd is about christ not about sex !
people do not go to wyd to have sex , but if they do that means they did n't get the idea of wyd .
christ never spoke of sex , he spoke of love ... our 21st century seems not see the difference between one and the other ! - bea , toronto , canada we need condoms like we need pornography - both are evils that the church condemns , and rightly so . - grace desouza giving away free condoms would imply that using them is perfectly okay , which it is not . give these young people the respect they deserve - acknowledge that they should and can abstain from immoral behavior . - joan collins distribution of condoms is so contrary to what these young people are about . they are there to grow spiritually , not to be sexually active .
we pray that those who wish to destroy the soul will be converted to know there is much more to life than a sexual appetite . - carol finerty condoms should not be distributed .
i think to do so shows arrogance beyond belief and insensitivity on behalf of those who push such an agenda . - fergal o 'neill did we not learn anything from our beloved holy father john paul ii regarding the culture of life and the theology of the body ?
we are made in the image and likeness of god and need to live for him and live a life of self-sacrifice . - frances huck dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de condom plans cancelled at youth fest as 400,000 catholic young people from around the world prepare to make their way to cologne for world youth day , a spat over condom distribution has erupted .

bavarian premier edmund stoiber , who could lay claim to any ministry , has still not made up his mind about whether he wants to move to berlin .
and the election outcome will also be decisive as merkel 's christian democrats might have to hand ministries to coalition partners - either the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , or the social democrats in a grand coalition . bildunterschrift : the competence team -lrb- from left -rrb- : norbert lammert , günther beckstein , gerda hasselfeldt , wolfgang schäuble , peter müller , ursula von der leyen , anette schavan , paul kirchhof , dieter althaus .

she had been accused of a cold leadership style and refusing to listen to ministry officials .
the mother of two children later became her party 's financial affairs spokeswoman in parliament .
a macro-economist , she grew up in a rural part of bavaria .
her father was a farmer , butcher and mayor of a small town in the eastern part of the state . culture : norbert lammert bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : norbert lammert lammert is deputy president of germany 's parliament and has been his party 's culture and media spokesman .

the 47-year-old premier of the eastern state of thuringia is meant to become the cdu 's face of eastern germany and is expected to placate voters in the east after bavarian premier edmund stoiber accused them of being " frustrated " and called on voters in the western parts of the country to not let easterners decide the outcome of the election .
initially considered bland , althaus succeeded thuringia 's charismatic former premier , bernhard vogel , in 2003 and has since become a constant guest on german talk shows .
he has called on his party colleagues to show willingness to compromise with the ruling coalition of social democrats and greens and veered from established cdu views on labor policies and subsidies for the eastern states .

kirchhof , who has four children , has also been lobbying for more state help to families with children .
during his last year as constitutional court judge , he lowered the tax burden on families by billions .

his relationship with merkel is not the best , however .
last fall , he rejected her offer to become her deputy for financial and economic affairs in parliament .
a former parliamentary leader himself who lost his positions in the wake of a party bribery scandal , schäuble was upset that merkel did not nominate him for the german presidency in 2004 and gave that job to former imf director horst köhler instead .
it 's unlikely that schäuble , who uses a wheel chair after an assassination attempt , will become foreign minister in case of an election victory as that position will be claimed by the cdu 's likely coalition partner , the fdp , or stoiber . interior affairs : günther beckstein bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günther beckstein beckstein , 61 , is bavarian interior minister , but well known throughout germany as he is a frequent guest on national talk shows .

with a long line of dramatic wins and losses , the arch-rivalry between the two neighbors always guarantees a sensational game . german-dutch soccer matches , even if they 're just friendlies , are seldom nice .
with a long line of dramatic wins and losses , the arch-rivalry between the two neighbors always guarantees a sensational game .
the german national soccer team will be braced for a tough show when they face-off against marco van basten 's netherlands wednesday night in rotterdam .
victories against the oranje have been few and far between in the past two decades , with just three in 11 encounters .
the last one was in 1996 at de kuip stadium in rotterdam , when the german team managed to squeeze out a 1-0 win thanks to jürgen klinsmann 's penalty conversion in the 19th minute .
but besides the fact of beating an old foe , klinsmann , the former striker-turned coach , would like for his side to do something a german team has not accomplished since october 2000 - that is to finally beat one of the world 's top teams .
since their 1-0 victory over england five years ago , germany has reeled off a string of 14 losses or draws against quality competition .
a third-place finish at the confederations cup in june may look impressive in the record books , but wins against australia , tunisia or mexico wo n't keep the experts quiet for long .
klinsmann , usually the epitome of sunshine and optimism – a carry-over from his year-round home in california – is not upbeat about wednesday 's match .
" this game has come too early for us , " he said .
" a lot of our players have just got back into training after the confederations cup . "
the return of experience the big stars of the confed cup were youngsters - the 20-year-old striker lukas podolski and the year-older midfielder bastian schweinsteiger - who are being left behind for the rotterdam game . according to the coaching staff , the two are getting well-deserved breaks .
their absence may be the break some of the players from years past have been waiting for .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : didi hamann -lrb- l -rrb- in his last apperance in german national uniform against latvia at euro 2004 for wednesday 's friendly , liverpool midfielder dietmar " didi " hamann , has been called back into the national squad after recovering from a foot injury , and more than a year after a less than stellar performance at the euro 2004 .
" he is the kind of player who despite a few injuries in the past few months has played the style that fits him , " klinsmann told kicker magazine .
" and he had a great deal to do with fc liverpool 's victory in the champions league . "
the 33-year-old defender christian wörns is also ready to play again after injuries sidelined him for months .
it should be a welcome return in the eyes of goalkeeper oliver kahn .
he and his colleagues jens lehmann and timo hildebrand had to fetch the ball from out of the net 11 times in five games at the confed cup .
miroslav klose , already with three goals in the bundesliga , also missed the confed cup .
the starter-status of the six-goal scorer at the world cup 2002 has been threatened by the rise of lukas podolski .
tops in the bundesliga does n't mean tops in holland bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roy makaay : flying high with bayern munich but grounded on dutch national team on the opposite side , the fate of dutch striker roy makaay , who leads the german bundesliga with five strikes in two matches , looks to be the one sitting on the bench .
the traditional dutch 4-3-3 with just one true striker means that , just as in years past , makaay will be watching from the sidelines most of the match .
ruud van nistelrooy has the better cards in the mind of coach van basten .
the statistics speak loads against makaay : only six goals in 42 matches for oranje .
still , german coaches think he should be a starter .
" if van basten wants to make things difficult for -lrb- german -rrb- goalkeeper kahn , then he should start makaay , " bayern coach felix magath commented .
high-risk match in rotterdam regardless of the line-up and the plays on the field , the historic rivalry between germany and the netherlands guarantees a full stadium , with thousands of fans crossing the border into " enemy " territory to cheer on their favorites .
because the animosity runs deep among soccer fans , security officials are taking no chances .
many remember all-to-well the 1996 riot in rotterdam when three people were stabbed and some 70 taken into custody following clashes between german hooligans and dutch police .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans can expect a strong police presence in rotterdam this time around , authorities from both countries are cooperating in patrolling the 572-kilometer border , stopping cars and trains for suspected hooligans .
dutch police have also been given the authority to search visitors in the city 's downtown .
there will be no alcohol consumption in or around the de kuip stadium .
and some 2,000 german fans will be escorted to the ahoy complex in the southern part of the city to pick up their tickets , thereby avoiding the city center and any possible mingling with dutch fans .
such security precautions have grown more and more common in the world of european soccer , where nationalist sentiments combine with sports fever to reach dangerous levels .
the open borders and ease of transportation between rival countries also means that fans can follow their teams almost anywhere .
just this past march , german hooligans brought shame on their country when they clashed with slovenians during an away match . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the specter of hooliganism returns german soccer hooligans have made a violent return to the international stage with just over a year to go before germany hosts the 2006 world cup .
officials have faith in security measures but experts predict trouble .
-lrb- april 7 , 2005 -rrb- attacking mentality stays , klinsmann says germany have not had a reputation for playing attacking football over the years but jürgen klinsmann seems intent on winning the 2006 world cup by outscoring opponents .

with a long line of dramatic wins and losses , the arch-rivalry between the two neighbors always guarantees a sensational game . german-dutch soccer matches , even if they 're just friendlies , are seldom nice .
with a long line of dramatic wins and losses , the arch-rivalry between the two neighbors always guarantees a sensational game .
the german national soccer team will be braced for a tough show when they face-off against marco van basten 's netherlands wednesday night in rotterdam .
victories against the oranje have been few and far between in the past two decades , with just three in 11 encounters .
the last one was in 1996 at de kuip stadium in rotterdam , when the german team managed to squeeze out a 1-0 win thanks to jürgen klinsmann 's penalty conversion in the 19th minute .
but besides the fact of beating an old foe , klinsmann , the former striker-turned coach , would like for his side to do something a german team has not accomplished since october 2000 - that is to finally beat one of the world 's top teams .
since their 1-0 victory over england five years ago , germany has reeled off a string of 14 losses or draws against quality competition .
a third-place finish at the confederations cup in june may look impressive in the record books , but wins against australia , tunisia or mexico wo n't keep the experts quiet for long .
klinsmann , usually the epitome of sunshine and optimism – a carry-over from his year-round home in california – is not upbeat about wednesday 's match .
" this game has come too early for us , " he said .
" a lot of our players have just got back into training after the confederations cup . "
the return of experience the big stars of the confed cup were youngsters - the 20-year-old striker lukas podolski and the year-older midfielder bastian schweinsteiger - who are being left behind for the rotterdam game . according to the coaching staff , the two are getting well-deserved breaks .
their absence may be the break some of the players from years past have been waiting for .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : didi hamann -lrb- l -rrb- in his last apperance in german national uniform against latvia at euro 2004 for wednesday 's friendly , liverpool midfielder dietmar " didi " hamann , has been called back into the national squad after recovering from a foot injury , and more than a year after a less than stellar performance at the euro 2004 .
" he is the kind of player who despite a few injuries in the past few months has played the style that fits him , " klinsmann told kicker magazine .
" and he had a great deal to do with fc liverpool 's victory in the champions league . "
the 33-year-old defender christian wörns is also ready to play again after injuries sidelined him for months .
it should be a welcome return in the eyes of goalkeeper oliver kahn .
he and his colleagues jens lehmann and timo hildebrand had to fetch the ball from out of the net 11 times in five games at the confed cup .
miroslav klose , already with three goals in the bundesliga , also missed the confed cup .
the starter-status of the six-goal scorer at the world cup 2002 has been threatened by the rise of lukas podolski .
tops in the bundesliga does n't mean tops in holland bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roy makaay : flying high with bayern munich but grounded on dutch national team on the opposite side , the fate of dutch striker roy makaay , who leads the german bundesliga with five strikes in two matches , looks to be the one sitting on the bench .
the traditional dutch 4-3-3 with just one true striker means that , just as in years past , makaay will be watching from the sidelines most of the match .
ruud van nistelrooy has the better cards in the mind of coach van basten .
the statistics speak loads against makaay : only six goals in 42 matches for oranje .
still , german coaches think he should be a starter .
" if van basten wants to make things difficult for -lrb- german -rrb- goalkeeper kahn , then he should start makaay , " bayern coach felix magath commented .
high-risk match in rotterdam regardless of the line-up and the plays on the field , the historic rivalry between germany and the netherlands guarantees a full stadium , with thousands of fans crossing the border into " enemy " territory to cheer on their favorites .
because the animosity runs deep among soccer fans , security officials are taking no chances .
many remember all-to-well the 1996 riot in rotterdam when three people were stabbed and some 70 taken into custody following clashes between german hooligans and dutch police .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans can expect a strong police presence in rotterdam this time around , authorities from both countries are cooperating in patrolling the 572-kilometer border , stopping cars and trains for suspected hooligans .
dutch police have also been given the authority to search visitors in the city 's downtown .
there will be no alcohol consumption in or around the de kuip stadium .
and some 2,000 german fans will be escorted to the ahoy complex in the southern part of the city to pick up their tickets , thereby avoiding the city center and any possible mingling with dutch fans .
such security precautions have grown more and more common in the world of european soccer , where nationalist sentiments combine with sports fever to reach dangerous levels .
the open borders and ease of transportation between rival countries also means that fans can follow their teams almost anywhere .
just this past march , german hooligans brought shame on their country when they clashed with slovenians during an away match . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the specter of hooliganism returns german soccer hooligans have made a violent return to the international stage with just over a year to go before germany hosts the 2006 world cup .
officials have faith in security measures but experts predict trouble .
-lrb- april 7 , 2005 -rrb- attacking mentality stays , klinsmann says germany have not had a reputation for playing attacking football over the years but jürgen klinsmann seems intent on winning the 2006 world cup by outscoring opponents .

" we 're a strong team and we 're ready to show germany that we can do things better , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former constitutional court judge paul kirchhof was named as finance expert onto merkel 's dream team one of the most important positions , that of financial affairs , will be filled by paul kirchhof -lrb- photo -rrb- , a former constitutional court judge and tax expert , who would cover the field of finances .
his background has been criticized by some experts .
" politics should not be about appointing friends but about competence and political experience and -lrb- friedrich -rrb- merz is clearly the one with those attributes , " peter lösche , a political scientist at göttingen university , told reuters .
friedrich merz , probably the cdu 's best financial expert , fell out with merkel during the power struggle for leadership within the christian democrats last year , thus leaving a large hole in that area within the party .
kirchhof , who is an independent , has been a vocal advocate of a simplified tax code .
in fact , merz assumed many of his ideas while he served as deputy party chairman .
while some suggested that merkel would create a " mega ministry " for finances , economics and labor in case she gets elected , the cdu leader said this would not make any sense .
there had been speculation that edmund stoiber would give up his job as bavarian premier to take on such a ministry .
" everyone can see that the minister of finance has his plate full , " merkel told german weekly stern .
" i ca n't really imagine merging finances , economics and labor into one ministry . "
beckstein to cover interior affairs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter müller , currently premier of the small state of saarland the new economics minister then could be peter müller -lrb- photo -rrb- , premier of the small western state of saarland , who will cover that area in merkel 's shadow cabinet .
for interior affairs , bavarian interior minister günther beckstein got the nod .
he would replace current german interior minister otto schily , should the cdu win on sept.18.
wolfgang schäuble , a longtime foreign policy expert , even under former chancellor helmut kohl , will serve as european and foreign affairs advisor .
ursula von der leyen , minister for social affairs in the state of lowe saxony , will take on family and social affairs .
annette schavan , minister for research and education in the state of baden-württemberg , will advise merkel in the same capacity .
gerda hasselfeldt , a former federal minister for construction , will serve as expert for agricultural , environmental and consumer affairs .
norbert lammert , a vice president of germany 's parliament , covers culture in the " competence team . "
apart from dieter althaus , the premier of the eastern state of thuringia , who will advise merkel on eastern german affairs , all members of the team have in principle agreed to serve in a cabinet under merkel should she be elected chancellor , the cdu leader said bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a potential successor for otto schily , günther beckstein bavarian premier edmund stoiber will not serve in any particular capacity .
but stoiber , who irked conservative allies by making disparaging remarks about eastern germans last week , is expected to attend merkel 's press conference announcing her team .
stoiber 's refusal to commit to moving to berlin until after the poll has been a source of great irritation to merkel and the cdu .
because he is head of the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the csu , nobody could hinder him from taking a post in berlin after sept .

with a long line of dramatic wins and losses , the arch-rivalry between the two neighbors always guarantees a sensational game .
the german national soccer team will be braced for a tough show when they face-off against marco van basten 's netherlands wednesday night in rotterdam .
victories against the oranje have been few and far between in the past two decades , with just three in 11 encounters .
the last one was in 1996 at de kuip stadium in rotterdam , when the german team managed to squeeze out a 1-0 win thanks to jürgen klinsmann 's penalty conversion in the 19th minute .
but besides the fact of beating an old foe , klinsmann , the former striker-turned coach , would like for his side to do something a german team has not accomplished since october 2000 - that is to finally beat one of the world 's top teams .
since their 1-0 victory over england five years ago , germany has reeled off a string of 14 losses or draws against quality competition .
a third-place finish at the confederations cup in june may look impressive in the record books , but wins against australia , tunisia or mexico wo n't keep the experts quiet for long .
klinsmann , usually the epitome of sunshine and optimism – a carry-over from his year-round home in california – is not upbeat about wednesday 's match .
" this game has come too early for us , " he said .
" a lot of our players have just got back into training after the confederations cup . "
the return of experience the big stars of the confed cup were youngsters - the 20-year-old striker lukas podolski and the year-older midfielder bastian schweinsteiger - who are being left behind for the rotterdam game . according to the coaching staff , the two are getting well-deserved breaks .
their absence may be the break some of the players from years past have been waiting for .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : didi hamann -lrb- l -rrb- in his last apperance in german national uniform against latvia at euro 2004 for wednesday 's friendly , liverpool midfielder dietmar " didi " hamann , has been called back into the national squad after recovering from a foot injury , and more than a year after a less than stellar performance at the euro 2004 .
" he is the kind of player who despite a few injuries in the past few months has played the style that fits him , " klinsmann told kicker magazine .
" and he had a great deal to do with fc liverpool 's victory in the champions league . "
the 33-year-old defender christian wörns is also ready to play again after injuries sidelined him for months .
it should be a welcome return in the eyes of goalkeeper oliver kahn .
he and his colleagues jens lehmann and timo hildebrand had to fetch the ball from out of the net 11 times in five games at the confed cup .
miroslav klose , already with three goals in the bundesliga , also missed the confed cup .
the starter-status of the six-goal scorer at the world cup 2002 has been threatened by the rise of lukas podolski .
tops in the bundesliga does n't mean tops in holland bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roy makaay : flying high with bayern munich but grounded on dutch national team on the opposite side , the fate of dutch striker roy makaay , who leads the german bundesliga with five strikes in two matches , looks to be the one sitting on the bench .
the traditional dutch 4-3-3 with just one true striker means that , just as in years past , makaay will be watching from the sidelines most of the match .
ruud van nistelrooy has the better cards in the mind of coach van basten .
the statistics speak loads against makaay : only six goals in 42 matches for oranje .
still , german coaches think he should be a starter .
" if van basten wants to make things difficult for -lrb- german -rrb- goalkeeper kahn , then he should start makaay , " bayern coach felix magath commented .
high-risk match in rotterdam regardless of the line-up and the plays on the field , the historic rivalry between germany and the netherlands guarantees a full stadium , with thousands of fans crossing the border into " enemy " territory to cheer on their favorites .
because the animosity runs deep among soccer fans , security officials are taking no chances .
many remember all-to-well the 1996 riot in rotterdam when three people were stabbed and some 70 taken into custody following clashes between german hooligans and dutch police .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans can expect a strong police presence in rotterdam this time around , authorities from both countries are cooperating in patrolling the 572-kilometer border , stopping cars and trains for suspected hooligans .
dutch police have also been given the authority to search visitors in the city 's downtown .
there will be no alcohol consumption in or around the de kuip stadium .
and some 2,000 german fans will be escorted to the ahoy complex in the southern part of the city to pick up their tickets , thereby avoiding the city center and any possible mingling with dutch fans .
such security precautions have grown more and more common in the world of european soccer , where nationalist sentiments combine with sports fever to reach dangerous levels .
the open borders and ease of transportation between rival countries also means that fans can follow their teams almost anywhere .

officials have faith in security measures but experts predict trouble .
-lrb- april 7 , 2005 -rrb- attacking mentality stays , klinsmann says germany have not had a reputation for playing attacking football over the years but jürgen klinsmann seems intent on winning the 2006 world cup by outscoring opponents .

an independent panel of german scientists has warned that the wholesale use of gene testing to check on the health of job applicants is not advisable .
the government wants an outright ban . germany 's national ethics council , which advises the government on ethical questions of modern medicine , recommended tuesday that forcible gene testing in the workplace for hereditary diseases should be subject to strict restrictions under german law .
it did , however , concede that exceptions could be made if third parties might be at risk - in the case of pilots , for example . an urgent need for legislation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some one hundred thousand gene tests are carried out in germany every year - many of them ordered by employers seeking to check on the long-term health risks of people applying for jobs . germany 's national ethics council believes that legislation protecting workers and employees is urgently needed to avoid misuse of data gathered from these tests . jochen taupitz , a legal advisor on the panel , believes that existing german regulations are lagging far behind the rapid advances in gene technology . " there is no law in germany governing the use of these tests in a detailed manner , " he said .
" all jurisdiction made by german courts so far is rather vague and does not match the technological progress in this field . " restrictions in germany , forcible gene tests made the headlines after a young teacher was refused employment two years ago for failing to undergo a test of her genes .
when school authorities learned that the applicant had a family record of huntington 's disease , a hereditary disease that affects the human nervous system , they wanted to find out whether she could also develop the illness .
a court ruled in the woman 's favor . kristiane weber-hassemer is the head of the german ethics council .
" we have come to agree that restrictions must be imposed here , " she said .
" this is especially needed to protect employees against dismissal for medical reasons .
restrictions must be put on the period of validity of gene diagnoses and predictions about the chances that a disease might occur . " 5-year diagnostic validity the scientists are demanding that the diagnostic validity of a gene test should not go beyond 5 years and that test results must be labeled negative if the possibility of an outbreak of a specific disease is estimated at less than 50 percent . efforts by chancellor schröder 's center-left government to adopt new gene laws have been halted until after early elections in germany in september this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the recommendations made by the ethics council tuesday , however , do n't affect other areas of public life - including possible gene screening by insurance companies .
in this area , german companies have voluntarily imposed a moratorium banning such testing of insurance applicants until 2011 .

beckstein to cover interior affairs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter müller , currently premier of the small state of saarland the new economics minister then could be peter müller -lrb- photo -rrb- , premier of the small western state of saarland , who will cover that area in merkel 's shadow cabinet .
for interior affairs , bavarian interior minister günther beckstein got the nod .
he would replace current german interior minister otto schily , should the cdu win on sept.18.
wolfgang schäuble , a longtime foreign policy expert , even under former chancellor helmut kohl , will serve as european and foreign affairs advisor .
ursula von der leyen , minister for social affairs in the state of lowe saxony , will take on family and social affairs .
annette schavan , minister for research and education in the state of baden-württemberg , will advise merkel in the same capacity .
gerda hasselfeldt , a former federal minister for construction , will serve as expert for agricultural , environmental and consumer affairs .
norbert lammert , a vice president of germany 's parliament , covers culture in the " competence team . "
apart from dieter althaus , the premier of the eastern state of thuringia , who will advise merkel on eastern german affairs , all members of the team have in principle agreed to serve in a cabinet under merkel should she be elected chancellor , the cdu leader said bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a potential successor for otto schily , günther beckstein bavarian premier edmund stoiber will not serve in any particular capacity .
but stoiber , who irked conservative allies by making disparaging remarks about eastern germans last week , is expected to attend merkel 's press conference announcing her team .
stoiber 's refusal to commit to moving to berlin until after the poll has been a source of great irritation to merkel and the cdu .
because he is head of the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the csu , nobody could hinder him from taking a post in berlin after sept .

dw-world has compiled biographical information about the members . merkel 's troupe , which has already been rechristened " incompetence team " by chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats , is not really a shadow cabinet as it 's still unclear whether the team members will eventually fill their respective positions in a conservative-led cabinet . most members have said they are willing to serve as ministers , with thuringia 's premier , dieter althaus , being the one exception .
bavarian premier edmund stoiber , who could lay claim to any ministry , has still not made up his mind about whether he wants to move to berlin .
and the election outcome will also be decisive as merkel 's christian democrats might have to hand ministries to coalition partners - either the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , or the social democrats in a grand coalition . bildunterschrift : the competence team -lrb- from left -rrb- : norbert lammert , günther beckstein , gerda hasselfeldt , wolfgang schäuble , peter müller , ursula von der leyen , anette schavan , paul kirchhof , dieter althaus .
on the right are angela merkel and edmund stoiber the " competence team " is therefore meant to give a face to important policy areas .
dw-world offers some background on its members . agriculture , environment and consumer protection : gerda hasselfeldt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerda hasselfeldt hasselfeldt , 55 , is widely unknown despite serving as her party 's deputy leader in parliament and holding the office of minister for construction and later health under former chancellor helmut kohl from 1989 to 1992 .
she had been accused of a cold leadership style and refusing to listen to ministry officials .
the mother of two children later became her party 's financial affairs spokeswoman in parliament .
a macro-economist , she grew up in a rural part of bavaria .
her father was a farmer , butcher and mayor of a small town in the eastern part of the state . culture : norbert lammert bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : norbert lammert lammert is deputy president of germany 's parliament and has been his party 's culture and media spokesman .
the 57-year-old social scientist is the son of a baker and comes from western germany 's industrial ruhr area .
much of his political career has been focused on education policies , but he also served as junior minister in germany 's ministry of economics from 1994 . eastern german reconstruction : dieter althaus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter althaus althaus might play a decisive role during the election .
the 47-year-old premier of the eastern state of thuringia is meant to become the cdu 's face of eastern germany and is expected to placate voters in the east after bavarian premier edmund stoiber accused them of being " frustrated " and called on voters in the western parts of the country to not let easterners decide the outcome of the election .
initially considered bland , althaus succeeded thuringia 's charismatic former premier , bernhard vogel , in 2003 and has since become a constant guest on german talk shows .
he has called on his party colleagues to show willingness to compromise with the ruling coalition of social democrats and greens and veered from established cdu views on labor policies and subsidies for the eastern states .
a former professor of mathematics and physics , he still avoids open confrontation with party friends and is considered a close merkel ally . economy and labor : peter müller bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter müller müller , 49 , is premier of the southwestern state of saarland and is seen as a generalist .
he is considered to be a definite member of a cabinet under merkel , but not necessarily in the same function as the one he has taken on now .
bavarian premier edmund stoiber might claim the economics and labor ministry after all .
müller has become well known throughout germany as president of his party 's commission on immigration .
a lawyer by trade , he is considered a " liberal " conservative , who does not always follow party lines , as has been the case regarding immigration issues as well as his opposition to the war in iraq . finances : paul kirchhof bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul kirchhof a former constitutional court judge , kirchhof is not a member of the christian democrats and is respected as a tax expert across party lines .
the 62-year-old law professor from heidelberg has introduced a radical tax reform model : he wants to do away with all forms of tax subsidies and lower the highest income tax rate to 25 percent .
kirchhof , who has four children , has also been lobbying for more state help to families with children .
during his last year as constitutional court judge , he lowered the tax burden on families by billions .
observers doubt that he will actually serve in merkel 's cabinet should she become chancellor .
many cdu members consider his ideas too radical .
he also rejects merkel 's plan to raise vat by 2 percent . foreign and security policy : wolfgang schäuble bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang schäuble without a doubt , schäuble is one of the cdu 's most competent politicians and a generalist like müller .
a former party leader , he has concentrated on international politics for years and shaped the cdu 's views in this area .
schäuble recently visited us president george w. bush , as he again pointed out during statements on wednesday .
his relationship with merkel is not the best , however .
last fall , he rejected her offer to become her deputy for financial and economic affairs in parliament .
a former parliamentary leader himself who lost his positions in the wake of a party bribery scandal , schäuble was upset that merkel did not nominate him for the german presidency in 2004 and gave that job to former imf director horst köhler instead .
it 's unlikely that schäuble , who uses a wheel chair after an assassination attempt , will become foreign minister in case of an election victory as that position will be claimed by the cdu 's likely coalition partner , the fdp , or stoiber . interior affairs : günther beckstein bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günther beckstein beckstein , 61 , is bavarian interior minister , but well known throughout germany as he is a frequent guest on national talk shows .
he is often 's interviewed on subjects such as terrorism , illegal immigration and domestic safety .
in office for 11 years , he is an ardent promoter of a " no tolerance " policy and has uncompromising views on immigration .
bavaria is the state that deports immigrants fastest and most frequently .
beckstein is a loyal supporter of bavarian premier edmund stoiber and many see him as a potential successor to his current boss . research and education : annette schavan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : annette schavan schavan , 50 , serves as minister for culture and education in the southwestern state of baden-württemberg .
she was defeated in a race to succeed former premier erwin teufel by current premier , günther oettinger .
a theologian , schavan is considered a smart politician , who likes to remain in the background and does n't search the limelight .
in 1998 , she became well known throughout germany when she refused to grant civil-servant status to a muslim teacher who insisted on wearing a veil in the classroom . social affairs , health , senior citizens : ursula von der leyen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ursula von der leyen the 46-year-old minister for social affairs in the northern state of lower saxony is considered one of her party 's rising stars .

" we 're a strong team and we 're ready to show germany that we can do things better , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former constitutional court judge paul kirchhof was named as finance expert onto merkel 's dream team one of the most important positions , that of financial affairs , will be filled by paul kirchhof -lrb- photo -rrb- , a former constitutional court judge and tax expert , who would cover the field of finances .
his background has been criticized by some experts .
" politics should not be about appointing friends but about competence and political experience and -lrb- friedrich -rrb- merz is clearly the one with those attributes , " peter lösche , a political scientist at göttingen university , told reuters .
friedrich merz , probably the cdu 's best financial expert , fell out with merkel during the power struggle for leadership within the christian democrats last year , thus leaving a large hole in that area within the party .
kirchhof , who is an independent , has been a vocal advocate of a simplified tax code .
in fact , merz assumed many of his ideas while he served as deputy party chairman .
while some suggested that merkel would create a " mega ministry " for finances , economics and labor in case she gets elected , the cdu leader said this would not make any sense .
there had been speculation that edmund stoiber would give up his job as bavarian premier to take on such a ministry .
" everyone can see that the minister of finance has his plate full , " merkel told german weekly stern .
" i ca n't really imagine merging finances , economics and labor into one ministry . "
beckstein to cover interior affairs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter müller , currently premier of the small state of saarland the new economics minister then could be peter müller -lrb- photo -rrb- , premier of the small western state of saarland , who will cover that area in merkel 's shadow cabinet .
for interior affairs , bavarian interior minister günther beckstein got the nod .
he would replace current german interior minister otto schily , should the cdu win on sept.18.
wolfgang schäuble , a longtime foreign policy expert , even under former chancellor helmut kohl , will serve as european and foreign affairs advisor .
ursula von der leyen , minister for social affairs in the state of lowe saxony , will take on family and social affairs .
annette schavan , minister for research and education in the state of baden-württemberg , will advise merkel in the same capacity .
gerda hasselfeldt , a former federal minister for construction , will serve as expert for agricultural , environmental and consumer affairs .
norbert lammert , a vice president of germany 's parliament , covers culture in the " competence team . "
apart from dieter althaus , the premier of the eastern state of thuringia , who will advise merkel on eastern german affairs , all members of the team have in principle agreed to serve in a cabinet under merkel should she be elected chancellor , the cdu leader said bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a potential successor for otto schily , günther beckstein bavarian premier edmund stoiber will not serve in any particular capacity .
but stoiber , who irked conservative allies by making disparaging remarks about eastern germans last week , is expected to attend merkel 's press conference announcing her team .
stoiber 's refusal to commit to moving to berlin until after the poll has been a source of great irritation to merkel and the cdu .
because he is head of the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the csu , nobody could hinder him from taking a post in berlin after sept .

a mobile service will relay the papal message to their cell phones . when pope benedict xvi delivers his final mass on sunday to end the world youth day celebrations , it 'll be a difficult feat for any of the 800,000 strong crowd of pilgrims expected to get anywhere close to the pontiff .
instead he will come to every single one of them - provided they have signed up for a text messaging service organized by the german bishop 's conference and tv broadcaster rtl .
spreading the message for those who have subscribed , every evening over the past week has seen a short but significant quote taken from a statement made by the pope on that day arrive on their cell phones , said dietmar heeg , a catholic priest who is in charge of organizing the service on behalf of germany 's catholic bishops .
" in this way the core theological statements of the german pope have been spread widely and quickly , " he added .
to subscribe , the believers only had to send an initial message to a service number to receive the quotes .

" in the run-up to the pope 's visit , we started the service by sending out statements benedict xvi. made in connection with world youth day , " explained heeg . 160 characters for the pope 's message to condense the papal utterances into 160 characters of a text message is certainly no mean feat , but the priest is no newcomer to the field of mobile spiritual guidance - and the limitations that come with it .

no profit the service does come at a price - around ten eurocents for the evening prayer and 0.29 for the new daily text message from the pope .
but heeg insists neither the production company nor the church is making any profit , the fees just about cover the costs of relaying the texts .
while heeg 's company is fully responsible for the evening prayer service , the higher price for the pontiff 's quotes comes about because in this case broadcaster rtl covers the technical side of the service and offers it as part of their premium rate text messaging .
any surplus would therefore end up in their coffers .

at the youth gathering they have been going on the offensive from day one . the pilgrims arriving in cologne on monday morning were certainly left in no doubt .
world youth day -lrb- wyd -rrb- information points at the railway station and throughout the city center were already waiting on the youth from around the globe to provide guidance - on navigating the city and the events of wyd that is .
the city center appears dotted with stages that host the events of wyd , makeshift tv studios were being set up and posters of the new pope were gracing walls and shop windows .
one day before the official start of world youth day 2005 in cologne things seemed to be running smoothly .
critics on the ground from day one but at the same time criticism was fermenting in the underground - literally .
in the basement of a luxury hotel some 10 minutes walk from the main station , the " world youth day 4 all " -lrb- wyd4all -rrb- coalition was also kicking off with their first press conference on monday morning .
the coalition of grassroots organizations bemoans the lack of room the wyd affords to discuss let alone criticize the church 's stance on controversial issues like contraception or the role of women .
strategic focus on specific issues their monday morning press briefing focused on hiv / aids prevention and the stance of the catholic church on the issue .
by banning the use of condoms " our church leaders are putting the world population at risk , " said molly o 'gorman from the washington-based organization catholics for a free choice which is part of the wyd4all coalition .
despite a host of matters and general themes on which critics disagree with the catholic church , o 'gorman insists that the focus on a specific issue such as this can steer a lot more people into action .
" it also leaves the church leaders with very little wiggle room , " she added .
bildunterschrift : poster for gay and lesbian youths at world youth day more church leaders speaking out according to catholics for a free choice a number of catholic bishops around the world - many from developing nations - have softened their stance on condom use , including the indian catholic bishop 's conference which has agreed to " provide all information about it " to couples seeking advice .
on a number of issues more and more bishops are coming out of the closet against the established views of the senior leadership including the pope .
molly o 'gorman is convinced that in the medium term this could lead to an internal revolution within the church .
and this is backed by pressure from the grassroots : surveys show that catholics around the world are defying the official vatican line in their daily lives .
how to address the crowd but how do the critics carry their message to the believers attending world youth day ?
wyd 2005 resembles the " communist world youth games , " german wyd4all spokesperson tobias raschke told the left-leaning newspaper tageszeitung recently .
and just like in those mass events of the cold war there is no room for the discussion of contentious but highly relevant issues , he said .
only last week german bishops issued a statement that essentially labeled two of germany 's most prominent church critics personae non gratae at the world youth day .
but catholic youth appear to have remained surprisingly quiet in response .
many young people come for the party , admitted raschke .
but then why should they listen to the critics ?
" we know that young people do feel strongly about many of the issues .
all we do is to provide information and the chance to discuss , if they so wish . "
it remains to be seen how much headway the critics can make during world youth day 2005 in the face of seemingly overwhelming enthusiasm for the visit of the new pope .

bildunterschrift : poster for gay and lesbian youths at world youth day more church leaders speaking out according to catholics for a free choice a number of catholic bishops around the world - many from developing nations - have softened their stance on condom use , including the indian catholic bishop 's conference which has agreed to " provide all information about it " to couples seeking advice .
on a number of issues more and more bishops are coming out of the closet against the established views of the senior leadership including the pope .
molly o 'gorman is convinced that in the medium term this could lead to an internal revolution within the church .
and this is backed by pressure from the grassroots : surveys show that catholics around the world are defying the official vatican line in their daily lives .
how to address the crowd but how do the critics carry their message to the believers attending world youth day ?
wyd 2005 resembles the " communist world youth games , " german wyd4all spokesperson tobias raschke told the left-leaning newspaper tageszeitung recently .
and just like in those mass events of the cold war there is no room for the discussion of contentious but highly relevant issues , he said .
only last week german bishops issued a statement that essentially labeled two of germany 's most prominent church critics personae non gratae at the world youth day .
but catholic youth appear to have remained surprisingly quiet in response .
many young people come for the party , admitted raschke .
but then why should they listen to the critics ?
" we know that young people do feel strongly about many of the issues .
all we do is to provide information and the chance to discuss , if they so wish . "
it remains to be seen how much headway the critics can make during world youth day 2005 in the face of seemingly overwhelming enthusiasm for the visit of the new pope .

a mobile service will relay the papal message to their cell phones . when pope benedict xvi delivers his final mass on sunday to end the world youth day celebrations , it 'll be a difficult feat for any of the 800,000 strong crowd of pilgrims expected to get anywhere close to the pontiff .
instead he will come to every single one of them - provided they have signed up for a text messaging service organized by the german bishop 's conference and tv broadcaster rtl .
spreading the message for those who have subscribed , every evening over the past week has seen a short but significant quote taken from a statement made by the pope on that day arrive on their cell phones , said dietmar heeg , a catholic priest who is in charge of organizing the service on behalf of germany 's catholic bishops .
" in this way the core theological statements of the german pope have been spread widely and quickly , " he added .

no profit the service does come at a price - around ten eurocents for the evening prayer and 0.29 for the new daily text message from the pope .
but heeg insists neither the production company nor the church is making any profit , the fees just about cover the costs of relaying the texts .
while heeg 's company is fully responsible for the evening prayer service , the higher price for the pontiff 's quotes comes about because in this case broadcaster rtl covers the technical side of the service and offers it as part of their premium rate text messaging .
any surplus would therefore end up in their coffers .

in the basement of a luxury hotel some 10 minutes walk from the main station , the " world youth day 4 all " -lrb- wyd4all -rrb- coalition was also kicking off with their first press conference on monday morning .
the coalition of grassroots organizations bemoans the lack of room the wyd affords to discuss let alone criticize the church 's stance on controversial issues like contraception or the role of women .
strategic focus on specific issues their monday morning press briefing focused on hiv / aids prevention and the stance of the catholic church on the issue .
by banning the use of condoms " our church leaders are putting the world population at risk , " said molly o 'gorman from the washington-based organization catholics for a free choice which is part of the wyd4all coalition .
despite a host of matters and general themes on which critics disagree with the catholic church , o 'gorman insists that the focus on a specific issue such as this can steer a lot more people into action .
" it also leaves the church leaders with very little wiggle room , " she added .
bildunterschrift : poster for gay and lesbian youths at world youth day more church leaders speaking out according to catholics for a free choice a number of catholic bishops around the world - many from developing nations - have softened their stance on condom use , including the indian catholic bishop 's conference which has agreed to " provide all information about it " to couples seeking advice .
on a number of issues more and more bishops are coming out of the closet against the established views of the senior leadership including the pope .
molly o 'gorman is convinced that in the medium term this could lead to an internal revolution within the church .
and this is backed by pressure from the grassroots : surveys show that catholics around the world are defying the official vatican line in their daily lives .
how to address the crowd but how do the critics carry their message to the believers attending world youth day ?
wyd 2005 resembles the " communist world youth games , " german wyd4all spokesperson tobias raschke told the left-leaning newspaper tageszeitung recently .
and just like in those mass events of the cold war there is no room for the discussion of contentious but highly relevant issues , he said .
only last week german bishops issued a statement that essentially labeled two of germany 's most prominent church critics personae non gratae at the world youth day .
but catholic youth appear to have remained surprisingly quiet in response .
many young people come for the party , admitted raschke .
but then why should they listen to the critics ?
" we know that young people do feel strongly about many of the issues .
all we do is to provide information and the chance to discuss , if they so wish . "
it remains to be seen how much headway the critics can make during world youth day 2005 in the face of seemingly overwhelming enthusiasm for the visit of the new pope .

at the youth gathering they have been going on the offensive from day one . the pilgrims arriving in cologne on monday morning were certainly left in no doubt .
world youth day -lrb- wyd -rrb- information points at the railway station and throughout the city center were already waiting on the youth from around the globe to provide guidance - on navigating the city and the events of wyd that is .
the city center appears dotted with stages that host the events of wyd , makeshift tv studios were being set up and posters of the new pope were gracing walls and shop windows .

dw-world has compiled biographical information about the members . merkel 's troupe , which has already been rechristened " incompetence team " by chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats , is not really a shadow cabinet as it 's still unclear whether the team members will eventually fill their respective positions in a conservative-led cabinet . most members have said they are willing to serve as ministers , with thuringia 's premier , dieter althaus , being the one exception .
bavarian premier edmund stoiber , who could lay claim to any ministry , has still not made up his mind about whether he wants to move to berlin .
and the election outcome will also be decisive as merkel 's christian democrats might have to hand ministries to coalition partners - either the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , or the social democrats in a grand coalition . bildunterschrift : the competence team -lrb- from left -rrb- : norbert lammert , günther beckstein , gerda hasselfeldt , wolfgang schäuble , peter müller , ursula von der leyen , anette schavan , paul kirchhof , dieter althaus .
on the right are angela merkel and edmund stoiber the " competence team " is therefore meant to give a face to important policy areas .
dw-world offers some background on its members . agriculture , environment and consumer protection : gerda hasselfeldt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerda hasselfeldt hasselfeldt , 55 , is widely unknown despite serving as her party 's deputy leader in parliament and holding the office of minister for construction and later health under former chancellor helmut kohl from 1989 to 1992 .
she had been accused of a cold leadership style and refusing to listen to ministry officials .
the mother of two children later became her party 's financial affairs spokeswoman in parliament .
a macro-economist , she grew up in a rural part of bavaria .
her father was a farmer , butcher and mayor of a small town in the eastern part of the state . culture : norbert lammert bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : norbert lammert lammert is deputy president of germany 's parliament and has been his party 's culture and media spokesman .
the 57-year-old social scientist is the son of a baker and comes from western germany 's industrial ruhr area .
much of his political career has been focused on education policies , but he also served as junior minister in germany 's ministry of economics from 1994 . eastern german reconstruction : dieter althaus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter althaus althaus might play a decisive role during the election .
the 47-year-old premier of the eastern state of thuringia is meant to become the cdu 's face of eastern germany and is expected to placate voters in the east after bavarian premier edmund stoiber accused them of being " frustrated " and called on voters in the western parts of the country to not let easterners decide the outcome of the election .
initially considered bland , althaus succeeded thuringia 's charismatic former premier , bernhard vogel , in 2003 and has since become a constant guest on german talk shows .
he has called on his party colleagues to show willingness to compromise with the ruling coalition of social democrats and greens and veered from established cdu views on labor policies and subsidies for the eastern states .
a former professor of mathematics and physics , he still avoids open confrontation with party friends and is considered a close merkel ally . economy and labor : peter müller bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter müller müller , 49 , is premier of the southwestern state of saarland and is seen as a generalist .
he is considered to be a definite member of a cabinet under merkel , but not necessarily in the same function as the one he has taken on now .
bavarian premier edmund stoiber might claim the economics and labor ministry after all .
müller has become well known throughout germany as president of his party 's commission on immigration .
a lawyer by trade , he is considered a " liberal " conservative , who does not always follow party lines , as has been the case regarding immigration issues as well as his opposition to the war in iraq . finances : paul kirchhof bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul kirchhof a former constitutional court judge , kirchhof is not a member of the christian democrats and is respected as a tax expert across party lines .
the 62-year-old law professor from heidelberg has introduced a radical tax reform model : he wants to do away with all forms of tax subsidies and lower the highest income tax rate to 25 percent .
kirchhof , who has four children , has also been lobbying for more state help to families with children .
during his last year as constitutional court judge , he lowered the tax burden on families by billions .
observers doubt that he will actually serve in merkel 's cabinet should she become chancellor .
many cdu members consider his ideas too radical .
he also rejects merkel 's plan to raise vat by 2 percent . foreign and security policy : wolfgang schäuble bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang schäuble without a doubt , schäuble is one of the cdu 's most competent politicians and a generalist like müller .
a former party leader , he has concentrated on international politics for years and shaped the cdu 's views in this area .
schäuble recently visited us president george w. bush , as he again pointed out during statements on wednesday .
his relationship with merkel is not the best , however .
last fall , he rejected her offer to become her deputy for financial and economic affairs in parliament .
a former parliamentary leader himself who lost his positions in the wake of a party bribery scandal , schäuble was upset that merkel did not nominate him for the german presidency in 2004 and gave that job to former imf director horst köhler instead .
it 's unlikely that schäuble , who uses a wheel chair after an assassination attempt , will become foreign minister in case of an election victory as that position will be claimed by the cdu 's likely coalition partner , the fdp , or stoiber . interior affairs : günther beckstein bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günther beckstein beckstein , 61 , is bavarian interior minister , but well known throughout germany as he is a frequent guest on national talk shows .
he is often 's interviewed on subjects such as terrorism , illegal immigration and domestic safety .
in office for 11 years , he is an ardent promoter of a " no tolerance " policy and has uncompromising views on immigration .
bavaria is the state that deports immigrants fastest and most frequently .
beckstein is a loyal supporter of bavarian premier edmund stoiber and many see him as a potential successor to his current boss . research and education : annette schavan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : annette schavan schavan , 50 , serves as minister for culture and education in the southwestern state of baden-württemberg .
she was defeated in a race to succeed former premier erwin teufel by current premier , günther oettinger .
a theologian , schavan is considered a smart politician , who likes to remain in the background and does n't search the limelight .
in 1998 , she became well known throughout germany when she refused to grant civil-servant status to a muslim teacher who insisted on wearing a veil in the classroom . social affairs , health , senior citizens : ursula von der leyen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ursula von der leyen the 46-year-old minister for social affairs in the northern state of lower saxony is considered one of her party 's rising stars .
last december she was elected as a vice chairman by 94.1 percent of delegates .
von der leyen worked as a doctor before becoming a minister in 2003 .
she is the daughter of a former premier of lower saxony , ernst albrecht , and has seven children . compiled by steffen leidel -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel unveils her campaign team seeking to stem a decline in the polls , conservative chancellor candidate angela merkel announced her team of advisors during the election campaign wednesday .

dw-world has compiled biographical information about the members . merkel 's troupe , which has already been rechristened " incompetence team " by chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats , is not really a shadow cabinet as it 's still unclear whether the team members will eventually fill their respective positions in a conservative-led cabinet . most members have said they are willing to serve as ministers , with thuringia 's premier , dieter althaus , being the one exception .
bavarian premier edmund stoiber , who could lay claim to any ministry , has still not made up his mind about whether he wants to move to berlin .
and the election outcome will also be decisive as merkel 's christian democrats might have to hand ministries to coalition partners - either the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , or the social democrats in a grand coalition . bildunterschrift : the competence team -lrb- from left -rrb- : norbert lammert , günther beckstein , gerda hasselfeldt , wolfgang schäuble , peter müller , ursula von der leyen , anette schavan , paul kirchhof , dieter althaus .
on the right are angela merkel and edmund stoiber the " competence team " is therefore meant to give a face to important policy areas .
dw-world offers some background on its members . agriculture , environment and consumer protection : gerda hasselfeldt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerda hasselfeldt hasselfeldt , 55 , is widely unknown despite serving as her party 's deputy leader in parliament and holding the office of minister for construction and later health under former chancellor helmut kohl from 1989 to 1992 .
she had been accused of a cold leadership style and refusing to listen to ministry officials .
the mother of two children later became her party 's financial affairs spokeswoman in parliament .
a macro-economist , she grew up in a rural part of bavaria .
her father was a farmer , butcher and mayor of a small town in the eastern part of the state . culture : norbert lammert bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : norbert lammert lammert is deputy president of germany 's parliament and has been his party 's culture and media spokesman .
the 57-year-old social scientist is the son of a baker and comes from western germany 's industrial ruhr area .
much of his political career has been focused on education policies , but he also served as junior minister in germany 's ministry of economics from 1994 . eastern german reconstruction : dieter althaus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter althaus althaus might play a decisive role during the election .
the 47-year-old premier of the eastern state of thuringia is meant to become the cdu 's face of eastern germany and is expected to placate voters in the east after bavarian premier edmund stoiber accused them of being " frustrated " and called on voters in the western parts of the country to not let easterners decide the outcome of the election .
initially considered bland , althaus succeeded thuringia 's charismatic former premier , bernhard vogel , in 2003 and has since become a constant guest on german talk shows .
he has called on his party colleagues to show willingness to compromise with the ruling coalition of social democrats and greens and veered from established cdu views on labor policies and subsidies for the eastern states .
a former professor of mathematics and physics , he still avoids open confrontation with party friends and is considered a close merkel ally . economy and labor : peter müller bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter müller müller , 49 , is premier of the southwestern state of saarland and is seen as a generalist .
he is considered to be a definite member of a cabinet under merkel , but not necessarily in the same function as the one he has taken on now .
bavarian premier edmund stoiber might claim the economics and labor ministry after all .
müller has become well known throughout germany as president of his party 's commission on immigration .
a lawyer by trade , he is considered a " liberal " conservative , who does not always follow party lines , as has been the case regarding immigration issues as well as his opposition to the war in iraq . finances : paul kirchhof bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul kirchhof a former constitutional court judge , kirchhof is not a member of the christian democrats and is respected as a tax expert across party lines .
the 62-year-old law professor from heidelberg has introduced a radical tax reform model : he wants to do away with all forms of tax subsidies and lower the highest income tax rate to 25 percent .
kirchhof , who has four children , has also been lobbying for more state help to families with children .
during his last year as constitutional court judge , he lowered the tax burden on families by billions .
observers doubt that he will actually serve in merkel 's cabinet should she become chancellor .
many cdu members consider his ideas too radical .
he also rejects merkel 's plan to raise vat by 2 percent . foreign and security policy : wolfgang schäuble bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang schäuble without a doubt , schäuble is one of the cdu 's most competent politicians and a generalist like müller .
a former party leader , he has concentrated on international politics for years and shaped the cdu 's views in this area .
schäuble recently visited us president george w. bush , as he again pointed out during statements on wednesday .
his relationship with merkel is not the best , however .
last fall , he rejected her offer to become her deputy for financial and economic affairs in parliament .
a former parliamentary leader himself who lost his positions in the wake of a party bribery scandal , schäuble was upset that merkel did not nominate him for the german presidency in 2004 and gave that job to former imf director horst köhler instead .
it 's unlikely that schäuble , who uses a wheel chair after an assassination attempt , will become foreign minister in case of an election victory as that position will be claimed by the cdu 's likely coalition partner , the fdp , or stoiber . interior affairs : günther beckstein bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günther beckstein beckstein , 61 , is bavarian interior minister , but well known throughout germany as he is a frequent guest on national talk shows .
he is often 's interviewed on subjects such as terrorism , illegal immigration and domestic safety .
in office for 11 years , he is an ardent promoter of a " no tolerance " policy and has uncompromising views on immigration .
bavaria is the state that deports immigrants fastest and most frequently .
beckstein is a loyal supporter of bavarian premier edmund stoiber and many see him as a potential successor to his current boss . research and education : annette schavan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : annette schavan schavan , 50 , serves as minister for culture and education in the southwestern state of baden-württemberg .
she was defeated in a race to succeed former premier erwin teufel by current premier , günther oettinger .
a theologian , schavan is considered a smart politician , who likes to remain in the background and does n't search the limelight .
in 1998 , she became well known throughout germany when she refused to grant civil-servant status to a muslim teacher who insisted on wearing a veil in the classroom . social affairs , health , senior citizens : ursula von der leyen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ursula von der leyen the 46-year-old minister for social affairs in the northern state of lower saxony is considered one of her party 's rising stars .
last december she was elected as a vice chairman by 94.1 percent of delegates .
von der leyen worked as a doctor before becoming a minister in 2003 .
she is the daughter of a former premier of lower saxony , ernst albrecht , and has seven children . compiled by steffen leidel -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel unveils her campaign team seeking to stem a decline in the polls , conservative chancellor candidate angela merkel announced her team of advisors during the election campaign wednesday .

" we 're a strong team and we 're ready to show germany that we can do things better , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former constitutional court judge paul kirchhof was named as finance expert onto merkel 's dream team one of the most important positions , that of financial affairs , will be filled by paul kirchhof -lrb- photo -rrb- , a former constitutional court judge and tax expert , who would cover the field of finances .
his background has been criticized by some experts .
" politics should not be about appointing friends but about competence and political experience and -lrb- friedrich -rrb- merz is clearly the one with those attributes , " peter lösche , a political scientist at göttingen university , told reuters .
friedrich merz , probably the cdu 's best financial expert , fell out with merkel during the power struggle for leadership within the christian democrats last year , thus leaving a large hole in that area within the party .
kirchhof , who is an independent , has been a vocal advocate of a simplified tax code .
in fact , merz assumed many of his ideas while he served as deputy party chairman .
while some suggested that merkel would create a " mega ministry " for finances , economics and labor in case she gets elected , the cdu leader said this would not make any sense .
there had been speculation that edmund stoiber would give up his job as bavarian premier to take on such a ministry .
" everyone can see that the minister of finance has his plate full , " merkel told german weekly stern .
" i ca n't really imagine merging finances , economics and labor into one ministry . "

he would replace current german interior minister otto schily , should the cdu win on sept.18.
wolfgang schäuble , a longtime foreign policy expert , even under former chancellor helmut kohl , will serve as european and foreign affairs advisor .
ursula von der leyen , minister for social affairs in the state of lowe saxony , will take on family and social affairs .
annette schavan , minister for research and education in the state of baden-württemberg , will advise merkel in the same capacity .
gerda hasselfeldt , a former federal minister for construction , will serve as expert for agricultural , environmental and consumer affairs .
norbert lammert , a vice president of germany 's parliament , covers culture in the " competence team . "
apart from dieter althaus , the premier of the eastern state of thuringia , who will advise merkel on eastern german affairs , all members of the team have in principle agreed to serve in a cabinet under merkel should she be elected chancellor , the cdu leader said bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a potential successor for otto schily , günther beckstein bavarian premier edmund stoiber will not serve in any particular capacity .
but stoiber , who irked conservative allies by making disparaging remarks about eastern germans last week , is expected to attend merkel 's press conference announcing her team .
stoiber 's refusal to commit to moving to berlin until after the poll has been a source of great irritation to merkel and the cdu .
because he is head of the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the csu , nobody could hinder him from taking a post in berlin after sept .

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . the idea -lrb- of distributing condoms -rrb- is crazy .
the thousands of youths who would be attending the world youth day are mostly conservative practicing catholics , and as such , the distribution of condoms at the event would be shocking and offensive to them . - carol it is such a great idea to make use of this event distributing condoms to the youth , considering the fact that it is not all prayers that will happen there .
i just hope they will attach these condoms on flyers with useful information printed on it .
coming from a country such as the philippines , whose population is so high and the rate of hiv-aids is increasing , i definitely agree with this concept ! - sam , philippines police should be distributing the rosary ! - pachla how stupid ! it would be like having a bikini contest during the muslim pilgrimage in mecca or a pig roast at the wailing wall . - p.cassidy how dare they even think of such a thing !
this is a religious gathering of young people who are faithful to the catholic church , if they were n't they would n't bother to travel the distances some are traveling or live under the conditions they will be living under for the days of wyd .
this should not be treated like any other gathering of young people such as a rock concert , etc . - anita wyd is about christ not about sex !
people do not go to wyd to have sex , but if they do that means they did n't get the idea of wyd .
christ never spoke of sex , he spoke of love ... our 21st century seems not see the difference between one and the other ! - bea , toronto , canada we need condoms like we need pornography - both are evils that the church condemns , and rightly so . - grace desouza giving away free condoms would imply that using them is perfectly okay , which it is not . give these young people the respect they deserve - acknowledge that they should and can abstain from immoral behavior . - joan collins distribution of condoms is so contrary to what these young people are about . they are there to grow spiritually , not to be sexually active .

an independent panel of german scientists has warned that the wholesale use of gene testing to check on the health of job applicants is not advisable .
the government wants an outright ban . germany 's national ethics council , which advises the government on ethical questions of modern medicine , recommended tuesday that forcible gene testing in the workplace for hereditary diseases should be subject to strict restrictions under german law .
it did , however , concede that exceptions could be made if third parties might be at risk - in the case of pilots , for example . an urgent need for legislation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some one hundred thousand gene tests are carried out in germany every year - many of them ordered by employers seeking to check on the long-term health risks of people applying for jobs . germany 's national ethics council believes that legislation protecting workers and employees is urgently needed to avoid misuse of data gathered from these tests . jochen taupitz , a legal advisor on the panel , believes that existing german regulations are lagging far behind the rapid advances in gene technology . " there is no law in germany governing the use of these tests in a detailed manner , " he said .
" all jurisdiction made by german courts so far is rather vague and does not match the technological progress in this field . " restrictions in germany , forcible gene tests made the headlines after a young teacher was refused employment two years ago for failing to undergo a test of her genes .
when school authorities learned that the applicant had a family record of huntington 's disease , a hereditary disease that affects the human nervous system , they wanted to find out whether she could also develop the illness .
a court ruled in the woman 's favor . kristiane weber-hassemer is the head of the german ethics council .
" we have come to agree that restrictions must be imposed here , " she said .
" this is especially needed to protect employees against dismissal for medical reasons .
restrictions must be put on the period of validity of gene diagnoses and predictions about the chances that a disease might occur . " 5-year diagnostic validity the scientists are demanding that the diagnostic validity of a gene test should not go beyond 5 years and that test results must be labeled negative if the possibility of an outbreak of a specific disease is estimated at less than 50 percent . efforts by chancellor schröder 's center-left government to adopt new gene laws have been halted until after early elections in germany in september this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the recommendations made by the ethics council tuesday , however , do n't affect other areas of public life - including possible gene screening by insurance companies .
in this area , german companies have voluntarily imposed a moratorium banning such testing of insurance applicants until 2011 .
but the experts on the ethics council believe that strong regulations will then be needed more urgently than ever . uwe hessler -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de are you -lrb- genetically -rrb- up to the job ?

" all jurisdiction made by german courts so far is rather vague and does not match the technological progress in this field . " restrictions in germany , forcible gene tests made the headlines after a young teacher was refused employment two years ago for failing to undergo a test of her genes .

at the youth gathering they have been going on the offensive from day one . the pilgrims arriving in cologne on monday morning were certainly left in no doubt .
world youth day -lrb- wyd -rrb- information points at the railway station and throughout the city center were already waiting on the youth from around the globe to provide guidance - on navigating the city and the events of wyd that is .
the city center appears dotted with stages that host the events of wyd , makeshift tv studios were being set up and posters of the new pope were gracing walls and shop windows .
one day before the official start of world youth day 2005 in cologne things seemed to be running smoothly .
critics on the ground from day one but at the same time criticism was fermenting in the underground - literally .
in the basement of a luxury hotel some 10 minutes walk from the main station , the " world youth day 4 all " -lrb- wyd4all -rrb- coalition was also kicking off with their first press conference on monday morning .
the coalition of grassroots organizations bemoans the lack of room the wyd affords to discuss let alone criticize the church 's stance on controversial issues like contraception or the role of women .
strategic focus on specific issues their monday morning press briefing focused on hiv / aids prevention and the stance of the catholic church on the issue .
by banning the use of condoms " our church leaders are putting the world population at risk , " said molly o 'gorman from the washington-based organization catholics for a free choice which is part of the wyd4all coalition .
despite a host of matters and general themes on which critics disagree with the catholic church , o 'gorman insists that the focus on a specific issue such as this can steer a lot more people into action .
" it also leaves the church leaders with very little wiggle room , " she added .
bildunterschrift : poster for gay and lesbian youths at world youth day more church leaders speaking out according to catholics for a free choice a number of catholic bishops around the world - many from developing nations - have softened their stance on condom use , including the indian catholic bishop 's conference which has agreed to " provide all information about it " to couples seeking advice .
on a number of issues more and more bishops are coming out of the closet against the established views of the senior leadership including the pope .
molly o 'gorman is convinced that in the medium term this could lead to an internal revolution within the church .
and this is backed by pressure from the grassroots : surveys show that catholics around the world are defying the official vatican line in their daily lives .
how to address the crowd but how do the critics carry their message to the believers attending world youth day ?
wyd 2005 resembles the " communist world youth games , " german wyd4all spokesperson tobias raschke told the left-leaning newspaper tageszeitung recently .
and just like in those mass events of the cold war there is no room for the discussion of contentious but highly relevant issues , he said .
only last week german bishops issued a statement that essentially labeled two of germany 's most prominent church critics personae non gratae at the world youth day .
but catholic youth appear to have remained surprisingly quiet in response .
many young people come for the party , admitted raschke .
but then why should they listen to the critics ?
" we know that young people do feel strongly about many of the issues .
all we do is to provide information and the chance to discuss , if they so wish . "
it remains to be seen how much headway the critics can make during world youth day 2005 in the face of seemingly overwhelming enthusiasm for the visit of the new pope .

with a long line of dramatic wins and losses , the arch-rivalry between the two neighbors always guarantees a sensational game . german-dutch soccer matches , even if they 're just friendlies , are seldom nice .
with a long line of dramatic wins and losses , the arch-rivalry between the two neighbors always guarantees a sensational game .
the german national soccer team will be braced for a tough show when they face-off against marco van basten 's netherlands wednesday night in rotterdam .
victories against the oranje have been few and far between in the past two decades , with just three in 11 encounters .
the last one was in 1996 at de kuip stadium in rotterdam , when the german team managed to squeeze out a 1-0 win thanks to jürgen klinsmann 's penalty conversion in the 19th minute .
but besides the fact of beating an old foe , klinsmann , the former striker-turned coach , would like for his side to do something a german team has not accomplished since october 2000 - that is to finally beat one of the world 's top teams .
since their 1-0 victory over england five years ago , germany has reeled off a string of 14 losses or draws against quality competition .
a third-place finish at the confederations cup in june may look impressive in the record books , but wins against australia , tunisia or mexico wo n't keep the experts quiet for long .
klinsmann , usually the epitome of sunshine and optimism – a carry-over from his year-round home in california – is not upbeat about wednesday 's match .
" this game has come too early for us , " he said .
" a lot of our players have just got back into training after the confederations cup . "
the return of experience the big stars of the confed cup were youngsters - the 20-year-old striker lukas podolski and the year-older midfielder bastian schweinsteiger - who are being left behind for the rotterdam game . according to the coaching staff , the two are getting well-deserved breaks .
their absence may be the break some of the players from years past have been waiting for .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : didi hamann -lrb- l -rrb- in his last apperance in german national uniform against latvia at euro 2004 for wednesday 's friendly , liverpool midfielder dietmar " didi " hamann , has been called back into the national squad after recovering from a foot injury , and more than a year after a less than stellar performance at the euro 2004 .
" he is the kind of player who despite a few injuries in the past few months has played the style that fits him , " klinsmann told kicker magazine .
" and he had a great deal to do with fc liverpool 's victory in the champions league . "
the 33-year-old defender christian wörns is also ready to play again after injuries sidelined him for months .
it should be a welcome return in the eyes of goalkeeper oliver kahn .
he and his colleagues jens lehmann and timo hildebrand had to fetch the ball from out of the net 11 times in five games at the confed cup .
miroslav klose , already with three goals in the bundesliga , also missed the confed cup .
the starter-status of the six-goal scorer at the world cup 2002 has been threatened by the rise of lukas podolski .
tops in the bundesliga does n't mean tops in holland bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roy makaay : flying high with bayern munich but grounded on dutch national team on the opposite side , the fate of dutch striker roy makaay , who leads the german bundesliga with five strikes in two matches , looks to be the one sitting on the bench .
the traditional dutch 4-3-3 with just one true striker means that , just as in years past , makaay will be watching from the sidelines most of the match .
ruud van nistelrooy has the better cards in the mind of coach van basten .
the statistics speak loads against makaay : only six goals in 42 matches for oranje .
still , german coaches think he should be a starter .
" if van basten wants to make things difficult for -lrb- german -rrb- goalkeeper kahn , then he should start makaay , " bayern coach felix magath commented .
high-risk match in rotterdam regardless of the line-up and the plays on the field , the historic rivalry between germany and the netherlands guarantees a full stadium , with thousands of fans crossing the border into " enemy " territory to cheer on their favorites .
because the animosity runs deep among soccer fans , security officials are taking no chances .
many remember all-to-well the 1996 riot in rotterdam when three people were stabbed and some 70 taken into custody following clashes between german hooligans and dutch police .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans can expect a strong police presence in rotterdam this time around , authorities from both countries are cooperating in patrolling the 572-kilometer border , stopping cars and trains for suspected hooligans .
dutch police have also been given the authority to search visitors in the city 's downtown .
there will be no alcohol consumption in or around the de kuip stadium .
and some 2,000 german fans will be escorted to the ahoy complex in the southern part of the city to pick up their tickets , thereby avoiding the city center and any possible mingling with dutch fans .
such security precautions have grown more and more common in the world of european soccer , where nationalist sentiments combine with sports fever to reach dangerous levels .
the open borders and ease of transportation between rival countries also means that fans can follow their teams almost anywhere .

at the youth gathering they have been going on the offensive from day one . the pilgrims arriving in cologne on monday morning were certainly left in no doubt .
world youth day -lrb- wyd -rrb- information points at the railway station and throughout the city center were already waiting on the youth from around the globe to provide guidance - on navigating the city and the events of wyd that is .
the city center appears dotted with stages that host the events of wyd , makeshift tv studios were being set up and posters of the new pope were gracing walls and shop windows .
one day before the official start of world youth day 2005 in cologne things seemed to be running smoothly .
critics on the ground from day one but at the same time criticism was fermenting in the underground - literally .
in the basement of a luxury hotel some 10 minutes walk from the main station , the " world youth day 4 all " -lrb- wyd4all -rrb- coalition was also kicking off with their first press conference on monday morning .
the coalition of grassroots organizations bemoans the lack of room the wyd affords to discuss let alone criticize the church 's stance on controversial issues like contraception or the role of women .
strategic focus on specific issues their monday morning press briefing focused on hiv / aids prevention and the stance of the catholic church on the issue .
by banning the use of condoms " our church leaders are putting the world population at risk , " said molly o 'gorman from the washington-based organization catholics for a free choice which is part of the wyd4all coalition .
despite a host of matters and general themes on which critics disagree with the catholic church , o 'gorman insists that the focus on a specific issue such as this can steer a lot more people into action .
" it also leaves the church leaders with very little wiggle room , " she added .
bildunterschrift : poster for gay and lesbian youths at world youth day more church leaders speaking out according to catholics for a free choice a number of catholic bishops around the world - many from developing nations - have softened their stance on condom use , including the indian catholic bishop 's conference which has agreed to " provide all information about it " to couples seeking advice .
on a number of issues more and more bishops are coming out of the closet against the established views of the senior leadership including the pope .
molly o 'gorman is convinced that in the medium term this could lead to an internal revolution within the church .
and this is backed by pressure from the grassroots : surveys show that catholics around the world are defying the official vatican line in their daily lives .
how to address the crowd but how do the critics carry their message to the believers attending world youth day ?
wyd 2005 resembles the " communist world youth games , " german wyd4all spokesperson tobias raschke told the left-leaning newspaper tageszeitung recently .
and just like in those mass events of the cold war there is no room for the discussion of contentious but highly relevant issues , he said .
only last week german bishops issued a statement that essentially labeled two of germany 's most prominent church critics personae non gratae at the world youth day .
but catholic youth appear to have remained surprisingly quiet in response .
many young people come for the party , admitted raschke .
but then why should they listen to the critics ?
" we know that young people do feel strongly about many of the issues .
all we do is to provide information and the chance to discuss , if they so wish . "
it remains to be seen how much headway the critics can make during world youth day 2005 in the face of seemingly overwhelming enthusiasm for the visit of the new pope .

with a long line of dramatic wins and losses , the arch-rivalry between the two neighbors always guarantees a sensational game .
the german national soccer team will be braced for a tough show when they face-off against marco van basten 's netherlands wednesday night in rotterdam .
victories against the oranje have been few and far between in the past two decades , with just three in 11 encounters .
the last one was in 1996 at de kuip stadium in rotterdam , when the german team managed to squeeze out a 1-0 win thanks to jürgen klinsmann 's penalty conversion in the 19th minute .
but besides the fact of beating an old foe , klinsmann , the former striker-turned coach , would like for his side to do something a german team has not accomplished since october 2000 - that is to finally beat one of the world 's top teams .

an independent panel of german scientists has warned that the wholesale use of gene testing to check on the health of job applicants is not advisable .
the government wants an outright ban . germany 's national ethics council , which advises the government on ethical questions of modern medicine , recommended tuesday that forcible gene testing in the workplace for hereditary diseases should be subject to strict restrictions under german law .
it did , however , concede that exceptions could be made if third parties might be at risk - in the case of pilots , for example . an urgent need for legislation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some one hundred thousand gene tests are carried out in germany every year - many of them ordered by employers seeking to check on the long-term health risks of people applying for jobs . germany 's national ethics council believes that legislation protecting workers and employees is urgently needed to avoid misuse of data gathered from these tests . jochen taupitz , a legal advisor on the panel , believes that existing german regulations are lagging far behind the rapid advances in gene technology . " there is no law in germany governing the use of these tests in a detailed manner , " he said .
" all jurisdiction made by german courts so far is rather vague and does not match the technological progress in this field . " restrictions in germany , forcible gene tests made the headlines after a young teacher was refused employment two years ago for failing to undergo a test of her genes .
when school authorities learned that the applicant had a family record of huntington 's disease , a hereditary disease that affects the human nervous system , they wanted to find out whether she could also develop the illness .
a court ruled in the woman 's favor . kristiane weber-hassemer is the head of the german ethics council .
" we have come to agree that restrictions must be imposed here , " she said .
" this is especially needed to protect employees against dismissal for medical reasons .
restrictions must be put on the period of validity of gene diagnoses and predictions about the chances that a disease might occur . " 5-year diagnostic validity the scientists are demanding that the diagnostic validity of a gene test should not go beyond 5 years and that test results must be labeled negative if the possibility of an outbreak of a specific disease is estimated at less than 50 percent . efforts by chancellor schröder 's center-left government to adopt new gene laws have been halted until after early elections in germany in september this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the recommendations made by the ethics council tuesday , however , do n't affect other areas of public life - including possible gene screening by insurance companies .
in this area , german companies have voluntarily imposed a moratorium banning such testing of insurance applicants until 2011 .
but the experts on the ethics council believe that strong regulations will then be needed more urgently than ever . uwe hessler -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de are you -lrb- genetically -rrb- up to the job ?

since their 1-0 victory over england five years ago , germany has reeled off a string of 14 losses or draws against quality competition .
a third-place finish at the confederations cup in june may look impressive in the record books , but wins against australia , tunisia or mexico wo n't keep the experts quiet for long .
klinsmann , usually the epitome of sunshine and optimism – a carry-over from his year-round home in california – is not upbeat about wednesday 's match .
" this game has come too early for us , " he said .
" a lot of our players have just got back into training after the confederations cup . "
the return of experience the big stars of the confed cup were youngsters - the 20-year-old striker lukas podolski and the year-older midfielder bastian schweinsteiger - who are being left behind for the rotterdam game . according to the coaching staff , the two are getting well-deserved breaks .
their absence may be the break some of the players from years past have been waiting for .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : didi hamann -lrb- l -rrb- in his last apperance in german national uniform against latvia at euro 2004 for wednesday 's friendly , liverpool midfielder dietmar " didi " hamann , has been called back into the national squad after recovering from a foot injury , and more than a year after a less than stellar performance at the euro 2004 .
" he is the kind of player who despite a few injuries in the past few months has played the style that fits him , " klinsmann told kicker magazine .
" and he had a great deal to do with fc liverpool 's victory in the champions league . "
the 33-year-old defender christian wörns is also ready to play again after injuries sidelined him for months .
it should be a welcome return in the eyes of goalkeeper oliver kahn .
he and his colleagues jens lehmann and timo hildebrand had to fetch the ball from out of the net 11 times in five games at the confed cup .
miroslav klose , already with three goals in the bundesliga , also missed the confed cup .
the starter-status of the six-goal scorer at the world cup 2002 has been threatened by the rise of lukas podolski .
tops in the bundesliga does n't mean tops in holland bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roy makaay : flying high with bayern munich but grounded on dutch national team on the opposite side , the fate of dutch striker roy makaay , who leads the german bundesliga with five strikes in two matches , looks to be the one sitting on the bench .
the traditional dutch 4-3-3 with just one true striker means that , just as in years past , makaay will be watching from the sidelines most of the match .
ruud van nistelrooy has the better cards in the mind of coach van basten .
the statistics speak loads against makaay : only six goals in 42 matches for oranje .
still , german coaches think he should be a starter .
" if van basten wants to make things difficult for -lrb- german -rrb- goalkeeper kahn , then he should start makaay , " bayern coach felix magath commented .
high-risk match in rotterdam regardless of the line-up and the plays on the field , the historic rivalry between germany and the netherlands guarantees a full stadium , with thousands of fans crossing the border into " enemy " territory to cheer on their favorites .
because the animosity runs deep among soccer fans , security officials are taking no chances .
many remember all-to-well the 1996 riot in rotterdam when three people were stabbed and some 70 taken into custody following clashes between german hooligans and dutch police .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans can expect a strong police presence in rotterdam this time around , authorities from both countries are cooperating in patrolling the 572-kilometer border , stopping cars and trains for suspected hooligans .
dutch police have also been given the authority to search visitors in the city 's downtown .
there will be no alcohol consumption in or around the de kuip stadium .
and some 2,000 german fans will be escorted to the ahoy complex in the southern part of the city to pick up their tickets , thereby avoiding the city center and any possible mingling with dutch fans .
such security precautions have grown more and more common in the world of european soccer , where nationalist sentiments combine with sports fever to reach dangerous levels .
the open borders and ease of transportation between rival countries also means that fans can follow their teams almost anywhere .

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . the idea -lrb- of distributing condoms -rrb- is crazy .
the thousands of youths who would be attending the world youth day are mostly conservative practicing catholics , and as such , the distribution of condoms at the event would be shocking and offensive to them . - carol it is such a great idea to make use of this event distributing condoms to the youth , considering the fact that it is not all prayers that will happen there .
i just hope they will attach these condoms on flyers with useful information printed on it .
coming from a country such as the philippines , whose population is so high and the rate of hiv-aids is increasing , i definitely agree with this concept ! - sam , philippines police should be distributing the rosary ! - pachla how stupid ! it would be like having a bikini contest during the muslim pilgrimage in mecca or a pig roast at the wailing wall . - p.cassidy how dare they even think of such a thing !
this is a religious gathering of young people who are faithful to the catholic church , if they were n't they would n't bother to travel the distances some are traveling or live under the conditions they will be living under for the days of wyd .
this should not be treated like any other gathering of young people such as a rock concert , etc . - anita wyd is about christ not about sex !
people do not go to wyd to have sex , but if they do that means they did n't get the idea of wyd .
christ never spoke of sex , he spoke of love ... our 21st century seems not see the difference between one and the other ! - bea , toronto , canada we need condoms like we need pornography - both are evils that the church condemns , and rightly so . - grace desouza giving away free condoms would imply that using them is perfectly okay , which it is not . give these young people the respect they deserve - acknowledge that they should and can abstain from immoral behavior . - joan collins distribution of condoms is so contrary to what these young people are about . they are there to grow spiritually , not to be sexually active .
we pray that those who wish to destroy the soul will be converted to know there is much more to life than a sexual appetite . - carol finerty condoms should not be distributed .
i think to do so shows arrogance beyond belief and insensitivity on behalf of those who push such an agenda . - fergal o 'neill did we not learn anything from our beloved holy father john paul ii regarding the culture of life and the theology of the body ?
we are made in the image and likeness of god and need to live for him and live a life of self-sacrifice . - frances huck dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de condom plans cancelled at youth fest as 400,000 catholic young people from around the world prepare to make their way to cologne for world youth day , a spat over condom distribution has erupted .

an independent panel of german scientists has warned that the wholesale use of gene testing to check on the health of job applicants is not advisable .
the government wants an outright ban . germany 's national ethics council , which advises the government on ethical questions of modern medicine , recommended tuesday that forcible gene testing in the workplace for hereditary diseases should be subject to strict restrictions under german law .
it did , however , concede that exceptions could be made if third parties might be at risk - in the case of pilots , for example . an urgent need for legislation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some one hundred thousand gene tests are carried out in germany every year - many of them ordered by employers seeking to check on the long-term health risks of people applying for jobs . germany 's national ethics council believes that legislation protecting workers and employees is urgently needed to avoid misuse of data gathered from these tests . jochen taupitz , a legal advisor on the panel , believes that existing german regulations are lagging far behind the rapid advances in gene technology . " there is no law in germany governing the use of these tests in a detailed manner , " he said .
" all jurisdiction made by german courts so far is rather vague and does not match the technological progress in this field . " restrictions in germany , forcible gene tests made the headlines after a young teacher was refused employment two years ago for failing to undergo a test of her genes .
when school authorities learned that the applicant had a family record of huntington 's disease , a hereditary disease that affects the human nervous system , they wanted to find out whether she could also develop the illness .
a court ruled in the woman 's favor . kristiane weber-hassemer is the head of the german ethics council .
" we have come to agree that restrictions must be imposed here , " she said .
" this is especially needed to protect employees against dismissal for medical reasons .
restrictions must be put on the period of validity of gene diagnoses and predictions about the chances that a disease might occur . " 5-year diagnostic validity the scientists are demanding that the diagnostic validity of a gene test should not go beyond 5 years and that test results must be labeled negative if the possibility of an outbreak of a specific disease is estimated at less than 50 percent . efforts by chancellor schröder 's center-left government to adopt new gene laws have been halted until after early elections in germany in september this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the recommendations made by the ethics council tuesday , however , do n't affect other areas of public life - including possible gene screening by insurance companies .
in this area , german companies have voluntarily imposed a moratorium banning such testing of insurance applicants until 2011 .

at the youth gathering they have been going on the offensive from day one . the pilgrims arriving in cologne on monday morning were certainly left in no doubt .
world youth day -lrb- wyd -rrb- information points at the railway station and throughout the city center were already waiting on the youth from around the globe to provide guidance - on navigating the city and the events of wyd that is .
the city center appears dotted with stages that host the events of wyd , makeshift tv studios were being set up and posters of the new pope were gracing walls and shop windows .
one day before the official start of world youth day 2005 in cologne things seemed to be running smoothly .
critics on the ground from day one but at the same time criticism was fermenting in the underground - literally .
in the basement of a luxury hotel some 10 minutes walk from the main station , the " world youth day 4 all " -lrb- wyd4all -rrb- coalition was also kicking off with their first press conference on monday morning .
the coalition of grassroots organizations bemoans the lack of room the wyd affords to discuss let alone criticize the church 's stance on controversial issues like contraception or the role of women .
strategic focus on specific issues their monday morning press briefing focused on hiv / aids prevention and the stance of the catholic church on the issue .
by banning the use of condoms " our church leaders are putting the world population at risk , " said molly o 'gorman from the washington-based organization catholics for a free choice which is part of the wyd4all coalition .
despite a host of matters and general themes on which critics disagree with the catholic church , o 'gorman insists that the focus on a specific issue such as this can steer a lot more people into action .
" it also leaves the church leaders with very little wiggle room , " she added .
bildunterschrift : poster for gay and lesbian youths at world youth day more church leaders speaking out according to catholics for a free choice a number of catholic bishops around the world - many from developing nations - have softened their stance on condom use , including the indian catholic bishop 's conference which has agreed to " provide all information about it " to couples seeking advice .
on a number of issues more and more bishops are coming out of the closet against the established views of the senior leadership including the pope .
molly o 'gorman is convinced that in the medium term this could lead to an internal revolution within the church .
and this is backed by pressure from the grassroots : surveys show that catholics around the world are defying the official vatican line in their daily lives .
how to address the crowd but how do the critics carry their message to the believers attending world youth day ?
wyd 2005 resembles the " communist world youth games , " german wyd4all spokesperson tobias raschke told the left-leaning newspaper tageszeitung recently .
and just like in those mass events of the cold war there is no room for the discussion of contentious but highly relevant issues , he said .
only last week german bishops issued a statement that essentially labeled two of germany 's most prominent church critics personae non gratae at the world youth day .
but catholic youth appear to have remained surprisingly quiet in response .
many young people come for the party , admitted raschke .
but then why should they listen to the critics ?
" we know that young people do feel strongly about many of the issues .
all we do is to provide information and the chance to discuss , if they so wish . "
it remains to be seen how much headway the critics can make during world youth day 2005 in the face of seemingly overwhelming enthusiasm for the visit of the new pope .

dw-world has compiled biographical information about the members . merkel 's troupe , which has already been rechristened " incompetence team " by chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats , is not really a shadow cabinet as it 's still unclear whether the team members will eventually fill their respective positions in a conservative-led cabinet . most members have said they are willing to serve as ministers , with thuringia 's premier , dieter althaus , being the one exception .
bavarian premier edmund stoiber , who could lay claim to any ministry , has still not made up his mind about whether he wants to move to berlin .
and the election outcome will also be decisive as merkel 's christian democrats might have to hand ministries to coalition partners - either the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , or the social democrats in a grand coalition . bildunterschrift : the competence team -lrb- from left -rrb- : norbert lammert , günther beckstein , gerda hasselfeldt , wolfgang schäuble , peter müller , ursula von der leyen , anette schavan , paul kirchhof , dieter althaus .
on the right are angela merkel and edmund stoiber the " competence team " is therefore meant to give a face to important policy areas .
dw-world offers some background on its members . agriculture , environment and consumer protection : gerda hasselfeldt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerda hasselfeldt hasselfeldt , 55 , is widely unknown despite serving as her party 's deputy leader in parliament and holding the office of minister for construction and later health under former chancellor helmut kohl from 1989 to 1992 .
she had been accused of a cold leadership style and refusing to listen to ministry officials .
the mother of two children later became her party 's financial affairs spokeswoman in parliament .
a macro-economist , she grew up in a rural part of bavaria .
her father was a farmer , butcher and mayor of a small town in the eastern part of the state . culture : norbert lammert bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : norbert lammert lammert is deputy president of germany 's parliament and has been his party 's culture and media spokesman .
the 57-year-old social scientist is the son of a baker and comes from western germany 's industrial ruhr area .
much of his political career has been focused on education policies , but he also served as junior minister in germany 's ministry of economics from 1994 . eastern german reconstruction : dieter althaus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter althaus althaus might play a decisive role during the election .
the 47-year-old premier of the eastern state of thuringia is meant to become the cdu 's face of eastern germany and is expected to placate voters in the east after bavarian premier edmund stoiber accused them of being " frustrated " and called on voters in the western parts of the country to not let easterners decide the outcome of the election .
initially considered bland , althaus succeeded thuringia 's charismatic former premier , bernhard vogel , in 2003 and has since become a constant guest on german talk shows .
he has called on his party colleagues to show willingness to compromise with the ruling coalition of social democrats and greens and veered from established cdu views on labor policies and subsidies for the eastern states .
a former professor of mathematics and physics , he still avoids open confrontation with party friends and is considered a close merkel ally . economy and labor : peter müller bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter müller müller , 49 , is premier of the southwestern state of saarland and is seen as a generalist .
he is considered to be a definite member of a cabinet under merkel , but not necessarily in the same function as the one he has taken on now .
bavarian premier edmund stoiber might claim the economics and labor ministry after all .
müller has become well known throughout germany as president of his party 's commission on immigration .
a lawyer by trade , he is considered a " liberal " conservative , who does not always follow party lines , as has been the case regarding immigration issues as well as his opposition to the war in iraq . finances : paul kirchhof bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul kirchhof a former constitutional court judge , kirchhof is not a member of the christian democrats and is respected as a tax expert across party lines .
the 62-year-old law professor from heidelberg has introduced a radical tax reform model : he wants to do away with all forms of tax subsidies and lower the highest income tax rate to 25 percent .
kirchhof , who has four children , has also been lobbying for more state help to families with children .
during his last year as constitutional court judge , he lowered the tax burden on families by billions .
observers doubt that he will actually serve in merkel 's cabinet should she become chancellor .
many cdu members consider his ideas too radical .
he also rejects merkel 's plan to raise vat by 2 percent . foreign and security policy : wolfgang schäuble bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang schäuble without a doubt , schäuble is one of the cdu 's most competent politicians and a generalist like müller .
a former party leader , he has concentrated on international politics for years and shaped the cdu 's views in this area .
schäuble recently visited us president george w. bush , as he again pointed out during statements on wednesday .
his relationship with merkel is not the best , however .
last fall , he rejected her offer to become her deputy for financial and economic affairs in parliament .

an independent panel of german scientists has warned that the wholesale use of gene testing to check on the health of job applicants is not advisable .
the government wants an outright ban . germany 's national ethics council , which advises the government on ethical questions of modern medicine , recommended tuesday that forcible gene testing in the workplace for hereditary diseases should be subject to strict restrictions under german law .
it did , however , concede that exceptions could be made if third parties might be at risk - in the case of pilots , for example . an urgent need for legislation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some one hundred thousand gene tests are carried out in germany every year - many of them ordered by employers seeking to check on the long-term health risks of people applying for jobs . germany 's national ethics council believes that legislation protecting workers and employees is urgently needed to avoid misuse of data gathered from these tests . jochen taupitz , a legal advisor on the panel , believes that existing german regulations are lagging far behind the rapid advances in gene technology . " there is no law in germany governing the use of these tests in a detailed manner , " he said .
" all jurisdiction made by german courts so far is rather vague and does not match the technological progress in this field . " restrictions in germany , forcible gene tests made the headlines after a young teacher was refused employment two years ago for failing to undergo a test of her genes .
when school authorities learned that the applicant had a family record of huntington 's disease , a hereditary disease that affects the human nervous system , they wanted to find out whether she could also develop the illness .
a court ruled in the woman 's favor . kristiane weber-hassemer is the head of the german ethics council .
" we have come to agree that restrictions must be imposed here , " she said .
" this is especially needed to protect employees against dismissal for medical reasons .
restrictions must be put on the period of validity of gene diagnoses and predictions about the chances that a disease might occur . " 5-year diagnostic validity the scientists are demanding that the diagnostic validity of a gene test should not go beyond 5 years and that test results must be labeled negative if the possibility of an outbreak of a specific disease is estimated at less than 50 percent . efforts by chancellor schröder 's center-left government to adopt new gene laws have been halted until after early elections in germany in september this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the recommendations made by the ethics council tuesday , however , do n't affect other areas of public life - including possible gene screening by insurance companies .
in this area , german companies have voluntarily imposed a moratorium banning such testing of insurance applicants until 2011 .
but the experts on the ethics council believe that strong regulations will then be needed more urgently than ever . uwe hessler -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de are you -lrb- genetically -rrb- up to the job ?

officials suspect that company officials knew of the announcement and began illegal trading but declined to identify any suspects .
meanwhile , a number of top executives at german-us auto giant daimlerchrysler are cashing in on the recent sharp rise in the company 's share price , according to mandatory legal filings published on the automaker 's website : six managers have exercised options to buy daimlerchrysler shares at a discounted price and then immediately re-sold those shares at a much higher market price on the same day , reaping fat profits from the transactions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 17.08.2005 -pipe- 14:00 utc officials investigate daimlerchrysler german regulators have begun a formal investigation into possible insider trading at daimlerchrysler , officials said tuesday .
the probe began after the german financial services regulatory agency bafin ran a check following a 10 percent hike in share prices before the resignation of chief executive jürgen schrempp last month .
officials suspect that company officials knew of the announcement and began illegal trading but declined to identify any suspects .
meanwhile , a number of top executives at german-us auto giant daimlerchrysler are cashing in on the recent sharp rise in the company 's share price , according to mandatory legal filings published on the automaker 's website : six managers have exercised options to buy daimlerchrysler shares at a discounted price and then immediately re-sold those shares at a much higher market price on the same day , reaping fat profits from the transactions .
two board members , thomas sidlik and eckhard cordes , and four other top executives , harald boestler , herbert kauffmann , ulrich walker , wolfgang diez and guenter egle , all liquidated their holdings since the announcement , netting a total 1.26 million euros -lrb- $ 1.56 million -rrb- , according to daimlerchrysler documents .
also , the managers received additional cash payments to make up for differences between the reference price and the actual strike price of the options , daimlerchrysler said .
all in all , the managers took home more than 1.5 million euros in profits from the deals .
the transactions were criticized by shareholder groups , who argued that the variable components of managers ' wages should not be linked to the share price but to a company 's long-term profits and accused managers of dipping freely into company coffers . dw-world.de schrempp : exit planned long ago analysts say the departure of daimlerchrysler chief executive jürgen schrempp marks the merciful end of a failed expansion strategy .
the stock market greeted the announcement .

" we 're a strong team and we 're ready to show germany that we can do things better , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former constitutional court judge paul kirchhof was named as finance expert onto merkel 's dream team one of the most important positions , that of financial affairs , will be filled by paul kirchhof -lrb- photo -rrb- , a former constitutional court judge and tax expert , who would cover the field of finances .
his background has been criticized by some experts .
" politics should not be about appointing friends but about competence and political experience and -lrb- friedrich -rrb- merz is clearly the one with those attributes , " peter lösche , a political scientist at göttingen university , told reuters .
friedrich merz , probably the cdu 's best financial expert , fell out with merkel during the power struggle for leadership within the christian democrats last year , thus leaving a large hole in that area within the party .
kirchhof , who is an independent , has been a vocal advocate of a simplified tax code .
in fact , merz assumed many of his ideas while he served as deputy party chairman .
while some suggested that merkel would create a " mega ministry " for finances , economics and labor in case she gets elected , the cdu leader said this would not make any sense .
there had been speculation that edmund stoiber would give up his job as bavarian premier to take on such a ministry .
" everyone can see that the minister of finance has his plate full , " merkel told german weekly stern .
" i ca n't really imagine merging finances , economics and labor into one ministry . "
beckstein to cover interior affairs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter müller , currently premier of the small state of saarland the new economics minister then could be peter müller -lrb- photo -rrb- , premier of the small western state of saarland , who will cover that area in merkel 's shadow cabinet .
for interior affairs , bavarian interior minister günther beckstein got the nod .
he would replace current german interior minister otto schily , should the cdu win on sept.18.
wolfgang schäuble , a longtime foreign policy expert , even under former chancellor helmut kohl , will serve as european and foreign affairs advisor .
ursula von der leyen , minister for social affairs in the state of lowe saxony , will take on family and social affairs .
annette schavan , minister for research and education in the state of baden-württemberg , will advise merkel in the same capacity .
gerda hasselfeldt , a former federal minister for construction , will serve as expert for agricultural , environmental and consumer affairs .
norbert lammert , a vice president of germany 's parliament , covers culture in the " competence team . "
apart from dieter althaus , the premier of the eastern state of thuringia , who will advise merkel on eastern german affairs , all members of the team have in principle agreed to serve in a cabinet under merkel should she be elected chancellor , the cdu leader said bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a potential successor for otto schily , günther beckstein bavarian premier edmund stoiber will not serve in any particular capacity .
but stoiber , who irked conservative allies by making disparaging remarks about eastern germans last week , is expected to attend merkel 's press conference announcing her team .
stoiber 's refusal to commit to moving to berlin until after the poll has been a source of great irritation to merkel and the cdu .
because he is head of the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the csu , nobody could hinder him from taking a post in berlin after sept .

" we 're a strong team and we 're ready to show germany that we can do things better , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former constitutional court judge paul kirchhof was named as finance expert onto merkel 's dream team one of the most important positions , that of financial affairs , will be filled by paul kirchhof -lrb- photo -rrb- , a former constitutional court judge and tax expert , who would cover the field of finances .
his background has been criticized by some experts .
" politics should not be about appointing friends but about competence and political experience and -lrb- friedrich -rrb- merz is clearly the one with those attributes , " peter lösche , a political scientist at göttingen university , told reuters .
friedrich merz , probably the cdu 's best financial expert , fell out with merkel during the power struggle for leadership within the christian democrats last year , thus leaving a large hole in that area within the party .
kirchhof , who is an independent , has been a vocal advocate of a simplified tax code .
in fact , merz assumed many of his ideas while he served as deputy party chairman .
while some suggested that merkel would create a " mega ministry " for finances , economics and labor in case she gets elected , the cdu leader said this would not make any sense .
there had been speculation that edmund stoiber would give up his job as bavarian premier to take on such a ministry .

his background has been criticized by some experts .
" politics should not be about appointing friends but about competence and political experience and -lrb- friedrich -rrb- merz is clearly the one with those attributes , " peter lösche , a political scientist at göttingen university , told reuters .
friedrich merz , probably the cdu 's best financial expert , fell out with merkel during the power struggle for leadership within the christian democrats last year , thus leaving a large hole in that area within the party .
kirchhof , who is an independent , has been a vocal advocate of a simplified tax code .
in fact , merz assumed many of his ideas while he served as deputy party chairman .
while some suggested that merkel would create a " mega ministry " for finances , economics and labor in case she gets elected , the cdu leader said this would not make any sense .
there had been speculation that edmund stoiber would give up his job as bavarian premier to take on such a ministry .

an independent panel of german scientists has warned that the wholesale use of gene testing to check on the health of job applicants is not advisable .
the government wants an outright ban . germany 's national ethics council , which advises the government on ethical questions of modern medicine , recommended tuesday that forcible gene testing in the workplace for hereditary diseases should be subject to strict restrictions under german law .
it did , however , concede that exceptions could be made if third parties might be at risk - in the case of pilots , for example . an urgent need for legislation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some one hundred thousand gene tests are carried out in germany every year - many of them ordered by employers seeking to check on the long-term health risks of people applying for jobs . germany 's national ethics council believes that legislation protecting workers and employees is urgently needed to avoid misuse of data gathered from these tests . jochen taupitz , a legal advisor on the panel , believes that existing german regulations are lagging far behind the rapid advances in gene technology . " there is no law in germany governing the use of these tests in a detailed manner , " he said .
" all jurisdiction made by german courts so far is rather vague and does not match the technological progress in this field . " restrictions in germany , forcible gene tests made the headlines after a young teacher was refused employment two years ago for failing to undergo a test of her genes .
when school authorities learned that the applicant had a family record of huntington 's disease , a hereditary disease that affects the human nervous system , they wanted to find out whether she could also develop the illness .
a court ruled in the woman 's favor . kristiane weber-hassemer is the head of the german ethics council .
" we have come to agree that restrictions must be imposed here , " she said .
" this is especially needed to protect employees against dismissal for medical reasons .
restrictions must be put on the period of validity of gene diagnoses and predictions about the chances that a disease might occur . " 5-year diagnostic validity the scientists are demanding that the diagnostic validity of a gene test should not go beyond 5 years and that test results must be labeled negative if the possibility of an outbreak of a specific disease is estimated at less than 50 percent . efforts by chancellor schröder 's center-left government to adopt new gene laws have been halted until after early elections in germany in september this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the recommendations made by the ethics council tuesday , however , do n't affect other areas of public life - including possible gene screening by insurance companies .
in this area , german companies have voluntarily imposed a moratorium banning such testing of insurance applicants until 2011 .
but the experts on the ethics council believe that strong regulations will then be needed more urgently than ever . uwe hessler -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de are you -lrb- genetically -rrb- up to the job ?

an independent panel of german scientists has warned that the wholesale use of gene testing to check on the health of job applicants is not advisable .
the government wants an outright ban . germany 's national ethics council , which advises the government on ethical questions of modern medicine , recommended tuesday that forcible gene testing in the workplace for hereditary diseases should be subject to strict restrictions under german law .

" there is no law in germany governing the use of these tests in a detailed manner , " he said .
" all jurisdiction made by german courts so far is rather vague and does not match the technological progress in this field . " restrictions in germany , forcible gene tests made the headlines after a young teacher was refused employment two years ago for failing to undergo a test of her genes .

a court ruled in the woman 's favor . kristiane weber-hassemer is the head of the german ethics council .

" this is especially needed to protect employees against dismissal for medical reasons .
restrictions must be put on the period of validity of gene diagnoses and predictions about the chances that a disease might occur . " 5-year diagnostic validity the scientists are demanding that the diagnostic validity of a gene test should not go beyond 5 years and that test results must be labeled negative if the possibility of an outbreak of a specific disease is estimated at less than 50 percent . efforts by chancellor schröder 's center-left government to adopt new gene laws have been halted until after early elections in germany in september this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the recommendations made by the ethics council tuesday , however , do n't affect other areas of public life - including possible gene screening by insurance companies .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de election 2005 -pipe- 17.08.2005 merkel 's " dream team " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said the group covers the spectrum of most important issues conservative chancellor candidate angela merkel presented her so-called " competence team " on wednesday .
dw-world has compiled biographical information about the members . merkel 's troupe , which has already been rechristened " incompetence team " by chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats , is not really a shadow cabinet as it 's still unclear whether the team members will eventually fill their respective positions in a conservative-led cabinet . most members have said they are willing to serve as ministers , with thuringia 's premier , dieter althaus , being the one exception .
bavarian premier edmund stoiber , who could lay claim to any ministry , has still not made up his mind about whether he wants to move to berlin .
and the election outcome will also be decisive as merkel 's christian democrats might have to hand ministries to coalition partners - either the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , or the social democrats in a grand coalition . bildunterschrift : the competence team -lrb- from left -rrb- : norbert lammert , günther beckstein , gerda hasselfeldt , wolfgang schäuble , peter müller , ursula von der leyen , anette schavan , paul kirchhof , dieter althaus .
on the right are angela merkel and edmund stoiber the " competence team " is therefore meant to give a face to important policy areas .
dw-world offers some background on its members . agriculture , environment and consumer protection : gerda hasselfeldt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerda hasselfeldt hasselfeldt , 55 , is widely unknown despite serving as her party 's deputy leader in parliament and holding the office of minister for construction and later health under former chancellor helmut kohl from 1989 to 1992 .
she had been accused of a cold leadership style and refusing to listen to ministry officials .
the mother of two children later became her party 's financial affairs spokeswoman in parliament .
a macro-economist , she grew up in a rural part of bavaria .
her father was a farmer , butcher and mayor of a small town in the eastern part of the state . culture : norbert lammert bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : norbert lammert lammert is deputy president of germany 's parliament and has been his party 's culture and media spokesman .
the 57-year-old social scientist is the son of a baker and comes from western germany 's industrial ruhr area .
much of his political career has been focused on education policies , but he also served as junior minister in germany 's ministry of economics from 1994 . eastern german reconstruction : dieter althaus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter althaus althaus might play a decisive role during the election .
the 47-year-old premier of the eastern state of thuringia is meant to become the cdu 's face of eastern germany and is expected to placate voters in the east after bavarian premier edmund stoiber accused them of being " frustrated " and called on voters in the western parts of the country to not let easterners decide the outcome of the election .
initially considered bland , althaus succeeded thuringia 's charismatic former premier , bernhard vogel , in 2003 and has since become a constant guest on german talk shows .
he has called on his party colleagues to show willingness to compromise with the ruling coalition of social democrats and greens and veered from established cdu views on labor policies and subsidies for the eastern states .
a former professor of mathematics and physics , he still avoids open confrontation with party friends and is considered a close merkel ally . economy and labor : peter müller bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter müller müller , 49 , is premier of the southwestern state of saarland and is seen as a generalist .
he is considered to be a definite member of a cabinet under merkel , but not necessarily in the same function as the one he has taken on now .
bavarian premier edmund stoiber might claim the economics and labor ministry after all .
müller has become well known throughout germany as president of his party 's commission on immigration .
a lawyer by trade , he is considered a " liberal " conservative , who does not always follow party lines , as has been the case regarding immigration issues as well as his opposition to the war in iraq . finances : paul kirchhof bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul kirchhof a former constitutional court judge , kirchhof is not a member of the christian democrats and is respected as a tax expert across party lines .
the 62-year-old law professor from heidelberg has introduced a radical tax reform model : he wants to do away with all forms of tax subsidies and lower the highest income tax rate to 25 percent .
kirchhof , who has four children , has also been lobbying for more state help to families with children .
during his last year as constitutional court judge , he lowered the tax burden on families by billions .
observers doubt that he will actually serve in merkel 's cabinet should she become chancellor .
many cdu members consider his ideas too radical .
he also rejects merkel 's plan to raise vat by 2 percent . foreign and security policy : wolfgang schäuble bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang schäuble without a doubt , schäuble is one of the cdu 's most competent politicians and a generalist like müller .
a former party leader , he has concentrated on international politics for years and shaped the cdu 's views in this area .
schäuble recently visited us president george w. bush , as he again pointed out during statements on wednesday .
his relationship with merkel is not the best , however .
last fall , he rejected her offer to become her deputy for financial and economic affairs in parliament .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de election 2005 -pipe- 17.08.2005 merkel 's " dream team " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said the group covers the spectrum of most important issues conservative chancellor candidate angela merkel presented her so-called " competence team " on wednesday .
dw-world has compiled biographical information about the members . merkel 's troupe , which has already been rechristened " incompetence team " by chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats , is not really a shadow cabinet as it 's still unclear whether the team members will eventually fill their respective positions in a conservative-led cabinet . most members have said they are willing to serve as ministers , with thuringia 's premier , dieter althaus , being the one exception .
bavarian premier edmund stoiber , who could lay claim to any ministry , has still not made up his mind about whether he wants to move to berlin .
and the election outcome will also be decisive as merkel 's christian democrats might have to hand ministries to coalition partners - either the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , or the social democrats in a grand coalition . bildunterschrift : the competence team -lrb- from left -rrb- : norbert lammert , günther beckstein , gerda hasselfeldt , wolfgang schäuble , peter müller , ursula von der leyen , anette schavan , paul kirchhof , dieter althaus .
on the right are angela merkel and edmund stoiber the " competence team " is therefore meant to give a face to important policy areas .
dw-world offers some background on its members . agriculture , environment and consumer protection : gerda hasselfeldt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerda hasselfeldt hasselfeldt , 55 , is widely unknown despite serving as her party 's deputy leader in parliament and holding the office of minister for construction and later health under former chancellor helmut kohl from 1989 to 1992 .
she had been accused of a cold leadership style and refusing to listen to ministry officials .
the mother of two children later became her party 's financial affairs spokeswoman in parliament .
a macro-economist , she grew up in a rural part of bavaria .
her father was a farmer , butcher and mayor of a small town in the eastern part of the state . culture : norbert lammert bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : norbert lammert lammert is deputy president of germany 's parliament and has been his party 's culture and media spokesman .
the 57-year-old social scientist is the son of a baker and comes from western germany 's industrial ruhr area .
much of his political career has been focused on education policies , but he also served as junior minister in germany 's ministry of economics from 1994 . eastern german reconstruction : dieter althaus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter althaus althaus might play a decisive role during the election .
the 47-year-old premier of the eastern state of thuringia is meant to become the cdu 's face of eastern germany and is expected to placate voters in the east after bavarian premier edmund stoiber accused them of being " frustrated " and called on voters in the western parts of the country to not let easterners decide the outcome of the election .
initially considered bland , althaus succeeded thuringia 's charismatic former premier , bernhard vogel , in 2003 and has since become a constant guest on german talk shows .
he has called on his party colleagues to show willingness to compromise with the ruling coalition of social democrats and greens and veered from established cdu views on labor policies and subsidies for the eastern states .
a former professor of mathematics and physics , he still avoids open confrontation with party friends and is considered a close merkel ally . economy and labor : peter müller bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter müller müller , 49 , is premier of the southwestern state of saarland and is seen as a generalist .
he is considered to be a definite member of a cabinet under merkel , but not necessarily in the same function as the one he has taken on now .
bavarian premier edmund stoiber might claim the economics and labor ministry after all .
müller has become well known throughout germany as president of his party 's commission on immigration .
a lawyer by trade , he is considered a " liberal " conservative , who does not always follow party lines , as has been the case regarding immigration issues as well as his opposition to the war in iraq . finances : paul kirchhof bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul kirchhof a former constitutional court judge , kirchhof is not a member of the christian democrats and is respected as a tax expert across party lines .
the 62-year-old law professor from heidelberg has introduced a radical tax reform model : he wants to do away with all forms of tax subsidies and lower the highest income tax rate to 25 percent .
kirchhof , who has four children , has also been lobbying for more state help to families with children .
during his last year as constitutional court judge , he lowered the tax burden on families by billions .
observers doubt that he will actually serve in merkel 's cabinet should she become chancellor .
many cdu members consider his ideas too radical .
he also rejects merkel 's plan to raise vat by 2 percent . foreign and security policy : wolfgang schäuble bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang schäuble without a doubt , schäuble is one of the cdu 's most competent politicians and a generalist like müller .
a former party leader , he has concentrated on international politics for years and shaped the cdu 's views in this area .
schäuble recently visited us president george w. bush , as he again pointed out during statements on wednesday .
his relationship with merkel is not the best , however .
last fall , he rejected her offer to become her deputy for financial and economic affairs in parliament .
a former parliamentary leader himself who lost his positions in the wake of a party bribery scandal , schäuble was upset that merkel did not nominate him for the german presidency in 2004 and gave that job to former imf director horst köhler instead .
it 's unlikely that schäuble , who uses a wheel chair after an assassination attempt , will become foreign minister in case of an election victory as that position will be claimed by the cdu 's likely coalition partner , the fdp , or stoiber . interior affairs : günther beckstein bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günther beckstein beckstein , 61 , is bavarian interior minister , but well known throughout germany as he is a frequent guest on national talk shows .
he is often 's interviewed on subjects such as terrorism , illegal immigration and domestic safety .

" we 're a strong team and we 're ready to show germany that we can do things better , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former constitutional court judge paul kirchhof was named as finance expert onto merkel 's dream team one of the most important positions , that of financial affairs , will be filled by paul kirchhof -lrb- photo -rrb- , a former constitutional court judge and tax expert , who would cover the field of finances .
his background has been criticized by some experts .
" politics should not be about appointing friends but about competence and political experience and -lrb- friedrich -rrb- merz is clearly the one with those attributes , " peter lösche , a political scientist at göttingen university , told reuters .
friedrich merz , probably the cdu 's best financial expert , fell out with merkel during the power struggle for leadership within the christian democrats last year , thus leaving a large hole in that area within the party .
kirchhof , who is an independent , has been a vocal advocate of a simplified tax code .
in fact , merz assumed many of his ideas while he served as deputy party chairman .
while some suggested that merkel would create a " mega ministry " for finances , economics and labor in case she gets elected , the cdu leader said this would not make any sense .
there had been speculation that edmund stoiber would give up his job as bavarian premier to take on such a ministry .
" everyone can see that the minister of finance has his plate full , " merkel told german weekly stern .
" i ca n't really imagine merging finances , economics and labor into one ministry . "
beckstein to cover interior affairs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter müller , currently premier of the small state of saarland the new economics minister then could be peter müller -lrb- photo -rrb- , premier of the small western state of saarland , who will cover that area in merkel 's shadow cabinet .
for interior affairs , bavarian interior minister günther beckstein got the nod .
he would replace current german interior minister otto schily , should the cdu win on sept.18.
wolfgang schäuble , a longtime foreign policy expert , even under former chancellor helmut kohl , will serve as european and foreign affairs advisor .
ursula von der leyen , minister for social affairs in the state of lowe saxony , will take on family and social affairs .
annette schavan , minister for research and education in the state of baden-württemberg , will advise merkel in the same capacity .
gerda hasselfeldt , a former federal minister for construction , will serve as expert for agricultural , environmental and consumer affairs .
norbert lammert , a vice president of germany 's parliament , covers culture in the " competence team . "
apart from dieter althaus , the premier of the eastern state of thuringia , who will advise merkel on eastern german affairs , all members of the team have in principle agreed to serve in a cabinet under merkel should she be elected chancellor , the cdu leader said bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a potential successor for otto schily , günther beckstein bavarian premier edmund stoiber will not serve in any particular capacity .
but stoiber , who irked conservative allies by making disparaging remarks about eastern germans last week , is expected to attend merkel 's press conference announcing her team .
stoiber 's refusal to commit to moving to berlin until after the poll has been a source of great irritation to merkel and the cdu .
because he is head of the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the csu , nobody could hinder him from taking a post in berlin after sept .

bavarian premier edmund stoiber , who could lay claim to any ministry , has still not made up his mind about whether he wants to move to berlin .
and the election outcome will also be decisive as merkel 's christian democrats might have to hand ministries to coalition partners - either the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , or the social democrats in a grand coalition . bildunterschrift : the competence team -lrb- from left -rrb- : norbert lammert , günther beckstein , gerda hasselfeldt , wolfgang schäuble , peter müller , ursula von der leyen , anette schavan , paul kirchhof , dieter althaus .
on the right are angela merkel and edmund stoiber the " competence team " is therefore meant to give a face to important policy areas .
dw-world offers some background on its members . agriculture , environment and consumer protection : gerda hasselfeldt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerda hasselfeldt hasselfeldt , 55 , is widely unknown despite serving as her party 's deputy leader in parliament and holding the office of minister for construction and later health under former chancellor helmut kohl from 1989 to 1992 .
she had been accused of a cold leadership style and refusing to listen to ministry officials .
the mother of two children later became her party 's financial affairs spokeswoman in parliament .
a macro-economist , she grew up in a rural part of bavaria .
her father was a farmer , butcher and mayor of a small town in the eastern part of the state . culture : norbert lammert bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : norbert lammert lammert is deputy president of germany 's parliament and has been his party 's culture and media spokesman .
the 57-year-old social scientist is the son of a baker and comes from western germany 's industrial ruhr area .
much of his political career has been focused on education policies , but he also served as junior minister in germany 's ministry of economics from 1994 . eastern german reconstruction : dieter althaus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter althaus althaus might play a decisive role during the election .
the 47-year-old premier of the eastern state of thuringia is meant to become the cdu 's face of eastern germany and is expected to placate voters in the east after bavarian premier edmund stoiber accused them of being " frustrated " and called on voters in the western parts of the country to not let easterners decide the outcome of the election .
initially considered bland , althaus succeeded thuringia 's charismatic former premier , bernhard vogel , in 2003 and has since become a constant guest on german talk shows .
he has called on his party colleagues to show willingness to compromise with the ruling coalition of social democrats and greens and veered from established cdu views on labor policies and subsidies for the eastern states .
a former professor of mathematics and physics , he still avoids open confrontation with party friends and is considered a close merkel ally . economy and labor : peter müller bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter müller müller , 49 , is premier of the southwestern state of saarland and is seen as a generalist .
he is considered to be a definite member of a cabinet under merkel , but not necessarily in the same function as the one he has taken on now .
bavarian premier edmund stoiber might claim the economics and labor ministry after all .
müller has become well known throughout germany as president of his party 's commission on immigration .
a lawyer by trade , he is considered a " liberal " conservative , who does not always follow party lines , as has been the case regarding immigration issues as well as his opposition to the war in iraq . finances : paul kirchhof bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul kirchhof a former constitutional court judge , kirchhof is not a member of the christian democrats and is respected as a tax expert across party lines .
the 62-year-old law professor from heidelberg has introduced a radical tax reform model : he wants to do away with all forms of tax subsidies and lower the highest income tax rate to 25 percent .
kirchhof , who has four children , has also been lobbying for more state help to families with children .
during his last year as constitutional court judge , he lowered the tax burden on families by billions .
observers doubt that he will actually serve in merkel 's cabinet should she become chancellor .
many cdu members consider his ideas too radical .
he also rejects merkel 's plan to raise vat by 2 percent . foreign and security policy : wolfgang schäuble bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang schäuble without a doubt , schäuble is one of the cdu 's most competent politicians and a generalist like müller .
a former party leader , he has concentrated on international politics for years and shaped the cdu 's views in this area .
schäuble recently visited us president george w. bush , as he again pointed out during statements on wednesday .
his relationship with merkel is not the best , however .
last fall , he rejected her offer to become her deputy for financial and economic affairs in parliament .
a former parliamentary leader himself who lost his positions in the wake of a party bribery scandal , schäuble was upset that merkel did not nominate him for the german presidency in 2004 and gave that job to former imf director horst köhler instead .
it 's unlikely that schäuble , who uses a wheel chair after an assassination attempt , will become foreign minister in case of an election victory as that position will be claimed by the cdu 's likely coalition partner , the fdp , or stoiber . interior affairs : günther beckstein bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günther beckstein beckstein , 61 , is bavarian interior minister , but well known throughout germany as he is a frequent guest on national talk shows .
he is often 's interviewed on subjects such as terrorism , illegal immigration and domestic safety .
in office for 11 years , he is an ardent promoter of a " no tolerance " policy and has uncompromising views on immigration .
bavaria is the state that deports immigrants fastest and most frequently .
beckstein is a loyal supporter of bavarian premier edmund stoiber and many see him as a potential successor to his current boss . research and education : annette schavan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : annette schavan schavan , 50 , serves as minister for culture and education in the southwestern state of baden-württemberg .
she was defeated in a race to succeed former premier erwin teufel by current premier , günther oettinger .
a theologian , schavan is considered a smart politician , who likes to remain in the background and does n't search the limelight .
in 1998 , she became well known throughout germany when she refused to grant civil-servant status to a muslim teacher who insisted on wearing a veil in the classroom . social affairs , health , senior citizens : ursula von der leyen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ursula von der leyen the 46-year-old minister for social affairs in the northern state of lower saxony is considered one of her party 's rising stars .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 17.08.2005 -pipe- 14:00 utc officials investigate daimlerchrysler german regulators have begun a formal investigation into possible insider trading at daimlerchrysler , officials said tuesday .
the probe began after the german financial services regulatory agency bafin ran a check following a 10 percent hike in share prices before the resignation of chief executive jürgen schrempp last month .
officials suspect that company officials knew of the announcement and began illegal trading but declined to identify any suspects .
meanwhile , a number of top executives at german-us auto giant daimlerchrysler are cashing in on the recent sharp rise in the company 's share price , according to mandatory legal filings published on the automaker 's website : six managers have exercised options to buy daimlerchrysler shares at a discounted price and then immediately re-sold those shares at a much higher market price on the same day , reaping fat profits from the transactions .
two board members , thomas sidlik and eckhard cordes , and four other top executives , harald boestler , herbert kauffmann , ulrich walker , wolfgang diez and guenter egle , all liquidated their holdings since the announcement , netting a total 1.26 million euros -lrb- $ 1.56 million -rrb- , according to daimlerchrysler documents .
also , the managers received additional cash payments to make up for differences between the reference price and the actual strike price of the options , daimlerchrysler said .
all in all , the managers took home more than 1.5 million euros in profits from the deals .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 17.08.2005 -pipe- 14:00 utc officials investigate daimlerchrysler german regulators have begun a formal investigation into possible insider trading at daimlerchrysler , officials said tuesday .
the probe began after the german financial services regulatory agency bafin ran a check following a 10 percent hike in share prices before the resignation of chief executive jürgen schrempp last month .
officials suspect that company officials knew of the announcement and began illegal trading but declined to identify any suspects .
meanwhile , a number of top executives at german-us auto giant daimlerchrysler are cashing in on the recent sharp rise in the company 's share price , according to mandatory legal filings published on the automaker 's website : six managers have exercised options to buy daimlerchrysler shares at a discounted price and then immediately re-sold those shares at a much higher market price on the same day , reaping fat profits from the transactions .
two board members , thomas sidlik and eckhard cordes , and four other top executives , harald boestler , herbert kauffmann , ulrich walker , wolfgang diez and guenter egle , all liquidated their holdings since the announcement , netting a total 1.26 million euros -lrb- $ 1.56 million -rrb- , according to daimlerchrysler documents .
also , the managers received additional cash payments to make up for differences between the reference price and the actual strike price of the options , daimlerchrysler said .
all in all , the managers took home more than 1.5 million euros in profits from the deals .
the transactions were criticized by shareholder groups , who argued that the variable components of managers ' wages should not be linked to the share price but to a company 's long-term profits and accused managers of dipping freely into company coffers . dw-world.de schrempp : exit planned long ago analysts say the departure of daimlerchrysler chief executive jürgen schrempp marks the merciful end of a failed expansion strategy .

dw-world has compiled biographical information about the members . merkel 's troupe , which has already been rechristened " incompetence team " by chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats , is not really a shadow cabinet as it 's still unclear whether the team members will eventually fill their respective positions in a conservative-led cabinet . most members have said they are willing to serve as ministers , with thuringia 's premier , dieter althaus , being the one exception .
bavarian premier edmund stoiber , who could lay claim to any ministry , has still not made up his mind about whether he wants to move to berlin .
and the election outcome will also be decisive as merkel 's christian democrats might have to hand ministries to coalition partners - either the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , or the social democrats in a grand coalition . bildunterschrift : the competence team -lrb- from left -rrb- : norbert lammert , günther beckstein , gerda hasselfeldt , wolfgang schäuble , peter müller , ursula von der leyen , anette schavan , paul kirchhof , dieter althaus .
on the right are angela merkel and edmund stoiber the " competence team " is therefore meant to give a face to important policy areas .
dw-world offers some background on its members . agriculture , environment and consumer protection : gerda hasselfeldt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerda hasselfeldt hasselfeldt , 55 , is widely unknown despite serving as her party 's deputy leader in parliament and holding the office of minister for construction and later health under former chancellor helmut kohl from 1989 to 1992 .
she had been accused of a cold leadership style and refusing to listen to ministry officials .
the mother of two children later became her party 's financial affairs spokeswoman in parliament .
a macro-economist , she grew up in a rural part of bavaria .
her father was a farmer , butcher and mayor of a small town in the eastern part of the state . culture : norbert lammert bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : norbert lammert lammert is deputy president of germany 's parliament and has been his party 's culture and media spokesman .
the 57-year-old social scientist is the son of a baker and comes from western germany 's industrial ruhr area .
much of his political career has been focused on education policies , but he also served as junior minister in germany 's ministry of economics from 1994 . eastern german reconstruction : dieter althaus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter althaus althaus might play a decisive role during the election .
the 47-year-old premier of the eastern state of thuringia is meant to become the cdu 's face of eastern germany and is expected to placate voters in the east after bavarian premier edmund stoiber accused them of being " frustrated " and called on voters in the western parts of the country to not let easterners decide the outcome of the election .
initially considered bland , althaus succeeded thuringia 's charismatic former premier , bernhard vogel , in 2003 and has since become a constant guest on german talk shows .
he has called on his party colleagues to show willingness to compromise with the ruling coalition of social democrats and greens and veered from established cdu views on labor policies and subsidies for the eastern states .
a former professor of mathematics and physics , he still avoids open confrontation with party friends and is considered a close merkel ally . economy and labor : peter müller bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter müller müller , 49 , is premier of the southwestern state of saarland and is seen as a generalist .
he is considered to be a definite member of a cabinet under merkel , but not necessarily in the same function as the one he has taken on now .
bavarian premier edmund stoiber might claim the economics and labor ministry after all .
müller has become well known throughout germany as president of his party 's commission on immigration .
a lawyer by trade , he is considered a " liberal " conservative , who does not always follow party lines , as has been the case regarding immigration issues as well as his opposition to the war in iraq . finances : paul kirchhof bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul kirchhof a former constitutional court judge , kirchhof is not a member of the christian democrats and is respected as a tax expert across party lines .
the 62-year-old law professor from heidelberg has introduced a radical tax reform model : he wants to do away with all forms of tax subsidies and lower the highest income tax rate to 25 percent .
kirchhof , who has four children , has also been lobbying for more state help to families with children .
during his last year as constitutional court judge , he lowered the tax burden on families by billions .
observers doubt that he will actually serve in merkel 's cabinet should she become chancellor .
many cdu members consider his ideas too radical .
he also rejects merkel 's plan to raise vat by 2 percent . foreign and security policy : wolfgang schäuble bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang schäuble without a doubt , schäuble is one of the cdu 's most competent politicians and a generalist like müller .
a former party leader , he has concentrated on international politics for years and shaped the cdu 's views in this area .
schäuble recently visited us president george w. bush , as he again pointed out during statements on wednesday .
his relationship with merkel is not the best , however .
last fall , he rejected her offer to become her deputy for financial and economic affairs in parliament .
a former parliamentary leader himself who lost his positions in the wake of a party bribery scandal , schäuble was upset that merkel did not nominate him for the german presidency in 2004 and gave that job to former imf director horst köhler instead .
it 's unlikely that schäuble , who uses a wheel chair after an assassination attempt , will become foreign minister in case of an election victory as that position will be claimed by the cdu 's likely coalition partner , the fdp , or stoiber . interior affairs : günther beckstein bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günther beckstein beckstein , 61 , is bavarian interior minister , but well known throughout germany as he is a frequent guest on national talk shows .
he is often 's interviewed on subjects such as terrorism , illegal immigration and domestic safety .
in office for 11 years , he is an ardent promoter of a " no tolerance " policy and has uncompromising views on immigration .
bavaria is the state that deports immigrants fastest and most frequently .
beckstein is a loyal supporter of bavarian premier edmund stoiber and many see him as a potential successor to his current boss . research and education : annette schavan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : annette schavan schavan , 50 , serves as minister for culture and education in the southwestern state of baden-württemberg .
she was defeated in a race to succeed former premier erwin teufel by current premier , günther oettinger .
a theologian , schavan is considered a smart politician , who likes to remain in the background and does n't search the limelight .
in 1998 , she became well known throughout germany when she refused to grant civil-servant status to a muslim teacher who insisted on wearing a veil in the classroom . social affairs , health , senior citizens : ursula von der leyen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ursula von der leyen the 46-year-old minister for social affairs in the northern state of lower saxony is considered one of her party 's rising stars .
last december she was elected as a vice chairman by 94.1 percent of delegates .
von der leyen worked as a doctor before becoming a minister in 2003 .

kirchhof , who has four children , has also been lobbying for more state help to families with children .
during his last year as constitutional court judge , he lowered the tax burden on families by billions .

his relationship with merkel is not the best , however .
last fall , he rejected her offer to become her deputy for financial and economic affairs in parliament .
a former parliamentary leader himself who lost his positions in the wake of a party bribery scandal , schäuble was upset that merkel did not nominate him for the german presidency in 2004 and gave that job to former imf director horst köhler instead .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de election 2005 -pipe- 17.08.2005 merkel 's " dream team " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said the group covers the spectrum of most important issues conservative chancellor candidate angela merkel presented her so-called " competence team " on wednesday .
dw-world has compiled biographical information about the members . merkel 's troupe , which has already been rechristened " incompetence team " by chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats , is not really a shadow cabinet as it 's still unclear whether the team members will eventually fill their respective positions in a conservative-led cabinet . most members have said they are willing to serve as ministers , with thuringia 's premier , dieter althaus , being the one exception .
bavarian premier edmund stoiber , who could lay claim to any ministry , has still not made up his mind about whether he wants to move to berlin .
and the election outcome will also be decisive as merkel 's christian democrats might have to hand ministries to coalition partners - either the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , or the social democrats in a grand coalition . bildunterschrift : the competence team -lrb- from left -rrb- : norbert lammert , günther beckstein , gerda hasselfeldt , wolfgang schäuble , peter müller , ursula von der leyen , anette schavan , paul kirchhof , dieter althaus .
on the right are angela merkel and edmund stoiber the " competence team " is therefore meant to give a face to important policy areas .
dw-world offers some background on its members . agriculture , environment and consumer protection : gerda hasselfeldt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerda hasselfeldt hasselfeldt , 55 , is widely unknown despite serving as her party 's deputy leader in parliament and holding the office of minister for construction and later health under former chancellor helmut kohl from 1989 to 1992 .
she had been accused of a cold leadership style and refusing to listen to ministry officials .
the mother of two children later became her party 's financial affairs spokeswoman in parliament .
a macro-economist , she grew up in a rural part of bavaria .
her father was a farmer , butcher and mayor of a small town in the eastern part of the state . culture : norbert lammert bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : norbert lammert lammert is deputy president of germany 's parliament and has been his party 's culture and media spokesman .
the 57-year-old social scientist is the son of a baker and comes from western germany 's industrial ruhr area .
much of his political career has been focused on education policies , but he also served as junior minister in germany 's ministry of economics from 1994 . eastern german reconstruction : dieter althaus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter althaus althaus might play a decisive role during the election .
the 47-year-old premier of the eastern state of thuringia is meant to become the cdu 's face of eastern germany and is expected to placate voters in the east after bavarian premier edmund stoiber accused them of being " frustrated " and called on voters in the western parts of the country to not let easterners decide the outcome of the election .
initially considered bland , althaus succeeded thuringia 's charismatic former premier , bernhard vogel , in 2003 and has since become a constant guest on german talk shows .
he has called on his party colleagues to show willingness to compromise with the ruling coalition of social democrats and greens and veered from established cdu views on labor policies and subsidies for the eastern states .
a former professor of mathematics and physics , he still avoids open confrontation with party friends and is considered a close merkel ally . economy and labor : peter müller bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter müller müller , 49 , is premier of the southwestern state of saarland and is seen as a generalist .
he is considered to be a definite member of a cabinet under merkel , but not necessarily in the same function as the one he has taken on now .
bavarian premier edmund stoiber might claim the economics and labor ministry after all .
müller has become well known throughout germany as president of his party 's commission on immigration .
a lawyer by trade , he is considered a " liberal " conservative , who does not always follow party lines , as has been the case regarding immigration issues as well as his opposition to the war in iraq . finances : paul kirchhof bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul kirchhof a former constitutional court judge , kirchhof is not a member of the christian democrats and is respected as a tax expert across party lines .

a mobile service will relay the papal message to their cell phones . when pope benedict xvi delivers his final mass on sunday to end the world youth day celebrations , it 'll be a difficult feat for any of the 800,000 strong crowd of pilgrims expected to get anywhere close to the pontiff .
instead he will come to every single one of them - provided they have signed up for a text messaging service organized by the german bishop 's conference and tv broadcaster rtl .
spreading the message for those who have subscribed , every evening over the past week has seen a short but significant quote taken from a statement made by the pope on that day arrive on their cell phones , said dietmar heeg , a catholic priest who is in charge of organizing the service on behalf of germany 's catholic bishops .

but heeg insists neither the production company nor the church is making any profit , the fees just about cover the costs of relaying the texts .
while heeg 's company is fully responsible for the evening prayer service , the higher price for the pontiff 's quotes comes about because in this case broadcaster rtl covers the technical side of the service and offers it as part of their premium rate text messaging .

with a long line of dramatic wins and losses , the arch-rivalry between the two neighbors always guarantees a sensational game . german-dutch soccer matches , even if they 're just friendlies , are seldom nice .
with a long line of dramatic wins and losses , the arch-rivalry between the two neighbors always guarantees a sensational game .
the german national soccer team will be braced for a tough show when they face-off against marco van basten 's netherlands wednesday night in rotterdam .
victories against the oranje have been few and far between in the past two decades , with just three in 11 encounters .
the last one was in 1996 at de kuip stadium in rotterdam , when the german team managed to squeeze out a 1-0 win thanks to jürgen klinsmann 's penalty conversion in the 19th minute .
but besides the fact of beating an old foe , klinsmann , the former striker-turned coach , would like for his side to do something a german team has not accomplished since october 2000 - that is to finally beat one of the world 's top teams .
since their 1-0 victory over england five years ago , germany has reeled off a string of 14 losses or draws against quality competition .
a third-place finish at the confederations cup in june may look impressive in the record books , but wins against australia , tunisia or mexico wo n't keep the experts quiet for long .
klinsmann , usually the epitome of sunshine and optimism – a carry-over from his year-round home in california – is not upbeat about wednesday 's match .
" this game has come too early for us , " he said .
" a lot of our players have just got back into training after the confederations cup . "
the return of experience the big stars of the confed cup were youngsters - the 20-year-old striker lukas podolski and the year-older midfielder bastian schweinsteiger - who are being left behind for the rotterdam game . according to the coaching staff , the two are getting well-deserved breaks .
their absence may be the break some of the players from years past have been waiting for .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : didi hamann -lrb- l -rrb- in his last apperance in german national uniform against latvia at euro 2004 for wednesday 's friendly , liverpool midfielder dietmar " didi " hamann , has been called back into the national squad after recovering from a foot injury , and more than a year after a less than stellar performance at the euro 2004 .
" he is the kind of player who despite a few injuries in the past few months has played the style that fits him , " klinsmann told kicker magazine .
" and he had a great deal to do with fc liverpool 's victory in the champions league . "
the 33-year-old defender christian wörns is also ready to play again after injuries sidelined him for months .
it should be a welcome return in the eyes of goalkeeper oliver kahn .
he and his colleagues jens lehmann and timo hildebrand had to fetch the ball from out of the net 11 times in five games at the confed cup .
miroslav klose , already with three goals in the bundesliga , also missed the confed cup .
the starter-status of the six-goal scorer at the world cup 2002 has been threatened by the rise of lukas podolski .
tops in the bundesliga does n't mean tops in holland bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roy makaay : flying high with bayern munich but grounded on dutch national team on the opposite side , the fate of dutch striker roy makaay , who leads the german bundesliga with five strikes in two matches , looks to be the one sitting on the bench .
the traditional dutch 4-3-3 with just one true striker means that , just as in years past , makaay will be watching from the sidelines most of the match .
ruud van nistelrooy has the better cards in the mind of coach van basten .
the statistics speak loads against makaay : only six goals in 42 matches for oranje .
still , german coaches think he should be a starter .
" if van basten wants to make things difficult for -lrb- german -rrb- goalkeeper kahn , then he should start makaay , " bayern coach felix magath commented .
high-risk match in rotterdam regardless of the line-up and the plays on the field , the historic rivalry between germany and the netherlands guarantees a full stadium , with thousands of fans crossing the border into " enemy " territory to cheer on their favorites .
because the animosity runs deep among soccer fans , security officials are taking no chances .
many remember all-to-well the 1996 riot in rotterdam when three people were stabbed and some 70 taken into custody following clashes between german hooligans and dutch police .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans can expect a strong police presence in rotterdam this time around , authorities from both countries are cooperating in patrolling the 572-kilometer border , stopping cars and trains for suspected hooligans .
dutch police have also been given the authority to search visitors in the city 's downtown .
there will be no alcohol consumption in or around the de kuip stadium .
and some 2,000 german fans will be escorted to the ahoy complex in the southern part of the city to pick up their tickets , thereby avoiding the city center and any possible mingling with dutch fans .
such security precautions have grown more and more common in the world of european soccer , where nationalist sentiments combine with sports fever to reach dangerous levels .
the open borders and ease of transportation between rival countries also means that fans can follow their teams almost anywhere .
just this past march , german hooligans brought shame on their country when they clashed with slovenians during an away match . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the specter of hooliganism returns german soccer hooligans have made a violent return to the international stage with just over a year to go before germany hosts the 2006 world cup .
officials have faith in security measures but experts predict trouble .

with a long line of dramatic wins and losses , the arch-rivalry between the two neighbors always guarantees a sensational game .
the german national soccer team will be braced for a tough show when they face-off against marco van basten 's netherlands wednesday night in rotterdam .
victories against the oranje have been few and far between in the past two decades , with just three in 11 encounters .
the last one was in 1996 at de kuip stadium in rotterdam , when the german team managed to squeeze out a 1-0 win thanks to jürgen klinsmann 's penalty conversion in the 19th minute .
but besides the fact of beating an old foe , klinsmann , the former striker-turned coach , would like for his side to do something a german team has not accomplished since october 2000 - that is to finally beat one of the world 's top teams .
since their 1-0 victory over england five years ago , germany has reeled off a string of 14 losses or draws against quality competition .
a third-place finish at the confederations cup in june may look impressive in the record books , but wins against australia , tunisia or mexico wo n't keep the experts quiet for long .
klinsmann , usually the epitome of sunshine and optimism – a carry-over from his year-round home in california – is not upbeat about wednesday 's match .
" this game has come too early for us , " he said .
" a lot of our players have just got back into training after the confederations cup . "
the return of experience the big stars of the confed cup were youngsters - the 20-year-old striker lukas podolski and the year-older midfielder bastian schweinsteiger - who are being left behind for the rotterdam game . according to the coaching staff , the two are getting well-deserved breaks .
their absence may be the break some of the players from years past have been waiting for .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : didi hamann -lrb- l -rrb- in his last apperance in german national uniform against latvia at euro 2004 for wednesday 's friendly , liverpool midfielder dietmar " didi " hamann , has been called back into the national squad after recovering from a foot injury , and more than a year after a less than stellar performance at the euro 2004 .
" he is the kind of player who despite a few injuries in the past few months has played the style that fits him , " klinsmann told kicker magazine .
" and he had a great deal to do with fc liverpool 's victory in the champions league . "
the 33-year-old defender christian wörns is also ready to play again after injuries sidelined him for months .
it should be a welcome return in the eyes of goalkeeper oliver kahn .
he and his colleagues jens lehmann and timo hildebrand had to fetch the ball from out of the net 11 times in five games at the confed cup .
miroslav klose , already with three goals in the bundesliga , also missed the confed cup .
the starter-status of the six-goal scorer at the world cup 2002 has been threatened by the rise of lukas podolski .

the traditional dutch 4-3-3 with just one true striker means that , just as in years past , makaay will be watching from the sidelines most of the match .
ruud van nistelrooy has the better cards in the mind of coach van basten .
the statistics speak loads against makaay : only six goals in 42 matches for oranje .
still , german coaches think he should be a starter .
" if van basten wants to make things difficult for -lrb- german -rrb- goalkeeper kahn , then he should start makaay , " bayern coach felix magath commented .
high-risk match in rotterdam regardless of the line-up and the plays on the field , the historic rivalry between germany and the netherlands guarantees a full stadium , with thousands of fans crossing the border into " enemy " territory to cheer on their favorites .
because the animosity runs deep among soccer fans , security officials are taking no chances .
many remember all-to-well the 1996 riot in rotterdam when three people were stabbed and some 70 taken into custody following clashes between german hooligans and dutch police .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans can expect a strong police presence in rotterdam this time around , authorities from both countries are cooperating in patrolling the 572-kilometer border , stopping cars and trains for suspected hooligans .
dutch police have also been given the authority to search visitors in the city 's downtown .
there will be no alcohol consumption in or around the de kuip stadium .
and some 2,000 german fans will be escorted to the ahoy complex in the southern part of the city to pick up their tickets , thereby avoiding the city center and any possible mingling with dutch fans .
such security precautions have grown more and more common in the world of european soccer , where nationalist sentiments combine with sports fever to reach dangerous levels .
the open borders and ease of transportation between rival countries also means that fans can follow their teams almost anywhere .

many remember all-to-well the 1996 riot in rotterdam when three people were stabbed and some 70 taken into custody following clashes between german hooligans and dutch police .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans can expect a strong police presence in rotterdam this time around , authorities from both countries are cooperating in patrolling the 572-kilometer border , stopping cars and trains for suspected hooligans .
dutch police have also been given the authority to search visitors in the city 's downtown .
there will be no alcohol consumption in or around the de kuip stadium .
and some 2,000 german fans will be escorted to the ahoy complex in the southern part of the city to pick up their tickets , thereby avoiding the city center and any possible mingling with dutch fans .
such security precautions have grown more and more common in the world of european soccer , where nationalist sentiments combine with sports fever to reach dangerous levels .
the open borders and ease of transportation between rival countries also means that fans can follow their teams almost anywhere .

at the youth gathering they have been going on the offensive from day one . the pilgrims arriving in cologne on monday morning were certainly left in no doubt .
world youth day -lrb- wyd -rrb- information points at the railway station and throughout the city center were already waiting on the youth from around the globe to provide guidance - on navigating the city and the events of wyd that is .
the city center appears dotted with stages that host the events of wyd , makeshift tv studios were being set up and posters of the new pope were gracing walls and shop windows .
one day before the official start of world youth day 2005 in cologne things seemed to be running smoothly .
critics on the ground from day one but at the same time criticism was fermenting in the underground - literally .
in the basement of a luxury hotel some 10 minutes walk from the main station , the " world youth day 4 all " -lrb- wyd4all -rrb- coalition was also kicking off with their first press conference on monday morning .
the coalition of grassroots organizations bemoans the lack of room the wyd affords to discuss let alone criticize the church 's stance on controversial issues like contraception or the role of women .
strategic focus on specific issues their monday morning press briefing focused on hiv / aids prevention and the stance of the catholic church on the issue .
by banning the use of condoms " our church leaders are putting the world population at risk , " said molly o 'gorman from the washington-based organization catholics for a free choice which is part of the wyd4all coalition .
despite a host of matters and general themes on which critics disagree with the catholic church , o 'gorman insists that the focus on a specific issue such as this can steer a lot more people into action .
" it also leaves the church leaders with very little wiggle room , " she added .
bildunterschrift : poster for gay and lesbian youths at world youth day more church leaders speaking out according to catholics for a free choice a number of catholic bishops around the world - many from developing nations - have softened their stance on condom use , including the indian catholic bishop 's conference which has agreed to " provide all information about it " to couples seeking advice .
on a number of issues more and more bishops are coming out of the closet against the established views of the senior leadership including the pope .
molly o 'gorman is convinced that in the medium term this could lead to an internal revolution within the church .
and this is backed by pressure from the grassroots : surveys show that catholics around the world are defying the official vatican line in their daily lives .
how to address the crowd but how do the critics carry their message to the believers attending world youth day ?
wyd 2005 resembles the " communist world youth games , " german wyd4all spokesperson tobias raschke told the left-leaning newspaper tageszeitung recently .
and just like in those mass events of the cold war there is no room for the discussion of contentious but highly relevant issues , he said .
only last week german bishops issued a statement that essentially labeled two of germany 's most prominent church critics personae non gratae at the world youth day .
but catholic youth appear to have remained surprisingly quiet in response .
many young people come for the party , admitted raschke .
but then why should they listen to the critics ?
" we know that young people do feel strongly about many of the issues .
all we do is to provide information and the chance to discuss , if they so wish . "
it remains to be seen how much headway the critics can make during world youth day 2005 in the face of seemingly overwhelming enthusiasm for the visit of the new pope .

dw-world has compiled biographical information about the members . merkel 's troupe , which has already been rechristened " incompetence team " by chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats , is not really a shadow cabinet as it 's still unclear whether the team members will eventually fill their respective positions in a conservative-led cabinet . most members have said they are willing to serve as ministers , with thuringia 's premier , dieter althaus , being the one exception .
bavarian premier edmund stoiber , who could lay claim to any ministry , has still not made up his mind about whether he wants to move to berlin .
and the election outcome will also be decisive as merkel 's christian democrats might have to hand ministries to coalition partners - either the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , or the social democrats in a grand coalition . bildunterschrift : the competence team -lrb- from left -rrb- : norbert lammert , günther beckstein , gerda hasselfeldt , wolfgang schäuble , peter müller , ursula von der leyen , anette schavan , paul kirchhof , dieter althaus .
on the right are angela merkel and edmund stoiber the " competence team " is therefore meant to give a face to important policy areas .
dw-world offers some background on its members . agriculture , environment and consumer protection : gerda hasselfeldt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerda hasselfeldt hasselfeldt , 55 , is widely unknown despite serving as her party 's deputy leader in parliament and holding the office of minister for construction and later health under former chancellor helmut kohl from 1989 to 1992 .
she had been accused of a cold leadership style and refusing to listen to ministry officials .
the mother of two children later became her party 's financial affairs spokeswoman in parliament .
a macro-economist , she grew up in a rural part of bavaria .
her father was a farmer , butcher and mayor of a small town in the eastern part of the state . culture : norbert lammert bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : norbert lammert lammert is deputy president of germany 's parliament and has been his party 's culture and media spokesman .
the 57-year-old social scientist is the son of a baker and comes from western germany 's industrial ruhr area .
much of his political career has been focused on education policies , but he also served as junior minister in germany 's ministry of economics from 1994 . eastern german reconstruction : dieter althaus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter althaus althaus might play a decisive role during the election .
the 47-year-old premier of the eastern state of thuringia is meant to become the cdu 's face of eastern germany and is expected to placate voters in the east after bavarian premier edmund stoiber accused them of being " frustrated " and called on voters in the western parts of the country to not let easterners decide the outcome of the election .
initially considered bland , althaus succeeded thuringia 's charismatic former premier , bernhard vogel , in 2003 and has since become a constant guest on german talk shows .
he has called on his party colleagues to show willingness to compromise with the ruling coalition of social democrats and greens and veered from established cdu views on labor policies and subsidies for the eastern states .
a former professor of mathematics and physics , he still avoids open confrontation with party friends and is considered a close merkel ally . economy and labor : peter müller bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter müller müller , 49 , is premier of the southwestern state of saarland and is seen as a generalist .
he is considered to be a definite member of a cabinet under merkel , but not necessarily in the same function as the one he has taken on now .
bavarian premier edmund stoiber might claim the economics and labor ministry after all .
müller has become well known throughout germany as president of his party 's commission on immigration .
a lawyer by trade , he is considered a " liberal " conservative , who does not always follow party lines , as has been the case regarding immigration issues as well as his opposition to the war in iraq . finances : paul kirchhof bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul kirchhof a former constitutional court judge , kirchhof is not a member of the christian democrats and is respected as a tax expert across party lines .
the 62-year-old law professor from heidelberg has introduced a radical tax reform model : he wants to do away with all forms of tax subsidies and lower the highest income tax rate to 25 percent .
kirchhof , who has four children , has also been lobbying for more state help to families with children .
during his last year as constitutional court judge , he lowered the tax burden on families by billions .
observers doubt that he will actually serve in merkel 's cabinet should she become chancellor .
many cdu members consider his ideas too radical .
he also rejects merkel 's plan to raise vat by 2 percent . foreign and security policy : wolfgang schäuble bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang schäuble without a doubt , schäuble is one of the cdu 's most competent politicians and a generalist like müller .
a former party leader , he has concentrated on international politics for years and shaped the cdu 's views in this area .
schäuble recently visited us president george w. bush , as he again pointed out during statements on wednesday .
his relationship with merkel is not the best , however .
last fall , he rejected her offer to become her deputy for financial and economic affairs in parliament .
a former parliamentary leader himself who lost his positions in the wake of a party bribery scandal , schäuble was upset that merkel did not nominate him for the german presidency in 2004 and gave that job to former imf director horst köhler instead .
it 's unlikely that schäuble , who uses a wheel chair after an assassination attempt , will become foreign minister in case of an election victory as that position will be claimed by the cdu 's likely coalition partner , the fdp , or stoiber . interior affairs : günther beckstein bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günther beckstein beckstein , 61 , is bavarian interior minister , but well known throughout germany as he is a frequent guest on national talk shows .
he is often 's interviewed on subjects such as terrorism , illegal immigration and domestic safety .
in office for 11 years , he is an ardent promoter of a " no tolerance " policy and has uncompromising views on immigration .
bavaria is the state that deports immigrants fastest and most frequently .
beckstein is a loyal supporter of bavarian premier edmund stoiber and many see him as a potential successor to his current boss . research and education : annette schavan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : annette schavan schavan , 50 , serves as minister for culture and education in the southwestern state of baden-württemberg .
she was defeated in a race to succeed former premier erwin teufel by current premier , günther oettinger .
a theologian , schavan is considered a smart politician , who likes to remain in the background and does n't search the limelight .
in 1998 , she became well known throughout germany when she refused to grant civil-servant status to a muslim teacher who insisted on wearing a veil in the classroom . social affairs , health , senior citizens : ursula von der leyen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ursula von der leyen the 46-year-old minister for social affairs in the northern state of lower saxony is considered one of her party 's rising stars .
last december she was elected as a vice chairman by 94.1 percent of delegates .

dw-world has compiled biographical information about the members . merkel 's troupe , which has already been rechristened " incompetence team " by chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats , is not really a shadow cabinet as it 's still unclear whether the team members will eventually fill their respective positions in a conservative-led cabinet . most members have said they are willing to serve as ministers , with thuringia 's premier , dieter althaus , being the one exception .
bavarian premier edmund stoiber , who could lay claim to any ministry , has still not made up his mind about whether he wants to move to berlin .
and the election outcome will also be decisive as merkel 's christian democrats might have to hand ministries to coalition partners - either the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , or the social democrats in a grand coalition . bildunterschrift : the competence team -lrb- from left -rrb- : norbert lammert , günther beckstein , gerda hasselfeldt , wolfgang schäuble , peter müller , ursula von der leyen , anette schavan , paul kirchhof , dieter althaus .
on the right are angela merkel and edmund stoiber the " competence team " is therefore meant to give a face to important policy areas .
dw-world offers some background on its members . agriculture , environment and consumer protection : gerda hasselfeldt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerda hasselfeldt hasselfeldt , 55 , is widely unknown despite serving as her party 's deputy leader in parliament and holding the office of minister for construction and later health under former chancellor helmut kohl from 1989 to 1992 .
she had been accused of a cold leadership style and refusing to listen to ministry officials .
the mother of two children later became her party 's financial affairs spokeswoman in parliament .
a macro-economist , she grew up in a rural part of bavaria .
her father was a farmer , butcher and mayor of a small town in the eastern part of the state . culture : norbert lammert bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : norbert lammert lammert is deputy president of germany 's parliament and has been his party 's culture and media spokesman .
the 57-year-old social scientist is the son of a baker and comes from western germany 's industrial ruhr area .
much of his political career has been focused on education policies , but he also served as junior minister in germany 's ministry of economics from 1994 . eastern german reconstruction : dieter althaus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter althaus althaus might play a decisive role during the election .
the 47-year-old premier of the eastern state of thuringia is meant to become the cdu 's face of eastern germany and is expected to placate voters in the east after bavarian premier edmund stoiber accused them of being " frustrated " and called on voters in the western parts of the country to not let easterners decide the outcome of the election .
initially considered bland , althaus succeeded thuringia 's charismatic former premier , bernhard vogel , in 2003 and has since become a constant guest on german talk shows .
he has called on his party colleagues to show willingness to compromise with the ruling coalition of social democrats and greens and veered from established cdu views on labor policies and subsidies for the eastern states .
a former professor of mathematics and physics , he still avoids open confrontation with party friends and is considered a close merkel ally . economy and labor : peter müller bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter müller müller , 49 , is premier of the southwestern state of saarland and is seen as a generalist .
he is considered to be a definite member of a cabinet under merkel , but not necessarily in the same function as the one he has taken on now .
bavarian premier edmund stoiber might claim the economics and labor ministry after all .
müller has become well known throughout germany as president of his party 's commission on immigration .
a lawyer by trade , he is considered a " liberal " conservative , who does not always follow party lines , as has been the case regarding immigration issues as well as his opposition to the war in iraq . finances : paul kirchhof bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul kirchhof a former constitutional court judge , kirchhof is not a member of the christian democrats and is respected as a tax expert across party lines .
the 62-year-old law professor from heidelberg has introduced a radical tax reform model : he wants to do away with all forms of tax subsidies and lower the highest income tax rate to 25 percent .
kirchhof , who has four children , has also been lobbying for more state help to families with children .
during his last year as constitutional court judge , he lowered the tax burden on families by billions .
observers doubt that he will actually serve in merkel 's cabinet should she become chancellor .
many cdu members consider his ideas too radical .
he also rejects merkel 's plan to raise vat by 2 percent . foreign and security policy : wolfgang schäuble bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang schäuble without a doubt , schäuble is one of the cdu 's most competent politicians and a generalist like müller .
a former party leader , he has concentrated on international politics for years and shaped the cdu 's views in this area .
schäuble recently visited us president george w. bush , as he again pointed out during statements on wednesday .
his relationship with merkel is not the best , however .
last fall , he rejected her offer to become her deputy for financial and economic affairs in parliament .
a former parliamentary leader himself who lost his positions in the wake of a party bribery scandal , schäuble was upset that merkel did not nominate him for the german presidency in 2004 and gave that job to former imf director horst köhler instead .
it 's unlikely that schäuble , who uses a wheel chair after an assassination attempt , will become foreign minister in case of an election victory as that position will be claimed by the cdu 's likely coalition partner , the fdp , or stoiber . interior affairs : günther beckstein bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günther beckstein beckstein , 61 , is bavarian interior minister , but well known throughout germany as he is a frequent guest on national talk shows .
he is often 's interviewed on subjects such as terrorism , illegal immigration and domestic safety .
in office for 11 years , he is an ardent promoter of a " no tolerance " policy and has uncompromising views on immigration .
bavaria is the state that deports immigrants fastest and most frequently .
beckstein is a loyal supporter of bavarian premier edmund stoiber and many see him as a potential successor to his current boss . research and education : annette schavan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : annette schavan schavan , 50 , serves as minister for culture and education in the southwestern state of baden-württemberg .
she was defeated in a race to succeed former premier erwin teufel by current premier , günther oettinger .
a theologian , schavan is considered a smart politician , who likes to remain in the background and does n't search the limelight .
in 1998 , she became well known throughout germany when she refused to grant civil-servant status to a muslim teacher who insisted on wearing a veil in the classroom . social affairs , health , senior citizens : ursula von der leyen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ursula von der leyen the 46-year-old minister for social affairs in the northern state of lower saxony is considered one of her party 's rising stars .
last december she was elected as a vice chairman by 94.1 percent of delegates .
von der leyen worked as a doctor before becoming a minister in 2003 .
she is the daughter of a former premier of lower saxony , ernst albrecht , and has seven children . compiled by steffen leidel -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel unveils her campaign team seeking to stem a decline in the polls , conservative chancellor candidate angela merkel announced her team of advisors during the election campaign wednesday .

a mobile service will relay the papal message to their cell phones . when pope benedict xvi delivers his final mass on sunday to end the world youth day celebrations , it 'll be a difficult feat for any of the 800,000 strong crowd of pilgrims expected to get anywhere close to the pontiff .
instead he will come to every single one of them - provided they have signed up for a text messaging service organized by the german bishop 's conference and tv broadcaster rtl .
spreading the message for those who have subscribed , every evening over the past week has seen a short but significant quote taken from a statement made by the pope on that day arrive on their cell phones , said dietmar heeg , a catholic priest who is in charge of organizing the service on behalf of germany 's catholic bishops .
" in this way the core theological statements of the german pope have been spread widely and quickly , " he added .
to subscribe , the believers only had to send an initial message to a service number to receive the quotes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi visits germany next week heeg , who works with a catholic tv production company in the city of frankfurt am main , has been responsible for selecting the quotes which have been sent via the mobile networks .
" in the run-up to the pope 's visit , we started the service by sending out statements benedict xvi. made in connection with world youth day , " explained heeg . 160 characters for the pope 's message to condense the papal utterances into 160 characters of a text message is certainly no mean feat , but the priest is no newcomer to the field of mobile spiritual guidance - and the limitations that come with it .

no profit the service does come at a price - around ten eurocents for the evening prayer and 0.29 for the new daily text message from the pope .
but heeg insists neither the production company nor the church is making any profit , the fees just about cover the costs of relaying the texts .
while heeg 's company is fully responsible for the evening prayer service , the higher price for the pontiff 's quotes comes about because in this case broadcaster rtl covers the technical side of the service and offers it as part of their premium rate text messaging .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 17.08.2005 you 've got mail -lrb- from the pope -rrb- großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blessms : spiritual guidance on your cell phone germans who ca n't attend the pope 's final mass of the world youth day celebrations on sunday need not despair .
a mobile service will relay the papal message to their cell phones . when pope benedict xvi delivers his final mass on sunday to end the world youth day celebrations , it 'll be a difficult feat for any of the 800,000 strong crowd of pilgrims expected to get anywhere close to the pontiff .
instead he will come to every single one of them - provided they have signed up for a text messaging service organized by the german bishop 's conference and tv broadcaster rtl .
spreading the message for those who have subscribed , every evening over the past week has seen a short but significant quote taken from a statement made by the pope on that day arrive on their cell phones , said dietmar heeg , a catholic priest who is in charge of organizing the service on behalf of germany 's catholic bishops .
" in this way the core theological statements of the german pope have been spread widely and quickly , " he added .
to subscribe , the believers only had to send an initial message to a service number to receive the quotes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi visits germany next week heeg , who works with a catholic tv production company in the city of frankfurt am main , has been responsible for selecting the quotes which have been sent via the mobile networks .
" in the run-up to the pope 's visit , we started the service by sending out statements benedict xvi. made in connection with world youth day , " explained heeg . 160 characters for the pope 's message to condense the papal utterances into 160 characters of a text message is certainly no mean feat , but the priest is no newcomer to the field of mobile spiritual guidance - and the limitations that come with it .
at the frankfurt based company he already runs another service .
the " sms-abendgebet " relays the " text message evening prayer " penned by a number of preachers on two of the country 's major tv networks - to the cell phones of the believers .
no profit the service does come at a price - around ten eurocents for the evening prayer and 0.29 for the new daily text message from the pope .
but heeg insists neither the production company nor the church is making any profit , the fees just about cover the costs of relaying the texts .
while heeg 's company is fully responsible for the evening prayer service , the higher price for the pontiff 's quotes comes about because in this case broadcaster rtl covers the technical side of the service and offers it as part of their premium rate text messaging .
any surplus would therefore end up in their coffers .
new service no " mass product " starting a week prior to wyd germans were able to register for the mobile messages from the pope .
" this is the first time we offer a service of this kind together with the catholic church , " said simone danner of broadcaster rtl , who declined to comment on the number of subscriptions received for the week-long event .
although text messages can be sent out to up to 1,000 people at the same time , she admits the service is " not a mass product " as it is aimed at " a specific group of people " and not likely to be as popular as their weather and news mobile services . ranty islam , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world youth day 2005 dossier : the 2005 world youth day in cologne , germany , is an event of superlatives .

world youth day -lrb- wyd -rrb- information points at the railway station and throughout the city center were already waiting on the youth from around the globe to provide guidance - on navigating the city and the events of wyd that is .
the city center appears dotted with stages that host the events of wyd , makeshift tv studios were being set up and posters of the new pope were gracing walls and shop windows .
one day before the official start of world youth day 2005 in cologne things seemed to be running smoothly .
critics on the ground from day one but at the same time criticism was fermenting in the underground - literally .
in the basement of a luxury hotel some 10 minutes walk from the main station , the " world youth day 4 all " -lrb- wyd4all -rrb- coalition was also kicking off with their first press conference on monday morning .
the coalition of grassroots organizations bemoans the lack of room the wyd affords to discuss let alone criticize the church 's stance on controversial issues like contraception or the role of women .
strategic focus on specific issues their monday morning press briefing focused on hiv / aids prevention and the stance of the catholic church on the issue .
by banning the use of condoms " our church leaders are putting the world population at risk , " said molly o 'gorman from the washington-based organization catholics for a free choice which is part of the wyd4all coalition .
despite a host of matters and general themes on which critics disagree with the catholic church , o 'gorman insists that the focus on a specific issue such as this can steer a lot more people into action .
" it also leaves the church leaders with very little wiggle room , " she added .
bildunterschrift : poster for gay and lesbian youths at world youth day more church leaders speaking out according to catholics for a free choice a number of catholic bishops around the world - many from developing nations - have softened their stance on condom use , including the indian catholic bishop 's conference which has agreed to " provide all information about it " to couples seeking advice .
on a number of issues more and more bishops are coming out of the closet against the established views of the senior leadership including the pope .
molly o 'gorman is convinced that in the medium term this could lead to an internal revolution within the church .
and this is backed by pressure from the grassroots : surveys show that catholics around the world are defying the official vatican line in their daily lives .
how to address the crowd but how do the critics carry their message to the believers attending world youth day ?
wyd 2005 resembles the " communist world youth games , " german wyd4all spokesperson tobias raschke told the left-leaning newspaper tageszeitung recently .
and just like in those mass events of the cold war there is no room for the discussion of contentious but highly relevant issues , he said .
only last week german bishops issued a statement that essentially labeled two of germany 's most prominent church critics personae non gratae at the world youth day .
but catholic youth appear to have remained surprisingly quiet in response .
many young people come for the party , admitted raschke .
but then why should they listen to the critics ?
" we know that young people do feel strongly about many of the issues .
all we do is to provide information and the chance to discuss , if they so wish . "
it remains to be seen how much headway the critics can make during world youth day 2005 in the face of seemingly overwhelming enthusiasm for the visit of the new pope .

" we 're a strong team and we 're ready to show germany that we can do things better , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former constitutional court judge paul kirchhof was named as finance expert onto merkel 's dream team one of the most important positions , that of financial affairs , will be filled by paul kirchhof -lrb- photo -rrb- , a former constitutional court judge and tax expert , who would cover the field of finances .
his background has been criticized by some experts .
" politics should not be about appointing friends but about competence and political experience and -lrb- friedrich -rrb- merz is clearly the one with those attributes , " peter lösche , a political scientist at göttingen university , told reuters .
friedrich merz , probably the cdu 's best financial expert , fell out with merkel during the power struggle for leadership within the christian democrats last year , thus leaving a large hole in that area within the party .
kirchhof , who is an independent , has been a vocal advocate of a simplified tax code .
in fact , merz assumed many of his ideas while he served as deputy party chairman .
while some suggested that merkel would create a " mega ministry " for finances , economics and labor in case she gets elected , the cdu leader said this would not make any sense .
there had been speculation that edmund stoiber would give up his job as bavarian premier to take on such a ministry .
" everyone can see that the minister of finance has his plate full , " merkel told german weekly stern .
" i ca n't really imagine merging finances , economics and labor into one ministry . "
beckstein to cover interior affairs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter müller , currently premier of the small state of saarland the new economics minister then could be peter müller -lrb- photo -rrb- , premier of the small western state of saarland , who will cover that area in merkel 's shadow cabinet .
for interior affairs , bavarian interior minister günther beckstein got the nod .
he would replace current german interior minister otto schily , should the cdu win on sept.18.
wolfgang schäuble , a longtime foreign policy expert , even under former chancellor helmut kohl , will serve as european and foreign affairs advisor .
ursula von der leyen , minister for social affairs in the state of lowe saxony , will take on family and social affairs .
annette schavan , minister for research and education in the state of baden-württemberg , will advise merkel in the same capacity .
gerda hasselfeldt , a former federal minister for construction , will serve as expert for agricultural , environmental and consumer affairs .
norbert lammert , a vice president of germany 's parliament , covers culture in the " competence team . "
apart from dieter althaus , the premier of the eastern state of thuringia , who will advise merkel on eastern german affairs , all members of the team have in principle agreed to serve in a cabinet under merkel should she be elected chancellor , the cdu leader said bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a potential successor for otto schily , günther beckstein bavarian premier edmund stoiber will not serve in any particular capacity .
but stoiber , who irked conservative allies by making disparaging remarks about eastern germans last week , is expected to attend merkel 's press conference announcing her team .
stoiber 's refusal to commit to moving to berlin until after the poll has been a source of great irritation to merkel and the cdu .
because he is head of the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the csu , nobody could hinder him from taking a post in berlin after sept .

at the youth gathering they have been going on the offensive from day one . the pilgrims arriving in cologne on monday morning were certainly left in no doubt .
world youth day -lrb- wyd -rrb- information points at the railway station and throughout the city center were already waiting on the youth from around the globe to provide guidance - on navigating the city and the events of wyd that is .
the city center appears dotted with stages that host the events of wyd , makeshift tv studios were being set up and posters of the new pope were gracing walls and shop windows .
one day before the official start of world youth day 2005 in cologne things seemed to be running smoothly .
critics on the ground from day one but at the same time criticism was fermenting in the underground - literally .
in the basement of a luxury hotel some 10 minutes walk from the main station , the " world youth day 4 all " -lrb- wyd4all -rrb- coalition was also kicking off with their first press conference on monday morning .
the coalition of grassroots organizations bemoans the lack of room the wyd affords to discuss let alone criticize the church 's stance on controversial issues like contraception or the role of women .
strategic focus on specific issues their monday morning press briefing focused on hiv / aids prevention and the stance of the catholic church on the issue .
by banning the use of condoms " our church leaders are putting the world population at risk , " said molly o 'gorman from the washington-based organization catholics for a free choice which is part of the wyd4all coalition .
despite a host of matters and general themes on which critics disagree with the catholic church , o 'gorman insists that the focus on a specific issue such as this can steer a lot more people into action .
" it also leaves the church leaders with very little wiggle room , " she added .
bildunterschrift : poster for gay and lesbian youths at world youth day more church leaders speaking out according to catholics for a free choice a number of catholic bishops around the world - many from developing nations - have softened their stance on condom use , including the indian catholic bishop 's conference which has agreed to " provide all information about it " to couples seeking advice .
on a number of issues more and more bishops are coming out of the closet against the established views of the senior leadership including the pope .
molly o 'gorman is convinced that in the medium term this could lead to an internal revolution within the church .
and this is backed by pressure from the grassroots : surveys show that catholics around the world are defying the official vatican line in their daily lives .
how to address the crowd but how do the critics carry their message to the believers attending world youth day ?
wyd 2005 resembles the " communist world youth games , " german wyd4all spokesperson tobias raschke told the left-leaning newspaper tageszeitung recently .
and just like in those mass events of the cold war there is no room for the discussion of contentious but highly relevant issues , he said .
only last week german bishops issued a statement that essentially labeled two of germany 's most prominent church critics personae non gratae at the world youth day .
but catholic youth appear to have remained surprisingly quiet in response .
many young people come for the party , admitted raschke .
but then why should they listen to the critics ?
" we know that young people do feel strongly about many of the issues .
all we do is to provide information and the chance to discuss , if they so wish . "
it remains to be seen how much headway the critics can make during world youth day 2005 in the face of seemingly overwhelming enthusiasm for the visit of the new pope .

an independent panel of german scientists has warned that the wholesale use of gene testing to check on the health of job applicants is not advisable .
the government wants an outright ban . germany 's national ethics council , which advises the government on ethical questions of modern medicine , recommended tuesday that forcible gene testing in the workplace for hereditary diseases should be subject to strict restrictions under german law .

" there is no law in germany governing the use of these tests in a detailed manner , " he said .
" all jurisdiction made by german courts so far is rather vague and does not match the technological progress in this field . " restrictions in germany , forcible gene tests made the headlines after a young teacher was refused employment two years ago for failing to undergo a test of her genes .

an independent panel of german scientists has warned that the wholesale use of gene testing to check on the health of job applicants is not advisable .
the government wants an outright ban . germany 's national ethics council , which advises the government on ethical questions of modern medicine , recommended tuesday that forcible gene testing in the workplace for hereditary diseases should be subject to strict restrictions under german law .
it did , however , concede that exceptions could be made if third parties might be at risk - in the case of pilots , for example . an urgent need for legislation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some one hundred thousand gene tests are carried out in germany every year - many of them ordered by employers seeking to check on the long-term health risks of people applying for jobs . germany 's national ethics council believes that legislation protecting workers and employees is urgently needed to avoid misuse of data gathered from these tests . jochen taupitz , a legal advisor on the panel , believes that existing german regulations are lagging far behind the rapid advances in gene technology . " there is no law in germany governing the use of these tests in a detailed manner , " he said .
" all jurisdiction made by german courts so far is rather vague and does not match the technological progress in this field . " restrictions in germany , forcible gene tests made the headlines after a young teacher was refused employment two years ago for failing to undergo a test of her genes .

a court ruled in the woman 's favor . kristiane weber-hassemer is the head of the german ethics council .
" we have come to agree that restrictions must be imposed here , " she said .
" this is especially needed to protect employees against dismissal for medical reasons .
restrictions must be put on the period of validity of gene diagnoses and predictions about the chances that a disease might occur . " 5-year diagnostic validity the scientists are demanding that the diagnostic validity of a gene test should not go beyond 5 years and that test results must be labeled negative if the possibility of an outbreak of a specific disease is estimated at less than 50 percent . efforts by chancellor schröder 's center-left government to adopt new gene laws have been halted until after early elections in germany in september this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the recommendations made by the ethics council tuesday , however , do n't affect other areas of public life - including possible gene screening by insurance companies .

a mobile service will relay the papal message to their cell phones . when pope benedict xvi delivers his final mass on sunday to end the world youth day celebrations , it 'll be a difficult feat for any of the 800,000 strong crowd of pilgrims expected to get anywhere close to the pontiff .
instead he will come to every single one of them - provided they have signed up for a text messaging service organized by the german bishop 's conference and tv broadcaster rtl .
spreading the message for those who have subscribed , every evening over the past week has seen a short but significant quote taken from a statement made by the pope on that day arrive on their cell phones , said dietmar heeg , a catholic priest who is in charge of organizing the service on behalf of germany 's catholic bishops .
" in this way the core theological statements of the german pope have been spread widely and quickly , " he added .
to subscribe , the believers only had to send an initial message to a service number to receive the quotes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi visits germany next week heeg , who works with a catholic tv production company in the city of frankfurt am main , has been responsible for selecting the quotes which have been sent via the mobile networks .
" in the run-up to the pope 's visit , we started the service by sending out statements benedict xvi. made in connection with world youth day , " explained heeg . 160 characters for the pope 's message to condense the papal utterances into 160 characters of a text message is certainly no mean feat , but the priest is no newcomer to the field of mobile spiritual guidance - and the limitations that come with it .
at the frankfurt based company he already runs another service .
the " sms-abendgebet " relays the " text message evening prayer " penned by a number of preachers on two of the country 's major tv networks - to the cell phones of the believers .
no profit the service does come at a price - around ten eurocents for the evening prayer and 0.29 for the new daily text message from the pope .
but heeg insists neither the production company nor the church is making any profit , the fees just about cover the costs of relaying the texts .
while heeg 's company is fully responsible for the evening prayer service , the higher price for the pontiff 's quotes comes about because in this case broadcaster rtl covers the technical side of the service and offers it as part of their premium rate text messaging .
any surplus would therefore end up in their coffers .
new service no " mass product " starting a week prior to wyd germans were able to register for the mobile messages from the pope .
" this is the first time we offer a service of this kind together with the catholic church , " said simone danner of broadcaster rtl , who declined to comment on the number of subscriptions received for the week-long event .
although text messages can be sent out to up to 1,000 people at the same time , she admits the service is " not a mass product " as it is aimed at " a specific group of people " and not likely to be as popular as their weather and news mobile services . ranty islam , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world youth day 2005 dossier : the 2005 world youth day in cologne , germany , is an event of superlatives .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de election 2005 -pipe- 17.08.2005 merkel 's " dream team " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said the group covers the spectrum of most important issues conservative chancellor candidate angela merkel presented her so-called " competence team " on wednesday .
dw-world has compiled biographical information about the members . merkel 's troupe , which has already been rechristened " incompetence team " by chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats , is not really a shadow cabinet as it 's still unclear whether the team members will eventually fill their respective positions in a conservative-led cabinet . most members have said they are willing to serve as ministers , with thuringia 's premier , dieter althaus , being the one exception .
bavarian premier edmund stoiber , who could lay claim to any ministry , has still not made up his mind about whether he wants to move to berlin .
and the election outcome will also be decisive as merkel 's christian democrats might have to hand ministries to coalition partners - either the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , or the social democrats in a grand coalition . bildunterschrift : the competence team -lrb- from left -rrb- : norbert lammert , günther beckstein , gerda hasselfeldt , wolfgang schäuble , peter müller , ursula von der leyen , anette schavan , paul kirchhof , dieter althaus .
on the right are angela merkel and edmund stoiber the " competence team " is therefore meant to give a face to important policy areas .
dw-world offers some background on its members . agriculture , environment and consumer protection : gerda hasselfeldt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerda hasselfeldt hasselfeldt , 55 , is widely unknown despite serving as her party 's deputy leader in parliament and holding the office of minister for construction and later health under former chancellor helmut kohl from 1989 to 1992 .
she had been accused of a cold leadership style and refusing to listen to ministry officials .
the mother of two children later became her party 's financial affairs spokeswoman in parliament .
a macro-economist , she grew up in a rural part of bavaria .
her father was a farmer , butcher and mayor of a small town in the eastern part of the state . culture : norbert lammert bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : norbert lammert lammert is deputy president of germany 's parliament and has been his party 's culture and media spokesman .
the 57-year-old social scientist is the son of a baker and comes from western germany 's industrial ruhr area .
much of his political career has been focused on education policies , but he also served as junior minister in germany 's ministry of economics from 1994 . eastern german reconstruction : dieter althaus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter althaus althaus might play a decisive role during the election .
the 47-year-old premier of the eastern state of thuringia is meant to become the cdu 's face of eastern germany and is expected to placate voters in the east after bavarian premier edmund stoiber accused them of being " frustrated " and called on voters in the western parts of the country to not let easterners decide the outcome of the election .
initially considered bland , althaus succeeded thuringia 's charismatic former premier , bernhard vogel , in 2003 and has since become a constant guest on german talk shows .
he has called on his party colleagues to show willingness to compromise with the ruling coalition of social democrats and greens and veered from established cdu views on labor policies and subsidies for the eastern states .
a former professor of mathematics and physics , he still avoids open confrontation with party friends and is considered a close merkel ally . economy and labor : peter müller bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter müller müller , 49 , is premier of the southwestern state of saarland and is seen as a generalist .
he is considered to be a definite member of a cabinet under merkel , but not necessarily in the same function as the one he has taken on now .
bavarian premier edmund stoiber might claim the economics and labor ministry after all .
müller has become well known throughout germany as president of his party 's commission on immigration .
a lawyer by trade , he is considered a " liberal " conservative , who does not always follow party lines , as has been the case regarding immigration issues as well as his opposition to the war in iraq . finances : paul kirchhof bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul kirchhof a former constitutional court judge , kirchhof is not a member of the christian democrats and is respected as a tax expert across party lines .
the 62-year-old law professor from heidelberg has introduced a radical tax reform model : he wants to do away with all forms of tax subsidies and lower the highest income tax rate to 25 percent .
kirchhof , who has four children , has also been lobbying for more state help to families with children .
during his last year as constitutional court judge , he lowered the tax burden on families by billions .
observers doubt that he will actually serve in merkel 's cabinet should she become chancellor .
many cdu members consider his ideas too radical .
he also rejects merkel 's plan to raise vat by 2 percent . foreign and security policy : wolfgang schäuble bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang schäuble without a doubt , schäuble is one of the cdu 's most competent politicians and a generalist like müller .
a former party leader , he has concentrated on international politics for years and shaped the cdu 's views in this area .
schäuble recently visited us president george w. bush , as he again pointed out during statements on wednesday .
his relationship with merkel is not the best , however .
last fall , he rejected her offer to become her deputy for financial and economic affairs in parliament .
a former parliamentary leader himself who lost his positions in the wake of a party bribery scandal , schäuble was upset that merkel did not nominate him for the german presidency in 2004 and gave that job to former imf director horst köhler instead .
it 's unlikely that schäuble , who uses a wheel chair after an assassination attempt , will become foreign minister in case of an election victory as that position will be claimed by the cdu 's likely coalition partner , the fdp , or stoiber . interior affairs : günther beckstein bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günther beckstein beckstein , 61 , is bavarian interior minister , but well known throughout germany as he is a frequent guest on national talk shows .
he is often 's interviewed on subjects such as terrorism , illegal immigration and domestic safety .
in office for 11 years , he is an ardent promoter of a " no tolerance " policy and has uncompromising views on immigration .

at the youth gathering they have been going on the offensive from day one . the pilgrims arriving in cologne on monday morning were certainly left in no doubt .
world youth day -lrb- wyd -rrb- information points at the railway station and throughout the city center were already waiting on the youth from around the globe to provide guidance - on navigating the city and the events of wyd that is .
the city center appears dotted with stages that host the events of wyd , makeshift tv studios were being set up and posters of the new pope were gracing walls and shop windows .
one day before the official start of world youth day 2005 in cologne things seemed to be running smoothly .
critics on the ground from day one but at the same time criticism was fermenting in the underground - literally .
in the basement of a luxury hotel some 10 minutes walk from the main station , the " world youth day 4 all " -lrb- wyd4all -rrb- coalition was also kicking off with their first press conference on monday morning .
the coalition of grassroots organizations bemoans the lack of room the wyd affords to discuss let alone criticize the church 's stance on controversial issues like contraception or the role of women .
strategic focus on specific issues their monday morning press briefing focused on hiv / aids prevention and the stance of the catholic church on the issue .
by banning the use of condoms " our church leaders are putting the world population at risk , " said molly o 'gorman from the washington-based organization catholics for a free choice which is part of the wyd4all coalition .
despite a host of matters and general themes on which critics disagree with the catholic church , o 'gorman insists that the focus on a specific issue such as this can steer a lot more people into action .
" it also leaves the church leaders with very little wiggle room , " she added .
bildunterschrift : poster for gay and lesbian youths at world youth day more church leaders speaking out according to catholics for a free choice a number of catholic bishops around the world - many from developing nations - have softened their stance on condom use , including the indian catholic bishop 's conference which has agreed to " provide all information about it " to couples seeking advice .
on a number of issues more and more bishops are coming out of the closet against the established views of the senior leadership including the pope .
molly o 'gorman is convinced that in the medium term this could lead to an internal revolution within the church .
and this is backed by pressure from the grassroots : surveys show that catholics around the world are defying the official vatican line in their daily lives .
how to address the crowd but how do the critics carry their message to the believers attending world youth day ?
wyd 2005 resembles the " communist world youth games , " german wyd4all spokesperson tobias raschke told the left-leaning newspaper tageszeitung recently .
and just like in those mass events of the cold war there is no room for the discussion of contentious but highly relevant issues , he said .
only last week german bishops issued a statement that essentially labeled two of germany 's most prominent church critics personae non gratae at the world youth day .
but catholic youth appear to have remained surprisingly quiet in response .
many young people come for the party , admitted raschke .
but then why should they listen to the critics ?
" we know that young people do feel strongly about many of the issues .
all we do is to provide information and the chance to discuss , if they so wish . "
it remains to be seen how much headway the critics can make during world youth day 2005 in the face of seemingly overwhelming enthusiasm for the visit of the new pope .

" we 're a strong team and we 're ready to show germany that we can do things better , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former constitutional court judge paul kirchhof was named as finance expert onto merkel 's dream team one of the most important positions , that of financial affairs , will be filled by paul kirchhof -lrb- photo -rrb- , a former constitutional court judge and tax expert , who would cover the field of finances .
his background has been criticized by some experts .
" politics should not be about appointing friends but about competence and political experience and -lrb- friedrich -rrb- merz is clearly the one with those attributes , " peter lösche , a political scientist at göttingen university , told reuters .
friedrich merz , probably the cdu 's best financial expert , fell out with merkel during the power struggle for leadership within the christian democrats last year , thus leaving a large hole in that area within the party .
kirchhof , who is an independent , has been a vocal advocate of a simplified tax code .
in fact , merz assumed many of his ideas while he served as deputy party chairman .
while some suggested that merkel would create a " mega ministry " for finances , economics and labor in case she gets elected , the cdu leader said this would not make any sense .
there had been speculation that edmund stoiber would give up his job as bavarian premier to take on such a ministry .
" everyone can see that the minister of finance has his plate full , " merkel told german weekly stern .
" i ca n't really imagine merging finances , economics and labor into one ministry . "
beckstein to cover interior affairs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter müller , currently premier of the small state of saarland the new economics minister then could be peter müller -lrb- photo -rrb- , premier of the small western state of saarland , who will cover that area in merkel 's shadow cabinet .
for interior affairs , bavarian interior minister günther beckstein got the nod .
he would replace current german interior minister otto schily , should the cdu win on sept.18.
wolfgang schäuble , a longtime foreign policy expert , even under former chancellor helmut kohl , will serve as european and foreign affairs advisor .
ursula von der leyen , minister for social affairs in the state of lowe saxony , will take on family and social affairs .
annette schavan , minister for research and education in the state of baden-württemberg , will advise merkel in the same capacity .
gerda hasselfeldt , a former federal minister for construction , will serve as expert for agricultural , environmental and consumer affairs .
norbert lammert , a vice president of germany 's parliament , covers culture in the " competence team . "
apart from dieter althaus , the premier of the eastern state of thuringia , who will advise merkel on eastern german affairs , all members of the team have in principle agreed to serve in a cabinet under merkel should she be elected chancellor , the cdu leader said bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a potential successor for otto schily , günther beckstein bavarian premier edmund stoiber will not serve in any particular capacity .
but stoiber , who irked conservative allies by making disparaging remarks about eastern germans last week , is expected to attend merkel 's press conference announcing her team .
stoiber 's refusal to commit to moving to berlin until after the poll has been a source of great irritation to merkel and the cdu .
because he is head of the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the csu , nobody could hinder him from taking a post in berlin after sept .

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . the idea -lrb- of distributing condoms -rrb- is crazy .
the thousands of youths who would be attending the world youth day are mostly conservative practicing catholics , and as such , the distribution of condoms at the event would be shocking and offensive to them . - carol it is such a great idea to make use of this event distributing condoms to the youth , considering the fact that it is not all prayers that will happen there .
i just hope they will attach these condoms on flyers with useful information printed on it .
coming from a country such as the philippines , whose population is so high and the rate of hiv-aids is increasing , i definitely agree with this concept ! - sam , philippines police should be distributing the rosary ! - pachla how stupid ! it would be like having a bikini contest during the muslim pilgrimage in mecca or a pig roast at the wailing wall . - p.cassidy how dare they even think of such a thing !
this is a religious gathering of young people who are faithful to the catholic church , if they were n't they would n't bother to travel the distances some are traveling or live under the conditions they will be living under for the days of wyd .
this should not be treated like any other gathering of young people such as a rock concert , etc . - anita wyd is about christ not about sex !
people do not go to wyd to have sex , but if they do that means they did n't get the idea of wyd .
christ never spoke of sex , he spoke of love ... our 21st century seems not see the difference between one and the other ! - bea , toronto , canada we need condoms like we need pornography - both are evils that the church condemns , and rightly so . - grace desouza giving away free condoms would imply that using them is perfectly okay , which it is not . give these young people the respect they deserve - acknowledge that they should and can abstain from immoral behavior . - joan collins distribution of condoms is so contrary to what these young people are about . they are there to grow spiritually , not to be sexually active .
we pray that those who wish to destroy the soul will be converted to know there is much more to life than a sexual appetite . - carol finerty condoms should not be distributed .
i think to do so shows arrogance beyond belief and insensitivity on behalf of those who push such an agenda . - fergal o 'neill did we not learn anything from our beloved holy father john paul ii regarding the culture of life and the theology of the body ?
we are made in the image and likeness of god and need to live for him and live a life of self-sacrifice . - frances huck dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de condom plans cancelled at youth fest as 400,000 catholic young people from around the world prepare to make their way to cologne for world youth day , a spat over condom distribution has erupted .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 17.08.2005 church critics ready to rumble großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not everyone at world youth day is on the same team catholic reformists bemoan the lack of discussion of controversial issues at wyd .
at the youth gathering they have been going on the offensive from day one . the pilgrims arriving in cologne on monday morning were certainly left in no doubt .
world youth day -lrb- wyd -rrb- information points at the railway station and throughout the city center were already waiting on the youth from around the globe to provide guidance - on navigating the city and the events of wyd that is .
the city center appears dotted with stages that host the events of wyd , makeshift tv studios were being set up and posters of the new pope were gracing walls and shop windows .
one day before the official start of world youth day 2005 in cologne things seemed to be running smoothly .
critics on the ground from day one but at the same time criticism was fermenting in the underground - literally .
in the basement of a luxury hotel some 10 minutes walk from the main station , the " world youth day 4 all " -lrb- wyd4all -rrb- coalition was also kicking off with their first press conference on monday morning .
the coalition of grassroots organizations bemoans the lack of room the wyd affords to discuss let alone criticize the church 's stance on controversial issues like contraception or the role of women .
strategic focus on specific issues their monday morning press briefing focused on hiv / aids prevention and the stance of the catholic church on the issue .
by banning the use of condoms " our church leaders are putting the world population at risk , " said molly o 'gorman from the washington-based organization catholics for a free choice which is part of the wyd4all coalition .
despite a host of matters and general themes on which critics disagree with the catholic church , o 'gorman insists that the focus on a specific issue such as this can steer a lot more people into action .
" it also leaves the church leaders with very little wiggle room , " she added .
bildunterschrift : poster for gay and lesbian youths at world youth day more church leaders speaking out according to catholics for a free choice a number of catholic bishops around the world - many from developing nations - have softened their stance on condom use , including the indian catholic bishop 's conference which has agreed to " provide all information about it " to couples seeking advice .
on a number of issues more and more bishops are coming out of the closet against the established views of the senior leadership including the pope .
molly o 'gorman is convinced that in the medium term this could lead to an internal revolution within the church .
and this is backed by pressure from the grassroots : surveys show that catholics around the world are defying the official vatican line in their daily lives .
how to address the crowd but how do the critics carry their message to the believers attending world youth day ?
wyd 2005 resembles the " communist world youth games , " german wyd4all spokesperson tobias raschke told the left-leaning newspaper tageszeitung recently .
and just like in those mass events of the cold war there is no room for the discussion of contentious but highly relevant issues , he said .
only last week german bishops issued a statement that essentially labeled two of germany 's most prominent church critics personae non gratae at the world youth day .
but catholic youth appear to have remained surprisingly quiet in response .
many young people come for the party , admitted raschke .
but then why should they listen to the critics ?
" we know that young people do feel strongly about many of the issues .
all we do is to provide information and the chance to discuss , if they so wish . "
it remains to be seen how much headway the critics can make during world youth day 2005 in the face of seemingly overwhelming enthusiasm for the visit of the new pope .

a mobile service will relay the papal message to their cell phones . when pope benedict xvi delivers his final mass on sunday to end the world youth day celebrations , it 'll be a difficult feat for any of the 800,000 strong crowd of pilgrims expected to get anywhere close to the pontiff .
instead he will come to every single one of them - provided they have signed up for a text messaging service organized by the german bishop 's conference and tv broadcaster rtl .
spreading the message for those who have subscribed , every evening over the past week has seen a short but significant quote taken from a statement made by the pope on that day arrive on their cell phones , said dietmar heeg , a catholic priest who is in charge of organizing the service on behalf of germany 's catholic bishops .
" in this way the core theological statements of the german pope have been spread widely and quickly , " he added .
to subscribe , the believers only had to send an initial message to a service number to receive the quotes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi visits germany next week heeg , who works with a catholic tv production company in the city of frankfurt am main , has been responsible for selecting the quotes which have been sent via the mobile networks .
" in the run-up to the pope 's visit , we started the service by sending out statements benedict xvi. made in connection with world youth day , " explained heeg . 160 characters for the pope 's message to condense the papal utterances into 160 characters of a text message is certainly no mean feat , but the priest is no newcomer to the field of mobile spiritual guidance - and the limitations that come with it .
at the frankfurt based company he already runs another service .
the " sms-abendgebet " relays the " text message evening prayer " penned by a number of preachers on two of the country 's major tv networks - to the cell phones of the believers .
no profit the service does come at a price - around ten eurocents for the evening prayer and 0.29 for the new daily text message from the pope .
but heeg insists neither the production company nor the church is making any profit , the fees just about cover the costs of relaying the texts .
while heeg 's company is fully responsible for the evening prayer service , the higher price for the pontiff 's quotes comes about because in this case broadcaster rtl covers the technical side of the service and offers it as part of their premium rate text messaging .
any surplus would therefore end up in their coffers .

" this is the first time we offer a service of this kind together with the catholic church , " said simone danner of broadcaster rtl , who declined to comment on the number of subscriptions received for the week-long event .
although text messages can be sent out to up to 1,000 people at the same time , she admits the service is " not a mass product " as it is aimed at " a specific group of people " and not likely to be as popular as their weather and news mobile services . ranty islam , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world youth day 2005 dossier : the 2005 world youth day in cologne , germany , is an event of superlatives .

instead he will come to every single one of them - provided they have signed up for a text messaging service organized by the german bishop 's conference and tv broadcaster rtl .
spreading the message for those who have subscribed , every evening over the past week has seen a short but significant quote taken from a statement made by the pope on that day arrive on their cell phones , said dietmar heeg , a catholic priest who is in charge of organizing the service on behalf of germany 's catholic bishops .

but heeg insists neither the production company nor the church is making any profit , the fees just about cover the costs of relaying the texts .
while heeg 's company is fully responsible for the evening prayer service , the higher price for the pontiff 's quotes comes about because in this case broadcaster rtl covers the technical side of the service and offers it as part of their premium rate text messaging .

a mobile service will relay the papal message to their cell phones . when pope benedict xvi delivers his final mass on sunday to end the world youth day celebrations , it 'll be a difficult feat for any of the 800,000 strong crowd of pilgrims expected to get anywhere close to the pontiff .
instead he will come to every single one of them - provided they have signed up for a text messaging service organized by the german bishop 's conference and tv broadcaster rtl .
spreading the message for those who have subscribed , every evening over the past week has seen a short but significant quote taken from a statement made by the pope on that day arrive on their cell phones , said dietmar heeg , a catholic priest who is in charge of organizing the service on behalf of germany 's catholic bishops .

" in the run-up to the pope 's visit , we started the service by sending out statements benedict xvi. made in connection with world youth day , " explained heeg . 160 characters for the pope 's message to condense the papal utterances into 160 characters of a text message is certainly no mean feat , but the priest is no newcomer to the field of mobile spiritual guidance - and the limitations that come with it .

but heeg insists neither the production company nor the church is making any profit , the fees just about cover the costs of relaying the texts .
while heeg 's company is fully responsible for the evening prayer service , the higher price for the pontiff 's quotes comes about because in this case broadcaster rtl covers the technical side of the service and offers it as part of their premium rate text messaging .

with a long line of dramatic wins and losses , the arch-rivalry between the two neighbors always guarantees a sensational game . german-dutch soccer matches , even if they 're just friendlies , are seldom nice .
with a long line of dramatic wins and losses , the arch-rivalry between the two neighbors always guarantees a sensational game .
the german national soccer team will be braced for a tough show when they face-off against marco van basten 's netherlands wednesday night in rotterdam .
victories against the oranje have been few and far between in the past two decades , with just three in 11 encounters .
the last one was in 1996 at de kuip stadium in rotterdam , when the german team managed to squeeze out a 1-0 win thanks to jürgen klinsmann 's penalty conversion in the 19th minute .
but besides the fact of beating an old foe , klinsmann , the former striker-turned coach , would like for his side to do something a german team has not accomplished since october 2000 - that is to finally beat one of the world 's top teams .
since their 1-0 victory over england five years ago , germany has reeled off a string of 14 losses or draws against quality competition .
a third-place finish at the confederations cup in june may look impressive in the record books , but wins against australia , tunisia or mexico wo n't keep the experts quiet for long .
klinsmann , usually the epitome of sunshine and optimism – a carry-over from his year-round home in california – is not upbeat about wednesday 's match .
" this game has come too early for us , " he said .
" a lot of our players have just got back into training after the confederations cup . "
the return of experience the big stars of the confed cup were youngsters - the 20-year-old striker lukas podolski and the year-older midfielder bastian schweinsteiger - who are being left behind for the rotterdam game . according to the coaching staff , the two are getting well-deserved breaks .
their absence may be the break some of the players from years past have been waiting for .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : didi hamann -lrb- l -rrb- in his last apperance in german national uniform against latvia at euro 2004 for wednesday 's friendly , liverpool midfielder dietmar " didi " hamann , has been called back into the national squad after recovering from a foot injury , and more than a year after a less than stellar performance at the euro 2004 .
" he is the kind of player who despite a few injuries in the past few months has played the style that fits him , " klinsmann told kicker magazine .
" and he had a great deal to do with fc liverpool 's victory in the champions league . "
the 33-year-old defender christian wörns is also ready to play again after injuries sidelined him for months .
it should be a welcome return in the eyes of goalkeeper oliver kahn .
he and his colleagues jens lehmann and timo hildebrand had to fetch the ball from out of the net 11 times in five games at the confed cup .
miroslav klose , already with three goals in the bundesliga , also missed the confed cup .
the starter-status of the six-goal scorer at the world cup 2002 has been threatened by the rise of lukas podolski .
tops in the bundesliga does n't mean tops in holland bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roy makaay : flying high with bayern munich but grounded on dutch national team on the opposite side , the fate of dutch striker roy makaay , who leads the german bundesliga with five strikes in two matches , looks to be the one sitting on the bench .
the traditional dutch 4-3-3 with just one true striker means that , just as in years past , makaay will be watching from the sidelines most of the match .
ruud van nistelrooy has the better cards in the mind of coach van basten .
the statistics speak loads against makaay : only six goals in 42 matches for oranje .

dutch police have also been given the authority to search visitors in the city 's downtown .
there will be no alcohol consumption in or around the de kuip stadium .
and some 2,000 german fans will be escorted to the ahoy complex in the southern part of the city to pick up their tickets , thereby avoiding the city center and any possible mingling with dutch fans .
such security precautions have grown more and more common in the world of european soccer , where nationalist sentiments combine with sports fever to reach dangerous levels .
the open borders and ease of transportation between rival countries also means that fans can follow their teams almost anywhere .

" we 're a strong team and we 're ready to show germany that we can do things better , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former constitutional court judge paul kirchhof was named as finance expert onto merkel 's dream team one of the most important positions , that of financial affairs , will be filled by paul kirchhof -lrb- photo -rrb- , a former constitutional court judge and tax expert , who would cover the field of finances .
his background has been criticized by some experts .
" politics should not be about appointing friends but about competence and political experience and -lrb- friedrich -rrb- merz is clearly the one with those attributes , " peter lösche , a political scientist at göttingen university , told reuters .
friedrich merz , probably the cdu 's best financial expert , fell out with merkel during the power struggle for leadership within the christian democrats last year , thus leaving a large hole in that area within the party .
kirchhof , who is an independent , has been a vocal advocate of a simplified tax code .
in fact , merz assumed many of his ideas while he served as deputy party chairman .
while some suggested that merkel would create a " mega ministry " for finances , economics and labor in case she gets elected , the cdu leader said this would not make any sense .
there had been speculation that edmund stoiber would give up his job as bavarian premier to take on such a ministry .
" everyone can see that the minister of finance has his plate full , " merkel told german weekly stern .
" i ca n't really imagine merging finances , economics and labor into one ministry . "
beckstein to cover interior affairs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter müller , currently premier of the small state of saarland the new economics minister then could be peter müller -lrb- photo -rrb- , premier of the small western state of saarland , who will cover that area in merkel 's shadow cabinet .
for interior affairs , bavarian interior minister günther beckstein got the nod .
he would replace current german interior minister otto schily , should the cdu win on sept.18.
wolfgang schäuble , a longtime foreign policy expert , even under former chancellor helmut kohl , will serve as european and foreign affairs advisor .
ursula von der leyen , minister for social affairs in the state of lowe saxony , will take on family and social affairs .
annette schavan , minister for research and education in the state of baden-württemberg , will advise merkel in the same capacity .
gerda hasselfeldt , a former federal minister for construction , will serve as expert for agricultural , environmental and consumer affairs .
norbert lammert , a vice president of germany 's parliament , covers culture in the " competence team . "
apart from dieter althaus , the premier of the eastern state of thuringia , who will advise merkel on eastern german affairs , all members of the team have in principle agreed to serve in a cabinet under merkel should she be elected chancellor , the cdu leader said bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a potential successor for otto schily , günther beckstein bavarian premier edmund stoiber will not serve in any particular capacity .
but stoiber , who irked conservative allies by making disparaging remarks about eastern germans last week , is expected to attend merkel 's press conference announcing her team .
stoiber 's refusal to commit to moving to berlin until after the poll has been a source of great irritation to merkel and the cdu .
because he is head of the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the csu , nobody could hinder him from taking a post in berlin after sept .

dw-world has compiled biographical information about the members . merkel 's troupe , which has already been rechristened " incompetence team " by chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats , is not really a shadow cabinet as it 's still unclear whether the team members will eventually fill their respective positions in a conservative-led cabinet . most members have said they are willing to serve as ministers , with thuringia 's premier , dieter althaus , being the one exception .
bavarian premier edmund stoiber , who could lay claim to any ministry , has still not made up his mind about whether he wants to move to berlin .
and the election outcome will also be decisive as merkel 's christian democrats might have to hand ministries to coalition partners - either the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , or the social democrats in a grand coalition . bildunterschrift : the competence team -lrb- from left -rrb- : norbert lammert , günther beckstein , gerda hasselfeldt , wolfgang schäuble , peter müller , ursula von der leyen , anette schavan , paul kirchhof , dieter althaus .
on the right are angela merkel and edmund stoiber the " competence team " is therefore meant to give a face to important policy areas .
dw-world offers some background on its members . agriculture , environment and consumer protection : gerda hasselfeldt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerda hasselfeldt hasselfeldt , 55 , is widely unknown despite serving as her party 's deputy leader in parliament and holding the office of minister for construction and later health under former chancellor helmut kohl from 1989 to 1992 .
she had been accused of a cold leadership style and refusing to listen to ministry officials .
the mother of two children later became her party 's financial affairs spokeswoman in parliament .
a macro-economist , she grew up in a rural part of bavaria .
her father was a farmer , butcher and mayor of a small town in the eastern part of the state . culture : norbert lammert bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : norbert lammert lammert is deputy president of germany 's parliament and has been his party 's culture and media spokesman .
the 57-year-old social scientist is the son of a baker and comes from western germany 's industrial ruhr area .
much of his political career has been focused on education policies , but he also served as junior minister in germany 's ministry of economics from 1994 . eastern german reconstruction : dieter althaus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter althaus althaus might play a decisive role during the election .
the 47-year-old premier of the eastern state of thuringia is meant to become the cdu 's face of eastern germany and is expected to placate voters in the east after bavarian premier edmund stoiber accused them of being " frustrated " and called on voters in the western parts of the country to not let easterners decide the outcome of the election .
initially considered bland , althaus succeeded thuringia 's charismatic former premier , bernhard vogel , in 2003 and has since become a constant guest on german talk shows .
he has called on his party colleagues to show willingness to compromise with the ruling coalition of social democrats and greens and veered from established cdu views on labor policies and subsidies for the eastern states .
a former professor of mathematics and physics , he still avoids open confrontation with party friends and is considered a close merkel ally . economy and labor : peter müller bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter müller müller , 49 , is premier of the southwestern state of saarland and is seen as a generalist .
he is considered to be a definite member of a cabinet under merkel , but not necessarily in the same function as the one he has taken on now .
bavarian premier edmund stoiber might claim the economics and labor ministry after all .
müller has become well known throughout germany as president of his party 's commission on immigration .
a lawyer by trade , he is considered a " liberal " conservative , who does not always follow party lines , as has been the case regarding immigration issues as well as his opposition to the war in iraq . finances : paul kirchhof bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul kirchhof a former constitutional court judge , kirchhof is not a member of the christian democrats and is respected as a tax expert across party lines .
the 62-year-old law professor from heidelberg has introduced a radical tax reform model : he wants to do away with all forms of tax subsidies and lower the highest income tax rate to 25 percent .
kirchhof , who has four children , has also been lobbying for more state help to families with children .
during his last year as constitutional court judge , he lowered the tax burden on families by billions .
observers doubt that he will actually serve in merkel 's cabinet should she become chancellor .
many cdu members consider his ideas too radical .
he also rejects merkel 's plan to raise vat by 2 percent . foreign and security policy : wolfgang schäuble bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang schäuble without a doubt , schäuble is one of the cdu 's most competent politicians and a generalist like müller .
a former party leader , he has concentrated on international politics for years and shaped the cdu 's views in this area .
schäuble recently visited us president george w. bush , as he again pointed out during statements on wednesday .
his relationship with merkel is not the best , however .
last fall , he rejected her offer to become her deputy for financial and economic affairs in parliament .
a former parliamentary leader himself who lost his positions in the wake of a party bribery scandal , schäuble was upset that merkel did not nominate him for the german presidency in 2004 and gave that job to former imf director horst köhler instead .
it 's unlikely that schäuble , who uses a wheel chair after an assassination attempt , will become foreign minister in case of an election victory as that position will be claimed by the cdu 's likely coalition partner , the fdp , or stoiber . interior affairs : günther beckstein bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günther beckstein beckstein , 61 , is bavarian interior minister , but well known throughout germany as he is a frequent guest on national talk shows .
he is often 's interviewed on subjects such as terrorism , illegal immigration and domestic safety .
in office for 11 years , he is an ardent promoter of a " no tolerance " policy and has uncompromising views on immigration .
bavaria is the state that deports immigrants fastest and most frequently .
beckstein is a loyal supporter of bavarian premier edmund stoiber and many see him as a potential successor to his current boss . research and education : annette schavan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : annette schavan schavan , 50 , serves as minister for culture and education in the southwestern state of baden-württemberg .
she was defeated in a race to succeed former premier erwin teufel by current premier , günther oettinger .
a theologian , schavan is considered a smart politician , who likes to remain in the background and does n't search the limelight .
in 1998 , she became well known throughout germany when she refused to grant civil-servant status to a muslim teacher who insisted on wearing a veil in the classroom . social affairs , health , senior citizens : ursula von der leyen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ursula von der leyen the 46-year-old minister for social affairs in the northern state of lower saxony is considered one of her party 's rising stars .
last december she was elected as a vice chairman by 94.1 percent of delegates .
von der leyen worked as a doctor before becoming a minister in 2003 .
she is the daughter of a former premier of lower saxony , ernst albrecht , and has seven children . compiled by steffen leidel -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel unveils her campaign team seeking to stem a decline in the polls , conservative chancellor candidate angela merkel announced her team of advisors during the election campaign wednesday .

dw-world has compiled biographical information about the members . merkel 's troupe , which has already been rechristened " incompetence team " by chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats , is not really a shadow cabinet as it 's still unclear whether the team members will eventually fill their respective positions in a conservative-led cabinet . most members have said they are willing to serve as ministers , with thuringia 's premier , dieter althaus , being the one exception .
bavarian premier edmund stoiber , who could lay claim to any ministry , has still not made up his mind about whether he wants to move to berlin .
and the election outcome will also be decisive as merkel 's christian democrats might have to hand ministries to coalition partners - either the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , or the social democrats in a grand coalition . bildunterschrift : the competence team -lrb- from left -rrb- : norbert lammert , günther beckstein , gerda hasselfeldt , wolfgang schäuble , peter müller , ursula von der leyen , anette schavan , paul kirchhof , dieter althaus .

dw-world offers some background on its members . agriculture , environment and consumer protection : gerda hasselfeldt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerda hasselfeldt hasselfeldt , 55 , is widely unknown despite serving as her party 's deputy leader in parliament and holding the office of minister for construction and later health under former chancellor helmut kohl from 1989 to 1992 .
she had been accused of a cold leadership style and refusing to listen to ministry officials .
the mother of two children later became her party 's financial affairs spokeswoman in parliament .
a macro-economist , she grew up in a rural part of bavaria .
her father was a farmer , butcher and mayor of a small town in the eastern part of the state . culture : norbert lammert bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : norbert lammert lammert is deputy president of germany 's parliament and has been his party 's culture and media spokesman .
the 57-year-old social scientist is the son of a baker and comes from western germany 's industrial ruhr area .
much of his political career has been focused on education policies , but he also served as junior minister in germany 's ministry of economics from 1994 . eastern german reconstruction : dieter althaus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter althaus althaus might play a decisive role during the election .
the 47-year-old premier of the eastern state of thuringia is meant to become the cdu 's face of eastern germany and is expected to placate voters in the east after bavarian premier edmund stoiber accused them of being " frustrated " and called on voters in the western parts of the country to not let easterners decide the outcome of the election .
initially considered bland , althaus succeeded thuringia 's charismatic former premier , bernhard vogel , in 2003 and has since become a constant guest on german talk shows .
he has called on his party colleagues to show willingness to compromise with the ruling coalition of social democrats and greens and veered from established cdu views on labor policies and subsidies for the eastern states .
a former professor of mathematics and physics , he still avoids open confrontation with party friends and is considered a close merkel ally . economy and labor : peter müller bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter müller müller , 49 , is premier of the southwestern state of saarland and is seen as a generalist .
he is considered to be a definite member of a cabinet under merkel , but not necessarily in the same function as the one he has taken on now .
bavarian premier edmund stoiber might claim the economics and labor ministry after all .
müller has become well known throughout germany as president of his party 's commission on immigration .

kirchhof , who has four children , has also been lobbying for more state help to families with children .
during his last year as constitutional court judge , he lowered the tax burden on families by billions .

schäuble recently visited us president george w. bush , as he again pointed out during statements on wednesday .
his relationship with merkel is not the best , however .
last fall , he rejected her offer to become her deputy for financial and economic affairs in parliament .
a former parliamentary leader himself who lost his positions in the wake of a party bribery scandal , schäuble was upset that merkel did not nominate him for the german presidency in 2004 and gave that job to former imf director horst köhler instead .
it 's unlikely that schäuble , who uses a wheel chair after an assassination attempt , will become foreign minister in case of an election victory as that position will be claimed by the cdu 's likely coalition partner , the fdp , or stoiber . interior affairs : günther beckstein bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günther beckstein beckstein , 61 , is bavarian interior minister , but well known throughout germany as he is a frequent guest on national talk shows .

with a long line of dramatic wins and losses , the arch-rivalry between the two neighbors always guarantees a sensational game . german-dutch soccer matches , even if they 're just friendlies , are seldom nice .
with a long line of dramatic wins and losses , the arch-rivalry between the two neighbors always guarantees a sensational game .
the german national soccer team will be braced for a tough show when they face-off against marco van basten 's netherlands wednesday night in rotterdam .
victories against the oranje have been few and far between in the past two decades , with just three in 11 encounters .
the last one was in 1996 at de kuip stadium in rotterdam , when the german team managed to squeeze out a 1-0 win thanks to jürgen klinsmann 's penalty conversion in the 19th minute .
but besides the fact of beating an old foe , klinsmann , the former striker-turned coach , would like for his side to do something a german team has not accomplished since october 2000 - that is to finally beat one of the world 's top teams .
since their 1-0 victory over england five years ago , germany has reeled off a string of 14 losses or draws against quality competition .
a third-place finish at the confederations cup in june may look impressive in the record books , but wins against australia , tunisia or mexico wo n't keep the experts quiet for long .
klinsmann , usually the epitome of sunshine and optimism – a carry-over from his year-round home in california – is not upbeat about wednesday 's match .
" this game has come too early for us , " he said .
" a lot of our players have just got back into training after the confederations cup . "
the return of experience the big stars of the confed cup were youngsters - the 20-year-old striker lukas podolski and the year-older midfielder bastian schweinsteiger - who are being left behind for the rotterdam game . according to the coaching staff , the two are getting well-deserved breaks .
their absence may be the break some of the players from years past have been waiting for .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : didi hamann -lrb- l -rrb- in his last apperance in german national uniform against latvia at euro 2004 for wednesday 's friendly , liverpool midfielder dietmar " didi " hamann , has been called back into the national squad after recovering from a foot injury , and more than a year after a less than stellar performance at the euro 2004 .
" he is the kind of player who despite a few injuries in the past few months has played the style that fits him , " klinsmann told kicker magazine .
" and he had a great deal to do with fc liverpool 's victory in the champions league . "
the 33-year-old defender christian wörns is also ready to play again after injuries sidelined him for months .
it should be a welcome return in the eyes of goalkeeper oliver kahn .
he and his colleagues jens lehmann and timo hildebrand had to fetch the ball from out of the net 11 times in five games at the confed cup .
miroslav klose , already with three goals in the bundesliga , also missed the confed cup .
the starter-status of the six-goal scorer at the world cup 2002 has been threatened by the rise of lukas podolski .
tops in the bundesliga does n't mean tops in holland bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roy makaay : flying high with bayern munich but grounded on dutch national team on the opposite side , the fate of dutch striker roy makaay , who leads the german bundesliga with five strikes in two matches , looks to be the one sitting on the bench .
the traditional dutch 4-3-3 with just one true striker means that , just as in years past , makaay will be watching from the sidelines most of the match .
ruud van nistelrooy has the better cards in the mind of coach van basten .
the statistics speak loads against makaay : only six goals in 42 matches for oranje .
still , german coaches think he should be a starter .
" if van basten wants to make things difficult for -lrb- german -rrb- goalkeeper kahn , then he should start makaay , " bayern coach felix magath commented .
high-risk match in rotterdam regardless of the line-up and the plays on the field , the historic rivalry between germany and the netherlands guarantees a full stadium , with thousands of fans crossing the border into " enemy " territory to cheer on their favorites .
because the animosity runs deep among soccer fans , security officials are taking no chances .
many remember all-to-well the 1996 riot in rotterdam when three people were stabbed and some 70 taken into custody following clashes between german hooligans and dutch police .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans can expect a strong police presence in rotterdam this time around , authorities from both countries are cooperating in patrolling the 572-kilometer border , stopping cars and trains for suspected hooligans .
dutch police have also been given the authority to search visitors in the city 's downtown .
there will be no alcohol consumption in or around the de kuip stadium .
and some 2,000 german fans will be escorted to the ahoy complex in the southern part of the city to pick up their tickets , thereby avoiding the city center and any possible mingling with dutch fans .
such security precautions have grown more and more common in the world of european soccer , where nationalist sentiments combine with sports fever to reach dangerous levels .
the open borders and ease of transportation between rival countries also means that fans can follow their teams almost anywhere .
just this past march , german hooligans brought shame on their country when they clashed with slovenians during an away match . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the specter of hooliganism returns german soccer hooligans have made a violent return to the international stage with just over a year to go before germany hosts the 2006 world cup .

klinsmann , usually the epitome of sunshine and optimism – a carry-over from his year-round home in california – is not upbeat about wednesday 's match .
" this game has come too early for us , " he said .
" a lot of our players have just got back into training after the confederations cup . "
the return of experience the big stars of the confed cup were youngsters - the 20-year-old striker lukas podolski and the year-older midfielder bastian schweinsteiger - who are being left behind for the rotterdam game . according to the coaching staff , the two are getting well-deserved breaks .
their absence may be the break some of the players from years past have been waiting for .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : didi hamann -lrb- l -rrb- in his last apperance in german national uniform against latvia at euro 2004 for wednesday 's friendly , liverpool midfielder dietmar " didi " hamann , has been called back into the national squad after recovering from a foot injury , and more than a year after a less than stellar performance at the euro 2004 .
" he is the kind of player who despite a few injuries in the past few months has played the style that fits him , " klinsmann told kicker magazine .
" and he had a great deal to do with fc liverpool 's victory in the champions league . "
the 33-year-old defender christian wörns is also ready to play again after injuries sidelined him for months .
it should be a welcome return in the eyes of goalkeeper oliver kahn .
he and his colleagues jens lehmann and timo hildebrand had to fetch the ball from out of the net 11 times in five games at the confed cup .
miroslav klose , already with three goals in the bundesliga , also missed the confed cup .
the starter-status of the six-goal scorer at the world cup 2002 has been threatened by the rise of lukas podolski .
tops in the bundesliga does n't mean tops in holland bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roy makaay : flying high with bayern munich but grounded on dutch national team on the opposite side , the fate of dutch striker roy makaay , who leads the german bundesliga with five strikes in two matches , looks to be the one sitting on the bench .
the traditional dutch 4-3-3 with just one true striker means that , just as in years past , makaay will be watching from the sidelines most of the match .
ruud van nistelrooy has the better cards in the mind of coach van basten .
the statistics speak loads against makaay : only six goals in 42 matches for oranje .
still , german coaches think he should be a starter .
" if van basten wants to make things difficult for -lrb- german -rrb- goalkeeper kahn , then he should start makaay , " bayern coach felix magath commented .
high-risk match in rotterdam regardless of the line-up and the plays on the field , the historic rivalry between germany and the netherlands guarantees a full stadium , with thousands of fans crossing the border into " enemy " territory to cheer on their favorites .
because the animosity runs deep among soccer fans , security officials are taking no chances .
many remember all-to-well the 1996 riot in rotterdam when three people were stabbed and some 70 taken into custody following clashes between german hooligans and dutch police .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans can expect a strong police presence in rotterdam this time around , authorities from both countries are cooperating in patrolling the 572-kilometer border , stopping cars and trains for suspected hooligans .
dutch police have also been given the authority to search visitors in the city 's downtown .
there will be no alcohol consumption in or around the de kuip stadium .
and some 2,000 german fans will be escorted to the ahoy complex in the southern part of the city to pick up their tickets , thereby avoiding the city center and any possible mingling with dutch fans .
such security precautions have grown more and more common in the world of european soccer , where nationalist sentiments combine with sports fever to reach dangerous levels .
the open borders and ease of transportation between rival countries also means that fans can follow their teams almost anywhere .

with a long line of dramatic wins and losses , the arch-rivalry between the two neighbors always guarantees a sensational game .
the german national soccer team will be braced for a tough show when they face-off against marco van basten 's netherlands wednesday night in rotterdam .
victories against the oranje have been few and far between in the past two decades , with just three in 11 encounters .
the last one was in 1996 at de kuip stadium in rotterdam , when the german team managed to squeeze out a 1-0 win thanks to jürgen klinsmann 's penalty conversion in the 19th minute .
but besides the fact of beating an old foe , klinsmann , the former striker-turned coach , would like for his side to do something a german team has not accomplished since october 2000 - that is to finally beat one of the world 's top teams .
since their 1-0 victory over england five years ago , germany has reeled off a string of 14 losses or draws against quality competition .

at the youth gathering they have been going on the offensive from day one . the pilgrims arriving in cologne on monday morning were certainly left in no doubt .
world youth day -lrb- wyd -rrb- information points at the railway station and throughout the city center were already waiting on the youth from around the globe to provide guidance - on navigating the city and the events of wyd that is .
the city center appears dotted with stages that host the events of wyd , makeshift tv studios were being set up and posters of the new pope were gracing walls and shop windows .
one day before the official start of world youth day 2005 in cologne things seemed to be running smoothly .
critics on the ground from day one but at the same time criticism was fermenting in the underground - literally .
in the basement of a luxury hotel some 10 minutes walk from the main station , the " world youth day 4 all " -lrb- wyd4all -rrb- coalition was also kicking off with their first press conference on monday morning .
the coalition of grassroots organizations bemoans the lack of room the wyd affords to discuss let alone criticize the church 's stance on controversial issues like contraception or the role of women .
strategic focus on specific issues their monday morning press briefing focused on hiv / aids prevention and the stance of the catholic church on the issue .
by banning the use of condoms " our church leaders are putting the world population at risk , " said molly o 'gorman from the washington-based organization catholics for a free choice which is part of the wyd4all coalition .
despite a host of matters and general themes on which critics disagree with the catholic church , o 'gorman insists that the focus on a specific issue such as this can steer a lot more people into action .
" it also leaves the church leaders with very little wiggle room , " she added .
bildunterschrift : poster for gay and lesbian youths at world youth day more church leaders speaking out according to catholics for a free choice a number of catholic bishops around the world - many from developing nations - have softened their stance on condom use , including the indian catholic bishop 's conference which has agreed to " provide all information about it " to couples seeking advice .
on a number of issues more and more bishops are coming out of the closet against the established views of the senior leadership including the pope .
molly o 'gorman is convinced that in the medium term this could lead to an internal revolution within the church .
and this is backed by pressure from the grassroots : surveys show that catholics around the world are defying the official vatican line in their daily lives .
how to address the crowd but how do the critics carry their message to the believers attending world youth day ?
wyd 2005 resembles the " communist world youth games , " german wyd4all spokesperson tobias raschke told the left-leaning newspaper tageszeitung recently .
and just like in those mass events of the cold war there is no room for the discussion of contentious but highly relevant issues , he said .
only last week german bishops issued a statement that essentially labeled two of germany 's most prominent church critics personae non gratae at the world youth day .
but catholic youth appear to have remained surprisingly quiet in response .
many young people come for the party , admitted raschke .
but then why should they listen to the critics ?
" we know that young people do feel strongly about many of the issues .
all we do is to provide information and the chance to discuss , if they so wish . "
it remains to be seen how much headway the critics can make during world youth day 2005 in the face of seemingly overwhelming enthusiasm for the visit of the new pope .

at the youth gathering they have been going on the offensive from day one . the pilgrims arriving in cologne on monday morning were certainly left in no doubt .
world youth day -lrb- wyd -rrb- information points at the railway station and throughout the city center were already waiting on the youth from around the globe to provide guidance - on navigating the city and the events of wyd that is .
the city center appears dotted with stages that host the events of wyd , makeshift tv studios were being set up and posters of the new pope were gracing walls and shop windows .
one day before the official start of world youth day 2005 in cologne things seemed to be running smoothly .
critics on the ground from day one but at the same time criticism was fermenting in the underground - literally .
in the basement of a luxury hotel some 10 minutes walk from the main station , the " world youth day 4 all " -lrb- wyd4all -rrb- coalition was also kicking off with their first press conference on monday morning .
the coalition of grassroots organizations bemoans the lack of room the wyd affords to discuss let alone criticize the church 's stance on controversial issues like contraception or the role of women .
strategic focus on specific issues their monday morning press briefing focused on hiv / aids prevention and the stance of the catholic church on the issue .
by banning the use of condoms " our church leaders are putting the world population at risk , " said molly o 'gorman from the washington-based organization catholics for a free choice which is part of the wyd4all coalition .
despite a host of matters and general themes on which critics disagree with the catholic church , o 'gorman insists that the focus on a specific issue such as this can steer a lot more people into action .
" it also leaves the church leaders with very little wiggle room , " she added .
bildunterschrift : poster for gay and lesbian youths at world youth day more church leaders speaking out according to catholics for a free choice a number of catholic bishops around the world - many from developing nations - have softened their stance on condom use , including the indian catholic bishop 's conference which has agreed to " provide all information about it " to couples seeking advice .
on a number of issues more and more bishops are coming out of the closet against the established views of the senior leadership including the pope .
molly o 'gorman is convinced that in the medium term this could lead to an internal revolution within the church .
and this is backed by pressure from the grassroots : surveys show that catholics around the world are defying the official vatican line in their daily lives .
how to address the crowd but how do the critics carry their message to the believers attending world youth day ?
wyd 2005 resembles the " communist world youth games , " german wyd4all spokesperson tobias raschke told the left-leaning newspaper tageszeitung recently .
and just like in those mass events of the cold war there is no room for the discussion of contentious but highly relevant issues , he said .
only last week german bishops issued a statement that essentially labeled two of germany 's most prominent church critics personae non gratae at the world youth day .
but catholic youth appear to have remained surprisingly quiet in response .
many young people come for the party , admitted raschke .
but then why should they listen to the critics ?
" we know that young people do feel strongly about many of the issues .
all we do is to provide information and the chance to discuss , if they so wish . "
it remains to be seen how much headway the critics can make during world youth day 2005 in the face of seemingly overwhelming enthusiasm for the visit of the new pope .

and this is backed by pressure from the grassroots : surveys show that catholics around the world are defying the official vatican line in their daily lives .
how to address the crowd but how do the critics carry their message to the believers attending world youth day ?
wyd 2005 resembles the " communist world youth games , " german wyd4all spokesperson tobias raschke told the left-leaning newspaper tageszeitung recently .
and just like in those mass events of the cold war there is no room for the discussion of contentious but highly relevant issues , he said .
only last week german bishops issued a statement that essentially labeled two of germany 's most prominent church critics personae non gratae at the world youth day .
but catholic youth appear to have remained surprisingly quiet in response .
many young people come for the party , admitted raschke .
but then why should they listen to the critics ?
" we know that young people do feel strongly about many of the issues .
all we do is to provide information and the chance to discuss , if they so wish . "
it remains to be seen how much headway the critics can make during world youth day 2005 in the face of seemingly overwhelming enthusiasm for the visit of the new pope .

dw-world reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . the idea -lrb- of distributing condoms -rrb- is crazy .
the thousands of youths who would be attending the world youth day are mostly conservative practicing catholics , and as such , the distribution of condoms at the event would be shocking and offensive to them . - carol it is such a great idea to make use of this event distributing condoms to the youth , considering the fact that it is not all prayers that will happen there .
i just hope they will attach these condoms on flyers with useful information printed on it .
coming from a country such as the philippines , whose population is so high and the rate of hiv-aids is increasing , i definitely agree with this concept ! - sam , philippines police should be distributing the rosary ! - pachla how stupid ! it would be like having a bikini contest during the muslim pilgrimage in mecca or a pig roast at the wailing wall . - p.cassidy how dare they even think of such a thing !
this is a religious gathering of young people who are faithful to the catholic church , if they were n't they would n't bother to travel the distances some are traveling or live under the conditions they will be living under for the days of wyd .
this should not be treated like any other gathering of young people such as a rock concert , etc . - anita wyd is about christ not about sex !
people do not go to wyd to have sex , but if they do that means they did n't get the idea of wyd .
christ never spoke of sex , he spoke of love ... our 21st century seems not see the difference between one and the other ! - bea , toronto , canada we need condoms like we need pornography - both are evils that the church condemns , and rightly so . - grace desouza giving away free condoms would imply that using them is perfectly okay , which it is not . give these young people the respect they deserve - acknowledge that they should and can abstain from immoral behavior . - joan collins distribution of condoms is so contrary to what these young people are about . they are there to grow spiritually , not to be sexually active .
we pray that those who wish to destroy the soul will be converted to know there is much more to life than a sexual appetite . - carol finerty condoms should not be distributed .
i think to do so shows arrogance beyond belief and insensitivity on behalf of those who push such an agenda . - fergal o 'neill did we not learn anything from our beloved holy father john paul ii regarding the culture of life and the theology of the body ?
we are made in the image and likeness of god and need to live for him and live a life of self-sacrifice . - frances huck dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de condom plans cancelled at youth fest as 400,000 catholic young people from around the world prepare to make their way to cologne for world youth day , a spat over condom distribution has erupted .

at the youth gathering they have been going on the offensive from day one .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de election 2005 -pipe- 17.08.2005 merkel 's " dream team " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said the group covers the spectrum of most important issues conservative chancellor candidate angela merkel presented her so-called " competence team " on wednesday .
dw-world has compiled biographical information about the members . merkel 's troupe , which has already been rechristened " incompetence team " by chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats , is not really a shadow cabinet as it 's still unclear whether the team members will eventually fill their respective positions in a conservative-led cabinet . most members have said they are willing to serve as ministers , with thuringia 's premier , dieter althaus , being the one exception .
bavarian premier edmund stoiber , who could lay claim to any ministry , has still not made up his mind about whether he wants to move to berlin .
and the election outcome will also be decisive as merkel 's christian democrats might have to hand ministries to coalition partners - either the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , or the social democrats in a grand coalition . bildunterschrift : the competence team -lrb- from left -rrb- : norbert lammert , günther beckstein , gerda hasselfeldt , wolfgang schäuble , peter müller , ursula von der leyen , anette schavan , paul kirchhof , dieter althaus .
on the right are angela merkel and edmund stoiber the " competence team " is therefore meant to give a face to important policy areas .
dw-world offers some background on its members . agriculture , environment and consumer protection : gerda hasselfeldt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerda hasselfeldt hasselfeldt , 55 , is widely unknown despite serving as her party 's deputy leader in parliament and holding the office of minister for construction and later health under former chancellor helmut kohl from 1989 to 1992 .
she had been accused of a cold leadership style and refusing to listen to ministry officials .
the mother of two children later became her party 's financial affairs spokeswoman in parliament .
a macro-economist , she grew up in a rural part of bavaria .
her father was a farmer , butcher and mayor of a small town in the eastern part of the state . culture : norbert lammert bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : norbert lammert lammert is deputy president of germany 's parliament and has been his party 's culture and media spokesman .
the 57-year-old social scientist is the son of a baker and comes from western germany 's industrial ruhr area .
much of his political career has been focused on education policies , but he also served as junior minister in germany 's ministry of economics from 1994 . eastern german reconstruction : dieter althaus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter althaus althaus might play a decisive role during the election .
the 47-year-old premier of the eastern state of thuringia is meant to become the cdu 's face of eastern germany and is expected to placate voters in the east after bavarian premier edmund stoiber accused them of being " frustrated " and called on voters in the western parts of the country to not let easterners decide the outcome of the election .
initially considered bland , althaus succeeded thuringia 's charismatic former premier , bernhard vogel , in 2003 and has since become a constant guest on german talk shows .
he has called on his party colleagues to show willingness to compromise with the ruling coalition of social democrats and greens and veered from established cdu views on labor policies and subsidies for the eastern states .
a former professor of mathematics and physics , he still avoids open confrontation with party friends and is considered a close merkel ally . economy and labor : peter müller bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter müller müller , 49 , is premier of the southwestern state of saarland and is seen as a generalist .
he is considered to be a definite member of a cabinet under merkel , but not necessarily in the same function as the one he has taken on now .
bavarian premier edmund stoiber might claim the economics and labor ministry after all .
müller has become well known throughout germany as president of his party 's commission on immigration .
a lawyer by trade , he is considered a " liberal " conservative , who does not always follow party lines , as has been the case regarding immigration issues as well as his opposition to the war in iraq . finances : paul kirchhof bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul kirchhof a former constitutional court judge , kirchhof is not a member of the christian democrats and is respected as a tax expert across party lines .
the 62-year-old law professor from heidelberg has introduced a radical tax reform model : he wants to do away with all forms of tax subsidies and lower the highest income tax rate to 25 percent .
kirchhof , who has four children , has also been lobbying for more state help to families with children .
during his last year as constitutional court judge , he lowered the tax burden on families by billions .
observers doubt that he will actually serve in merkel 's cabinet should she become chancellor .
many cdu members consider his ideas too radical .
he also rejects merkel 's plan to raise vat by 2 percent . foreign and security policy : wolfgang schäuble bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang schäuble without a doubt , schäuble is one of the cdu 's most competent politicians and a generalist like müller .
a former party leader , he has concentrated on international politics for years and shaped the cdu 's views in this area .
schäuble recently visited us president george w. bush , as he again pointed out during statements on wednesday .
his relationship with merkel is not the best , however .
last fall , he rejected her offer to become her deputy for financial and economic affairs in parliament .
a former parliamentary leader himself who lost his positions in the wake of a party bribery scandal , schäuble was upset that merkel did not nominate him for the german presidency in 2004 and gave that job to former imf director horst köhler instead .
it 's unlikely that schäuble , who uses a wheel chair after an assassination attempt , will become foreign minister in case of an election victory as that position will be claimed by the cdu 's likely coalition partner , the fdp , or stoiber . interior affairs : günther beckstein bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günther beckstein beckstein , 61 , is bavarian interior minister , but well known throughout germany as he is a frequent guest on national talk shows .
he is often 's interviewed on subjects such as terrorism , illegal immigration and domestic safety .
in office for 11 years , he is an ardent promoter of a " no tolerance " policy and has uncompromising views on immigration .
bavaria is the state that deports immigrants fastest and most frequently .
beckstein is a loyal supporter of bavarian premier edmund stoiber and many see him as a potential successor to his current boss . research and education : annette schavan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : annette schavan schavan , 50 , serves as minister for culture and education in the southwestern state of baden-württemberg .
she was defeated in a race to succeed former premier erwin teufel by current premier , günther oettinger .
a theologian , schavan is considered a smart politician , who likes to remain in the background and does n't search the limelight .
in 1998 , she became well known throughout germany when she refused to grant civil-servant status to a muslim teacher who insisted on wearing a veil in the classroom . social affairs , health , senior citizens : ursula von der leyen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ursula von der leyen the 46-year-old minister for social affairs in the northern state of lower saxony is considered one of her party 's rising stars .
last december she was elected as a vice chairman by 94.1 percent of delegates .
von der leyen worked as a doctor before becoming a minister in 2003 .
she is the daughter of a former premier of lower saxony , ernst albrecht , and has seven children . compiled by steffen leidel -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel unveils her campaign team seeking to stem a decline in the polls , conservative chancellor candidate angela merkel announced her team of advisors during the election campaign wednesday .

with a long line of dramatic wins and losses , the arch-rivalry between the two neighbors always guarantees a sensational game .
the german national soccer team will be braced for a tough show when they face-off against marco van basten 's netherlands wednesday night in rotterdam .
victories against the oranje have been few and far between in the past two decades , with just three in 11 encounters .
the last one was in 1996 at de kuip stadium in rotterdam , when the german team managed to squeeze out a 1-0 win thanks to jürgen klinsmann 's penalty conversion in the 19th minute .
but besides the fact of beating an old foe , klinsmann , the former striker-turned coach , would like for his side to do something a german team has not accomplished since october 2000 - that is to finally beat one of the world 's top teams .
since their 1-0 victory over england five years ago , germany has reeled off a string of 14 losses or draws against quality competition .
a third-place finish at the confederations cup in june may look impressive in the record books , but wins against australia , tunisia or mexico wo n't keep the experts quiet for long .
klinsmann , usually the epitome of sunshine and optimism – a carry-over from his year-round home in california – is not upbeat about wednesday 's match .
" this game has come too early for us , " he said .
" a lot of our players have just got back into training after the confederations cup . "
the return of experience the big stars of the confed cup were youngsters - the 20-year-old striker lukas podolski and the year-older midfielder bastian schweinsteiger - who are being left behind for the rotterdam game . according to the coaching staff , the two are getting well-deserved breaks .
their absence may be the break some of the players from years past have been waiting for .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : didi hamann -lrb- l -rrb- in his last apperance in german national uniform against latvia at euro 2004 for wednesday 's friendly , liverpool midfielder dietmar " didi " hamann , has been called back into the national squad after recovering from a foot injury , and more than a year after a less than stellar performance at the euro 2004 .
" he is the kind of player who despite a few injuries in the past few months has played the style that fits him , " klinsmann told kicker magazine .
" and he had a great deal to do with fc liverpool 's victory in the champions league . "
the 33-year-old defender christian wörns is also ready to play again after injuries sidelined him for months .
it should be a welcome return in the eyes of goalkeeper oliver kahn .
he and his colleagues jens lehmann and timo hildebrand had to fetch the ball from out of the net 11 times in five games at the confed cup .
miroslav klose , already with three goals in the bundesliga , also missed the confed cup .
the starter-status of the six-goal scorer at the world cup 2002 has been threatened by the rise of lukas podolski .

the traditional dutch 4-3-3 with just one true striker means that , just as in years past , makaay will be watching from the sidelines most of the match .
ruud van nistelrooy has the better cards in the mind of coach van basten .
the statistics speak loads against makaay : only six goals in 42 matches for oranje .
still , german coaches think he should be a starter .
" if van basten wants to make things difficult for -lrb- german -rrb- goalkeeper kahn , then he should start makaay , " bayern coach felix magath commented .
high-risk match in rotterdam regardless of the line-up and the plays on the field , the historic rivalry between germany and the netherlands guarantees a full stadium , with thousands of fans crossing the border into " enemy " territory to cheer on their favorites .

with a long line of dramatic wins and losses , the arch-rivalry between the two neighbors always guarantees a sensational game . german-dutch soccer matches , even if they 're just friendlies , are seldom nice .
with a long line of dramatic wins and losses , the arch-rivalry between the two neighbors always guarantees a sensational game .
the german national soccer team will be braced for a tough show when they face-off against marco van basten 's netherlands wednesday night in rotterdam .
victories against the oranje have been few and far between in the past two decades , with just three in 11 encounters .
the last one was in 1996 at de kuip stadium in rotterdam , when the german team managed to squeeze out a 1-0 win thanks to jürgen klinsmann 's penalty conversion in the 19th minute .
but besides the fact of beating an old foe , klinsmann , the former striker-turned coach , would like for his side to do something a german team has not accomplished since october 2000 - that is to finally beat one of the world 's top teams .
since their 1-0 victory over england five years ago , germany has reeled off a string of 14 losses or draws against quality competition .
a third-place finish at the confederations cup in june may look impressive in the record books , but wins against australia , tunisia or mexico wo n't keep the experts quiet for long .
klinsmann , usually the epitome of sunshine and optimism – a carry-over from his year-round home in california – is not upbeat about wednesday 's match .
" this game has come too early for us , " he said .
" a lot of our players have just got back into training after the confederations cup . "
the return of experience the big stars of the confed cup were youngsters - the 20-year-old striker lukas podolski and the year-older midfielder bastian schweinsteiger - who are being left behind for the rotterdam game . according to the coaching staff , the two are getting well-deserved breaks .
their absence may be the break some of the players from years past have been waiting for .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : didi hamann -lrb- l -rrb- in his last apperance in german national uniform against latvia at euro 2004 for wednesday 's friendly , liverpool midfielder dietmar " didi " hamann , has been called back into the national squad after recovering from a foot injury , and more than a year after a less than stellar performance at the euro 2004 .
" he is the kind of player who despite a few injuries in the past few months has played the style that fits him , " klinsmann told kicker magazine .
" and he had a great deal to do with fc liverpool 's victory in the champions league . "
the 33-year-old defender christian wörns is also ready to play again after injuries sidelined him for months .
it should be a welcome return in the eyes of goalkeeper oliver kahn .
he and his colleagues jens lehmann and timo hildebrand had to fetch the ball from out of the net 11 times in five games at the confed cup .
miroslav klose , already with three goals in the bundesliga , also missed the confed cup .
the starter-status of the six-goal scorer at the world cup 2002 has been threatened by the rise of lukas podolski .
tops in the bundesliga does n't mean tops in holland bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roy makaay : flying high with bayern munich but grounded on dutch national team on the opposite side , the fate of dutch striker roy makaay , who leads the german bundesliga with five strikes in two matches , looks to be the one sitting on the bench .
the traditional dutch 4-3-3 with just one true striker means that , just as in years past , makaay will be watching from the sidelines most of the match .
ruud van nistelrooy has the better cards in the mind of coach van basten .
the statistics speak loads against makaay : only six goals in 42 matches for oranje .
still , german coaches think he should be a starter .
" if van basten wants to make things difficult for -lrb- german -rrb- goalkeeper kahn , then he should start makaay , " bayern coach felix magath commented .
high-risk match in rotterdam regardless of the line-up and the plays on the field , the historic rivalry between germany and the netherlands guarantees a full stadium , with thousands of fans crossing the border into " enemy " territory to cheer on their favorites .
because the animosity runs deep among soccer fans , security officials are taking no chances .
many remember all-to-well the 1996 riot in rotterdam when three people were stabbed and some 70 taken into custody following clashes between german hooligans and dutch police .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans can expect a strong police presence in rotterdam this time around , authorities from both countries are cooperating in patrolling the 572-kilometer border , stopping cars and trains for suspected hooligans .
dutch police have also been given the authority to search visitors in the city 's downtown .
there will be no alcohol consumption in or around the de kuip stadium .
and some 2,000 german fans will be escorted to the ahoy complex in the southern part of the city to pick up their tickets , thereby avoiding the city center and any possible mingling with dutch fans .
such security precautions have grown more and more common in the world of european soccer , where nationalist sentiments combine with sports fever to reach dangerous levels .
the open borders and ease of transportation between rival countries also means that fans can follow their teams almost anywhere .
just this past march , german hooligans brought shame on their country when they clashed with slovenians during an away match . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the specter of hooliganism returns german soccer hooligans have made a violent return to the international stage with just over a year to go before germany hosts the 2006 world cup .
officials have faith in security measures but experts predict trouble .
-lrb- april 7 , 2005 -rrb- attacking mentality stays , klinsmann says germany have not had a reputation for playing attacking football over the years but jürgen klinsmann seems intent on winning the 2006 world cup by outscoring opponents .

with a long line of dramatic wins and losses , the arch-rivalry between the two neighbors always guarantees a sensational game .
the german national soccer team will be braced for a tough show when they face-off against marco van basten 's netherlands wednesday night in rotterdam .
victories against the oranje have been few and far between in the past two decades , with just three in 11 encounters .
the last one was in 1996 at de kuip stadium in rotterdam , when the german team managed to squeeze out a 1-0 win thanks to jürgen klinsmann 's penalty conversion in the 19th minute .
but besides the fact of beating an old foe , klinsmann , the former striker-turned coach , would like for his side to do something a german team has not accomplished since october 2000 - that is to finally beat one of the world 's top teams .
since their 1-0 victory over england five years ago , germany has reeled off a string of 14 losses or draws against quality competition .
a third-place finish at the confederations cup in june may look impressive in the record books , but wins against australia , tunisia or mexico wo n't keep the experts quiet for long .
klinsmann , usually the epitome of sunshine and optimism – a carry-over from his year-round home in california – is not upbeat about wednesday 's match .
" this game has come too early for us , " he said .
" a lot of our players have just got back into training after the confederations cup . "
the return of experience the big stars of the confed cup were youngsters - the 20-year-old striker lukas podolski and the year-older midfielder bastian schweinsteiger - who are being left behind for the rotterdam game . according to the coaching staff , the two are getting well-deserved breaks .
their absence may be the break some of the players from years past have been waiting for .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : didi hamann -lrb- l -rrb- in his last apperance in german national uniform against latvia at euro 2004 for wednesday 's friendly , liverpool midfielder dietmar " didi " hamann , has been called back into the national squad after recovering from a foot injury , and more than a year after a less than stellar performance at the euro 2004 .
" he is the kind of player who despite a few injuries in the past few months has played the style that fits him , " klinsmann told kicker magazine .
" and he had a great deal to do with fc liverpool 's victory in the champions league . "
the 33-year-old defender christian wörns is also ready to play again after injuries sidelined him for months .
it should be a welcome return in the eyes of goalkeeper oliver kahn .
he and his colleagues jens lehmann and timo hildebrand had to fetch the ball from out of the net 11 times in five games at the confed cup .
miroslav klose , already with three goals in the bundesliga , also missed the confed cup .
the starter-status of the six-goal scorer at the world cup 2002 has been threatened by the rise of lukas podolski .
tops in the bundesliga does n't mean tops in holland bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roy makaay : flying high with bayern munich but grounded on dutch national team on the opposite side , the fate of dutch striker roy makaay , who leads the german bundesliga with five strikes in two matches , looks to be the one sitting on the bench .
the traditional dutch 4-3-3 with just one true striker means that , just as in years past , makaay will be watching from the sidelines most of the match .
ruud van nistelrooy has the better cards in the mind of coach van basten .
the statistics speak loads against makaay : only six goals in 42 matches for oranje .
still , german coaches think he should be a starter .
" if van basten wants to make things difficult for -lrb- german -rrb- goalkeeper kahn , then he should start makaay , " bayern coach felix magath commented .
high-risk match in rotterdam regardless of the line-up and the plays on the field , the historic rivalry between germany and the netherlands guarantees a full stadium , with thousands of fans crossing the border into " enemy " territory to cheer on their favorites .
because the animosity runs deep among soccer fans , security officials are taking no chances .
many remember all-to-well the 1996 riot in rotterdam when three people were stabbed and some 70 taken into custody following clashes between german hooligans and dutch police .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans can expect a strong police presence in rotterdam this time around , authorities from both countries are cooperating in patrolling the 572-kilometer border , stopping cars and trains for suspected hooligans .
dutch police have also been given the authority to search visitors in the city 's downtown .
there will be no alcohol consumption in or around the de kuip stadium .
and some 2,000 german fans will be escorted to the ahoy complex in the southern part of the city to pick up their tickets , thereby avoiding the city center and any possible mingling with dutch fans .
such security precautions have grown more and more common in the world of european soccer , where nationalist sentiments combine with sports fever to reach dangerous levels .
the open borders and ease of transportation between rival countries also means that fans can follow their teams almost anywhere .

world youth day -lrb- wyd -rrb- information points at the railway station and throughout the city center were already waiting on the youth from around the globe to provide guidance - on navigating the city and the events of wyd that is .
the city center appears dotted with stages that host the events of wyd , makeshift tv studios were being set up and posters of the new pope were gracing walls and shop windows .
one day before the official start of world youth day 2005 in cologne things seemed to be running smoothly .
critics on the ground from day one but at the same time criticism was fermenting in the underground - literally .
in the basement of a luxury hotel some 10 minutes walk from the main station , the " world youth day 4 all " -lrb- wyd4all -rrb- coalition was also kicking off with their first press conference on monday morning .
the coalition of grassroots organizations bemoans the lack of room the wyd affords to discuss let alone criticize the church 's stance on controversial issues like contraception or the role of women .
strategic focus on specific issues their monday morning press briefing focused on hiv / aids prevention and the stance of the catholic church on the issue .
by banning the use of condoms " our church leaders are putting the world population at risk , " said molly o 'gorman from the washington-based organization catholics for a free choice which is part of the wyd4all coalition .
despite a host of matters and general themes on which critics disagree with the catholic church , o 'gorman insists that the focus on a specific issue such as this can steer a lot more people into action .

on a number of issues more and more bishops are coming out of the closet against the established views of the senior leadership including the pope .
molly o 'gorman is convinced that in the medium term this could lead to an internal revolution within the church .
and this is backed by pressure from the grassroots : surveys show that catholics around the world are defying the official vatican line in their daily lives .

and just like in those mass events of the cold war there is no room for the discussion of contentious but highly relevant issues , he said .
only last week german bishops issued a statement that essentially labeled two of germany 's most prominent church critics personae non gratae at the world youth day .
but catholic youth appear to have remained surprisingly quiet in response .
many young people come for the party , admitted raschke .
but then why should they listen to the critics ?
" we know that young people do feel strongly about many of the issues .
all we do is to provide information and the chance to discuss , if they so wish . "
it remains to be seen how much headway the critics can make during world youth day 2005 in the face of seemingly overwhelming enthusiasm for the visit of the new pope .

at the youth gathering they have been going on the offensive from day one . the pilgrims arriving in cologne on monday morning were certainly left in no doubt .
world youth day -lrb- wyd -rrb- information points at the railway station and throughout the city center were already waiting on the youth from around the globe to provide guidance - on navigating the city and the events of wyd that is .
the city center appears dotted with stages that host the events of wyd , makeshift tv studios were being set up and posters of the new pope were gracing walls and shop windows .
one day before the official start of world youth day 2005 in cologne things seemed to be running smoothly .
critics on the ground from day one but at the same time criticism was fermenting in the underground - literally .
in the basement of a luxury hotel some 10 minutes walk from the main station , the " world youth day 4 all " -lrb- wyd4all -rrb- coalition was also kicking off with their first press conference on monday morning .
the coalition of grassroots organizations bemoans the lack of room the wyd affords to discuss let alone criticize the church 's stance on controversial issues like contraception or the role of women .
strategic focus on specific issues their monday morning press briefing focused on hiv / aids prevention and the stance of the catholic church on the issue .
by banning the use of condoms " our church leaders are putting the world population at risk , " said molly o 'gorman from the washington-based organization catholics for a free choice which is part of the wyd4all coalition .
despite a host of matters and general themes on which critics disagree with the catholic church , o 'gorman insists that the focus on a specific issue such as this can steer a lot more people into action .
" it also leaves the church leaders with very little wiggle room , " she added .
bildunterschrift : poster for gay and lesbian youths at world youth day more church leaders speaking out according to catholics for a free choice a number of catholic bishops around the world - many from developing nations - have softened their stance on condom use , including the indian catholic bishop 's conference which has agreed to " provide all information about it " to couples seeking advice .
on a number of issues more and more bishops are coming out of the closet against the established views of the senior leadership including the pope .
molly o 'gorman is convinced that in the medium term this could lead to an internal revolution within the church .
and this is backed by pressure from the grassroots : surveys show that catholics around the world are defying the official vatican line in their daily lives .
how to address the crowd but how do the critics carry their message to the believers attending world youth day ?
wyd 2005 resembles the " communist world youth games , " german wyd4all spokesperson tobias raschke told the left-leaning newspaper tageszeitung recently .
and just like in those mass events of the cold war there is no room for the discussion of contentious but highly relevant issues , he said .
only last week german bishops issued a statement that essentially labeled two of germany 's most prominent church critics personae non gratae at the world youth day .
but catholic youth appear to have remained surprisingly quiet in response .
many young people come for the party , admitted raschke .
but then why should they listen to the critics ?
" we know that young people do feel strongly about many of the issues .
all we do is to provide information and the chance to discuss , if they so wish . "
it remains to be seen how much headway the critics can make during world youth day 2005 in the face of seemingly overwhelming enthusiasm for the visit of the new pope .

with a long line of dramatic wins and losses , the arch-rivalry between the two neighbors always guarantees a sensational game . german-dutch soccer matches , even if they 're just friendlies , are seldom nice .
with a long line of dramatic wins and losses , the arch-rivalry between the two neighbors always guarantees a sensational game .
the german national soccer team will be braced for a tough show when they face-off against marco van basten 's netherlands wednesday night in rotterdam .
victories against the oranje have been few and far between in the past two decades , with just three in 11 encounters .
the last one was in 1996 at de kuip stadium in rotterdam , when the german team managed to squeeze out a 1-0 win thanks to jürgen klinsmann 's penalty conversion in the 19th minute .
but besides the fact of beating an old foe , klinsmann , the former striker-turned coach , would like for his side to do something a german team has not accomplished since october 2000 - that is to finally beat one of the world 's top teams .
since their 1-0 victory over england five years ago , germany has reeled off a string of 14 losses or draws against quality competition .
a third-place finish at the confederations cup in june may look impressive in the record books , but wins against australia , tunisia or mexico wo n't keep the experts quiet for long .
klinsmann , usually the epitome of sunshine and optimism – a carry-over from his year-round home in california – is not upbeat about wednesday 's match .
" this game has come too early for us , " he said .
" a lot of our players have just got back into training after the confederations cup . "
the return of experience the big stars of the confed cup were youngsters - the 20-year-old striker lukas podolski and the year-older midfielder bastian schweinsteiger - who are being left behind for the rotterdam game . according to the coaching staff , the two are getting well-deserved breaks .
their absence may be the break some of the players from years past have been waiting for .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : didi hamann -lrb- l -rrb- in his last apperance in german national uniform against latvia at euro 2004 for wednesday 's friendly , liverpool midfielder dietmar " didi " hamann , has been called back into the national squad after recovering from a foot injury , and more than a year after a less than stellar performance at the euro 2004 .
" he is the kind of player who despite a few injuries in the past few months has played the style that fits him , " klinsmann told kicker magazine .
" and he had a great deal to do with fc liverpool 's victory in the champions league . "
the 33-year-old defender christian wörns is also ready to play again after injuries sidelined him for months .
it should be a welcome return in the eyes of goalkeeper oliver kahn .
he and his colleagues jens lehmann and timo hildebrand had to fetch the ball from out of the net 11 times in five games at the confed cup .
miroslav klose , already with three goals in the bundesliga , also missed the confed cup .
the starter-status of the six-goal scorer at the world cup 2002 has been threatened by the rise of lukas podolski .
tops in the bundesliga does n't mean tops in holland bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roy makaay : flying high with bayern munich but grounded on dutch national team on the opposite side , the fate of dutch striker roy makaay , who leads the german bundesliga with five strikes in two matches , looks to be the one sitting on the bench .
the traditional dutch 4-3-3 with just one true striker means that , just as in years past , makaay will be watching from the sidelines most of the match .
ruud van nistelrooy has the better cards in the mind of coach van basten .
the statistics speak loads against makaay : only six goals in 42 matches for oranje .
still , german coaches think he should be a starter .
" if van basten wants to make things difficult for -lrb- german -rrb- goalkeeper kahn , then he should start makaay , " bayern coach felix magath commented .
high-risk match in rotterdam regardless of the line-up and the plays on the field , the historic rivalry between germany and the netherlands guarantees a full stadium , with thousands of fans crossing the border into " enemy " territory to cheer on their favorites .
because the animosity runs deep among soccer fans , security officials are taking no chances .
many remember all-to-well the 1996 riot in rotterdam when three people were stabbed and some 70 taken into custody following clashes between german hooligans and dutch police .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans can expect a strong police presence in rotterdam this time around , authorities from both countries are cooperating in patrolling the 572-kilometer border , stopping cars and trains for suspected hooligans .
dutch police have also been given the authority to search visitors in the city 's downtown .
there will be no alcohol consumption in or around the de kuip stadium .
and some 2,000 german fans will be escorted to the ahoy complex in the southern part of the city to pick up their tickets , thereby avoiding the city center and any possible mingling with dutch fans .
such security precautions have grown more and more common in the world of european soccer , where nationalist sentiments combine with sports fever to reach dangerous levels .
the open borders and ease of transportation between rival countries also means that fans can follow their teams almost anywhere .
just this past march , german hooligans brought shame on their country when they clashed with slovenians during an away match . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the specter of hooliganism returns german soccer hooligans have made a violent return to the international stage with just over a year to go before germany hosts the 2006 world cup .

with a long line of dramatic wins and losses , the arch-rivalry between the two neighbors always guarantees a sensational game .
the german national soccer team will be braced for a tough show when they face-off against marco van basten 's netherlands wednesday night in rotterdam .
victories against the oranje have been few and far between in the past two decades , with just three in 11 encounters .
the last one was in 1996 at de kuip stadium in rotterdam , when the german team managed to squeeze out a 1-0 win thanks to jürgen klinsmann 's penalty conversion in the 19th minute .
but besides the fact of beating an old foe , klinsmann , the former striker-turned coach , would like for his side to do something a german team has not accomplished since october 2000 - that is to finally beat one of the world 's top teams .
since their 1-0 victory over england five years ago , germany has reeled off a string of 14 losses or draws against quality competition .
a third-place finish at the confederations cup in june may look impressive in the record books , but wins against australia , tunisia or mexico wo n't keep the experts quiet for long .
klinsmann , usually the epitome of sunshine and optimism – a carry-over from his year-round home in california – is not upbeat about wednesday 's match .
" this game has come too early for us , " he said .
" a lot of our players have just got back into training after the confederations cup . "
the return of experience the big stars of the confed cup were youngsters - the 20-year-old striker lukas podolski and the year-older midfielder bastian schweinsteiger - who are being left behind for the rotterdam game . according to the coaching staff , the two are getting well-deserved breaks .
their absence may be the break some of the players from years past have been waiting for .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : didi hamann -lrb- l -rrb- in his last apperance in german national uniform against latvia at euro 2004 for wednesday 's friendly , liverpool midfielder dietmar " didi " hamann , has been called back into the national squad after recovering from a foot injury , and more than a year after a less than stellar performance at the euro 2004 .
" he is the kind of player who despite a few injuries in the past few months has played the style that fits him , " klinsmann told kicker magazine .
" and he had a great deal to do with fc liverpool 's victory in the champions league . "
the 33-year-old defender christian wörns is also ready to play again after injuries sidelined him for months .
it should be a welcome return in the eyes of goalkeeper oliver kahn .
he and his colleagues jens lehmann and timo hildebrand had to fetch the ball from out of the net 11 times in five games at the confed cup .
miroslav klose , already with three goals in the bundesliga , also missed the confed cup .
the starter-status of the six-goal scorer at the world cup 2002 has been threatened by the rise of lukas podolski .
tops in the bundesliga does n't mean tops in holland bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roy makaay : flying high with bayern munich but grounded on dutch national team on the opposite side , the fate of dutch striker roy makaay , who leads the german bundesliga with five strikes in two matches , looks to be the one sitting on the bench .
the traditional dutch 4-3-3 with just one true striker means that , just as in years past , makaay will be watching from the sidelines most of the match .
ruud van nistelrooy has the better cards in the mind of coach van basten .
the statistics speak loads against makaay : only six goals in 42 matches for oranje .
still , german coaches think he should be a starter .
" if van basten wants to make things difficult for -lrb- german -rrb- goalkeeper kahn , then he should start makaay , " bayern coach felix magath commented .
high-risk match in rotterdam regardless of the line-up and the plays on the field , the historic rivalry between germany and the netherlands guarantees a full stadium , with thousands of fans crossing the border into " enemy " territory to cheer on their favorites .
because the animosity runs deep among soccer fans , security officials are taking no chances .
many remember all-to-well the 1996 riot in rotterdam when three people were stabbed and some 70 taken into custody following clashes between german hooligans and dutch police .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans can expect a strong police presence in rotterdam this time around , authorities from both countries are cooperating in patrolling the 572-kilometer border , stopping cars and trains for suspected hooligans .
dutch police have also been given the authority to search visitors in the city 's downtown .
there will be no alcohol consumption in or around the de kuip stadium .
and some 2,000 german fans will be escorted to the ahoy complex in the southern part of the city to pick up their tickets , thereby avoiding the city center and any possible mingling with dutch fans .
such security precautions have grown more and more common in the world of european soccer , where nationalist sentiments combine with sports fever to reach dangerous levels .
the open borders and ease of transportation between rival countries also means that fans can follow their teams almost anywhere .

at the youth gathering they have been going on the offensive from day one . the pilgrims arriving in cologne on monday morning were certainly left in no doubt .
world youth day -lrb- wyd -rrb- information points at the railway station and throughout the city center were already waiting on the youth from around the globe to provide guidance - on navigating the city and the events of wyd that is .
the city center appears dotted with stages that host the events of wyd , makeshift tv studios were being set up and posters of the new pope were gracing walls and shop windows .
one day before the official start of world youth day 2005 in cologne things seemed to be running smoothly .
critics on the ground from day one but at the same time criticism was fermenting in the underground - literally .
in the basement of a luxury hotel some 10 minutes walk from the main station , the " world youth day 4 all " -lrb- wyd4all -rrb- coalition was also kicking off with their first press conference on monday morning .
the coalition of grassroots organizations bemoans the lack of room the wyd affords to discuss let alone criticize the church 's stance on controversial issues like contraception or the role of women .
strategic focus on specific issues their monday morning press briefing focused on hiv / aids prevention and the stance of the catholic church on the issue .
by banning the use of condoms " our church leaders are putting the world population at risk , " said molly o 'gorman from the washington-based organization catholics for a free choice which is part of the wyd4all coalition .
despite a host of matters and general themes on which critics disagree with the catholic church , o 'gorman insists that the focus on a specific issue such as this can steer a lot more people into action .
" it also leaves the church leaders with very little wiggle room , " she added .
bildunterschrift : poster for gay and lesbian youths at world youth day more church leaders speaking out according to catholics for a free choice a number of catholic bishops around the world - many from developing nations - have softened their stance on condom use , including the indian catholic bishop 's conference which has agreed to " provide all information about it " to couples seeking advice .
on a number of issues more and more bishops are coming out of the closet against the established views of the senior leadership including the pope .
molly o 'gorman is convinced that in the medium term this could lead to an internal revolution within the church .
and this is backed by pressure from the grassroots : surveys show that catholics around the world are defying the official vatican line in their daily lives .
how to address the crowd but how do the critics carry their message to the believers attending world youth day ?
wyd 2005 resembles the " communist world youth games , " german wyd4all spokesperson tobias raschke told the left-leaning newspaper tageszeitung recently .
and just like in those mass events of the cold war there is no room for the discussion of contentious but highly relevant issues , he said .
only last week german bishops issued a statement that essentially labeled two of germany 's most prominent church critics personae non gratae at the world youth day .
but catholic youth appear to have remained surprisingly quiet in response .
many young people come for the party , admitted raschke .
but then why should they listen to the critics ?
" we know that young people do feel strongly about many of the issues .
all we do is to provide information and the chance to discuss , if they so wish . "
it remains to be seen how much headway the critics can make during world youth day 2005 in the face of seemingly overwhelming enthusiasm for the visit of the new pope .

one day before the official start of world youth day 2005 in cologne things seemed to be running smoothly .
critics on the ground from day one but at the same time criticism was fermenting in the underground - literally .
in the basement of a luxury hotel some 10 minutes walk from the main station , the " world youth day 4 all " -lrb- wyd4all -rrb- coalition was also kicking off with their first press conference on monday morning .
the coalition of grassroots organizations bemoans the lack of room the wyd affords to discuss let alone criticize the church 's stance on controversial issues like contraception or the role of women .
strategic focus on specific issues their monday morning press briefing focused on hiv / aids prevention and the stance of the catholic church on the issue .
by banning the use of condoms " our church leaders are putting the world population at risk , " said molly o 'gorman from the washington-based organization catholics for a free choice which is part of the wyd4all coalition .
despite a host of matters and general themes on which critics disagree with the catholic church , o 'gorman insists that the focus on a specific issue such as this can steer a lot more people into action .

on a number of issues more and more bishops are coming out of the closet against the established views of the senior leadership including the pope .
molly o 'gorman is convinced that in the medium term this could lead to an internal revolution within the church .

and just like in those mass events of the cold war there is no room for the discussion of contentious but highly relevant issues , he said .
only last week german bishops issued a statement that essentially labeled two of germany 's most prominent church critics personae non gratae at the world youth day .
but catholic youth appear to have remained surprisingly quiet in response .
many young people come for the party , admitted raschke .
but then why should they listen to the critics ?
" we know that young people do feel strongly about many of the issues .
all we do is to provide information and the chance to discuss , if they so wish . "

an independent panel of german scientists has warned that the wholesale use of gene testing to check on the health of job applicants is not advisable .
the government wants an outright ban . germany 's national ethics council , which advises the government on ethical questions of modern medicine , recommended tuesday that forcible gene testing in the workplace for hereditary diseases should be subject to strict restrictions under german law .
it did , however , concede that exceptions could be made if third parties might be at risk - in the case of pilots , for example . an urgent need for legislation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some one hundred thousand gene tests are carried out in germany every year - many of them ordered by employers seeking to check on the long-term health risks of people applying for jobs . germany 's national ethics council believes that legislation protecting workers and employees is urgently needed to avoid misuse of data gathered from these tests . jochen taupitz , a legal advisor on the panel , believes that existing german regulations are lagging far behind the rapid advances in gene technology . " there is no law in germany governing the use of these tests in a detailed manner , " he said .
" all jurisdiction made by german courts so far is rather vague and does not match the technological progress in this field . " restrictions in germany , forcible gene tests made the headlines after a young teacher was refused employment two years ago for failing to undergo a test of her genes .
when school authorities learned that the applicant had a family record of huntington 's disease , a hereditary disease that affects the human nervous system , they wanted to find out whether she could also develop the illness .
a court ruled in the woman 's favor . kristiane weber-hassemer is the head of the german ethics council .
" we have come to agree that restrictions must be imposed here , " she said .
" this is especially needed to protect employees against dismissal for medical reasons .
restrictions must be put on the period of validity of gene diagnoses and predictions about the chances that a disease might occur . " 5-year diagnostic validity the scientists are demanding that the diagnostic validity of a gene test should not go beyond 5 years and that test results must be labeled negative if the possibility of an outbreak of a specific disease is estimated at less than 50 percent . efforts by chancellor schröder 's center-left government to adopt new gene laws have been halted until after early elections in germany in september this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the recommendations made by the ethics council tuesday , however , do n't affect other areas of public life - including possible gene screening by insurance companies .
in this area , german companies have voluntarily imposed a moratorium banning such testing of insurance applicants until 2011 .
but the experts on the ethics council believe that strong regulations will then be needed more urgently than ever . uwe hessler -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de are you -lrb- genetically -rrb- up to the job ?

at the youth gathering they have been going on the offensive from day one . the pilgrims arriving in cologne on monday morning were certainly left in no doubt .
world youth day -lrb- wyd -rrb- information points at the railway station and throughout the city center were already waiting on the youth from around the globe to provide guidance - on navigating the city and the events of wyd that is .
the city center appears dotted with stages that host the events of wyd , makeshift tv studios were being set up and posters of the new pope were gracing walls and shop windows .
one day before the official start of world youth day 2005 in cologne things seemed to be running smoothly .
critics on the ground from day one but at the same time criticism was fermenting in the underground - literally .
in the basement of a luxury hotel some 10 minutes walk from the main station , the " world youth day 4 all " -lrb- wyd4all -rrb- coalition was also kicking off with their first press conference on monday morning .
the coalition of grassroots organizations bemoans the lack of room the wyd affords to discuss let alone criticize the church 's stance on controversial issues like contraception or the role of women .
strategic focus on specific issues their monday morning press briefing focused on hiv / aids prevention and the stance of the catholic church on the issue .
by banning the use of condoms " our church leaders are putting the world population at risk , " said molly o 'gorman from the washington-based organization catholics for a free choice which is part of the wyd4all coalition .
despite a host of matters and general themes on which critics disagree with the catholic church , o 'gorman insists that the focus on a specific issue such as this can steer a lot more people into action .
" it also leaves the church leaders with very little wiggle room , " she added .
bildunterschrift : poster for gay and lesbian youths at world youth day more church leaders speaking out according to catholics for a free choice a number of catholic bishops around the world - many from developing nations - have softened their stance on condom use , including the indian catholic bishop 's conference which has agreed to " provide all information about it " to couples seeking advice .
on a number of issues more and more bishops are coming out of the closet against the established views of the senior leadership including the pope .
molly o 'gorman is convinced that in the medium term this could lead to an internal revolution within the church .
and this is backed by pressure from the grassroots : surveys show that catholics around the world are defying the official vatican line in their daily lives .
how to address the crowd but how do the critics carry their message to the believers attending world youth day ?
wyd 2005 resembles the " communist world youth games , " german wyd4all spokesperson tobias raschke told the left-leaning newspaper tageszeitung recently .
and just like in those mass events of the cold war there is no room for the discussion of contentious but highly relevant issues , he said .
only last week german bishops issued a statement that essentially labeled two of germany 's most prominent church critics personae non gratae at the world youth day .
but catholic youth appear to have remained surprisingly quiet in response .
many young people come for the party , admitted raschke .
but then why should they listen to the critics ?
" we know that young people do feel strongly about many of the issues .
all we do is to provide information and the chance to discuss , if they so wish . "
it remains to be seen how much headway the critics can make during world youth day 2005 in the face of seemingly overwhelming enthusiasm for the visit of the new pope .

and just like in those mass events of the cold war there is no room for the discussion of contentious but highly relevant issues , he said .
only last week german bishops issued a statement that essentially labeled two of germany 's most prominent church critics personae non gratae at the world youth day .
but catholic youth appear to have remained surprisingly quiet in response .
many young people come for the party , admitted raschke .
but then why should they listen to the critics ?
" we know that young people do feel strongly about many of the issues .
all we do is to provide information and the chance to discuss , if they so wish . "
it remains to be seen how much headway the critics can make during world youth day 2005 in the face of seemingly overwhelming enthusiasm for the visit of the new pope .

with a long line of dramatic wins and losses , the arch-rivalry between the two neighbors always guarantees a sensational game .
the german national soccer team will be braced for a tough show when they face-off against marco van basten 's netherlands wednesday night in rotterdam .
victories against the oranje have been few and far between in the past two decades , with just three in 11 encounters .
the last one was in 1996 at de kuip stadium in rotterdam , when the german team managed to squeeze out a 1-0 win thanks to jürgen klinsmann 's penalty conversion in the 19th minute .
but besides the fact of beating an old foe , klinsmann , the former striker-turned coach , would like for his side to do something a german team has not accomplished since october 2000 - that is to finally beat one of the world 's top teams .
since their 1-0 victory over england five years ago , germany has reeled off a string of 14 losses or draws against quality competition .
a third-place finish at the confederations cup in june may look impressive in the record books , but wins against australia , tunisia or mexico wo n't keep the experts quiet for long .
klinsmann , usually the epitome of sunshine and optimism – a carry-over from his year-round home in california – is not upbeat about wednesday 's match .
" this game has come too early for us , " he said .
" a lot of our players have just got back into training after the confederations cup . "
the return of experience the big stars of the confed cup were youngsters - the 20-year-old striker lukas podolski and the year-older midfielder bastian schweinsteiger - who are being left behind for the rotterdam game . according to the coaching staff , the two are getting well-deserved breaks .
their absence may be the break some of the players from years past have been waiting for .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : didi hamann -lrb- l -rrb- in his last apperance in german national uniform against latvia at euro 2004 for wednesday 's friendly , liverpool midfielder dietmar " didi " hamann , has been called back into the national squad after recovering from a foot injury , and more than a year after a less than stellar performance at the euro 2004 .
" he is the kind of player who despite a few injuries in the past few months has played the style that fits him , " klinsmann told kicker magazine .
" and he had a great deal to do with fc liverpool 's victory in the champions league . "
the 33-year-old defender christian wörns is also ready to play again after injuries sidelined him for months .
it should be a welcome return in the eyes of goalkeeper oliver kahn .
he and his colleagues jens lehmann and timo hildebrand had to fetch the ball from out of the net 11 times in five games at the confed cup .
miroslav klose , already with three goals in the bundesliga , also missed the confed cup .
the starter-status of the six-goal scorer at the world cup 2002 has been threatened by the rise of lukas podolski .

the traditional dutch 4-3-3 with just one true striker means that , just as in years past , makaay will be watching from the sidelines most of the match .
ruud van nistelrooy has the better cards in the mind of coach van basten .
the statistics speak loads against makaay : only six goals in 42 matches for oranje .
still , german coaches think he should be a starter .
" if van basten wants to make things difficult for -lrb- german -rrb- goalkeeper kahn , then he should start makaay , " bayern coach felix magath commented .
high-risk match in rotterdam regardless of the line-up and the plays on the field , the historic rivalry between germany and the netherlands guarantees a full stadium , with thousands of fans crossing the border into " enemy " territory to cheer on their favorites .
because the animosity runs deep among soccer fans , security officials are taking no chances .
many remember all-to-well the 1996 riot in rotterdam when three people were stabbed and some 70 taken into custody following clashes between german hooligans and dutch police .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans can expect a strong police presence in rotterdam this time around , authorities from both countries are cooperating in patrolling the 572-kilometer border , stopping cars and trains for suspected hooligans .
dutch police have also been given the authority to search visitors in the city 's downtown .
there will be no alcohol consumption in or around the de kuip stadium .
and some 2,000 german fans will be escorted to the ahoy complex in the southern part of the city to pick up their tickets , thereby avoiding the city center and any possible mingling with dutch fans .
such security precautions have grown more and more common in the world of european soccer , where nationalist sentiments combine with sports fever to reach dangerous levels .
the open borders and ease of transportation between rival countries also means that fans can follow their teams almost anywhere .

the thousands of youths who would be attending the world youth day are mostly conservative practicing catholics , and as such , the distribution of condoms at the event would be shocking and offensive to them . - carol it is such a great idea to make use of this event distributing condoms to the youth , considering the fact that it is not all prayers that will happen there .
i just hope they will attach these condoms on flyers with useful information printed on it .
coming from a country such as the philippines , whose population is so high and the rate of hiv-aids is increasing , i definitely agree with this concept ! - sam , philippines police should be distributing the rosary ! - pachla how stupid ! it would be like having a bikini contest during the muslim pilgrimage in mecca or a pig roast at the wailing wall . - p.cassidy how dare they even think of such a thing !
this is a religious gathering of young people who are faithful to the catholic church , if they were n't they would n't bother to travel the distances some are traveling or live under the conditions they will be living under for the days of wyd .
this should not be treated like any other gathering of young people such as a rock concert , etc . - anita wyd is about christ not about sex !
people do not go to wyd to have sex , but if they do that means they did n't get the idea of wyd .
christ never spoke of sex , he spoke of love ... our 21st century seems not see the difference between one and the other ! - bea , toronto , canada we need condoms like we need pornography - both are evils that the church condemns , and rightly so . - grace desouza giving away free condoms would imply that using them is perfectly okay , which it is not . give these young people the respect they deserve - acknowledge that they should and can abstain from immoral behavior . - joan collins distribution of condoms is so contrary to what these young people are about . they are there to grow spiritually , not to be sexually active .
we pray that those who wish to destroy the soul will be converted to know there is much more to life than a sexual appetite . - carol finerty condoms should not be distributed .
i think to do so shows arrogance beyond belief and insensitivity on behalf of those who push such an agenda . - fergal o 'neill did we not learn anything from our beloved holy father john paul ii regarding the culture of life and the theology of the body ?
we are made in the image and likeness of god and need to live for him and live a life of self-sacrifice . - frances huck dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de condom plans cancelled at youth fest as 400,000 catholic young people from around the world prepare to make their way to cologne for world youth day , a spat over condom distribution has erupted .

" we 're a strong team and we 're ready to show germany that we can do things better , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former constitutional court judge paul kirchhof was named as finance expert onto merkel 's dream team one of the most important positions , that of financial affairs , will be filled by paul kirchhof -lrb- photo -rrb- , a former constitutional court judge and tax expert , who would cover the field of finances .
his background has been criticized by some experts .
" politics should not be about appointing friends but about competence and political experience and -lrb- friedrich -rrb- merz is clearly the one with those attributes , " peter lösche , a political scientist at göttingen university , told reuters .
friedrich merz , probably the cdu 's best financial expert , fell out with merkel during the power struggle for leadership within the christian democrats last year , thus leaving a large hole in that area within the party .
kirchhof , who is an independent , has been a vocal advocate of a simplified tax code .
in fact , merz assumed many of his ideas while he served as deputy party chairman .
while some suggested that merkel would create a " mega ministry " for finances , economics and labor in case she gets elected , the cdu leader said this would not make any sense .
there had been speculation that edmund stoiber would give up his job as bavarian premier to take on such a ministry .
" everyone can see that the minister of finance has his plate full , " merkel told german weekly stern .
" i ca n't really imagine merging finances , economics and labor into one ministry . "
beckstein to cover interior affairs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter müller , currently premier of the small state of saarland the new economics minister then could be peter müller -lrb- photo -rrb- , premier of the small western state of saarland , who will cover that area in merkel 's shadow cabinet .
for interior affairs , bavarian interior minister günther beckstein got the nod .
he would replace current german interior minister otto schily , should the cdu win on sept.18.
wolfgang schäuble , a longtime foreign policy expert , even under former chancellor helmut kohl , will serve as european and foreign affairs advisor .
ursula von der leyen , minister for social affairs in the state of lowe saxony , will take on family and social affairs .
annette schavan , minister for research and education in the state of baden-württemberg , will advise merkel in the same capacity .
gerda hasselfeldt , a former federal minister for construction , will serve as expert for agricultural , environmental and consumer affairs .
norbert lammert , a vice president of germany 's parliament , covers culture in the " competence team . "
apart from dieter althaus , the premier of the eastern state of thuringia , who will advise merkel on eastern german affairs , all members of the team have in principle agreed to serve in a cabinet under merkel should she be elected chancellor , the cdu leader said bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a potential successor for otto schily , günther beckstein bavarian premier edmund stoiber will not serve in any particular capacity .
but stoiber , who irked conservative allies by making disparaging remarks about eastern germans last week , is expected to attend merkel 's press conference announcing her team .
stoiber 's refusal to commit to moving to berlin until after the poll has been a source of great irritation to merkel and the cdu .
because he is head of the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the csu , nobody could hinder him from taking a post in berlin after sept .

dw-world has compiled biographical information about the members . merkel 's troupe , which has already been rechristened " incompetence team " by chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats , is not really a shadow cabinet as it 's still unclear whether the team members will eventually fill their respective positions in a conservative-led cabinet . most members have said they are willing to serve as ministers , with thuringia 's premier , dieter althaus , being the one exception .
bavarian premier edmund stoiber , who could lay claim to any ministry , has still not made up his mind about whether he wants to move to berlin .
and the election outcome will also be decisive as merkel 's christian democrats might have to hand ministries to coalition partners - either the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , or the social democrats in a grand coalition . bildunterschrift : the competence team -lrb- from left -rrb- : norbert lammert , günther beckstein , gerda hasselfeldt , wolfgang schäuble , peter müller , ursula von der leyen , anette schavan , paul kirchhof , dieter althaus .
on the right are angela merkel and edmund stoiber the " competence team " is therefore meant to give a face to important policy areas .
dw-world offers some background on its members . agriculture , environment and consumer protection : gerda hasselfeldt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerda hasselfeldt hasselfeldt , 55 , is widely unknown despite serving as her party 's deputy leader in parliament and holding the office of minister for construction and later health under former chancellor helmut kohl from 1989 to 1992 .
she had been accused of a cold leadership style and refusing to listen to ministry officials .
the mother of two children later became her party 's financial affairs spokeswoman in parliament .
a macro-economist , she grew up in a rural part of bavaria .
her father was a farmer , butcher and mayor of a small town in the eastern part of the state . culture : norbert lammert bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : norbert lammert lammert is deputy president of germany 's parliament and has been his party 's culture and media spokesman .
the 57-year-old social scientist is the son of a baker and comes from western germany 's industrial ruhr area .
much of his political career has been focused on education policies , but he also served as junior minister in germany 's ministry of economics from 1994 . eastern german reconstruction : dieter althaus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter althaus althaus might play a decisive role during the election .
the 47-year-old premier of the eastern state of thuringia is meant to become the cdu 's face of eastern germany and is expected to placate voters in the east after bavarian premier edmund stoiber accused them of being " frustrated " and called on voters in the western parts of the country to not let easterners decide the outcome of the election .
initially considered bland , althaus succeeded thuringia 's charismatic former premier , bernhard vogel , in 2003 and has since become a constant guest on german talk shows .
he has called on his party colleagues to show willingness to compromise with the ruling coalition of social democrats and greens and veered from established cdu views on labor policies and subsidies for the eastern states .
a former professor of mathematics and physics , he still avoids open confrontation with party friends and is considered a close merkel ally . economy and labor : peter müller bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter müller müller , 49 , is premier of the southwestern state of saarland and is seen as a generalist .
he is considered to be a definite member of a cabinet under merkel , but not necessarily in the same function as the one he has taken on now .
bavarian premier edmund stoiber might claim the economics and labor ministry after all .
müller has become well known throughout germany as president of his party 's commission on immigration .
a lawyer by trade , he is considered a " liberal " conservative , who does not always follow party lines , as has been the case regarding immigration issues as well as his opposition to the war in iraq . finances : paul kirchhof bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul kirchhof a former constitutional court judge , kirchhof is not a member of the christian democrats and is respected as a tax expert across party lines .
the 62-year-old law professor from heidelberg has introduced a radical tax reform model : he wants to do away with all forms of tax subsidies and lower the highest income tax rate to 25 percent .
kirchhof , who has four children , has also been lobbying for more state help to families with children .
during his last year as constitutional court judge , he lowered the tax burden on families by billions .
observers doubt that he will actually serve in merkel 's cabinet should she become chancellor .
many cdu members consider his ideas too radical .
he also rejects merkel 's plan to raise vat by 2 percent . foreign and security policy : wolfgang schäuble bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang schäuble without a doubt , schäuble is one of the cdu 's most competent politicians and a generalist like müller .
a former party leader , he has concentrated on international politics for years and shaped the cdu 's views in this area .
schäuble recently visited us president george w. bush , as he again pointed out during statements on wednesday .
his relationship with merkel is not the best , however .
last fall , he rejected her offer to become her deputy for financial and economic affairs in parliament .
a former parliamentary leader himself who lost his positions in the wake of a party bribery scandal , schäuble was upset that merkel did not nominate him for the german presidency in 2004 and gave that job to former imf director horst köhler instead .
it 's unlikely that schäuble , who uses a wheel chair after an assassination attempt , will become foreign minister in case of an election victory as that position will be claimed by the cdu 's likely coalition partner , the fdp , or stoiber . interior affairs : günther beckstein bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günther beckstein beckstein , 61 , is bavarian interior minister , but well known throughout germany as he is a frequent guest on national talk shows .
he is often 's interviewed on subjects such as terrorism , illegal immigration and domestic safety .
in office for 11 years , he is an ardent promoter of a " no tolerance " policy and has uncompromising views on immigration .
bavaria is the state that deports immigrants fastest and most frequently .
beckstein is a loyal supporter of bavarian premier edmund stoiber and many see him as a potential successor to his current boss . research and education : annette schavan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : annette schavan schavan , 50 , serves as minister for culture and education in the southwestern state of baden-württemberg .
she was defeated in a race to succeed former premier erwin teufel by current premier , günther oettinger .
a theologian , schavan is considered a smart politician , who likes to remain in the background and does n't search the limelight .
in 1998 , she became well known throughout germany when she refused to grant civil-servant status to a muslim teacher who insisted on wearing a veil in the classroom . social affairs , health , senior citizens : ursula von der leyen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ursula von der leyen the 46-year-old minister for social affairs in the northern state of lower saxony is considered one of her party 's rising stars .
last december she was elected as a vice chairman by 94.1 percent of delegates .
von der leyen worked as a doctor before becoming a minister in 2003 .

dw-world has compiled biographical information about the members . merkel 's troupe , which has already been rechristened " incompetence team " by chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats , is not really a shadow cabinet as it 's still unclear whether the team members will eventually fill their respective positions in a conservative-led cabinet . most members have said they are willing to serve as ministers , with thuringia 's premier , dieter althaus , being the one exception .
bavarian premier edmund stoiber , who could lay claim to any ministry , has still not made up his mind about whether he wants to move to berlin .
and the election outcome will also be decisive as merkel 's christian democrats might have to hand ministries to coalition partners - either the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , or the social democrats in a grand coalition . bildunterschrift : the competence team -lrb- from left -rrb- : norbert lammert , günther beckstein , gerda hasselfeldt , wolfgang schäuble , peter müller , ursula von der leyen , anette schavan , paul kirchhof , dieter althaus .
on the right are angela merkel and edmund stoiber the " competence team " is therefore meant to give a face to important policy areas .
dw-world offers some background on its members . agriculture , environment and consumer protection : gerda hasselfeldt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerda hasselfeldt hasselfeldt , 55 , is widely unknown despite serving as her party 's deputy leader in parliament and holding the office of minister for construction and later health under former chancellor helmut kohl from 1989 to 1992 .
she had been accused of a cold leadership style and refusing to listen to ministry officials .
the mother of two children later became her party 's financial affairs spokeswoman in parliament .
a macro-economist , she grew up in a rural part of bavaria .
her father was a farmer , butcher and mayor of a small town in the eastern part of the state . culture : norbert lammert bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : norbert lammert lammert is deputy president of germany 's parliament and has been his party 's culture and media spokesman .
the 57-year-old social scientist is the son of a baker and comes from western germany 's industrial ruhr area .
much of his political career has been focused on education policies , but he also served as junior minister in germany 's ministry of economics from 1994 . eastern german reconstruction : dieter althaus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter althaus althaus might play a decisive role during the election .
the 47-year-old premier of the eastern state of thuringia is meant to become the cdu 's face of eastern germany and is expected to placate voters in the east after bavarian premier edmund stoiber accused them of being " frustrated " and called on voters in the western parts of the country to not let easterners decide the outcome of the election .
initially considered bland , althaus succeeded thuringia 's charismatic former premier , bernhard vogel , in 2003 and has since become a constant guest on german talk shows .
he has called on his party colleagues to show willingness to compromise with the ruling coalition of social democrats and greens and veered from established cdu views on labor policies and subsidies for the eastern states .
a former professor of mathematics and physics , he still avoids open confrontation with party friends and is considered a close merkel ally . economy and labor : peter müller bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter müller müller , 49 , is premier of the southwestern state of saarland and is seen as a generalist .
he is considered to be a definite member of a cabinet under merkel , but not necessarily in the same function as the one he has taken on now .
bavarian premier edmund stoiber might claim the economics and labor ministry after all .
müller has become well known throughout germany as president of his party 's commission on immigration .
a lawyer by trade , he is considered a " liberal " conservative , who does not always follow party lines , as has been the case regarding immigration issues as well as his opposition to the war in iraq . finances : paul kirchhof bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul kirchhof a former constitutional court judge , kirchhof is not a member of the christian democrats and is respected as a tax expert across party lines .
the 62-year-old law professor from heidelberg has introduced a radical tax reform model : he wants to do away with all forms of tax subsidies and lower the highest income tax rate to 25 percent .
kirchhof , who has four children , has also been lobbying for more state help to families with children .
during his last year as constitutional court judge , he lowered the tax burden on families by billions .
observers doubt that he will actually serve in merkel 's cabinet should she become chancellor .
many cdu members consider his ideas too radical .
he also rejects merkel 's plan to raise vat by 2 percent . foreign and security policy : wolfgang schäuble bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang schäuble without a doubt , schäuble is one of the cdu 's most competent politicians and a generalist like müller .
a former party leader , he has concentrated on international politics for years and shaped the cdu 's views in this area .
schäuble recently visited us president george w. bush , as he again pointed out during statements on wednesday .
his relationship with merkel is not the best , however .
last fall , he rejected her offer to become her deputy for financial and economic affairs in parliament .
a former parliamentary leader himself who lost his positions in the wake of a party bribery scandal , schäuble was upset that merkel did not nominate him for the german presidency in 2004 and gave that job to former imf director horst köhler instead .
it 's unlikely that schäuble , who uses a wheel chair after an assassination attempt , will become foreign minister in case of an election victory as that position will be claimed by the cdu 's likely coalition partner , the fdp , or stoiber . interior affairs : günther beckstein bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günther beckstein beckstein , 61 , is bavarian interior minister , but well known throughout germany as he is a frequent guest on national talk shows .
he is often 's interviewed on subjects such as terrorism , illegal immigration and domestic safety .
in office for 11 years , he is an ardent promoter of a " no tolerance " policy and has uncompromising views on immigration .
bavaria is the state that deports immigrants fastest and most frequently .
beckstein is a loyal supporter of bavarian premier edmund stoiber and many see him as a potential successor to his current boss . research and education : annette schavan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : annette schavan schavan , 50 , serves as minister for culture and education in the southwestern state of baden-württemberg .
she was defeated in a race to succeed former premier erwin teufel by current premier , günther oettinger .
a theologian , schavan is considered a smart politician , who likes to remain in the background and does n't search the limelight .
in 1998 , she became well known throughout germany when she refused to grant civil-servant status to a muslim teacher who insisted on wearing a veil in the classroom . social affairs , health , senior citizens : ursula von der leyen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ursula von der leyen the 46-year-old minister for social affairs in the northern state of lower saxony is considered one of her party 's rising stars .

dw-world has compiled biographical information about the members . merkel 's troupe , which has already been rechristened " incompetence team " by chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats , is not really a shadow cabinet as it 's still unclear whether the team members will eventually fill their respective positions in a conservative-led cabinet . most members have said they are willing to serve as ministers , with thuringia 's premier , dieter althaus , being the one exception .
bavarian premier edmund stoiber , who could lay claim to any ministry , has still not made up his mind about whether he wants to move to berlin .
and the election outcome will also be decisive as merkel 's christian democrats might have to hand ministries to coalition partners - either the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , or the social democrats in a grand coalition . bildunterschrift : the competence team -lrb- from left -rrb- : norbert lammert , günther beckstein , gerda hasselfeldt , wolfgang schäuble , peter müller , ursula von der leyen , anette schavan , paul kirchhof , dieter althaus .
on the right are angela merkel and edmund stoiber the " competence team " is therefore meant to give a face to important policy areas .
dw-world offers some background on its members . agriculture , environment and consumer protection : gerda hasselfeldt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerda hasselfeldt hasselfeldt , 55 , is widely unknown despite serving as her party 's deputy leader in parliament and holding the office of minister for construction and later health under former chancellor helmut kohl from 1989 to 1992 .
she had been accused of a cold leadership style and refusing to listen to ministry officials .
the mother of two children later became her party 's financial affairs spokeswoman in parliament .
a macro-economist , she grew up in a rural part of bavaria .
her father was a farmer , butcher and mayor of a small town in the eastern part of the state . culture : norbert lammert bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : norbert lammert lammert is deputy president of germany 's parliament and has been his party 's culture and media spokesman .
the 57-year-old social scientist is the son of a baker and comes from western germany 's industrial ruhr area .
much of his political career has been focused on education policies , but he also served as junior minister in germany 's ministry of economics from 1994 . eastern german reconstruction : dieter althaus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter althaus althaus might play a decisive role during the election .
the 47-year-old premier of the eastern state of thuringia is meant to become the cdu 's face of eastern germany and is expected to placate voters in the east after bavarian premier edmund stoiber accused them of being " frustrated " and called on voters in the western parts of the country to not let easterners decide the outcome of the election .
initially considered bland , althaus succeeded thuringia 's charismatic former premier , bernhard vogel , in 2003 and has since become a constant guest on german talk shows .
he has called on his party colleagues to show willingness to compromise with the ruling coalition of social democrats and greens and veered from established cdu views on labor policies and subsidies for the eastern states .
a former professor of mathematics and physics , he still avoids open confrontation with party friends and is considered a close merkel ally . economy and labor : peter müller bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter müller müller , 49 , is premier of the southwestern state of saarland and is seen as a generalist .
he is considered to be a definite member of a cabinet under merkel , but not necessarily in the same function as the one he has taken on now .
bavarian premier edmund stoiber might claim the economics and labor ministry after all .
müller has become well known throughout germany as president of his party 's commission on immigration .
a lawyer by trade , he is considered a " liberal " conservative , who does not always follow party lines , as has been the case regarding immigration issues as well as his opposition to the war in iraq . finances : paul kirchhof bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul kirchhof a former constitutional court judge , kirchhof is not a member of the christian democrats and is respected as a tax expert across party lines .
the 62-year-old law professor from heidelberg has introduced a radical tax reform model : he wants to do away with all forms of tax subsidies and lower the highest income tax rate to 25 percent .
kirchhof , who has four children , has also been lobbying for more state help to families with children .
during his last year as constitutional court judge , he lowered the tax burden on families by billions .
observers doubt that he will actually serve in merkel 's cabinet should she become chancellor .
many cdu members consider his ideas too radical .
he also rejects merkel 's plan to raise vat by 2 percent . foreign and security policy : wolfgang schäuble bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang schäuble without a doubt , schäuble is one of the cdu 's most competent politicians and a generalist like müller .
a former party leader , he has concentrated on international politics for years and shaped the cdu 's views in this area .
schäuble recently visited us president george w. bush , as he again pointed out during statements on wednesday .
his relationship with merkel is not the best , however .
last fall , he rejected her offer to become her deputy for financial and economic affairs in parliament .
a former parliamentary leader himself who lost his positions in the wake of a party bribery scandal , schäuble was upset that merkel did not nominate him for the german presidency in 2004 and gave that job to former imf director horst köhler instead .
it 's unlikely that schäuble , who uses a wheel chair after an assassination attempt , will become foreign minister in case of an election victory as that position will be claimed by the cdu 's likely coalition partner , the fdp , or stoiber . interior affairs : günther beckstein bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günther beckstein beckstein , 61 , is bavarian interior minister , but well known throughout germany as he is a frequent guest on national talk shows .
he is often 's interviewed on subjects such as terrorism , illegal immigration and domestic safety .
in office for 11 years , he is an ardent promoter of a " no tolerance " policy and has uncompromising views on immigration .
bavaria is the state that deports immigrants fastest and most frequently .
beckstein is a loyal supporter of bavarian premier edmund stoiber and many see him as a potential successor to his current boss . research and education : annette schavan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : annette schavan schavan , 50 , serves as minister for culture and education in the southwestern state of baden-württemberg .
she was defeated in a race to succeed former premier erwin teufel by current premier , günther oettinger .
a theologian , schavan is considered a smart politician , who likes to remain in the background and does n't search the limelight .
in 1998 , she became well known throughout germany when she refused to grant civil-servant status to a muslim teacher who insisted on wearing a veil in the classroom . social affairs , health , senior citizens : ursula von der leyen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ursula von der leyen the 46-year-old minister for social affairs in the northern state of lower saxony is considered one of her party 's rising stars .
last december she was elected as a vice chairman by 94.1 percent of delegates .
von der leyen worked as a doctor before becoming a minister in 2003 .
she is the daughter of a former premier of lower saxony , ernst albrecht , and has seven children . compiled by steffen leidel -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel unveils her campaign team seeking to stem a decline in the polls , conservative chancellor candidate angela merkel announced her team of advisors during the election campaign wednesday .

the commission , the civil service arm of the european union , has been unhappy with the way premier league football matches in the uk have been sold .
at the moment satellite broadcaster sky has what is in effect an exclusive deal with the premier league to show live matches .
the league has made some proposals , but they have not been seen as satisfactory luc de hert , european commission sky will show 138 live televised matches from the premier league this season , via sky sports and sky premplus , but the commission wants the market opened to competitors when current deals expire in 2007 .
" we have been in touch with the premier league over the arrangements for media rights from the 2007 season onwards , " ec competition spokesman luc de hert told the bbc .
" the league has made some proposals , but they have not been seen as satisfactory .
" we are waiting for new proposals from them , and expect them to send us something soon . "
' possible penalties ' competition commissioner neelie kroes has written to the premier league , rejecting its latest offers .
premier league v european commission 2001 - ec probe into sale of premier league media rights 2002 - eu charges league with breaking competition law august 2003 - sky wins four tiered live rights packages august 2003 - ec unhappy and says league has ' serious questions ' to answer 2005 - ec expresses its concerns about distribution of rights in 2007 the commission has not yet taken formal action over any possible breaking of competition law .
however , it could set out a formal " statement of objections " pointing out how it feels the current proposals breach competition law .
a statement of objections can lead to financial penalties of up to one-tenth of a company 's annual turnover worldwide .
" they have the power to do that - but we have not had any indication they are preparing such a move , " a premier league spokesman told the bbc .
" we are still two years from the next deal , and the structure of the packages is still being discussed .
" as we have previously said ; in future no one broadcaster will be able to hold the rights exclusively .
" how we achieve that is what we are discussing with brussels just now . "
future packaging however the commission is looking for more concessions , with some reports claiming it wants to limit any company 's ownership to 50 % of live games in future .
that , however , may dilute the potential top price a tv company would be prepared to pay , if they are unable to win exclusivity .
sky will show 138 barclays premiership games this season harry philp , analyst at hermes sports partners said : " the european commission want to see changes in 2007 .
" it remains to be seen how the league will package the games .
we may well get a number of parties expressing a strong interest in 2007 , or coming together in partnerships . "
he said companies , as well as sky , that may be looking for a televised package - be they live games , delayed-broadcast matches or match highlights - could include setanta , ntl , telewest , the bbc and itv .
" private equity companies are also looking closely at the situation and may compete , " says mr philp .
" however , even if you split the games up into separate packages , and you attract lots of bidders , you ca n't stop one party winning all the packages . "
what happened in france is a good thing from the premier league and sky 's perspective , as it was allowed to go through on the same basis as the current english deal harry philp , hermes sports this happened in august 2003 , when the premier league awarded all four of its rights packages to sky in a deal worth £ 1.024bn.
the commission claimed the deal was anti-competitive ; but the league argued sky had won all the packages on an individual basis .
" we actually structured those packages at the eu 's behest and it was only afterwards they were unhappy with the outcome , " says the premier league spokesman .
the commission is thought to be unhappy that a compromise to sub-license six to eight live games a season from sky to other broadcasters fell through .
the prices offered fell short of the reserve price agreed with the commission , sky said in april 2004 .
french deal yet , one factor which may help the premier league is the fact that in france last december broadcaster canal + was successful in winning all the packages on offer to show live games , thus giving it ' exclusivity ' too .
canal + has an exclusive deal covering french top football it paid 1.8bn euros to buy the exclusive rights to broadcast french league matches for the next three years .
" what happened in france is a good thing from the premier league and sky 's perspective , as it went through on the same basis as the current english deal , " says mr philp .
however , it appears that after years of skirmishing the commission is determined to force a rethink to the way premier league tv deals are drawn up .
" we ca n't go into the details of what changes we want to see come about , but there have to be changes , " insists mr de hert .

"
the boxer - called charlie by rescuers - was believed to have been locked up and abandoned before he was handed in at rhyl police station in june .
dafydd and gaynor williams , from rhuddlan , were chosen from dozens of people who asked to adopt the dog .
mr and mrs williams said charlie was now a " different dog . "
charlie was taken to the north clwyd animal rescue centre in june after being found emaciated , covered in mange and with claws so long they had grown into his skin .
rspca inspector fred armstrong said the 12-month-old animal was in a " scared and pitiful state " when he first saw him .
" i was really quite shocked to see him .
he was in an appalling state , " said mr armstrong .
but since being re-homed , charlie has made a full recovery .
gaynor williams said : " he 's put on weight , his skin is becoming more soft and shiny and he 's really lively .
" he 's a real character .
everybody seems to know about him and they all want to know how he 's getting on . "
mrs williams said she and her husband were " absolutely mortified " when they first saw pictures of charlie .
' absolute darling ' she added : " i was crying my eyes out .
but we were determined to help him and we began visiting him every week and taking treats for him .
" gradually we got to know him and we were absolutely delighted when we were told we could take him home .
" my husband slept on the settee with him on the first night , but since then he 's slept in our bedroom and he 's not a bit of trouble .
he 's an absolute darling . "
mr and mrs williams ' take charlie back to the rescue centre at trelogan , near prestatyn , every weekend so he can be weighed .
charlie has also won first prize in the " rescued " class at the centre 's dog show and received a rosette .
ann owen , who runs the centre , said : " it 's lovely to see him looking so well after all he 's been through .
" the williams have done such a lot to help with his recovery and they really deserve to have him . "

prime minister john howard had said in november the government was planning to sell its 51.8 % stake in the state communications giant , worth a $ 30bn .
legislation to approve the sale will be introduced to parliament in two weeks .
an a $ 2bn rural telecoms fund will now be created , and a $ 1.1bn spent on a roll out of broadband around the country .
however , mr howard - serving his fourth term as prime minister - may face heavy challenges to the sale from opposition political parties , while a recent opinion poll showed there may also be strong public opposition .
there are fears that privatising telstra will cause service in rural areas , where there is less competition , to suffer .
' not in national interest ' however , if all lawmakers in the ruling coalition back the legislation it will become law because mr howard has majorities in both houses of parliament .
" the decision that we 've taken today will , i believe , reflect a fundamental reality and that is , that it is quite counter-productive and not in the national interest for the australian government to own more than half of the largest company in australia , " mr howard said .
mr howard added that the government 's six billion shares were expected to be sold next year , but an exact date has not been set of the sell off .
since the government last sold shares in telstra in 1999 , the stock has fallen in value from a $ 7.40 to a $ 4.85 on wednesday .
earlier this year american sol trujillo took over as the company 's chief executive , replacing ziggy switkowski .

prime minister john howard had said in november the government was planning to sell its 51.8 % stake in the state communications giant , worth a $ 30bn .
legislation to approve the sale will be introduced to parliament in two weeks .
an a $ 2bn rural telecoms fund will now be created , and a $ 1.1bn spent on a roll out of broadband around the country .
however , mr howard - serving his fourth term as prime minister - may face heavy challenges to the sale from opposition political parties , while a recent opinion poll showed there may also be strong public opposition .
there are fears that privatising telstra will cause service in rural areas , where there is less competition , to suffer .
' not in national interest ' however , if all lawmakers in the ruling coalition back the legislation it will become law because mr howard has majorities in both houses of parliament .
" the decision that we 've taken today will , i believe , reflect a fundamental reality and that is , that it is quite counter-productive and not in the national interest for the australian government to own more than half of the largest company in australia , " mr howard said .
mr howard added that the government 's six billion shares were expected to be sold next year , but an exact date has not been set of the sell off .
since the government last sold shares in telstra in 1999 , the stock has fallen in value from a $ 7.40 to a $ 4.85 on wednesday .
earlier this year american sol trujillo took over as the company 's chief executive , replacing ziggy switkowski .

but they are just a few of the big-name stars that director christopher monger worked with to create his latest film called special thanks to roy london .
the documentary is a feature-length tribute to acting coach roy london .
monger , from taff 's well , south wales , is currently showing the film at festivals and looking for distributors .
the director , whose previous credits include the englishman who went up a hill but came down a mountain , said it was a project that had been in his head since roy london died in 1993 .
roy london was featured in life magazine as a five-year-old " my wife -lrb- producer karen montgomery -rrb- knew roy very , very well , " he said .
" there were several times we said we should do something , and we decided to put some people on tape - the first person to agree was sharon stone - she did a five-hour interview and the floodgates opened . "
hank azaria , sherilyn fenn , drew carey , famke janssen and garry shandling were among the other actors who contributed during a year of filming .
" sharon stone said on many occasions that , before roy , she was stuck in b-movies - roy helped her make the transformation , " said monger .
" a lot of people who worked with him had careers as jobbing actors , but were not getting the big roles . "
we are hoping for a limited theatrical release in the us , but i think our big market will be dvd christopher monger as well as the talking heads , there is also some footage from london himself , although he was not the easiest man to capture on camera .
monger added : " he would never allow classes to be filmed - he wanted to be in the background .
there were just two interviews we had access to . "
london , whose first brush with fame was a child maths prodigy who appeared in life magazine aged just five , emerged as an acting coach in los angeles in the 1980s .
the title of the film came from awards acceptance speeches made by stars including brad pitt , geena davis and sharon stone who paid tribute to him while picking up their accolades .
monger said that , although he was not sure of securing a theatrical release for the movie in the uk , it had a lot to offer actors , writers and artists .
christopher monger and karen montgomery have showed the film in new york he said : " roy london 's work was very simple - he was very results-orientated . "
earlier this year , the film was well-received during its showing at new york 's tribeca film festival , which was founded by robert de niro .
" now we are looking for distribution and fielding our first sales offers , " said monger .
" we are hoping for a limited theatrical release in the us , but i think our big market will be dvd . "
monger said that uk-based film festivals were also interested in the movie .
" i have heard noises that cardiff would like it , and have also applied for london , " he said .
as a welshman living in los angeles , monger said he tried to keep in touch with his south wales roots .
" i try to get over once a year , twice if i can .
my mother still lives in the same house there , " he said .

tesco had objected to the advertising standards authority -lrb- asa -rrb- about the claim , made in a number of asda press adverts and a tv commercial .
after an investigation , the asa upheld tesco 's complaints and told asda not to repeat its low price assertion .
leeds-based asda made the claim following a price survey by the grocer .
the supermarket industry magazine 's grocer 33 survey compared the price of 33 products across eight retailers on a weekly basis for a year .
in june 2004 the grocer named asda winner of its annual " cheapest basket " award for the seventh year in succession , after which asda began the advertisements in question .
' insufficient survey ' tesco complained to the asa because it said the grocer survey was limited and unrepresentative , as it did not look at enough product lines .

the asa found for tesco , further adding that the grocer survey did not include low-cost supermarkets .
' robust ' asda - the uk 's second largest supermarket group with headquarters in leeds - has since won the grocer 33 survey this year .
it said its current advertising would be unaffected by the industry watchdog 's decision .
asda marketing director chris pilling added that tesco 's complaint was a " complete waste of time " .
" we promise we 'll never again claim to be the cheapest supermarket for seven years in a row , that 's because we 've now won the grocer title for eight years on the trot , " said mr pilling .

edinburgh university researchers used ethnicity data from the 2001 population census to find out more about the links between ethnicity and certain diseases .
they found that 30 % of south asians die after their first heart attack compared to 50 % of the general population .
the latest census was compared to data held on hospital admission forms .
professor of public health at edinburgh university , raj bhopal , led the research .
we need a great deal of awareness and a great deal of attention to reducing cardio-vascular risk factors prof raj bhopal edinburgh university he said the findings backed observations from round the world , particularly in england and wales .
he told bbc radio 's good morning scotland programme : " for the first time we 've been able to look at incidence rates , the rate of new cases , of heart disease .
" we found that in new cases the incidence is very much higher .
" that shows that it is not the case of people who are developing heart disease dying more , rather the opposite , south asians in scotland seem to survive better once they get their heart attack but they get more heart attacks . "
prof bhopal said a major change in lifestyle was a key factor in the findings , including poor diet , higher fat intake , weight gain , lack of exercise and a very high prevalence of diabetes .
lifestyle choices he said all the possible causes were the subject of intense study , but as yet there was no definitive answer as to why the heart disease rates were so high .
south asians living in traditional societies , particularly in villages and small towns , were found to have a relatively low rate of heart disease and diabetes .
but prof bhopal said once people urbanised and developed " westernised lifestyles " , obesity and heart disease became increasingly common .
he added : " scotland is one of the world 's capitals for heart disease anyway and here we have a sub-section of the population with rates that are even higher .
" so we need a great deal of awareness and a great deal of attention to reducing cardiovascular risk factors .
" people should be avoiding weight gain , they should be taking exercise , if they are smoking they should give up , particularly attention to the content of the diet with high intake of fruits and vegetables and low intake of fatty foods . "

edinburgh university researchers used ethnicity data from the 2001 population census to find out more about the links between ethnicity and certain diseases .
they found that 30 % of south asians die after their first heart attack compared to 50 % of the general population .
the latest census was compared to data held on hospital admission forms .
professor of public health at edinburgh university , raj bhopal , led the research .
we need a great deal of awareness and a great deal of attention to reducing cardio-vascular risk factors prof raj bhopal edinburgh university he said the findings backed observations from round the world , particularly in england and wales .
he told bbc radio 's good morning scotland programme : " for the first time we 've been able to look at incidence rates , the rate of new cases , of heart disease .
" we found that in new cases the incidence is very much higher .
" that shows that it is not the case of people who are developing heart disease dying more , rather the opposite , south asians in scotland seem to survive better once they get their heart attack but they get more heart attacks . "
prof bhopal said a major change in lifestyle was a key factor in the findings , including poor diet , higher fat intake , weight gain , lack of exercise and a very high prevalence of diabetes .
lifestyle choices he said all the possible causes were the subject of intense study , but as yet there was no definitive answer as to why the heart disease rates were so high .
south asians living in traditional societies , particularly in villages and small towns , were found to have a relatively low rate of heart disease and diabetes .
but prof bhopal said once people urbanised and developed " westernised lifestyles " , obesity and heart disease became increasingly common .
he added : " scotland is one of the world 's capitals for heart disease anyway and here we have a sub-section of the population with rates that are even higher .
" so we need a great deal of awareness and a great deal of attention to reducing cardiovascular risk factors .
" people should be avoiding weight gain , they should be taking exercise , if they are smoking they should give up , particularly attention to the content of the diet with high intake of fruits and vegetables and low intake of fatty foods . "
