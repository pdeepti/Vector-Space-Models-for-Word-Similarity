thus , it 's unlikely gerhard schröder will waste much time consoling his close friend jacques chirac for the failed referendum in france . the german chancellor is in a defiant mood now that dutch and french voters have rejected the new eu charter and plunged the european union into severe crisis .
one day ahead of his meeting with jacques chirac in berlin , schröder vowed to press ahead towards the goal of a fully-fledged constitution . " i will not accept attempts to stop the entire project simply because two countries rejected it , " he said .

opinion polls show he will lose to the conservative opposition christian democrats of angela merkel -lrb- photo -rrb- . chirac meanwhile suffered the humiliation of seeing his people ignore his appeals for them to ratify the constitution and spent the week looking , to many analysts , like a lame duck president . the " no " vote forced him into a government reshuffle , promoting former health minister philippe douste-blazy to foreign minister . douste-blazy was candid about the future , saying : " we are obviously in a difficult situation after two negative referendums . " chirac 's spokesman meanwhile said he would use the brussels summit to assure his eu colleagues of france 's commitment to the bloc and its " anchoring within the union " in the coming weeks . schröder 's new flexibility in an attempt to pour oil into troubled waters , gerhard schröder has already signaled flexibility in an ongoing row over eu financing which has pitted net contributors to the budget against recipients .
although no details were given by the chancellor , a deal could include a rise in german eu contributions beyond the current 1 percent of gross national product . schröder ’ s new flexibility could perhaps include concessions towards britain which enjoys a rebate from eu coffers that most members want scrapped .
it wouldn ’ t be the first time that germany has sought to buy europe out of its troubles and it ’ s a prospect that could even keep prime minister tony blair from canceling the british referendum and declaring the constitution dead once and for all . blair will meet schröder in berlin on june 13 . uwe hessler -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder 's shuttle diplomacy to save eu germany forced the pace friday as european leaders scrambled to resolve the deep political crisis over the eu constitution , with chancellor gerhard schröder scheduling a series of meetings with eu leaders .
-lrb- june 3 , 2005 -rrb- europe 's motor plans emergency summit germany and france , for so long the driving force behind european integration , will hold an emergency summit this weekend to discuss the crisis unfolding after the french and dutch rejection of the eu constitution .
-lrb- june 2 , 2005 -rrb- eu in agony after constitution fiasco europe agonized over the eu constitution 's future thursday after dutch voters rejected it wednesday .
while some fear that the " no " could all but bury the treaty , most eu leaders said its ratification should continue .

but the show goes much further than that . along berlin ’ s boulevard unter den linden , a series of bright red letters " e " have been installed .
they represent " einstein , " " energy " or " e = mc ² " in places associated with the scientist 's life in the german capital .
these red letters are intended to draw attention to one of the highlights of germany 's current einstein year : the exhibition " chief engineer of the universe . "
it introduces visitors to various competing views in understanding our world .
for the max planck institute for the history of science , which organized the show , albert einstein 's key role in shaping the world view on fundamental questions of the nature of space , gravitation and the invisible forces of magnetism , radiation and electricity makes him the " chief engineer of the universe . "
the feel of a modern laboratory the institute 's professor jürgen renn does not intend to relate a hero 's tale , though .
he says the exhibition " is more an exercise in presenting the adventure of scientific research and its history in an attractive and understandable style . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the exhibit wants to create a certain atmosphere " sure , that 's a challenge , " said renn .
" we 've tried to create an atmosphere , which can also be grasped aesthetically . "
he said the organizers had created something like a giant modern laboratory .
" entering that , the visitor feels the bustle , but also the inquisitiveness that drives these scientists , " said renn .
" these are emotional qualities , which we have tried to put into practice . "
more than just einstein 's face the exhibition is a giant laboratory on three floors .
historic experiments have been set up with original tools .
curious views into the sub-atomic world are made accessible in dark studios .
einstein himself explains scientific advances in original film footage .
for the show , the institute collected more than 1,000 exhibits from around the world .
contemporary documents are on display , some of which have never been published before .
at one point in the exhibition , the audience is suddenly blinded by bright light and left alone in a white room .
exhibition organizer stefan iglhaut explained that this is about looking at the world in a different way .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is probably the most famous photograph of einstein " i think this is an unusual way to make einstein understandable and interesting , " said iglhaut .
" we 're not only explaining his theories , but also finding metaphors and pictures which impress our audience .
we want them to take home more than just einstein 's face . "
everybody knows his face : the weird old guy with the gray mop of hair sticking his tongue out at the world .
but the exhibition communicates the historical context of einstein 's influence and the special challenges which arose for him as a human being and as a scientist .
a desk with a history einstein 's life is illuminated against the background of the political and social upheavals of his time .
visitors follow him from his childhood in the middle-class world of the family electrical business , through his time in switzerland , to the tense world of the jewry caught between anti-semitism and new zionist beginnings .
in 1933 , einstein 's books were burnt by germans just outside the museum .
in the same year , einstein emigrated to the united states , where he experienced " a tense atmosphere of fortified democracy and political mistrust , " said renn .
renn 's favorite exhibit is einstein 's desk .
" he had to leave it behind in berlin when the nazis forced him to emigrate , " he said .
" the french ambassador helped him to have it transferred to his office in princeton .
since then , this is the first time this very moving piece of furniture with its dramatic history has made it back to germany . "
it 's rather unspectacular : a simple , fairly small wooden desk .
but here einstein worked to change the world .
in 1905 , his " special theory of relativity " revolutionized our understanding of space and time , while e = mc ² became the most famous equation in physics .
einstein succeeded in moving young and old einstein once said it was important to never stop asking .
" one can not help but marvel reverently at the secrets of eternity , life and the wonderful structure of reality , " the famous scientist said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors can also see einstein 's impact on the world today throughout the exhibition , more than 50 multimedia stations encourage visitors to ask their own questions .

einstein , his colleagues and this exhibition have succeeded in moving young and old .
the success of this exhibition is that it maintains a balance between historical reflection on successive changes in world views , information on the life and work of albert einstein - the " chief engineer of the universe " - and how these themes relate to challenges that we face today . peter zimmermann -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de following in einstein 's footsteps as part of the " einstein year " , which the 50th anniversary of the death of the physicist and the 100th jubilee of the relativity theory , enthusiasts can trace the path of the genius across germany .

but the show goes much further than that . along berlin ’ s boulevard unter den linden , a series of bright red letters " e " have been installed .
they represent " einstein , " " energy " or " e = mc ² " in places associated with the scientist 's life in the german capital .
these red letters are intended to draw attention to one of the highlights of germany 's current einstein year : the exhibition " chief engineer of the universe . "
it introduces visitors to various competing views in understanding our world .
for the max planck institute for the history of science , which organized the show , albert einstein 's key role in shaping the world view on fundamental questions of the nature of space , gravitation and the invisible forces of magnetism , radiation and electricity makes him the " chief engineer of the universe . "
the feel of a modern laboratory the institute 's professor jürgen renn does not intend to relate a hero 's tale , though .
he says the exhibition " is more an exercise in presenting the adventure of scientific research and its history in an attractive and understandable style . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the exhibit wants to create a certain atmosphere " sure , that 's a challenge , " said renn .
" we 've tried to create an atmosphere , which can also be grasped aesthetically . "
he said the organizers had created something like a giant modern laboratory .
" entering that , the visitor feels the bustle , but also the inquisitiveness that drives these scientists , " said renn .
" these are emotional qualities , which we have tried to put into practice . "
more than just einstein 's face the exhibition is a giant laboratory on three floors .
historic experiments have been set up with original tools .
curious views into the sub-atomic world are made accessible in dark studios .
einstein himself explains scientific advances in original film footage .
for the show , the institute collected more than 1,000 exhibits from around the world .
contemporary documents are on display , some of which have never been published before .
at one point in the exhibition , the audience is suddenly blinded by bright light and left alone in a white room .
exhibition organizer stefan iglhaut explained that this is about looking at the world in a different way .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is probably the most famous photograph of einstein " i think this is an unusual way to make einstein understandable and interesting , " said iglhaut .
" we 're not only explaining his theories , but also finding metaphors and pictures which impress our audience .
we want them to take home more than just einstein 's face . "
everybody knows his face : the weird old guy with the gray mop of hair sticking his tongue out at the world .
but the exhibition communicates the historical context of einstein 's influence and the special challenges which arose for him as a human being and as a scientist .
a desk with a history einstein 's life is illuminated against the background of the political and social upheavals of his time .
visitors follow him from his childhood in the middle-class world of the family electrical business , through his time in switzerland , to the tense world of the jewry caught between anti-semitism and new zionist beginnings .
in 1933 , einstein 's books were burnt by germans just outside the museum .
in the same year , einstein emigrated to the united states , where he experienced " a tense atmosphere of fortified democracy and political mistrust , " said renn .
renn 's favorite exhibit is einstein 's desk .
" he had to leave it behind in berlin when the nazis forced him to emigrate , " he said .
" the french ambassador helped him to have it transferred to his office in princeton .
since then , this is the first time this very moving piece of furniture with its dramatic history has made it back to germany . "
it 's rather unspectacular : a simple , fairly small wooden desk .
but here einstein worked to change the world .
in 1905 , his " special theory of relativity " revolutionized our understanding of space and time , while e = mc ² became the most famous equation in physics .
einstein succeeded in moving young and old einstein once said it was important to never stop asking .
" one can not help but marvel reverently at the secrets of eternity , life and the wonderful structure of reality , " the famous scientist said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors can also see einstein 's impact on the world today throughout the exhibition , more than 50 multimedia stations encourage visitors to ask their own questions .
it concludes with einstein 's impact on today 's science and culture .
twenty-four seats are arranged along a white conference table .
one after another , today 's leading scientists give their views on the " secrets of eternity , life and the wonderful structure of reality . "
einstein , his colleagues and this exhibition have succeeded in moving young and old .
the success of this exhibition is that it maintains a balance between historical reflection on successive changes in world views , information on the life and work of albert einstein - the " chief engineer of the universe " - and how these themes relate to challenges that we face today . peter zimmermann -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de following in einstein 's footsteps as part of the " einstein year " , which the 50th anniversary of the death of the physicist and the 100th jubilee of the relativity theory , enthusiasts can trace the path of the genius across germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 04.06.2005 crisis talks to assess eu charter wreckage großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saving the new eu treaty will top saturday night 's agenda german chancellor schröder will meet french president chirac for a working dinner in berlin saturday to salvage the eu 's constitution after dutch and french voters categorically rejected the new charter this week . despite the resounding blow dealt to the document by the two eu founder members , the german chancellor is eager to see the ratification process to continue in the remaining countries of the 25-nation bloc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac warmly received schröder earlier in may in paris .
thus , it 's unlikely gerhard schröder will waste much time consoling his close friend jacques chirac for the failed referendum in france . the german chancellor is in a defiant mood now that dutch and french voters have rejected the new eu charter and plunged the european union into severe crisis .
one day ahead of his meeting with jacques chirac in berlin , schröder vowed to press ahead towards the goal of a fully-fledged constitution . " i will not accept attempts to stop the entire project simply because two countries rejected it , " he said .
" germany has adopted the constitution as well as a number of other countries .
only at the end of the ratification process will we be able to decide what to do next .
that is why any form of overreaction is totally misplaced . " a tricky situation yet the two leaders are in a dilemma .
stopping the ratification process is apparently unacceptable to the german chancellor .
a renegotiation of the treaty or new votes in the countries opposed to it has also been widely ruled out . what may come under discussion during the crisis talks are ways to extract key provisions in the treaty such as streamlining the eu voting system and establishing the post of an eu foreign minister so that are not subject to referendums . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people hold up the eu flag during a rally through the streets of warsaw , sunday may 15 , 2005 .
another possibility would be to continue with the ratification process and assess the situation at the end of it in 2006 .
berlin appears to be placing some hope on a much-underrated annex to the constitution treaty which allows for an eu summit meeting to discuss further steps if at least 20 of the 25 eu members have ratified the charter . german foreign minister joschka fischer also believes that the constitution treaty is not dead as yet . " i don ’ t think that there is a better treaty to be found anywhere , " fischer said .

thus , it 's unlikely gerhard schröder will waste much time consoling his close friend jacques chirac for the failed referendum in france . the german chancellor is in a defiant mood now that dutch and french voters have rejected the new eu charter and plunged the european union into severe crisis .
one day ahead of his meeting with jacques chirac in berlin , schröder vowed to press ahead towards the goal of a fully-fledged constitution . " i will not accept attempts to stop the entire project simply because two countries rejected it , " he said .
" germany has adopted the constitution as well as a number of other countries .
only at the end of the ratification process will we be able to decide what to do next .
that is why any form of overreaction is totally misplaced . " a tricky situation yet the two leaders are in a dilemma .
stopping the ratification process is apparently unacceptable to the german chancellor .
a renegotiation of the treaty or new votes in the countries opposed to it has also been widely ruled out . what may come under discussion during the crisis talks are ways to extract key provisions in the treaty such as streamlining the eu voting system and establishing the post of an eu foreign minister so that are not subject to referendums . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people hold up the eu flag during a rally through the streets of warsaw , sunday may 15 , 2005 .
another possibility would be to continue with the ratification process and assess the situation at the end of it in 2006 .
berlin appears to be placing some hope on a much-underrated annex to the constitution treaty which allows for an eu summit meeting to discuss further steps if at least 20 of the 25 eu members have ratified the charter . german foreign minister joschka fischer also believes that the constitution treaty is not dead as yet . " i don ’ t think that there is a better treaty to be found anywhere , " fischer said .
" so we have to work hard to rescue it .
obviously we have to put some of our foreign policy objectives on hold for the time being , because of the eu ’ s internal problems , but the world wo n't just stand by and wait for us . " dipping popularity at home as chirac and schröder form a common , pro-constitution front when they sit down to their working dinner in berlin , they might also reflect that they share something else - plummeting popularity ratings at home . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel schröder 's social democrats suffered a devastating defeat in a state election last month , prompting him to call for a general election this september , 12 months ahead of schedule .

there have been " nos " before - from denmark or ireland over the maastricht and nice treaties , for example .
but the constitution is especially significant and of course the french " no " in particular carries a lot of weight .
if you look at the type of discussions which are now going on , you start to worry that we 're walking on quicksand , and there 's nothing you can do about it . but you get the impression it 's not just hyperbole - after this double " no , " europe seems almost paralyzed . we have to recognize that the constitution was already too late .
it should have happened before the european union took in the ten new members last year .
the 25-strong eu wo n't work with the current body of legislation , because the decision-making processes are so complicated and so difficult . everyone said that , if one country rejected the constitution , then it would n't happen at all , so is n't it already dead as a dodo ? no , not if we handle it properly .
in the draft constitution , it says 20 states have to sign it by october 2006 , two years after it was originally put forward : if not , then the european council has to find other ways ahead .
we 'll have to see whether any country is going to pull out , or whether there 'll have to be a new dialogue with any of them .
but i believe we can only do that if we have a change both in policy and in atmosphere - otherwise the french people wo n't be willing to follow us then either . bildunterschrift : a woman walks past " yes " and " no " campaign posters for france 's referendum on the european union constitution in may , 2005 . you 're saying , then , that the double " no " means that we need a different policy change in europe ? we have to take this seriously because the citizens were n't against the constitution per se .
the constitution makes everything more transparent - you wo n't be able to make decisions behind closed doors anymore - and citizens ' rights , democracy and the authority of the national parliaments vis-à-vis the eu will all be strengthened .
if we go back to the nice treaty again , then the distance between the eu and its citizens will grow even more .
we have to have dialogue - but we do n't have to decide everything .
we do n't have to regulate everything in europe , and especially not in a way that contradicts the principles of competitiveness .
and we also have to make it clear that europe has borders , because people are feeling overwhelmed . european citizens in france and the netherlands said " no , " but the first thing we hear from brussels is " we 'll keep on , " so , we 'll keep on ratifying : is that really the right response to the " non and " née ? " well , i think it 's right that the process of ratification should continue and that the other peoples should be consulted in accordance with their own constitutions .
but the process will only be successful if the consolidation phase i have described really does happen and the people feel that we politicians have received and understood this message . now , let 's assume that perhaps not just five but seven countries say no : would that bury the constitution ? then it really will be as dead as a dodo .
and i fear the european union will then be in a real crisis situation - because of the decision-making apparatus and because we will , in the long run , still be so detached that there will be less and less support for the european ideal . could you imagine renegotiating the constitution treaty piecemeal to meet some countries halfway ? it has to be dealt with the same way in each country .
we 've now got 11 countries which have ratified it .
we 'd have to start from scratch again . is n't that a pandora 's box ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : socialist party supporters celebrate in amsterdam , netherlands , after the announcement of preliminary results of the referendum on the proposed european union constitution .
dutch voters overwhelmingly rejected the treaty .
it really is a pandora 's box : but we 've got a breakdown of the vote which shows how mixed the messages from france were .
le pen and the far right sent a completely different message to the left wing , who were talking about a great social europe .
that , in turn , put the british and scandinavians off .
we have to emphasize that , in a federation of 25 countries , not everyone will be able to specify exactly what he wants to have . europe is in crisis and one should n't just ask what to do but who should actually do it ?
it 's a very unusual situation : the french president amongst the ashes his presidency ; the german chancellor - the other half of the franco-german engine - weakened by new elections ; tony blair re-elected but also probably on the way ; berlusconi in difficulties ; things in poland unclear .
who exactly is going to pull the european carriage out of the ditch ? well , firstly , having managed to make such a mess , these gentlemen now have a chance to mount a rescue attempt as their swan-song : for example , they could quickly agree on financial prospects for the next seven years and thereby demonstrate their competence . secondly , : the leadership of europe is up for grabs and it should be the job of the european commission to take care of that as jaques delors once did .
the commission president jose manuel barroso needs to get on with it . is he strong enough ? he knows exactly what 's at stake .
i have the impression that he only needs the will - and to see - that he has a central role to play . for perhaps the first time in the last ten years , you can not ignore the real scepticism about europe right across the political spectrum .
various things are behind it : fear of globalization , fear of the franco-german directorate . where does this euroscepticism come from ?
is the brussels dreamboat , for example , a bit too far above people 's heads ? yes , on the one hand , you have to realize that this is a scepticism about politics as a whole , because at least half the motivation for the " no " in both countries had its roots in domestic politics .
the belgian government only has the support of 19 percent of the voters , and raffarin and chirac 's popularity is stellar , to put it ironically . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dark clouds hover over the eu but on the other hand , we have to admit that we did n't explain that eu expansion had political and economic advantages .
people believe more and more outsiders are coming in while there 's already 10- 12 percent unemployment and they think they are going to take their jobs - and at the same time , they see that in the context of the negotiations with turkey .
all this has had disastrous psychological consequences , especially when politicians did not set out to win people over . i mean , the politicians should have known this : they always say , europe is too expensive and the commission did this or that without asking us , although they all agreed to it . if your policies on europe are always going to follow the same pattern where , in the first sentence , you say " i 'm in favor of europe " and then you come up with three pages blaming your failures on the eu , well , then there 's the problem .
i do n't think the german government 's policies are much different to those of other countries : " when the sun shines , it was berlin , when it rains , it was brussels . " does expansion have to stop ? i think so . in two weeks , 25 heads of state and government will meet for what could be a crisis summit .
from an mep 's perspective , what signal should it send europe 's citizens ? it would be great if they could manage to sort out the future finances .
it would give a boost by demonstrating competence .
also , they have to say to the people : " we have got your message .
we have to do some things differently . "
and if they really manage to do that , in the next 12 months we will be able to approach the people with the continuing process of ratification , because they will say that the constitution is o.k. and that the leaders have learnt how to deal with such a constitution properly . europe should be more modest ? yes , it has to be more modest : we should have more confidence in the people .
and we have to recognize one thing in particular : in a democracy , objective reality is n't reality , it 's what people see as reality .
and if we politicians ca n't accept that , then we 've been trying to sell a pig in a poke . the interview was conducted by alexander kudascheff send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de crisis talks to assess eu charter wreckage german chancellor schröder will meet french president chirac for a working dinner in berlin saturday to salvage the eu 's constitution after dutch and french voters categorically rejected the new charter this week .

there have been " nos " before - from denmark or ireland over the maastricht and nice treaties , for example .
but the constitution is especially significant and of course the french " no " in particular carries a lot of weight .
if you look at the type of discussions which are now going on , you start to worry that we 're walking on quicksand , and there 's nothing you can do about it . but you get the impression it 's not just hyperbole - after this double " no , " europe seems almost paralyzed . we have to recognize that the constitution was already too late .
it should have happened before the european union took in the ten new members last year .
the 25-strong eu wo n't work with the current body of legislation , because the decision-making processes are so complicated and so difficult . everyone said that , if one country rejected the constitution , then it would n't happen at all , so is n't it already dead as a dodo ? no , not if we handle it properly .
in the draft constitution , it says 20 states have to sign it by october 2006 , two years after it was originally put forward : if not , then the european council has to find other ways ahead .
we 'll have to see whether any country is going to pull out , or whether there 'll have to be a new dialogue with any of them .
but i believe we can only do that if we have a change both in policy and in atmosphere - otherwise the french people wo n't be willing to follow us then either . bildunterschrift : a woman walks past " yes " and " no " campaign posters for france 's referendum on the european union constitution in may , 2005 . you 're saying , then , that the double " no " means that we need a different policy change in europe ? we have to take this seriously because the citizens were n't against the constitution per se .
the constitution makes everything more transparent - you wo n't be able to make decisions behind closed doors anymore - and citizens ' rights , democracy and the authority of the national parliaments vis-à-vis the eu will all be strengthened .
if we go back to the nice treaty again , then the distance between the eu and its citizens will grow even more .
we have to have dialogue - but we do n't have to decide everything .
we do n't have to regulate everything in europe , and especially not in a way that contradicts the principles of competitiveness .
and we also have to make it clear that europe has borders , because people are feeling overwhelmed . european citizens in france and the netherlands said " no , " but the first thing we hear from brussels is " we 'll keep on , " so , we 'll keep on ratifying : is that really the right response to the " non and " née ? " well , i think it 's right that the process of ratification should continue and that the other peoples should be consulted in accordance with their own constitutions .
but the process will only be successful if the consolidation phase i have described really does happen and the people feel that we politicians have received and understood this message . now , let 's assume that perhaps not just five but seven countries say no : would that bury the constitution ? then it really will be as dead as a dodo .
and i fear the european union will then be in a real crisis situation - because of the decision-making apparatus and because we will , in the long run , still be so detached that there will be less and less support for the european ideal . could you imagine renegotiating the constitution treaty piecemeal to meet some countries halfway ? it has to be dealt with the same way in each country .
we 've now got 11 countries which have ratified it .
we 'd have to start from scratch again . is n't that a pandora 's box ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : socialist party supporters celebrate in amsterdam , netherlands , after the announcement of preliminary results of the referendum on the proposed european union constitution .
dutch voters overwhelmingly rejected the treaty .
it really is a pandora 's box : but we 've got a breakdown of the vote which shows how mixed the messages from france were .
le pen and the far right sent a completely different message to the left wing , who were talking about a great social europe .
that , in turn , put the british and scandinavians off .
we have to emphasize that , in a federation of 25 countries , not everyone will be able to specify exactly what he wants to have . europe is in crisis and one should n't just ask what to do but who should actually do it ?
it 's a very unusual situation : the french president amongst the ashes his presidency ; the german chancellor - the other half of the franco-german engine - weakened by new elections ; tony blair re-elected but also probably on the way ; berlusconi in difficulties ; things in poland unclear .
who exactly is going to pull the european carriage out of the ditch ? well , firstly , having managed to make such a mess , these gentlemen now have a chance to mount a rescue attempt as their swan-song : for example , they could quickly agree on financial prospects for the next seven years and thereby demonstrate their competence . secondly , : the leadership of europe is up for grabs and it should be the job of the european commission to take care of that as jaques delors once did .
the commission president jose manuel barroso needs to get on with it . is he strong enough ? he knows exactly what 's at stake .
i have the impression that he only needs the will - and to see - that he has a central role to play . for perhaps the first time in the last ten years , you can not ignore the real scepticism about europe right across the political spectrum .
various things are behind it : fear of globalization , fear of the franco-german directorate . where does this euroscepticism come from ?
is the brussels dreamboat , for example , a bit too far above people 's heads ? yes , on the one hand , you have to realize that this is a scepticism about politics as a whole , because at least half the motivation for the " no " in both countries had its roots in domestic politics .
the belgian government only has the support of 19 percent of the voters , and raffarin and chirac 's popularity is stellar , to put it ironically . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dark clouds hover over the eu but on the other hand , we have to admit that we did n't explain that eu expansion had political and economic advantages .
people believe more and more outsiders are coming in while there 's already 10- 12 percent unemployment and they think they are going to take their jobs - and at the same time , they see that in the context of the negotiations with turkey .
all this has had disastrous psychological consequences , especially when politicians did not set out to win people over . i mean , the politicians should have known this : they always say , europe is too expensive and the commission did this or that without asking us , although they all agreed to it . if your policies on europe are always going to follow the same pattern where , in the first sentence , you say " i 'm in favor of europe " and then you come up with three pages blaming your failures on the eu , well , then there 's the problem .

" if the constitution does not come into effect , we remain with the treaty of nice , and the whole of europe agrees that nice was not sufficient for enlargement , " martin schulz , head of the socialist group in the european parliament , told the süddeutsche zeitung . voters in france and the netherlands rejected the constitution in referendums during the past seven days .
romania and bulgaria are due to enter the eu in 2007 and turkey is seeking membership . in the same newspaper klaus hansch , a german social democrat and former president of the parliament , said that european citizens were " very sceptical about a new enlargement " adding that the prospect of turkish membership had played " a very major role " in the " no " votes in france and the netherlands . " europe needs a phase of consolidation which will last much longer than five years , " he said . germans increasingly against treaty the statements come amid a rash of unofficial surveys in the country which show that a rising number of germans are increasingly skeptical of the new embattled eu constitution - a fact that 's being attributed to the lack of a real referendum on the treaty in germany .
the country voted only in the parliament to ratify the treaty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch cows wear protest signs ahead of the referendum on the eu constitution in oosthuizen , 32 km north of amsterdam .
the dutch word " boe " refers to the sound cows make and , like the english " boo , " signals disapproval .
on saturday , the mass-selling daily bild headlined " 96.9 percent against the eu constitution " on its front page , pointing to a survey it conducted among 390,694 readers along with television station rtl .
experts are warning that the recent rejections of the treaty by france and the netherlands are creating a ripple effect , leading to a surge of negative attitudes towards the eu constitution among germans . in one poll carried out by the institute polis for news magazine focus , 44 percent of those surveyed said they were in favor of the treaty with 39 against . full membership for new candidates on hold ? the head of the european affairs commission of the lower house of the german parliament , matthias wissman , for his part said that full membership for new candidates was " out of range for a long time . " wissmann , a christian democrat , told sunday 's welt am sonntag , there should be a " new architecture " for the european union , with eurozone countries at the centre , and those that do not use the single european currency further out . in an outer circle would be " those countries we can not consider full members for a long time but which have a european outlook . " erdogan : nothing but full membership wissmann referred to candidates for eventual membership , including croatia , macedonia and ukraine , as well as turkey , whose prime minister recep tayyip erdogan repeated in an interview with sunday 's bild am sonntag that his government would not accept anything but full membership . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan a " partnership " with the eu , as suggested by french and german right-wingers in particular , would be against the spirit of the relations between the two sides and break europe 's commitments to ankara , erdogan added . he said turkey had fulfilled the political criteria required by brussels and was busy implementing the necessary reforms .
while the french and dutch rejection of the constitution were " cause for concern , " erdogan said the eu had overcome such setbacks in the past . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de crisis talks to assess eu charter wreckage german chancellor schröder will meet french president chirac for a working dinner in berlin saturday to salvage the eu 's constitution after dutch and french voters categorically rejected the new charter this week .

" if the constitution does not come into effect , we remain with the treaty of nice , and the whole of europe agrees that nice was not sufficient for enlargement , " martin schulz , head of the socialist group in the european parliament , told the süddeutsche zeitung . voters in france and the netherlands rejected the constitution in referendums during the past seven days .
romania and bulgaria are due to enter the eu in 2007 and turkey is seeking membership . in the same newspaper klaus hansch , a german social democrat and former president of the parliament , said that european citizens were " very sceptical about a new enlargement " adding that the prospect of turkish membership had played " a very major role " in the " no " votes in france and the netherlands . " europe needs a phase of consolidation which will last much longer than five years , " he said . germans increasingly against treaty the statements come amid a rash of unofficial surveys in the country which show that a rising number of germans are increasingly skeptical of the new embattled eu constitution - a fact that 's being attributed to the lack of a real referendum on the treaty in germany .
the country voted only in the parliament to ratify the treaty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch cows wear protest signs ahead of the referendum on the eu constitution in oosthuizen , 32 km north of amsterdam .
the dutch word " boe " refers to the sound cows make and , like the english " boo , " signals disapproval .
on saturday , the mass-selling daily bild headlined " 96.9 percent against the eu constitution " on its front page , pointing to a survey it conducted among 390,694 readers along with television station rtl .
experts are warning that the recent rejections of the treaty by france and the netherlands are creating a ripple effect , leading to a surge of negative attitudes towards the eu constitution among germans . in one poll carried out by the institute polis for news magazine focus , 44 percent of those surveyed said they were in favor of the treaty with 39 against . full membership for new candidates on hold ? the head of the european affairs commission of the lower house of the german parliament , matthias wissman , for his part said that full membership for new candidates was " out of range for a long time . " wissmann , a christian democrat , told sunday 's welt am sonntag , there should be a " new architecture " for the european union , with eurozone countries at the centre , and those that do not use the single european currency further out . in an outer circle would be " those countries we can not consider full members for a long time but which have a european outlook . " erdogan : nothing but full membership wissmann referred to candidates for eventual membership , including croatia , macedonia and ukraine , as well as turkey , whose prime minister recep tayyip erdogan repeated in an interview with sunday 's bild am sonntag that his government would not accept anything but full membership . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan a " partnership " with the eu , as suggested by french and german right-wingers in particular , would be against the spirit of the relations between the two sides and break europe 's commitments to ankara , erdogan added . he said turkey had fulfilled the political criteria required by brussels and was busy implementing the necessary reforms .
while the french and dutch rejection of the constitution were " cause for concern , " erdogan said the eu had overcome such setbacks in the past . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de crisis talks to assess eu charter wreckage german chancellor schröder will meet french president chirac for a working dinner in berlin saturday to salvage the eu 's constitution after dutch and french voters categorically rejected the new charter this week .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 04.06.2005 germany popular with foreign students großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a growing number of foreign faces in germany 's lecture halls universities and politicians are repeatedly complaining that germany 's smartest brains are packing up and leaving to study and research abroad .
but a study shows the country is gaining a growing number of foreign brains . knowledge is international .
for precisely this reason , germany has become a significant hub of learning , said education and research minister edelgard bulmahn .
" germany belongs to the winners in the race for the smartest heads , " bulmahn said .
" in the 1990s , we had an alarming brain drain in germany .
since 2001 , we 've managed to achieve a turn of the tide . "
according to a study by the german student services studentenwerk , every tenth student in germany comes from abroad .
this makes germany just as attractive a place to study as britain .
the percentage of foreign students is even higher than in the united states .
the number of foreign students has increased since the 1990s from 150,000 to some 230,000 , the study said .
asian interest in german institutions german universities are probably also so popular because there are no tuition fees .
this is a reason why so many students from developing countries and newly industrializing nations come to germany .
a strong increase in interest in german universities is especially noticeable from asia .
" we have really managed to attract a significantly larger share of students from regions which are booming economically , " bulmahn said .
" these are our future trade partners and these students are the ambassadors which we need in those countries . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign students are increasingly filling german university libraries at the same time , 15 percent of the more than 1.7 million german students spend at least part of their studies abroad .
this makes them generally more mobile than their counterparts from britain , australia or the united states .
bulmahn said this " welcome development " was somewhat marred , however .
despite reforms , children from socially weak families were still neglected for foreign study .
only 55,000 germans go abroad solely for studying .
brain drain to germany still , the minister takes a positive stock of the matter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education and research minister edelgard bulmahn has been keen to attract more brainpower to germany " the mobility of german students can be seen worldwide , as well as the increase in the number of foreign students here , " bulmahn said .
" in addition , we are attracting more scientists from abroad every year since the german government has created the general conditions for an internationally competitive research base . "
the controversial junior professorship had helped stop the brain drain , she said .
this position enables up-and-coming scientists to teach and research independently sooner if they can present an outstanding dissertation .
the federal government supports these posts with an average of 60,000 euros -lrb- $ 73,640 -rrb- per position .
the junior professorship has attracted talented foreign up-and-coming scientists to germany and also brought young top german researchers back home .

there have been " nos " before - from denmark or ireland over the maastricht and nice treaties , for example .
but the constitution is especially significant and of course the french " no " in particular carries a lot of weight .
if you look at the type of discussions which are now going on , you start to worry that we 're walking on quicksand , and there 's nothing you can do about it . but you get the impression it 's not just hyperbole - after this double " no , " europe seems almost paralyzed . we have to recognize that the constitution was already too late .
it should have happened before the european union took in the ten new members last year .
the 25-strong eu wo n't work with the current body of legislation , because the decision-making processes are so complicated and so difficult . everyone said that , if one country rejected the constitution , then it would n't happen at all , so is n't it already dead as a dodo ? no , not if we handle it properly .
in the draft constitution , it says 20 states have to sign it by october 2006 , two years after it was originally put forward : if not , then the european council has to find other ways ahead .
we 'll have to see whether any country is going to pull out , or whether there 'll have to be a new dialogue with any of them .
but i believe we can only do that if we have a change both in policy and in atmosphere - otherwise the french people wo n't be willing to follow us then either . bildunterschrift : a woman walks past " yes " and " no " campaign posters for france 's referendum on the european union constitution in may , 2005 . you 're saying , then , that the double " no " means that we need a different policy change in europe ? we have to take this seriously because the citizens were n't against the constitution per se .
the constitution makes everything more transparent - you wo n't be able to make decisions behind closed doors anymore - and citizens ' rights , democracy and the authority of the national parliaments vis-à-vis the eu will all be strengthened .
if we go back to the nice treaty again , then the distance between the eu and its citizens will grow even more .
we have to have dialogue - but we do n't have to decide everything .
we do n't have to regulate everything in europe , and especially not in a way that contradicts the principles of competitiveness .
and we also have to make it clear that europe has borders , because people are feeling overwhelmed . european citizens in france and the netherlands said " no , " but the first thing we hear from brussels is " we 'll keep on , " so , we 'll keep on ratifying : is that really the right response to the " non and " née ? " well , i think it 's right that the process of ratification should continue and that the other peoples should be consulted in accordance with their own constitutions .
but the process will only be successful if the consolidation phase i have described really does happen and the people feel that we politicians have received and understood this message . now , let 's assume that perhaps not just five but seven countries say no : would that bury the constitution ? then it really will be as dead as a dodo .
and i fear the european union will then be in a real crisis situation - because of the decision-making apparatus and because we will , in the long run , still be so detached that there will be less and less support for the european ideal . could you imagine renegotiating the constitution treaty piecemeal to meet some countries halfway ? it has to be dealt with the same way in each country .
we 've now got 11 countries which have ratified it .
we 'd have to start from scratch again . is n't that a pandora 's box ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : socialist party supporters celebrate in amsterdam , netherlands , after the announcement of preliminary results of the referendum on the proposed european union constitution .
dutch voters overwhelmingly rejected the treaty .
it really is a pandora 's box : but we 've got a breakdown of the vote which shows how mixed the messages from france were .
le pen and the far right sent a completely different message to the left wing , who were talking about a great social europe .
that , in turn , put the british and scandinavians off .
we have to emphasize that , in a federation of 25 countries , not everyone will be able to specify exactly what he wants to have . europe is in crisis and one should n't just ask what to do but who should actually do it ?
it 's a very unusual situation : the french president amongst the ashes his presidency ; the german chancellor - the other half of the franco-german engine - weakened by new elections ; tony blair re-elected but also probably on the way ; berlusconi in difficulties ; things in poland unclear .
who exactly is going to pull the european carriage out of the ditch ? well , firstly , having managed to make such a mess , these gentlemen now have a chance to mount a rescue attempt as their swan-song : for example , they could quickly agree on financial prospects for the next seven years and thereby demonstrate their competence . secondly , : the leadership of europe is up for grabs and it should be the job of the european commission to take care of that as jaques delors once did .
the commission president jose manuel barroso needs to get on with it . is he strong enough ? he knows exactly what 's at stake .
i have the impression that he only needs the will - and to see - that he has a central role to play . for perhaps the first time in the last ten years , you can not ignore the real scepticism about europe right across the political spectrum .
various things are behind it : fear of globalization , fear of the franco-german directorate . where does this euroscepticism come from ?
is the brussels dreamboat , for example , a bit too far above people 's heads ? yes , on the one hand , you have to realize that this is a scepticism about politics as a whole , because at least half the motivation for the " no " in both countries had its roots in domestic politics .
the belgian government only has the support of 19 percent of the voters , and raffarin and chirac 's popularity is stellar , to put it ironically . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dark clouds hover over the eu but on the other hand , we have to admit that we did n't explain that eu expansion had political and economic advantages .
people believe more and more outsiders are coming in while there 's already 10- 12 percent unemployment and they think they are going to take their jobs - and at the same time , they see that in the context of the negotiations with turkey .
all this has had disastrous psychological consequences , especially when politicians did not set out to win people over . i mean , the politicians should have known this : they always say , europe is too expensive and the commission did this or that without asking us , although they all agreed to it . if your policies on europe are always going to follow the same pattern where , in the first sentence , you say " i 'm in favor of europe " and then you come up with three pages blaming your failures on the eu , well , then there 's the problem .
i do n't think the german government 's policies are much different to those of other countries : " when the sun shines , it was berlin , when it rains , it was brussels . " does expansion have to stop ? i think so . in two weeks , 25 heads of state and government will meet for what could be a crisis summit .
from an mep 's perspective , what signal should it send europe 's citizens ? it would be great if they could manage to sort out the future finances .
it would give a boost by demonstrating competence .
also , they have to say to the people : " we have got your message .
we have to do some things differently . "
and if they really manage to do that , in the next 12 months we will be able to approach the people with the continuing process of ratification , because they will say that the constitution is o.k. and that the leaders have learnt how to deal with such a constitution properly . europe should be more modest ? yes , it has to be more modest : we should have more confidence in the people .
and we have to recognize one thing in particular : in a democracy , objective reality is n't reality , it 's what people see as reality .
and if we politicians ca n't accept that , then we 've been trying to sell a pig in a poke . the interview was conducted by alexander kudascheff send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de crisis talks to assess eu charter wreckage german chancellor schröder will meet french president chirac for a working dinner in berlin saturday to salvage the eu 's constitution after dutch and french voters categorically rejected the new charter this week .

the 25-strong eu wo n't work with the current body of legislation , because the decision-making processes are so complicated and so difficult . everyone said that , if one country rejected the constitution , then it would n't happen at all , so is n't it already dead as a dodo ? no , not if we handle it properly .
in the draft constitution , it says 20 states have to sign it by october 2006 , two years after it was originally put forward : if not , then the european council has to find other ways ahead .
we 'll have to see whether any country is going to pull out , or whether there 'll have to be a new dialogue with any of them .
but i believe we can only do that if we have a change both in policy and in atmosphere - otherwise the french people wo n't be willing to follow us then either . bildunterschrift : a woman walks past " yes " and " no " campaign posters for france 's referendum on the european union constitution in may , 2005 . you 're saying , then , that the double " no " means that we need a different policy change in europe ? we have to take this seriously because the citizens were n't against the constitution per se .
the constitution makes everything more transparent - you wo n't be able to make decisions behind closed doors anymore - and citizens ' rights , democracy and the authority of the national parliaments vis-à-vis the eu will all be strengthened .
if we go back to the nice treaty again , then the distance between the eu and its citizens will grow even more .
we have to have dialogue - but we do n't have to decide everything .
we do n't have to regulate everything in europe , and especially not in a way that contradicts the principles of competitiveness .
and we also have to make it clear that europe has borders , because people are feeling overwhelmed . european citizens in france and the netherlands said " no , " but the first thing we hear from brussels is " we 'll keep on , " so , we 'll keep on ratifying : is that really the right response to the " non and " née ? " well , i think it 's right that the process of ratification should continue and that the other peoples should be consulted in accordance with their own constitutions .
but the process will only be successful if the consolidation phase i have described really does happen and the people feel that we politicians have received and understood this message . now , let 's assume that perhaps not just five but seven countries say no : would that bury the constitution ? then it really will be as dead as a dodo .
and i fear the european union will then be in a real crisis situation - because of the decision-making apparatus and because we will , in the long run , still be so detached that there will be less and less support for the european ideal . could you imagine renegotiating the constitution treaty piecemeal to meet some countries halfway ? it has to be dealt with the same way in each country .
we 've now got 11 countries which have ratified it .
we 'd have to start from scratch again . is n't that a pandora 's box ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : socialist party supporters celebrate in amsterdam , netherlands , after the announcement of preliminary results of the referendum on the proposed european union constitution .
dutch voters overwhelmingly rejected the treaty .
it really is a pandora 's box : but we 've got a breakdown of the vote which shows how mixed the messages from france were .
le pen and the far right sent a completely different message to the left wing , who were talking about a great social europe .
that , in turn , put the british and scandinavians off .
we have to emphasize that , in a federation of 25 countries , not everyone will be able to specify exactly what he wants to have . europe is in crisis and one should n't just ask what to do but who should actually do it ?
it 's a very unusual situation : the french president amongst the ashes his presidency ; the german chancellor - the other half of the franco-german engine - weakened by new elections ; tony blair re-elected but also probably on the way ; berlusconi in difficulties ; things in poland unclear .
who exactly is going to pull the european carriage out of the ditch ? well , firstly , having managed to make such a mess , these gentlemen now have a chance to mount a rescue attempt as their swan-song : for example , they could quickly agree on financial prospects for the next seven years and thereby demonstrate their competence . secondly , : the leadership of europe is up for grabs and it should be the job of the european commission to take care of that as jaques delors once did .
the commission president jose manuel barroso needs to get on with it . is he strong enough ? he knows exactly what 's at stake .
i have the impression that he only needs the will - and to see - that he has a central role to play . for perhaps the first time in the last ten years , you can not ignore the real scepticism about europe right across the political spectrum .
various things are behind it : fear of globalization , fear of the franco-german directorate . where does this euroscepticism come from ?
is the brussels dreamboat , for example , a bit too far above people 's heads ? yes , on the one hand , you have to realize that this is a scepticism about politics as a whole , because at least half the motivation for the " no " in both countries had its roots in domestic politics .
the belgian government only has the support of 19 percent of the voters , and raffarin and chirac 's popularity is stellar , to put it ironically . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dark clouds hover over the eu but on the other hand , we have to admit that we did n't explain that eu expansion had political and economic advantages .
people believe more and more outsiders are coming in while there 's already 10- 12 percent unemployment and they think they are going to take their jobs - and at the same time , they see that in the context of the negotiations with turkey .
all this has had disastrous psychological consequences , especially when politicians did not set out to win people over . i mean , the politicians should have known this : they always say , europe is too expensive and the commission did this or that without asking us , although they all agreed to it . if your policies on europe are always going to follow the same pattern where , in the first sentence , you say " i 'm in favor of europe " and then you come up with three pages blaming your failures on the eu , well , then there 's the problem .
i do n't think the german government 's policies are much different to those of other countries : " when the sun shines , it was berlin , when it rains , it was brussels . " does expansion have to stop ? i think so . in two weeks , 25 heads of state and government will meet for what could be a crisis summit .
from an mep 's perspective , what signal should it send europe 's citizens ? it would be great if they could manage to sort out the future finances .
it would give a boost by demonstrating competence .
also , they have to say to the people : " we have got your message .
we have to do some things differently . "
and if they really manage to do that , in the next 12 months we will be able to approach the people with the continuing process of ratification , because they will say that the constitution is o.k. and that the leaders have learnt how to deal with such a constitution properly . europe should be more modest ? yes , it has to be more modest : we should have more confidence in the people .
and we have to recognize one thing in particular : in a democracy , objective reality is n't reality , it 's what people see as reality .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 04.06.2005 " europe has to be more modest " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is caught in a cul-de-sac over its new constitution elmar brok , conservative european mep and member of the convention which drew up the eu charter told dw-tv that it should have been approved before expansion and warned the eu had to take note of its citizens ' concerns . dw : mr brok , you are almost part of the political landscape in both brussels and europe - is the european union going through its biggest ever crisis after the two " no " in the referendums in france and the netherlands ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elmar brok elmar brok : no , technically speaking , it 's not the biggest crisis .
there have been " nos " before - from denmark or ireland over the maastricht and nice treaties , for example .
but the constitution is especially significant and of course the french " no " in particular carries a lot of weight .
if you look at the type of discussions which are now going on , you start to worry that we 're walking on quicksand , and there 's nothing you can do about it . but you get the impression it 's not just hyperbole - after this double " no , " europe seems almost paralyzed . we have to recognize that the constitution was already too late .
it should have happened before the european union took in the ten new members last year .
the 25-strong eu wo n't work with the current body of legislation , because the decision-making processes are so complicated and so difficult . everyone said that , if one country rejected the constitution , then it would n't happen at all , so is n't it already dead as a dodo ? no , not if we handle it properly .
in the draft constitution , it says 20 states have to sign it by october 2006 , two years after it was originally put forward : if not , then the european council has to find other ways ahead .
we 'll have to see whether any country is going to pull out , or whether there 'll have to be a new dialogue with any of them .
but i believe we can only do that if we have a change both in policy and in atmosphere - otherwise the french people wo n't be willing to follow us then either . bildunterschrift : a woman walks past " yes " and " no " campaign posters for france 's referendum on the european union constitution in may , 2005 . you 're saying , then , that the double " no " means that we need a different policy change in europe ? we have to take this seriously because the citizens were n't against the constitution per se .
the constitution makes everything more transparent - you wo n't be able to make decisions behind closed doors anymore - and citizens ' rights , democracy and the authority of the national parliaments vis-à-vis the eu will all be strengthened .
if we go back to the nice treaty again , then the distance between the eu and its citizens will grow even more .
we have to have dialogue - but we do n't have to decide everything .
we do n't have to regulate everything in europe , and especially not in a way that contradicts the principles of competitiveness .
and we also have to make it clear that europe has borders , because people are feeling overwhelmed . european citizens in france and the netherlands said " no , " but the first thing we hear from brussels is " we 'll keep on , " so , we 'll keep on ratifying : is that really the right response to the " non and " née ? " well , i think it 's right that the process of ratification should continue and that the other peoples should be consulted in accordance with their own constitutions .
but the process will only be successful if the consolidation phase i have described really does happen and the people feel that we politicians have received and understood this message . now , let 's assume that perhaps not just five but seven countries say no : would that bury the constitution ? then it really will be as dead as a dodo .
and i fear the european union will then be in a real crisis situation - because of the decision-making apparatus and because we will , in the long run , still be so detached that there will be less and less support for the european ideal . could you imagine renegotiating the constitution treaty piecemeal to meet some countries halfway ? it has to be dealt with the same way in each country .
we 've now got 11 countries which have ratified it .
we 'd have to start from scratch again . is n't that a pandora 's box ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : socialist party supporters celebrate in amsterdam , netherlands , after the announcement of preliminary results of the referendum on the proposed european union constitution .
dutch voters overwhelmingly rejected the treaty .
it really is a pandora 's box : but we 've got a breakdown of the vote which shows how mixed the messages from france were .
le pen and the far right sent a completely different message to the left wing , who were talking about a great social europe .
that , in turn , put the british and scandinavians off .
we have to emphasize that , in a federation of 25 countries , not everyone will be able to specify exactly what he wants to have . europe is in crisis and one should n't just ask what to do but who should actually do it ?
it 's a very unusual situation : the french president amongst the ashes his presidency ; the german chancellor - the other half of the franco-german engine - weakened by new elections ; tony blair re-elected but also probably on the way ; berlusconi in difficulties ; things in poland unclear .
who exactly is going to pull the european carriage out of the ditch ? well , firstly , having managed to make such a mess , these gentlemen now have a chance to mount a rescue attempt as their swan-song : for example , they could quickly agree on financial prospects for the next seven years and thereby demonstrate their competence . secondly , : the leadership of europe is up for grabs and it should be the job of the european commission to take care of that as jaques delors once did .
the commission president jose manuel barroso needs to get on with it . is he strong enough ? he knows exactly what 's at stake .
i have the impression that he only needs the will - and to see - that he has a central role to play . for perhaps the first time in the last ten years , you can not ignore the real scepticism about europe right across the political spectrum .
various things are behind it : fear of globalization , fear of the franco-german directorate . where does this euroscepticism come from ?
is the brussels dreamboat , for example , a bit too far above people 's heads ? yes , on the one hand , you have to realize that this is a scepticism about politics as a whole , because at least half the motivation for the " no " in both countries had its roots in domestic politics .
the belgian government only has the support of 19 percent of the voters , and raffarin and chirac 's popularity is stellar , to put it ironically . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dark clouds hover over the eu but on the other hand , we have to admit that we did n't explain that eu expansion had political and economic advantages .
people believe more and more outsiders are coming in while there 's already 10- 12 percent unemployment and they think they are going to take their jobs - and at the same time , they see that in the context of the negotiations with turkey .
all this has had disastrous psychological consequences , especially when politicians did not set out to win people over . i mean , the politicians should have known this : they always say , europe is too expensive and the commission did this or that without asking us , although they all agreed to it . if your policies on europe are always going to follow the same pattern where , in the first sentence , you say " i 'm in favor of europe " and then you come up with three pages blaming your failures on the eu , well , then there 's the problem .
i do n't think the german government 's policies are much different to those of other countries : " when the sun shines , it was berlin , when it rains , it was brussels . " does expansion have to stop ? i think so . in two weeks , 25 heads of state and government will meet for what could be a crisis summit .
from an mep 's perspective , what signal should it send europe 's citizens ? it would be great if they could manage to sort out the future finances .
it would give a boost by demonstrating competence .
also , they have to say to the people : " we have got your message .
we have to do some things differently . "
and if they really manage to do that , in the next 12 months we will be able to approach the people with the continuing process of ratification , because they will say that the constitution is o.k. and that the leaders have learnt how to deal with such a constitution properly . europe should be more modest ? yes , it has to be more modest : we should have more confidence in the people .
and we have to recognize one thing in particular : in a democracy , objective reality is n't reality , it 's what people see as reality .
and if we politicians ca n't accept that , then we 've been trying to sell a pig in a poke . the interview was conducted by alexander kudascheff send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de crisis talks to assess eu charter wreckage german chancellor schröder will meet french president chirac for a working dinner in berlin saturday to salvage the eu 's constitution after dutch and french voters categorically rejected the new charter this week .

thus , it 's unlikely gerhard schröder will waste much time consoling his close friend jacques chirac for the failed referendum in france . the german chancellor is in a defiant mood now that dutch and french voters have rejected the new eu charter and plunged the european union into severe crisis .
one day ahead of his meeting with jacques chirac in berlin , schröder vowed to press ahead towards the goal of a fully-fledged constitution . " i will not accept attempts to stop the entire project simply because two countries rejected it , " he said .
" germany has adopted the constitution as well as a number of other countries .
only at the end of the ratification process will we be able to decide what to do next .
that is why any form of overreaction is totally misplaced . " a tricky situation yet the two leaders are in a dilemma .
stopping the ratification process is apparently unacceptable to the german chancellor .
a renegotiation of the treaty or new votes in the countries opposed to it has also been widely ruled out . what may come under discussion during the crisis talks are ways to extract key provisions in the treaty such as streamlining the eu voting system and establishing the post of an eu foreign minister so that are not subject to referendums . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people hold up the eu flag during a rally through the streets of warsaw , sunday may 15 , 2005 .
another possibility would be to continue with the ratification process and assess the situation at the end of it in 2006 .
berlin appears to be placing some hope on a much-underrated annex to the constitution treaty which allows for an eu summit meeting to discuss further steps if at least 20 of the 25 eu members have ratified the charter . german foreign minister joschka fischer also believes that the constitution treaty is not dead as yet . " i don ’ t think that there is a better treaty to be found anywhere , " fischer said .
" so we have to work hard to rescue it .
obviously we have to put some of our foreign policy objectives on hold for the time being , because of the eu ’ s internal problems , but the world wo n't just stand by and wait for us . " dipping popularity at home as chirac and schröder form a common , pro-constitution front when they sit down to their working dinner in berlin , they might also reflect that they share something else - plummeting popularity ratings at home . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel schröder 's social democrats suffered a devastating defeat in a state election last month , prompting him to call for a general election this september , 12 months ahead of schedule .
opinion polls show he will lose to the conservative opposition christian democrats of angela merkel -lrb- photo -rrb- . chirac meanwhile suffered the humiliation of seeing his people ignore his appeals for them to ratify the constitution and spent the week looking , to many analysts , like a lame duck president . the " no " vote forced him into a government reshuffle , promoting former health minister philippe douste-blazy to foreign minister . douste-blazy was candid about the future , saying : " we are obviously in a difficult situation after two negative referendums . " chirac 's spokesman meanwhile said he would use the brussels summit to assure his eu colleagues of france 's commitment to the bloc and its " anchoring within the union " in the coming weeks . schröder 's new flexibility in an attempt to pour oil into troubled waters , gerhard schröder has already signaled flexibility in an ongoing row over eu financing which has pitted net contributors to the budget against recipients .
although no details were given by the chancellor , a deal could include a rise in german eu contributions beyond the current 1 percent of gross national product . schröder ’ s new flexibility could perhaps include concessions towards britain which enjoys a rebate from eu coffers that most members want scrapped .
it wouldn ’ t be the first time that germany has sought to buy europe out of its troubles and it ’ s a prospect that could even keep prime minister tony blair from canceling the british referendum and declaring the constitution dead once and for all . blair will meet schröder in berlin on june 13 . uwe hessler -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder 's shuttle diplomacy to save eu germany forced the pace friday as european leaders scrambled to resolve the deep political crisis over the eu constitution , with chancellor gerhard schröder scheduling a series of meetings with eu leaders .
-lrb- june 3 , 2005 -rrb- europe 's motor plans emergency summit germany and france , for so long the driving force behind european integration , will hold an emergency summit this weekend to discuss the crisis unfolding after the french and dutch rejection of the eu constitution .
-lrb- june 2 , 2005 -rrb- eu in agony after constitution fiasco europe agonized over the eu constitution 's future thursday after dutch voters rejected it wednesday .
while some fear that the " no " could all but bury the treaty , most eu leaders said its ratification should continue .

according to a study by the german student services studentenwerk , every tenth student in germany comes from abroad .
this makes germany just as attractive a place to study as britain .

thus , it 's unlikely gerhard schröder will waste much time consoling his close friend jacques chirac for the failed referendum in france . the german chancellor is in a defiant mood now that dutch and french voters have rejected the new eu charter and plunged the european union into severe crisis .
one day ahead of his meeting with jacques chirac in berlin , schröder vowed to press ahead towards the goal of a fully-fledged constitution . " i will not accept attempts to stop the entire project simply because two countries rejected it , " he said .
" germany has adopted the constitution as well as a number of other countries .
only at the end of the ratification process will we be able to decide what to do next .
that is why any form of overreaction is totally misplaced . " a tricky situation yet the two leaders are in a dilemma .
stopping the ratification process is apparently unacceptable to the german chancellor .
a renegotiation of the treaty or new votes in the countries opposed to it has also been widely ruled out . what may come under discussion during the crisis talks are ways to extract key provisions in the treaty such as streamlining the eu voting system and establishing the post of an eu foreign minister so that are not subject to referendums . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people hold up the eu flag during a rally through the streets of warsaw , sunday may 15 , 2005 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 04.06.2005 germany popular with foreign students großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a growing number of foreign faces in germany 's lecture halls universities and politicians are repeatedly complaining that germany 's smartest brains are packing up and leaving to study and research abroad .
but a study shows the country is gaining a growing number of foreign brains . knowledge is international .
for precisely this reason , germany has become a significant hub of learning , said education and research minister edelgard bulmahn .
" germany belongs to the winners in the race for the smartest heads , " bulmahn said .
" in the 1990s , we had an alarming brain drain in germany .
since 2001 , we 've managed to achieve a turn of the tide . "
according to a study by the german student services studentenwerk , every tenth student in germany comes from abroad .
this makes germany just as attractive a place to study as britain .
the percentage of foreign students is even higher than in the united states .
the number of foreign students has increased since the 1990s from 150,000 to some 230,000 , the study said .
asian interest in german institutions german universities are probably also so popular because there are no tuition fees .
this is a reason why so many students from developing countries and newly industrializing nations come to germany .
a strong increase in interest in german universities is especially noticeable from asia .
" we have really managed to attract a significantly larger share of students from regions which are booming economically , " bulmahn said .
" these are our future trade partners and these students are the ambassadors which we need in those countries . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign students are increasingly filling german university libraries at the same time , 15 percent of the more than 1.7 million german students spend at least part of their studies abroad .
this makes them generally more mobile than their counterparts from britain , australia or the united states .
bulmahn said this " welcome development " was somewhat marred , however .
despite reforms , children from socially weak families were still neglected for foreign study .
only 55,000 germans go abroad solely for studying .
brain drain to germany still , the minister takes a positive stock of the matter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education and research minister edelgard bulmahn has been keen to attract more brainpower to germany " the mobility of german students can be seen worldwide , as well as the increase in the number of foreign students here , " bulmahn said .
" in addition , we are attracting more scientists from abroad every year since the german government has created the general conditions for an internationally competitive research base . "
the controversial junior professorship had helped stop the brain drain , she said .
this position enables up-and-coming scientists to teach and research independently sooner if they can present an outstanding dissertation .
the federal government supports these posts with an average of 60,000 euros -lrb- $ 73,640 -rrb- per position .
the junior professorship has attracted talented foreign up-and-coming scientists to germany and also brought young top german researchers back home .
so , if at all , there can only be talk of brain drain to germany . karin kails -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de paying for european research the eu has over 400 funding programs , many of which are dedicated to particular fields of research ranging from nuclear science to bee keeping .

for precisely this reason , germany has become a significant hub of learning , said education and research minister edelgard bulmahn .
" germany belongs to the winners in the race for the smartest heads , " bulmahn said .
" in the 1990s , we had an alarming brain drain in germany .
since 2001 , we 've managed to achieve a turn of the tide . "
according to a study by the german student services studentenwerk , every tenth student in germany comes from abroad .
this makes germany just as attractive a place to study as britain .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 04.06.2005 " europe has to be more modest " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is caught in a cul-de-sac over its new constitution elmar brok , conservative european mep and member of the convention which drew up the eu charter told dw-tv that it should have been approved before expansion and warned the eu had to take note of its citizens ' concerns . dw : mr brok , you are almost part of the political landscape in both brussels and europe - is the european union going through its biggest ever crisis after the two " no " in the referendums in france and the netherlands ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elmar brok elmar brok : no , technically speaking , it 's not the biggest crisis .
there have been " nos " before - from denmark or ireland over the maastricht and nice treaties , for example .
but the constitution is especially significant and of course the french " no " in particular carries a lot of weight .
if you look at the type of discussions which are now going on , you start to worry that we 're walking on quicksand , and there 's nothing you can do about it . but you get the impression it 's not just hyperbole - after this double " no , " europe seems almost paralyzed . we have to recognize that the constitution was already too late .
it should have happened before the european union took in the ten new members last year .
the 25-strong eu wo n't work with the current body of legislation , because the decision-making processes are so complicated and so difficult . everyone said that , if one country rejected the constitution , then it would n't happen at all , so is n't it already dead as a dodo ? no , not if we handle it properly .
in the draft constitution , it says 20 states have to sign it by october 2006 , two years after it was originally put forward : if not , then the european council has to find other ways ahead .
we 'll have to see whether any country is going to pull out , or whether there 'll have to be a new dialogue with any of them .
but i believe we can only do that if we have a change both in policy and in atmosphere - otherwise the french people wo n't be willing to follow us then either . bildunterschrift : a woman walks past " yes " and " no " campaign posters for france 's referendum on the european union constitution in may , 2005 . you 're saying , then , that the double " no " means that we need a different policy change in europe ? we have to take this seriously because the citizens were n't against the constitution per se .
the constitution makes everything more transparent - you wo n't be able to make decisions behind closed doors anymore - and citizens ' rights , democracy and the authority of the national parliaments vis-à-vis the eu will all be strengthened .
if we go back to the nice treaty again , then the distance between the eu and its citizens will grow even more .
we have to have dialogue - but we do n't have to decide everything .
we do n't have to regulate everything in europe , and especially not in a way that contradicts the principles of competitiveness .
and we also have to make it clear that europe has borders , because people are feeling overwhelmed . european citizens in france and the netherlands said " no , " but the first thing we hear from brussels is " we 'll keep on , " so , we 'll keep on ratifying : is that really the right response to the " non and " née ? " well , i think it 's right that the process of ratification should continue and that the other peoples should be consulted in accordance with their own constitutions .
but the process will only be successful if the consolidation phase i have described really does happen and the people feel that we politicians have received and understood this message . now , let 's assume that perhaps not just five but seven countries say no : would that bury the constitution ? then it really will be as dead as a dodo .
and i fear the european union will then be in a real crisis situation - because of the decision-making apparatus and because we will , in the long run , still be so detached that there will be less and less support for the european ideal . could you imagine renegotiating the constitution treaty piecemeal to meet some countries halfway ? it has to be dealt with the same way in each country .
we 've now got 11 countries which have ratified it .
we 'd have to start from scratch again . is n't that a pandora 's box ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : socialist party supporters celebrate in amsterdam , netherlands , after the announcement of preliminary results of the referendum on the proposed european union constitution .
dutch voters overwhelmingly rejected the treaty .
it really is a pandora 's box : but we 've got a breakdown of the vote which shows how mixed the messages from france were .
le pen and the far right sent a completely different message to the left wing , who were talking about a great social europe .
that , in turn , put the british and scandinavians off .
we have to emphasize that , in a federation of 25 countries , not everyone will be able to specify exactly what he wants to have . europe is in crisis and one should n't just ask what to do but who should actually do it ?
it 's a very unusual situation : the french president amongst the ashes his presidency ; the german chancellor - the other half of the franco-german engine - weakened by new elections ; tony blair re-elected but also probably on the way ; berlusconi in difficulties ; things in poland unclear .
who exactly is going to pull the european carriage out of the ditch ? well , firstly , having managed to make such a mess , these gentlemen now have a chance to mount a rescue attempt as their swan-song : for example , they could quickly agree on financial prospects for the next seven years and thereby demonstrate their competence . secondly , : the leadership of europe is up for grabs and it should be the job of the european commission to take care of that as jaques delors once did .
the commission president jose manuel barroso needs to get on with it . is he strong enough ? he knows exactly what 's at stake .
i have the impression that he only needs the will - and to see - that he has a central role to play . for perhaps the first time in the last ten years , you can not ignore the real scepticism about europe right across the political spectrum .
various things are behind it : fear of globalization , fear of the franco-german directorate . where does this euroscepticism come from ?

there have been " nos " before - from denmark or ireland over the maastricht and nice treaties , for example .
but the constitution is especially significant and of course the french " no " in particular carries a lot of weight .
if you look at the type of discussions which are now going on , you start to worry that we 're walking on quicksand , and there 's nothing you can do about it . but you get the impression it 's not just hyperbole - after this double " no , " europe seems almost paralyzed . we have to recognize that the constitution was already too late .
it should have happened before the european union took in the ten new members last year .
the 25-strong eu wo n't work with the current body of legislation , because the decision-making processes are so complicated and so difficult . everyone said that , if one country rejected the constitution , then it would n't happen at all , so is n't it already dead as a dodo ? no , not if we handle it properly .
in the draft constitution , it says 20 states have to sign it by october 2006 , two years after it was originally put forward : if not , then the european council has to find other ways ahead .
we 'll have to see whether any country is going to pull out , or whether there 'll have to be a new dialogue with any of them .
but i believe we can only do that if we have a change both in policy and in atmosphere - otherwise the french people wo n't be willing to follow us then either . bildunterschrift : a woman walks past " yes " and " no " campaign posters for france 's referendum on the european union constitution in may , 2005 . you 're saying , then , that the double " no " means that we need a different policy change in europe ? we have to take this seriously because the citizens were n't against the constitution per se .
the constitution makes everything more transparent - you wo n't be able to make decisions behind closed doors anymore - and citizens ' rights , democracy and the authority of the national parliaments vis-à-vis the eu will all be strengthened .
if we go back to the nice treaty again , then the distance between the eu and its citizens will grow even more .
we have to have dialogue - but we do n't have to decide everything .
we do n't have to regulate everything in europe , and especially not in a way that contradicts the principles of competitiveness .
and we also have to make it clear that europe has borders , because people are feeling overwhelmed . european citizens in france and the netherlands said " no , " but the first thing we hear from brussels is " we 'll keep on , " so , we 'll keep on ratifying : is that really the right response to the " non and " née ? " well , i think it 's right that the process of ratification should continue and that the other peoples should be consulted in accordance with their own constitutions .
but the process will only be successful if the consolidation phase i have described really does happen and the people feel that we politicians have received and understood this message . now , let 's assume that perhaps not just five but seven countries say no : would that bury the constitution ? then it really will be as dead as a dodo .
and i fear the european union will then be in a real crisis situation - because of the decision-making apparatus and because we will , in the long run , still be so detached that there will be less and less support for the european ideal . could you imagine renegotiating the constitution treaty piecemeal to meet some countries halfway ? it has to be dealt with the same way in each country .
we 've now got 11 countries which have ratified it .
we 'd have to start from scratch again . is n't that a pandora 's box ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : socialist party supporters celebrate in amsterdam , netherlands , after the announcement of preliminary results of the referendum on the proposed european union constitution .
dutch voters overwhelmingly rejected the treaty .
it really is a pandora 's box : but we 've got a breakdown of the vote which shows how mixed the messages from france were .
le pen and the far right sent a completely different message to the left wing , who were talking about a great social europe .
that , in turn , put the british and scandinavians off .
we have to emphasize that , in a federation of 25 countries , not everyone will be able to specify exactly what he wants to have . europe is in crisis and one should n't just ask what to do but who should actually do it ?
it 's a very unusual situation : the french president amongst the ashes his presidency ; the german chancellor - the other half of the franco-german engine - weakened by new elections ; tony blair re-elected but also probably on the way ; berlusconi in difficulties ; things in poland unclear .
who exactly is going to pull the european carriage out of the ditch ? well , firstly , having managed to make such a mess , these gentlemen now have a chance to mount a rescue attempt as their swan-song : for example , they could quickly agree on financial prospects for the next seven years and thereby demonstrate their competence . secondly , : the leadership of europe is up for grabs and it should be the job of the european commission to take care of that as jaques delors once did .
the commission president jose manuel barroso needs to get on with it . is he strong enough ? he knows exactly what 's at stake .
i have the impression that he only needs the will - and to see - that he has a central role to play . for perhaps the first time in the last ten years , you can not ignore the real scepticism about europe right across the political spectrum .
various things are behind it : fear of globalization , fear of the franco-german directorate . where does this euroscepticism come from ?

but the process will only be successful if the consolidation phase i have described really does happen and the people feel that we politicians have received and understood this message . now , let 's assume that perhaps not just five but seven countries say no : would that bury the constitution ? then it really will be as dead as a dodo .
and i fear the european union will then be in a real crisis situation - because of the decision-making apparatus and because we will , in the long run , still be so detached that there will be less and less support for the european ideal . could you imagine renegotiating the constitution treaty piecemeal to meet some countries halfway ? it has to be dealt with the same way in each country .

it really is a pandora 's box : but we 've got a breakdown of the vote which shows how mixed the messages from france were .

it 's a very unusual situation : the french president amongst the ashes his presidency ; the german chancellor - the other half of the franco-german engine - weakened by new elections ; tony blair re-elected but also probably on the way ; berlusconi in difficulties ; things in poland unclear .
who exactly is going to pull the european carriage out of the ditch ? well , firstly , having managed to make such a mess , these gentlemen now have a chance to mount a rescue attempt as their swan-song : for example , they could quickly agree on financial prospects for the next seven years and thereby demonstrate their competence . secondly , : the leadership of europe is up for grabs and it should be the job of the european commission to take care of that as jaques delors once did .
the commission president jose manuel barroso needs to get on with it . is he strong enough ? he knows exactly what 's at stake .
i have the impression that he only needs the will - and to see - that he has a central role to play . for perhaps the first time in the last ten years , you can not ignore the real scepticism about europe right across the political spectrum .
various things are behind it : fear of globalization , fear of the franco-german directorate . where does this euroscepticism come from ?
is the brussels dreamboat , for example , a bit too far above people 's heads ? yes , on the one hand , you have to realize that this is a scepticism about politics as a whole , because at least half the motivation for the " no " in both countries had its roots in domestic politics .

people believe more and more outsiders are coming in while there 's already 10- 12 percent unemployment and they think they are going to take their jobs - and at the same time , they see that in the context of the negotiations with turkey .
all this has had disastrous psychological consequences , especially when politicians did not set out to win people over . i mean , the politicians should have known this : they always say , europe is too expensive and the commission did this or that without asking us , although they all agreed to it . if your policies on europe are always going to follow the same pattern where , in the first sentence , you say " i 'm in favor of europe " and then you come up with three pages blaming your failures on the eu , well , then there 's the problem .
i do n't think the german government 's policies are much different to those of other countries : " when the sun shines , it was berlin , when it rains , it was brussels . " does expansion have to stop ? i think so . in two weeks , 25 heads of state and government will meet for what could be a crisis summit .
from an mep 's perspective , what signal should it send europe 's citizens ? it would be great if they could manage to sort out the future finances .
it would give a boost by demonstrating competence .
also , they have to say to the people : " we have got your message .

and if they really manage to do that , in the next 12 months we will be able to approach the people with the continuing process of ratification , because they will say that the constitution is o.k. and that the leaders have learnt how to deal with such a constitution properly . europe should be more modest ? yes , it has to be more modest : we should have more confidence in the people .

there have been " nos " before - from denmark or ireland over the maastricht and nice treaties , for example .
but the constitution is especially significant and of course the french " no " in particular carries a lot of weight .
if you look at the type of discussions which are now going on , you start to worry that we 're walking on quicksand , and there 's nothing you can do about it . but you get the impression it 's not just hyperbole - after this double " no , " europe seems almost paralyzed . we have to recognize that the constitution was already too late .
it should have happened before the european union took in the ten new members last year .
the 25-strong eu wo n't work with the current body of legislation , because the decision-making processes are so complicated and so difficult . everyone said that , if one country rejected the constitution , then it would n't happen at all , so is n't it already dead as a dodo ? no , not if we handle it properly .
in the draft constitution , it says 20 states have to sign it by october 2006 , two years after it was originally put forward : if not , then the european council has to find other ways ahead .
we 'll have to see whether any country is going to pull out , or whether there 'll have to be a new dialogue with any of them .
but i believe we can only do that if we have a change both in policy and in atmosphere - otherwise the french people wo n't be willing to follow us then either . bildunterschrift : a woman walks past " yes " and " no " campaign posters for france 's referendum on the european union constitution in may , 2005 . you 're saying , then , that the double " no " means that we need a different policy change in europe ? we have to take this seriously because the citizens were n't against the constitution per se .
the constitution makes everything more transparent - you wo n't be able to make decisions behind closed doors anymore - and citizens ' rights , democracy and the authority of the national parliaments vis-à-vis the eu will all be strengthened .
if we go back to the nice treaty again , then the distance between the eu and its citizens will grow even more .
we have to have dialogue - but we do n't have to decide everything .
we do n't have to regulate everything in europe , and especially not in a way that contradicts the principles of competitiveness .
and we also have to make it clear that europe has borders , because people are feeling overwhelmed . european citizens in france and the netherlands said " no , " but the first thing we hear from brussels is " we 'll keep on , " so , we 'll keep on ratifying : is that really the right response to the " non and " née ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 04.06.2005 crisis talks to assess eu charter wreckage großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saving the new eu treaty will top saturday night 's agenda german chancellor schröder will meet french president chirac for a working dinner in berlin saturday to salvage the eu 's constitution after dutch and french voters categorically rejected the new charter this week . despite the resounding blow dealt to the document by the two eu founder members , the german chancellor is eager to see the ratification process to continue in the remaining countries of the 25-nation bloc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac warmly received schröder earlier in may in paris .
thus , it 's unlikely gerhard schröder will waste much time consoling his close friend jacques chirac for the failed referendum in france . the german chancellor is in a defiant mood now that dutch and french voters have rejected the new eu charter and plunged the european union into severe crisis .
one day ahead of his meeting with jacques chirac in berlin , schröder vowed to press ahead towards the goal of a fully-fledged constitution . " i will not accept attempts to stop the entire project simply because two countries rejected it , " he said .
" germany has adopted the constitution as well as a number of other countries .
only at the end of the ratification process will we be able to decide what to do next .
that is why any form of overreaction is totally misplaced . " a tricky situation yet the two leaders are in a dilemma .
stopping the ratification process is apparently unacceptable to the german chancellor .
a renegotiation of the treaty or new votes in the countries opposed to it has also been widely ruled out . what may come under discussion during the crisis talks are ways to extract key provisions in the treaty such as streamlining the eu voting system and establishing the post of an eu foreign minister so that are not subject to referendums . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people hold up the eu flag during a rally through the streets of warsaw , sunday may 15 , 2005 .
another possibility would be to continue with the ratification process and assess the situation at the end of it in 2006 .
berlin appears to be placing some hope on a much-underrated annex to the constitution treaty which allows for an eu summit meeting to discuss further steps if at least 20 of the 25 eu members have ratified the charter . german foreign minister joschka fischer also believes that the constitution treaty is not dead as yet . " i don ’ t think that there is a better treaty to be found anywhere , " fischer said .
" so we have to work hard to rescue it .
obviously we have to put some of our foreign policy objectives on hold for the time being , because of the eu ’ s internal problems , but the world wo n't just stand by and wait for us . " dipping popularity at home as chirac and schröder form a common , pro-constitution front when they sit down to their working dinner in berlin , they might also reflect that they share something else - plummeting popularity ratings at home . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel schröder 's social democrats suffered a devastating defeat in a state election last month , prompting him to call for a general election this september , 12 months ahead of schedule .
opinion polls show he will lose to the conservative opposition christian democrats of angela merkel -lrb- photo -rrb- . chirac meanwhile suffered the humiliation of seeing his people ignore his appeals for them to ratify the constitution and spent the week looking , to many analysts , like a lame duck president . the " no " vote forced him into a government reshuffle , promoting former health minister philippe douste-blazy to foreign minister . douste-blazy was candid about the future , saying : " we are obviously in a difficult situation after two negative referendums . " chirac 's spokesman meanwhile said he would use the brussels summit to assure his eu colleagues of france 's commitment to the bloc and its " anchoring within the union " in the coming weeks . schröder 's new flexibility in an attempt to pour oil into troubled waters , gerhard schröder has already signaled flexibility in an ongoing row over eu financing which has pitted net contributors to the budget against recipients .
although no details were given by the chancellor , a deal could include a rise in german eu contributions beyond the current 1 percent of gross national product . schröder ’ s new flexibility could perhaps include concessions towards britain which enjoys a rebate from eu coffers that most members want scrapped .
it wouldn ’ t be the first time that germany has sought to buy europe out of its troubles and it ’ s a prospect that could even keep prime minister tony blair from canceling the british referendum and declaring the constitution dead once and for all . blair will meet schröder in berlin on june 13 . uwe hessler -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder 's shuttle diplomacy to save eu germany forced the pace friday as european leaders scrambled to resolve the deep political crisis over the eu constitution , with chancellor gerhard schröder scheduling a series of meetings with eu leaders .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 04.06.2005 germany popular with foreign students großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a growing number of foreign faces in germany 's lecture halls universities and politicians are repeatedly complaining that germany 's smartest brains are packing up and leaving to study and research abroad .
but a study shows the country is gaining a growing number of foreign brains . knowledge is international .
for precisely this reason , germany has become a significant hub of learning , said education and research minister edelgard bulmahn .
" germany belongs to the winners in the race for the smartest heads , " bulmahn said .
" in the 1990s , we had an alarming brain drain in germany .
since 2001 , we 've managed to achieve a turn of the tide . "
according to a study by the german student services studentenwerk , every tenth student in germany comes from abroad .
this makes germany just as attractive a place to study as britain .
the percentage of foreign students is even higher than in the united states .
the number of foreign students has increased since the 1990s from 150,000 to some 230,000 , the study said .
asian interest in german institutions german universities are probably also so popular because there are no tuition fees .
this is a reason why so many students from developing countries and newly industrializing nations come to germany .
a strong increase in interest in german universities is especially noticeable from asia .
" we have really managed to attract a significantly larger share of students from regions which are booming economically , " bulmahn said .
" these are our future trade partners and these students are the ambassadors which we need in those countries . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign students are increasingly filling german university libraries at the same time , 15 percent of the more than 1.7 million german students spend at least part of their studies abroad .
this makes them generally more mobile than their counterparts from britain , australia or the united states .
bulmahn said this " welcome development " was somewhat marred , however .
despite reforms , children from socially weak families were still neglected for foreign study .
only 55,000 germans go abroad solely for studying .
brain drain to germany still , the minister takes a positive stock of the matter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education and research minister edelgard bulmahn has been keen to attract more brainpower to germany " the mobility of german students can be seen worldwide , as well as the increase in the number of foreign students here , " bulmahn said .
" in addition , we are attracting more scientists from abroad every year since the german government has created the general conditions for an internationally competitive research base . "
the controversial junior professorship had helped stop the brain drain , she said .
this position enables up-and-coming scientists to teach and research independently sooner if they can present an outstanding dissertation .
the federal government supports these posts with an average of 60,000 euros -lrb- $ 73,640 -rrb- per position .
the junior professorship has attracted talented foreign up-and-coming scientists to germany and also brought young top german researchers back home .
so , if at all , there can only be talk of brain drain to germany . karin kails -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de paying for european research the eu has over 400 funding programs , many of which are dedicated to particular fields of research ranging from nuclear science to bee keeping .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 04.06.2005 crisis talks to assess eu charter wreckage großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saving the new eu treaty will top saturday night 's agenda german chancellor schröder will meet french president chirac for a working dinner in berlin saturday to salvage the eu 's constitution after dutch and french voters categorically rejected the new charter this week . despite the resounding blow dealt to the document by the two eu founder members , the german chancellor is eager to see the ratification process to continue in the remaining countries of the 25-nation bloc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac warmly received schröder earlier in may in paris .
thus , it 's unlikely gerhard schröder will waste much time consoling his close friend jacques chirac for the failed referendum in france . the german chancellor is in a defiant mood now that dutch and french voters have rejected the new eu charter and plunged the european union into severe crisis .
one day ahead of his meeting with jacques chirac in berlin , schröder vowed to press ahead towards the goal of a fully-fledged constitution . " i will not accept attempts to stop the entire project simply because two countries rejected it , " he said .
" germany has adopted the constitution as well as a number of other countries .
only at the end of the ratification process will we be able to decide what to do next .
that is why any form of overreaction is totally misplaced . " a tricky situation yet the two leaders are in a dilemma .
stopping the ratification process is apparently unacceptable to the german chancellor .
a renegotiation of the treaty or new votes in the countries opposed to it has also been widely ruled out . what may come under discussion during the crisis talks are ways to extract key provisions in the treaty such as streamlining the eu voting system and establishing the post of an eu foreign minister so that are not subject to referendums . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people hold up the eu flag during a rally through the streets of warsaw , sunday may 15 , 2005 .
another possibility would be to continue with the ratification process and assess the situation at the end of it in 2006 .
berlin appears to be placing some hope on a much-underrated annex to the constitution treaty which allows for an eu summit meeting to discuss further steps if at least 20 of the 25 eu members have ratified the charter . german foreign minister joschka fischer also believes that the constitution treaty is not dead as yet . " i don ’ t think that there is a better treaty to be found anywhere , " fischer said .
" so we have to work hard to rescue it .
obviously we have to put some of our foreign policy objectives on hold for the time being , because of the eu ’ s internal problems , but the world wo n't just stand by and wait for us . " dipping popularity at home as chirac and schröder form a common , pro-constitution front when they sit down to their working dinner in berlin , they might also reflect that they share something else - plummeting popularity ratings at home . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel schröder 's social democrats suffered a devastating defeat in a state election last month , prompting him to call for a general election this september , 12 months ahead of schedule .
opinion polls show he will lose to the conservative opposition christian democrats of angela merkel -lrb- photo -rrb- . chirac meanwhile suffered the humiliation of seeing his people ignore his appeals for them to ratify the constitution and spent the week looking , to many analysts , like a lame duck president . the " no " vote forced him into a government reshuffle , promoting former health minister philippe douste-blazy to foreign minister . douste-blazy was candid about the future , saying : " we are obviously in a difficult situation after two negative referendums . " chirac 's spokesman meanwhile said he would use the brussels summit to assure his eu colleagues of france 's commitment to the bloc and its " anchoring within the union " in the coming weeks . schröder 's new flexibility in an attempt to pour oil into troubled waters , gerhard schröder has already signaled flexibility in an ongoing row over eu financing which has pitted net contributors to the budget against recipients .
although no details were given by the chancellor , a deal could include a rise in german eu contributions beyond the current 1 percent of gross national product . schröder ’ s new flexibility could perhaps include concessions towards britain which enjoys a rebate from eu coffers that most members want scrapped .
it wouldn ’ t be the first time that germany has sought to buy europe out of its troubles and it ’ s a prospect that could even keep prime minister tony blair from canceling the british referendum and declaring the constitution dead once and for all . blair will meet schröder in berlin on june 13 . uwe hessler -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder 's shuttle diplomacy to save eu germany forced the pace friday as european leaders scrambled to resolve the deep political crisis over the eu constitution , with chancellor gerhard schröder scheduling a series of meetings with eu leaders .
-lrb- june 3 , 2005 -rrb- europe 's motor plans emergency summit germany and france , for so long the driving force behind european integration , will hold an emergency summit this weekend to discuss the crisis unfolding after the french and dutch rejection of the eu constitution .
-lrb- june 2 , 2005 -rrb- eu in agony after constitution fiasco europe agonized over the eu constitution 's future thursday after dutch voters rejected it wednesday .
while some fear that the " no " could all but bury the treaty , most eu leaders said its ratification should continue .
-lrb- june 2 , 2005 -rrb- feedback do you think the planned emergency meet between chirac and schröder , leaders of europe 's so-called motor , will be successful in stemming the growing eu-scepticism in the bloc ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 04.06.2005 germany popular with foreign students großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a growing number of foreign faces in germany 's lecture halls universities and politicians are repeatedly complaining that germany 's smartest brains are packing up and leaving to study and research abroad .
but a study shows the country is gaining a growing number of foreign brains . knowledge is international .
for precisely this reason , germany has become a significant hub of learning , said education and research minister edelgard bulmahn .
" germany belongs to the winners in the race for the smartest heads , " bulmahn said .
" in the 1990s , we had an alarming brain drain in germany .
since 2001 , we 've managed to achieve a turn of the tide . "
according to a study by the german student services studentenwerk , every tenth student in germany comes from abroad .
this makes germany just as attractive a place to study as britain .
the percentage of foreign students is even higher than in the united states .
the number of foreign students has increased since the 1990s from 150,000 to some 230,000 , the study said .
asian interest in german institutions german universities are probably also so popular because there are no tuition fees .
this is a reason why so many students from developing countries and newly industrializing nations come to germany .
a strong increase in interest in german universities is especially noticeable from asia .
" we have really managed to attract a significantly larger share of students from regions which are booming economically , " bulmahn said .
" these are our future trade partners and these students are the ambassadors which we need in those countries . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign students are increasingly filling german university libraries at the same time , 15 percent of the more than 1.7 million german students spend at least part of their studies abroad .
this makes them generally more mobile than their counterparts from britain , australia or the united states .
bulmahn said this " welcome development " was somewhat marred , however .
despite reforms , children from socially weak families were still neglected for foreign study .
only 55,000 germans go abroad solely for studying .
brain drain to germany still , the minister takes a positive stock of the matter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education and research minister edelgard bulmahn has been keen to attract more brainpower to germany " the mobility of german students can be seen worldwide , as well as the increase in the number of foreign students here , " bulmahn said .
" in addition , we are attracting more scientists from abroad every year since the german government has created the general conditions for an internationally competitive research base . "
the controversial junior professorship had helped stop the brain drain , she said .
this position enables up-and-coming scientists to teach and research independently sooner if they can present an outstanding dissertation .
the federal government supports these posts with an average of 60,000 euros -lrb- $ 73,640 -rrb- per position .
the junior professorship has attracted talented foreign up-and-coming scientists to germany and also brought young top german researchers back home .
so , if at all , there can only be talk of brain drain to germany . karin kails -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de paying for european research the eu has over 400 funding programs , many of which are dedicated to particular fields of research ranging from nuclear science to bee keeping .

" if the constitution does not come into effect , we remain with the treaty of nice , and the whole of europe agrees that nice was not sufficient for enlargement , " martin schulz , head of the socialist group in the european parliament , told the süddeutsche zeitung . voters in france and the netherlands rejected the constitution in referendums during the past seven days .
romania and bulgaria are due to enter the eu in 2007 and turkey is seeking membership . in the same newspaper klaus hansch , a german social democrat and former president of the parliament , said that european citizens were " very sceptical about a new enlargement " adding that the prospect of turkish membership had played " a very major role " in the " no " votes in france and the netherlands . " europe needs a phase of consolidation which will last much longer than five years , " he said . germans increasingly against treaty the statements come amid a rash of unofficial surveys in the country which show that a rising number of germans are increasingly skeptical of the new embattled eu constitution - a fact that 's being attributed to the lack of a real referendum on the treaty in germany .

thus , it 's unlikely gerhard schröder will waste much time consoling his close friend jacques chirac for the failed referendum in france . the german chancellor is in a defiant mood now that dutch and french voters have rejected the new eu charter and plunged the european union into severe crisis .
one day ahead of his meeting with jacques chirac in berlin , schröder vowed to press ahead towards the goal of a fully-fledged constitution . " i will not accept attempts to stop the entire project simply because two countries rejected it , " he said .
" germany has adopted the constitution as well as a number of other countries .
only at the end of the ratification process will we be able to decide what to do next .
that is why any form of overreaction is totally misplaced . " a tricky situation yet the two leaders are in a dilemma .
stopping the ratification process is apparently unacceptable to the german chancellor .
a renegotiation of the treaty or new votes in the countries opposed to it has also been widely ruled out . what may come under discussion during the crisis talks are ways to extract key provisions in the treaty such as streamlining the eu voting system and establishing the post of an eu foreign minister so that are not subject to referendums . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people hold up the eu flag during a rally through the streets of warsaw , sunday may 15 , 2005 .
another possibility would be to continue with the ratification process and assess the situation at the end of it in 2006 .
berlin appears to be placing some hope on a much-underrated annex to the constitution treaty which allows for an eu summit meeting to discuss further steps if at least 20 of the 25 eu members have ratified the charter . german foreign minister joschka fischer also believes that the constitution treaty is not dead as yet . " i don ’ t think that there is a better treaty to be found anywhere , " fischer said .
" so we have to work hard to rescue it .
obviously we have to put some of our foreign policy objectives on hold for the time being , because of the eu ’ s internal problems , but the world wo n't just stand by and wait for us .

opinion polls show he will lose to the conservative opposition christian democrats of angela merkel -lrb- photo -rrb- . chirac meanwhile suffered the humiliation of seeing his people ignore his appeals for them to ratify the constitution and spent the week looking , to many analysts , like a lame duck president . the " no " vote forced him into a government reshuffle , promoting former health minister philippe douste-blazy to foreign minister . douste-blazy was candid about the future , saying : " we are obviously in a difficult situation after two negative referendums . " chirac 's spokesman meanwhile said he would use the brussels summit to assure his eu colleagues of france 's commitment to the bloc and its " anchoring within the union " in the coming weeks . schröder 's new flexibility in an attempt to pour oil into troubled waters , gerhard schröder has already signaled flexibility in an ongoing row over eu financing which has pitted net contributors to the budget against recipients .
although no details were given by the chancellor , a deal could include a rise in german eu contributions beyond the current 1 percent of gross national product . schröder ’ s new flexibility could perhaps include concessions towards britain which enjoys a rebate from eu coffers that most members want scrapped .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 04.06.2005 " europe has to be more modest " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is caught in a cul-de-sac over its new constitution elmar brok , conservative european mep and member of the convention which drew up the eu charter told dw-tv that it should have been approved before expansion and warned the eu had to take note of its citizens ' concerns . dw : mr brok , you are almost part of the political landscape in both brussels and europe - is the european union going through its biggest ever crisis after the two " no " in the referendums in france and the netherlands ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elmar brok elmar brok : no , technically speaking , it 's not the biggest crisis .
there have been " nos " before - from denmark or ireland over the maastricht and nice treaties , for example .
but the constitution is especially significant and of course the french " no " in particular carries a lot of weight .
if you look at the type of discussions which are now going on , you start to worry that we 're walking on quicksand , and there 's nothing you can do about it . but you get the impression it 's not just hyperbole - after this double " no , " europe seems almost paralyzed . we have to recognize that the constitution was already too late .
it should have happened before the european union took in the ten new members last year .
the 25-strong eu wo n't work with the current body of legislation , because the decision-making processes are so complicated and so difficult . everyone said that , if one country rejected the constitution , then it would n't happen at all , so is n't it already dead as a dodo ? no , not if we handle it properly .
in the draft constitution , it says 20 states have to sign it by october 2006 , two years after it was originally put forward : if not , then the european council has to find other ways ahead .
we 'll have to see whether any country is going to pull out , or whether there 'll have to be a new dialogue with any of them .
but i believe we can only do that if we have a change both in policy and in atmosphere - otherwise the french people wo n't be willing to follow us then either . bildunterschrift : a woman walks past " yes " and " no " campaign posters for france 's referendum on the european union constitution in may , 2005 . you 're saying , then , that the double " no " means that we need a different policy change in europe ? we have to take this seriously because the citizens were n't against the constitution per se .
the constitution makes everything more transparent - you wo n't be able to make decisions behind closed doors anymore - and citizens ' rights , democracy and the authority of the national parliaments vis-à-vis the eu will all be strengthened .
if we go back to the nice treaty again , then the distance between the eu and its citizens will grow even more .
we have to have dialogue - but we do n't have to decide everything .
we do n't have to regulate everything in europe , and especially not in a way that contradicts the principles of competitiveness .
and we also have to make it clear that europe has borders , because people are feeling overwhelmed . european citizens in france and the netherlands said " no , " but the first thing we hear from brussels is " we 'll keep on , " so , we 'll keep on ratifying : is that really the right response to the " non and " née ? " well , i think it 's right that the process of ratification should continue and that the other peoples should be consulted in accordance with their own constitutions .
but the process will only be successful if the consolidation phase i have described really does happen and the people feel that we politicians have received and understood this message . now , let 's assume that perhaps not just five but seven countries say no : would that bury the constitution ? then it really will be as dead as a dodo .
and i fear the european union will then be in a real crisis situation - because of the decision-making apparatus and because we will , in the long run , still be so detached that there will be less and less support for the european ideal . could you imagine renegotiating the constitution treaty piecemeal to meet some countries halfway ? it has to be dealt with the same way in each country .
we 've now got 11 countries which have ratified it .
we 'd have to start from scratch again . is n't that a pandora 's box ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : socialist party supporters celebrate in amsterdam , netherlands , after the announcement of preliminary results of the referendum on the proposed european union constitution .
dutch voters overwhelmingly rejected the treaty .
it really is a pandora 's box : but we 've got a breakdown of the vote which shows how mixed the messages from france were .
le pen and the far right sent a completely different message to the left wing , who were talking about a great social europe .
that , in turn , put the british and scandinavians off .
we have to emphasize that , in a federation of 25 countries , not everyone will be able to specify exactly what he wants to have . europe is in crisis and one should n't just ask what to do but who should actually do it ?
it 's a very unusual situation : the french president amongst the ashes his presidency ; the german chancellor - the other half of the franco-german engine - weakened by new elections ; tony blair re-elected but also probably on the way ; berlusconi in difficulties ; things in poland unclear .
who exactly is going to pull the european carriage out of the ditch ? well , firstly , having managed to make such a mess , these gentlemen now have a chance to mount a rescue attempt as their swan-song : for example , they could quickly agree on financial prospects for the next seven years and thereby demonstrate their competence . secondly , : the leadership of europe is up for grabs and it should be the job of the european commission to take care of that as jaques delors once did .
the commission president jose manuel barroso needs to get on with it . is he strong enough ? he knows exactly what 's at stake .
i have the impression that he only needs the will - and to see - that he has a central role to play . for perhaps the first time in the last ten years , you can not ignore the real scepticism about europe right across the political spectrum .
various things are behind it : fear of globalization , fear of the franco-german directorate . where does this euroscepticism come from ?
is the brussels dreamboat , for example , a bit too far above people 's heads ? yes , on the one hand , you have to realize that this is a scepticism about politics as a whole , because at least half the motivation for the " no " in both countries had its roots in domestic politics .
the belgian government only has the support of 19 percent of the voters , and raffarin and chirac 's popularity is stellar , to put it ironically . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dark clouds hover over the eu but on the other hand , we have to admit that we did n't explain that eu expansion had political and economic advantages .
people believe more and more outsiders are coming in while there 's already 10- 12 percent unemployment and they think they are going to take their jobs - and at the same time , they see that in the context of the negotiations with turkey .
all this has had disastrous psychological consequences , especially when politicians did not set out to win people over . i mean , the politicians should have known this : they always say , europe is too expensive and the commission did this or that without asking us , although they all agreed to it . if your policies on europe are always going to follow the same pattern where , in the first sentence , you say " i 'm in favor of europe " and then you come up with three pages blaming your failures on the eu , well , then there 's the problem .
i do n't think the german government 's policies are much different to those of other countries : " when the sun shines , it was berlin , when it rains , it was brussels . " does expansion have to stop ? i think so . in two weeks , 25 heads of state and government will meet for what could be a crisis summit .
from an mep 's perspective , what signal should it send europe 's citizens ? it would be great if they could manage to sort out the future finances .
it would give a boost by demonstrating competence .
also , they have to say to the people : " we have got your message .
we have to do some things differently . "
and if they really manage to do that , in the next 12 months we will be able to approach the people with the continuing process of ratification , because they will say that the constitution is o.k. and that the leaders have learnt how to deal with such a constitution properly . europe should be more modest ? yes , it has to be more modest : we should have more confidence in the people .
and we have to recognize one thing in particular : in a democracy , objective reality is n't reality , it 's what people see as reality .
and if we politicians ca n't accept that , then we 've been trying to sell a pig in a poke . the interview was conducted by alexander kudascheff send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de crisis talks to assess eu charter wreckage german chancellor schröder will meet french president chirac for a working dinner in berlin saturday to salvage the eu 's constitution after dutch and french voters categorically rejected the new charter this week .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 04.06.2005 " europe has to be more modest " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is caught in a cul-de-sac over its new constitution elmar brok , conservative european mep and member of the convention which drew up the eu charter told dw-tv that it should have been approved before expansion and warned the eu had to take note of its citizens ' concerns . dw : mr brok , you are almost part of the political landscape in both brussels and europe - is the european union going through its biggest ever crisis after the two " no " in the referendums in france and the netherlands ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elmar brok elmar brok : no , technically speaking , it 's not the biggest crisis .
there have been " nos " before - from denmark or ireland over the maastricht and nice treaties , for example .
but the constitution is especially significant and of course the french " no " in particular carries a lot of weight .
if you look at the type of discussions which are now going on , you start to worry that we 're walking on quicksand , and there 's nothing you can do about it . but you get the impression it 's not just hyperbole - after this double " no , " europe seems almost paralyzed . we have to recognize that the constitution was already too late .
it should have happened before the european union took in the ten new members last year .
the 25-strong eu wo n't work with the current body of legislation , because the decision-making processes are so complicated and so difficult . everyone said that , if one country rejected the constitution , then it would n't happen at all , so is n't it already dead as a dodo ? no , not if we handle it properly .
in the draft constitution , it says 20 states have to sign it by october 2006 , two years after it was originally put forward : if not , then the european council has to find other ways ahead .
we 'll have to see whether any country is going to pull out , or whether there 'll have to be a new dialogue with any of them .
but i believe we can only do that if we have a change both in policy and in atmosphere - otherwise the french people wo n't be willing to follow us then either . bildunterschrift : a woman walks past " yes " and " no " campaign posters for france 's referendum on the european union constitution in may , 2005 . you 're saying , then , that the double " no " means that we need a different policy change in europe ? we have to take this seriously because the citizens were n't against the constitution per se .
the constitution makes everything more transparent - you wo n't be able to make decisions behind closed doors anymore - and citizens ' rights , democracy and the authority of the national parliaments vis-à-vis the eu will all be strengthened .
if we go back to the nice treaty again , then the distance between the eu and its citizens will grow even more .
we have to have dialogue - but we do n't have to decide everything .
we do n't have to regulate everything in europe , and especially not in a way that contradicts the principles of competitiveness .
and we also have to make it clear that europe has borders , because people are feeling overwhelmed . european citizens in france and the netherlands said " no , " but the first thing we hear from brussels is " we 'll keep on , " so , we 'll keep on ratifying : is that really the right response to the " non and " née ? " well , i think it 's right that the process of ratification should continue and that the other peoples should be consulted in accordance with their own constitutions .
but the process will only be successful if the consolidation phase i have described really does happen and the people feel that we politicians have received and understood this message . now , let 's assume that perhaps not just five but seven countries say no : would that bury the constitution ? then it really will be as dead as a dodo .
and i fear the european union will then be in a real crisis situation - because of the decision-making apparatus and because we will , in the long run , still be so detached that there will be less and less support for the european ideal . could you imagine renegotiating the constitution treaty piecemeal to meet some countries halfway ? it has to be dealt with the same way in each country .
we 've now got 11 countries which have ratified it .
we 'd have to start from scratch again . is n't that a pandora 's box ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : socialist party supporters celebrate in amsterdam , netherlands , after the announcement of preliminary results of the referendum on the proposed european union constitution .
dutch voters overwhelmingly rejected the treaty .

" an emotional reaction is always possible , " said yves christen , head of the swiss pro-eu movement , nomes . polling booths were already open in some parts of the country friday while most postal ballots - a large proportion of votes many areas - had already been cast .
the result is due on sunday . swiss hostile to closer eu ties christen was counting on a 51 to 55 percent " yes " vote in a country that traditionally has shown suspicion if not outright hostility to closer ties with the eu in recent decades . swiss voters , who have the final say on key legislation several times a year , narrowly rejected a broad economic agreement with brussels in 1992 after a heated campaign . another motion by pro-eu campaigners in 2001 calling for eu membership talks was swept aside by 77 percent of voters .

the schengen area , named after a small town in luxembourg where the treaty was signed in 1985 , now includes 13 eu states , as well as iceland and norway . the agreement abolishes systematic identity checks on travelers within the area and provides for a common visa in return for stronger controls on the area 's outer fringe , as well as closer cooperation between police forces . schengen 's swiss opponents say that amounts to giving up a chunk of their sovereignty to brussels .

" the svp is preying on people 's fears , " said didier berberat , a socialist party mp . while access to schengen 's computerized crime database is prized by most police unions in switzerland , it is loathed by swiss left-wingers who oppose the step into the area . " no would mean durable isolation " for many swiss living near austria , france , germany and italy , the outcome will make little difference . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : customs checks on imports and shopping baskets will remain , while many smaller borders posts have already been deserted and given way to random checks .
pro-europeans are eyeing sunday 's result as a guide to the climate in switzerland before another referendum in september . swiss voters are due to give their verdict on the extension of an agreement on the free movement of labor to the eu 's 10 new member states , at the very moment when political debate in western europe is beset by fears about cheaper competition from the east . " if the ' yes ' -lrb- to schengen -rrb- wins , it will be encouraging for the referendum on free movement .

but the show goes much further than that . along berlin ’ s boulevard unter den linden , a series of bright red letters " e " have been installed .
they represent " einstein , " " energy " or " e = mc ² " in places associated with the scientist 's life in the german capital .
these red letters are intended to draw attention to one of the highlights of germany 's current einstein year : the exhibition " chief engineer of the universe . "
it introduces visitors to various competing views in understanding our world .
for the max planck institute for the history of science , which organized the show , albert einstein 's key role in shaping the world view on fundamental questions of the nature of space , gravitation and the invisible forces of magnetism , radiation and electricity makes him the " chief engineer of the universe . "
the feel of a modern laboratory the institute 's professor jürgen renn does not intend to relate a hero 's tale , though .
he says the exhibition " is more an exercise in presenting the adventure of scientific research and its history in an attractive and understandable style . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the exhibit wants to create a certain atmosphere " sure , that 's a challenge , " said renn .
" we 've tried to create an atmosphere , which can also be grasped aesthetically . "
he said the organizers had created something like a giant modern laboratory .
" entering that , the visitor feels the bustle , but also the inquisitiveness that drives these scientists , " said renn .
" these are emotional qualities , which we have tried to put into practice . "
more than just einstein 's face the exhibition is a giant laboratory on three floors .
historic experiments have been set up with original tools .
curious views into the sub-atomic world are made accessible in dark studios .
einstein himself explains scientific advances in original film footage .
for the show , the institute collected more than 1,000 exhibits from around the world .
contemporary documents are on display , some of which have never been published before .
at one point in the exhibition , the audience is suddenly blinded by bright light and left alone in a white room .
exhibition organizer stefan iglhaut explained that this is about looking at the world in a different way .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is probably the most famous photograph of einstein " i think this is an unusual way to make einstein understandable and interesting , " said iglhaut .
" we 're not only explaining his theories , but also finding metaphors and pictures which impress our audience .
we want them to take home more than just einstein 's face . "
everybody knows his face : the weird old guy with the gray mop of hair sticking his tongue out at the world .
but the exhibition communicates the historical context of einstein 's influence and the special challenges which arose for him as a human being and as a scientist .
a desk with a history einstein 's life is illuminated against the background of the political and social upheavals of his time .
visitors follow him from his childhood in the middle-class world of the family electrical business , through his time in switzerland , to the tense world of the jewry caught between anti-semitism and new zionist beginnings .
in 1933 , einstein 's books were burnt by germans just outside the museum .
in the same year , einstein emigrated to the united states , where he experienced " a tense atmosphere of fortified democracy and political mistrust , " said renn .
renn 's favorite exhibit is einstein 's desk .
" he had to leave it behind in berlin when the nazis forced him to emigrate , " he said .
" the french ambassador helped him to have it transferred to his office in princeton .
since then , this is the first time this very moving piece of furniture with its dramatic history has made it back to germany . "
it 's rather unspectacular : a simple , fairly small wooden desk .
but here einstein worked to change the world .
in 1905 , his " special theory of relativity " revolutionized our understanding of space and time , while e = mc ² became the most famous equation in physics .
einstein succeeded in moving young and old einstein once said it was important to never stop asking .
" one can not help but marvel reverently at the secrets of eternity , life and the wonderful structure of reality , " the famous scientist said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors can also see einstein 's impact on the world today throughout the exhibition , more than 50 multimedia stations encourage visitors to ask their own questions .
it concludes with einstein 's impact on today 's science and culture .
twenty-four seats are arranged along a white conference table .
one after another , today 's leading scientists give their views on the " secrets of eternity , life and the wonderful structure of reality . "
einstein , his colleagues and this exhibition have succeeded in moving young and old .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 04.06.2005 exploring einstein 's laboratory großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he has become a cult figure , not only in the world of science an exhibition organized by the max planck institute in berlin pays tribute to the scientist 100 years after he published his theory of relativity and 50 years since his death .
but the show goes much further than that . along berlin ’ s boulevard unter den linden , a series of bright red letters " e " have been installed .
they represent " einstein , " " energy " or " e = mc ² " in places associated with the scientist 's life in the german capital .
these red letters are intended to draw attention to one of the highlights of germany 's current einstein year : the exhibition " chief engineer of the universe . "
it introduces visitors to various competing views in understanding our world .
for the max planck institute for the history of science , which organized the show , albert einstein 's key role in shaping the world view on fundamental questions of the nature of space , gravitation and the invisible forces of magnetism , radiation and electricity makes him the " chief engineer of the universe . "
the feel of a modern laboratory the institute 's professor jürgen renn does not intend to relate a hero 's tale , though .
he says the exhibition " is more an exercise in presenting the adventure of scientific research and its history in an attractive and understandable style . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the exhibit wants to create a certain atmosphere " sure , that 's a challenge , " said renn .
" we 've tried to create an atmosphere , which can also be grasped aesthetically . "
he said the organizers had created something like a giant modern laboratory .
" entering that , the visitor feels the bustle , but also the inquisitiveness that drives these scientists , " said renn .
" these are emotional qualities , which we have tried to put into practice . "
more than just einstein 's face the exhibition is a giant laboratory on three floors .
historic experiments have been set up with original tools .
curious views into the sub-atomic world are made accessible in dark studios .
einstein himself explains scientific advances in original film footage .
for the show , the institute collected more than 1,000 exhibits from around the world .
contemporary documents are on display , some of which have never been published before .
at one point in the exhibition , the audience is suddenly blinded by bright light and left alone in a white room .
exhibition organizer stefan iglhaut explained that this is about looking at the world in a different way .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is probably the most famous photograph of einstein " i think this is an unusual way to make einstein understandable and interesting , " said iglhaut .
" we 're not only explaining his theories , but also finding metaphors and pictures which impress our audience .
we want them to take home more than just einstein 's face . "
everybody knows his face : the weird old guy with the gray mop of hair sticking his tongue out at the world .
but the exhibition communicates the historical context of einstein 's influence and the special challenges which arose for him as a human being and as a scientist .
a desk with a history einstein 's life is illuminated against the background of the political and social upheavals of his time .
visitors follow him from his childhood in the middle-class world of the family electrical business , through his time in switzerland , to the tense world of the jewry caught between anti-semitism and new zionist beginnings .
in 1933 , einstein 's books were burnt by germans just outside the museum .
in the same year , einstein emigrated to the united states , where he experienced " a tense atmosphere of fortified democracy and political mistrust , " said renn .
renn 's favorite exhibit is einstein 's desk .
" he had to leave it behind in berlin when the nazis forced him to emigrate , " he said .
" the french ambassador helped him to have it transferred to his office in princeton .
since then , this is the first time this very moving piece of furniture with its dramatic history has made it back to germany . "
it 's rather unspectacular : a simple , fairly small wooden desk .
but here einstein worked to change the world .
in 1905 , his " special theory of relativity " revolutionized our understanding of space and time , while e = mc ² became the most famous equation in physics .
einstein succeeded in moving young and old einstein once said it was important to never stop asking .
" one can not help but marvel reverently at the secrets of eternity , life and the wonderful structure of reality , " the famous scientist said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors can also see einstein 's impact on the world today throughout the exhibition , more than 50 multimedia stations encourage visitors to ask their own questions .
it concludes with einstein 's impact on today 's science and culture .
twenty-four seats are arranged along a white conference table .
one after another , today 's leading scientists give their views on the " secrets of eternity , life and the wonderful structure of reality . "
einstein , his colleagues and this exhibition have succeeded in moving young and old .
the success of this exhibition is that it maintains a balance between historical reflection on successive changes in world views , information on the life and work of albert einstein - the " chief engineer of the universe " - and how these themes relate to challenges that we face today . peter zimmermann -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de following in einstein 's footsteps as part of the " einstein year " , which the 50th anniversary of the death of the physicist and the 100th jubilee of the relativity theory , enthusiasts can trace the path of the genius across germany .

there have been " nos " before - from denmark or ireland over the maastricht and nice treaties , for example .
but the constitution is especially significant and of course the french " no " in particular carries a lot of weight .
if you look at the type of discussions which are now going on , you start to worry that we 're walking on quicksand , and there 's nothing you can do about it . but you get the impression it 's not just hyperbole - after this double " no , " europe seems almost paralyzed . we have to recognize that the constitution was already too late .
it should have happened before the european union took in the ten new members last year .
the 25-strong eu wo n't work with the current body of legislation , because the decision-making processes are so complicated and so difficult . everyone said that , if one country rejected the constitution , then it would n't happen at all , so is n't it already dead as a dodo ? no , not if we handle it properly .
in the draft constitution , it says 20 states have to sign it by october 2006 , two years after it was originally put forward : if not , then the european council has to find other ways ahead .
we 'll have to see whether any country is going to pull out , or whether there 'll have to be a new dialogue with any of them .
but i believe we can only do that if we have a change both in policy and in atmosphere - otherwise the french people wo n't be willing to follow us then either . bildunterschrift : a woman walks past " yes " and " no " campaign posters for france 's referendum on the european union constitution in may , 2005 . you 're saying , then , that the double " no " means that we need a different policy change in europe ? we have to take this seriously because the citizens were n't against the constitution per se .
the constitution makes everything more transparent - you wo n't be able to make decisions behind closed doors anymore - and citizens ' rights , democracy and the authority of the national parliaments vis-à-vis the eu will all be strengthened .
if we go back to the nice treaty again , then the distance between the eu and its citizens will grow even more .
we have to have dialogue - but we do n't have to decide everything .
we do n't have to regulate everything in europe , and especially not in a way that contradicts the principles of competitiveness .
and we also have to make it clear that europe has borders , because people are feeling overwhelmed . european citizens in france and the netherlands said " no , " but the first thing we hear from brussels is " we 'll keep on , " so , we 'll keep on ratifying : is that really the right response to the " non and " née ? " well , i think it 's right that the process of ratification should continue and that the other peoples should be consulted in accordance with their own constitutions .
but the process will only be successful if the consolidation phase i have described really does happen and the people feel that we politicians have received and understood this message . now , let 's assume that perhaps not just five but seven countries say no : would that bury the constitution ? then it really will be as dead as a dodo .
and i fear the european union will then be in a real crisis situation - because of the decision-making apparatus and because we will , in the long run , still be so detached that there will be less and less support for the european ideal . could you imagine renegotiating the constitution treaty piecemeal to meet some countries halfway ? it has to be dealt with the same way in each country .
we 've now got 11 countries which have ratified it .
we 'd have to start from scratch again . is n't that a pandora 's box ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : socialist party supporters celebrate in amsterdam , netherlands , after the announcement of preliminary results of the referendum on the proposed european union constitution .
dutch voters overwhelmingly rejected the treaty .
it really is a pandora 's box : but we 've got a breakdown of the vote which shows how mixed the messages from france were .
le pen and the far right sent a completely different message to the left wing , who were talking about a great social europe .
that , in turn , put the british and scandinavians off .
we have to emphasize that , in a federation of 25 countries , not everyone will be able to specify exactly what he wants to have . europe is in crisis and one should n't just ask what to do but who should actually do it ?
it 's a very unusual situation : the french president amongst the ashes his presidency ; the german chancellor - the other half of the franco-german engine - weakened by new elections ; tony blair re-elected but also probably on the way ; berlusconi in difficulties ; things in poland unclear .
who exactly is going to pull the european carriage out of the ditch ? well , firstly , having managed to make such a mess , these gentlemen now have a chance to mount a rescue attempt as their swan-song : for example , they could quickly agree on financial prospects for the next seven years and thereby demonstrate their competence . secondly , : the leadership of europe is up for grabs and it should be the job of the european commission to take care of that as jaques delors once did .
the commission president jose manuel barroso needs to get on with it . is he strong enough ? he knows exactly what 's at stake .
i have the impression that he only needs the will - and to see - that he has a central role to play . for perhaps the first time in the last ten years , you can not ignore the real scepticism about europe right across the political spectrum .
various things are behind it : fear of globalization , fear of the franco-german directorate . where does this euroscepticism come from ?
is the brussels dreamboat , for example , a bit too far above people 's heads ? yes , on the one hand , you have to realize that this is a scepticism about politics as a whole , because at least half the motivation for the " no " in both countries had its roots in domestic politics .
the belgian government only has the support of 19 percent of the voters , and raffarin and chirac 's popularity is stellar , to put it ironically . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dark clouds hover over the eu but on the other hand , we have to admit that we did n't explain that eu expansion had political and economic advantages .
people believe more and more outsiders are coming in while there 's already 10- 12 percent unemployment and they think they are going to take their jobs - and at the same time , they see that in the context of the negotiations with turkey .
all this has had disastrous psychological consequences , especially when politicians did not set out to win people over . i mean , the politicians should have known this : they always say , europe is too expensive and the commission did this or that without asking us , although they all agreed to it . if your policies on europe are always going to follow the same pattern where , in the first sentence , you say " i 'm in favor of europe " and then you come up with three pages blaming your failures on the eu , well , then there 's the problem .
i do n't think the german government 's policies are much different to those of other countries : " when the sun shines , it was berlin , when it rains , it was brussels . " does expansion have to stop ? i think so . in two weeks , 25 heads of state and government will meet for what could be a crisis summit .
from an mep 's perspective , what signal should it send europe 's citizens ? it would be great if they could manage to sort out the future finances .
it would give a boost by demonstrating competence .
also , they have to say to the people : " we have got your message .
we have to do some things differently . "
and if they really manage to do that , in the next 12 months we will be able to approach the people with the continuing process of ratification , because they will say that the constitution is o.k. and that the leaders have learnt how to deal with such a constitution properly . europe should be more modest ? yes , it has to be more modest : we should have more confidence in the people .
and we have to recognize one thing in particular : in a democracy , objective reality is n't reality , it 's what people see as reality .
and if we politicians ca n't accept that , then we 've been trying to sell a pig in a poke . the interview was conducted by alexander kudascheff send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de crisis talks to assess eu charter wreckage german chancellor schröder will meet french president chirac for a working dinner in berlin saturday to salvage the eu 's constitution after dutch and french voters categorically rejected the new charter this week .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 04.06.2005 " europe has to be more modest " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is caught in a cul-de-sac over its new constitution elmar brok , conservative european mep and member of the convention which drew up the eu charter told dw-tv that it should have been approved before expansion and warned the eu had to take note of its citizens ' concerns . dw : mr brok , you are almost part of the political landscape in both brussels and europe - is the european union going through its biggest ever crisis after the two " no " in the referendums in france and the netherlands ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elmar brok elmar brok : no , technically speaking , it 's not the biggest crisis .
there have been " nos " before - from denmark or ireland over the maastricht and nice treaties , for example .
but the constitution is especially significant and of course the french " no " in particular carries a lot of weight .
if you look at the type of discussions which are now going on , you start to worry that we 're walking on quicksand , and there 's nothing you can do about it . but you get the impression it 's not just hyperbole - after this double " no , " europe seems almost paralyzed . we have to recognize that the constitution was already too late .
it should have happened before the european union took in the ten new members last year .
the 25-strong eu wo n't work with the current body of legislation , because the decision-making processes are so complicated and so difficult . everyone said that , if one country rejected the constitution , then it would n't happen at all , so is n't it already dead as a dodo ? no , not if we handle it properly .
in the draft constitution , it says 20 states have to sign it by october 2006 , two years after it was originally put forward : if not , then the european council has to find other ways ahead .
we 'll have to see whether any country is going to pull out , or whether there 'll have to be a new dialogue with any of them .
but i believe we can only do that if we have a change both in policy and in atmosphere - otherwise the french people wo n't be willing to follow us then either . bildunterschrift : a woman walks past " yes " and " no " campaign posters for france 's referendum on the european union constitution in may , 2005 . you 're saying , then , that the double " no " means that we need a different policy change in europe ? we have to take this seriously because the citizens were n't against the constitution per se .
the constitution makes everything more transparent - you wo n't be able to make decisions behind closed doors anymore - and citizens ' rights , democracy and the authority of the national parliaments vis-à-vis the eu will all be strengthened .
if we go back to the nice treaty again , then the distance between the eu and its citizens will grow even more .
we have to have dialogue - but we do n't have to decide everything .
we do n't have to regulate everything in europe , and especially not in a way that contradicts the principles of competitiveness .
and we also have to make it clear that europe has borders , because people are feeling overwhelmed . european citizens in france and the netherlands said " no , " but the first thing we hear from brussels is " we 'll keep on , " so , we 'll keep on ratifying : is that really the right response to the " non and " née ? " well , i think it 's right that the process of ratification should continue and that the other peoples should be consulted in accordance with their own constitutions .
but the process will only be successful if the consolidation phase i have described really does happen and the people feel that we politicians have received and understood this message . now , let 's assume that perhaps not just five but seven countries say no : would that bury the constitution ? then it really will be as dead as a dodo .
and i fear the european union will then be in a real crisis situation - because of the decision-making apparatus and because we will , in the long run , still be so detached that there will be less and less support for the european ideal . could you imagine renegotiating the constitution treaty piecemeal to meet some countries halfway ? it has to be dealt with the same way in each country .
we 've now got 11 countries which have ratified it .
we 'd have to start from scratch again . is n't that a pandora 's box ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : socialist party supporters celebrate in amsterdam , netherlands , after the announcement of preliminary results of the referendum on the proposed european union constitution .
dutch voters overwhelmingly rejected the treaty .
it really is a pandora 's box : but we 've got a breakdown of the vote which shows how mixed the messages from france were .
le pen and the far right sent a completely different message to the left wing , who were talking about a great social europe .
that , in turn , put the british and scandinavians off .
we have to emphasize that , in a federation of 25 countries , not everyone will be able to specify exactly what he wants to have . europe is in crisis and one should n't just ask what to do but who should actually do it ?
it 's a very unusual situation : the french president amongst the ashes his presidency ; the german chancellor - the other half of the franco-german engine - weakened by new elections ; tony blair re-elected but also probably on the way ; berlusconi in difficulties ; things in poland unclear .
who exactly is going to pull the european carriage out of the ditch ? well , firstly , having managed to make such a mess , these gentlemen now have a chance to mount a rescue attempt as their swan-song : for example , they could quickly agree on financial prospects for the next seven years and thereby demonstrate their competence . secondly , : the leadership of europe is up for grabs and it should be the job of the european commission to take care of that as jaques delors once did .
the commission president jose manuel barroso needs to get on with it . is he strong enough ? he knows exactly what 's at stake .
i have the impression that he only needs the will - and to see - that he has a central role to play . for perhaps the first time in the last ten years , you can not ignore the real scepticism about europe right across the political spectrum .
various things are behind it : fear of globalization , fear of the franco-german directorate . where does this euroscepticism come from ?
is the brussels dreamboat , for example , a bit too far above people 's heads ? yes , on the one hand , you have to realize that this is a scepticism about politics as a whole , because at least half the motivation for the " no " in both countries had its roots in domestic politics .
the belgian government only has the support of 19 percent of the voters , and raffarin and chirac 's popularity is stellar , to put it ironically . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dark clouds hover over the eu but on the other hand , we have to admit that we did n't explain that eu expansion had political and economic advantages .
people believe more and more outsiders are coming in while there 's already 10- 12 percent unemployment and they think they are going to take their jobs - and at the same time , they see that in the context of the negotiations with turkey .
all this has had disastrous psychological consequences , especially when politicians did not set out to win people over . i mean , the politicians should have known this : they always say , europe is too expensive and the commission did this or that without asking us , although they all agreed to it . if your policies on europe are always going to follow the same pattern where , in the first sentence , you say " i 'm in favor of europe " and then you come up with three pages blaming your failures on the eu , well , then there 's the problem .
i do n't think the german government 's policies are much different to those of other countries : " when the sun shines , it was berlin , when it rains , it was brussels . " does expansion have to stop ? i think so . in two weeks , 25 heads of state and government will meet for what could be a crisis summit .
from an mep 's perspective , what signal should it send europe 's citizens ? it would be great if they could manage to sort out the future finances .
it would give a boost by demonstrating competence .
also , they have to say to the people : " we have got your message .
we have to do some things differently . "
and if they really manage to do that , in the next 12 months we will be able to approach the people with the continuing process of ratification , because they will say that the constitution is o.k. and that the leaders have learnt how to deal with such a constitution properly . europe should be more modest ? yes , it has to be more modest : we should have more confidence in the people .
and we have to recognize one thing in particular : in a democracy , objective reality is n't reality , it 's what people see as reality .
and if we politicians ca n't accept that , then we 've been trying to sell a pig in a poke . the interview was conducted by alexander kudascheff send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de crisis talks to assess eu charter wreckage german chancellor schröder will meet french president chirac for a working dinner in berlin saturday to salvage the eu 's constitution after dutch and french voters categorically rejected the new charter this week .

thus , it 's unlikely gerhard schröder will waste much time consoling his close friend jacques chirac for the failed referendum in france . the german chancellor is in a defiant mood now that dutch and french voters have rejected the new eu charter and plunged the european union into severe crisis .
one day ahead of his meeting with jacques chirac in berlin , schröder vowed to press ahead towards the goal of a fully-fledged constitution . " i will not accept attempts to stop the entire project simply because two countries rejected it , " he said .
" germany has adopted the constitution as well as a number of other countries .
only at the end of the ratification process will we be able to decide what to do next .
that is why any form of overreaction is totally misplaced . " a tricky situation yet the two leaders are in a dilemma .
stopping the ratification process is apparently unacceptable to the german chancellor .
a renegotiation of the treaty or new votes in the countries opposed to it has also been widely ruled out . what may come under discussion during the crisis talks are ways to extract key provisions in the treaty such as streamlining the eu voting system and establishing the post of an eu foreign minister so that are not subject to referendums . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people hold up the eu flag during a rally through the streets of warsaw , sunday may 15 , 2005 .
another possibility would be to continue with the ratification process and assess the situation at the end of it in 2006 .
berlin appears to be placing some hope on a much-underrated annex to the constitution treaty which allows for an eu summit meeting to discuss further steps if at least 20 of the 25 eu members have ratified the charter . german foreign minister joschka fischer also believes that the constitution treaty is not dead as yet . " i don ’ t think that there is a better treaty to be found anywhere , " fischer said .
" so we have to work hard to rescue it .
obviously we have to put some of our foreign policy objectives on hold for the time being , because of the eu ’ s internal problems , but the world wo n't just stand by and wait for us .

" chirac 's spokesman meanwhile said he would use the brussels summit to assure his eu colleagues of france 's commitment to the bloc and its " anchoring within the union " in the coming weeks . schröder 's new flexibility in an attempt to pour oil into troubled waters , gerhard schröder has already signaled flexibility in an ongoing row over eu financing which has pitted net contributors to the budget against recipients .

thus , it 's unlikely gerhard schröder will waste much time consoling his close friend jacques chirac for the failed referendum in france . the german chancellor is in a defiant mood now that dutch and french voters have rejected the new eu charter and plunged the european union into severe crisis .
one day ahead of his meeting with jacques chirac in berlin , schröder vowed to press ahead towards the goal of a fully-fledged constitution . " i will not accept attempts to stop the entire project simply because two countries rejected it , " he said .
" germany has adopted the constitution as well as a number of other countries .
only at the end of the ratification process will we be able to decide what to do next .

stopping the ratification process is apparently unacceptable to the german chancellor .
a renegotiation of the treaty or new votes in the countries opposed to it has also been widely ruled out . what may come under discussion during the crisis talks are ways to extract key provisions in the treaty such as streamlining the eu voting system and establishing the post of an eu foreign minister so that are not subject to referendums . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people hold up the eu flag during a rally through the streets of warsaw , sunday may 15 , 2005 .

berlin appears to be placing some hope on a much-underrated annex to the constitution treaty which allows for an eu summit meeting to discuss further steps if at least 20 of the 25 eu members have ratified the charter . german foreign minister joschka fischer also believes that the constitution treaty is not dead as yet . " i don ’ t think that there is a better treaty to be found anywhere , " fischer said .
" so we have to work hard to rescue it .
obviously we have to put some of our foreign policy objectives on hold for the time being , because of the eu ’ s internal problems , but the world wo n't just stand by and wait for us .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 04.06.2005 exploring einstein 's laboratory großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he has become a cult figure , not only in the world of science an exhibition organized by the max planck institute in berlin pays tribute to the scientist 100 years after he published his theory of relativity and 50 years since his death .
but the show goes much further than that . along berlin ’ s boulevard unter den linden , a series of bright red letters " e " have been installed .
they represent " einstein , " " energy " or " e = mc ² " in places associated with the scientist 's life in the german capital .
these red letters are intended to draw attention to one of the highlights of germany 's current einstein year : the exhibition " chief engineer of the universe . "
it introduces visitors to various competing views in understanding our world .
for the max planck institute for the history of science , which organized the show , albert einstein 's key role in shaping the world view on fundamental questions of the nature of space , gravitation and the invisible forces of magnetism , radiation and electricity makes him the " chief engineer of the universe . "
the feel of a modern laboratory the institute 's professor jürgen renn does not intend to relate a hero 's tale , though .
he says the exhibition " is more an exercise in presenting the adventure of scientific research and its history in an attractive and understandable style . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the exhibit wants to create a certain atmosphere " sure , that 's a challenge , " said renn .
" we 've tried to create an atmosphere , which can also be grasped aesthetically . "
he said the organizers had created something like a giant modern laboratory .
" entering that , the visitor feels the bustle , but also the inquisitiveness that drives these scientists , " said renn .
" these are emotional qualities , which we have tried to put into practice . "
more than just einstein 's face the exhibition is a giant laboratory on three floors .
historic experiments have been set up with original tools .
curious views into the sub-atomic world are made accessible in dark studios .
einstein himself explains scientific advances in original film footage .
for the show , the institute collected more than 1,000 exhibits from around the world .
contemporary documents are on display , some of which have never been published before .
at one point in the exhibition , the audience is suddenly blinded by bright light and left alone in a white room .
exhibition organizer stefan iglhaut explained that this is about looking at the world in a different way .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is probably the most famous photograph of einstein " i think this is an unusual way to make einstein understandable and interesting , " said iglhaut .
" we 're not only explaining his theories , but also finding metaphors and pictures which impress our audience .
we want them to take home more than just einstein 's face . "
everybody knows his face : the weird old guy with the gray mop of hair sticking his tongue out at the world .
but the exhibition communicates the historical context of einstein 's influence and the special challenges which arose for him as a human being and as a scientist .
a desk with a history einstein 's life is illuminated against the background of the political and social upheavals of his time .
visitors follow him from his childhood in the middle-class world of the family electrical business , through his time in switzerland , to the tense world of the jewry caught between anti-semitism and new zionist beginnings .
in 1933 , einstein 's books were burnt by germans just outside the museum .
in the same year , einstein emigrated to the united states , where he experienced " a tense atmosphere of fortified democracy and political mistrust , " said renn .
renn 's favorite exhibit is einstein 's desk .
" he had to leave it behind in berlin when the nazis forced him to emigrate , " he said .
" the french ambassador helped him to have it transferred to his office in princeton .
since then , this is the first time this very moving piece of furniture with its dramatic history has made it back to germany . "
it 's rather unspectacular : a simple , fairly small wooden desk .
but here einstein worked to change the world .
in 1905 , his " special theory of relativity " revolutionized our understanding of space and time , while e = mc ² became the most famous equation in physics .
einstein succeeded in moving young and old einstein once said it was important to never stop asking .
" one can not help but marvel reverently at the secrets of eternity , life and the wonderful structure of reality , " the famous scientist said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors can also see einstein 's impact on the world today throughout the exhibition , more than 50 multimedia stations encourage visitors to ask their own questions .
it concludes with einstein 's impact on today 's science and culture .
twenty-four seats are arranged along a white conference table .
one after another , today 's leading scientists give their views on the " secrets of eternity , life and the wonderful structure of reality . "
einstein , his colleagues and this exhibition have succeeded in moving young and old .
the success of this exhibition is that it maintains a balance between historical reflection on successive changes in world views , information on the life and work of albert einstein - the " chief engineer of the universe " - and how these themes relate to challenges that we face today . peter zimmermann -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de following in einstein 's footsteps as part of the " einstein year " , which the 50th anniversary of the death of the physicist and the 100th jubilee of the relativity theory , enthusiasts can trace the path of the genius across germany .

" an emotional reaction is always possible , " said yves christen , head of the swiss pro-eu movement , nomes . polling booths were already open in some parts of the country friday while most postal ballots - a large proportion of votes many areas - had already been cast .
the result is due on sunday . swiss hostile to closer eu ties christen was counting on a 51 to 55 percent " yes " vote in a country that traditionally has shown suspicion if not outright hostility to closer ties with the eu in recent decades . swiss voters , who have the final say on key legislation several times a year , narrowly rejected a broad economic agreement with brussels in 1992 after a heated campaign . another motion by pro-eu campaigners in 2001 calling for eu membership talks was swept aside by 77 percent of voters .
instead , the swiss have approved a host of specialized accords with the eu to ease trade , labor , educational and technical ties in recent years . fear of loss of sovereignty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the entry to the town of schengen in luxembourg .
the schengen area , named after a small town in luxembourg where the treaty was signed in 1985 , now includes 13 eu states , as well as iceland and norway . the agreement abolishes systematic identity checks on travelers within the area and provides for a common visa in return for stronger controls on the area 's outer fringe , as well as closer cooperation between police forces . schengen 's swiss opponents say that amounts to giving up a chunk of their sovereignty to brussels . " we do n't trust an organization that ca n't manage to resolve its enormous internal problems , " said hans fehr , a parliamentarian for the right-wing swiss people 's party -lrb- svp -rrb- and head of an isolationist lobby group , the association for a neutral and independent switzerland -lrb- auns -rrb- . with the vote also covering membership of the eu 's dublin agreement on handling asylum seekers , lurid anti-schengen campaign leaflets have raised fears of rising crime and job losses to illicit immigrant labor . with the exception of the svp , all the major political parties are supporting the step into schengen , which has already been approved by parliament . " the svp is preying on people 's fears , " said didier berberat , a socialist party mp . while access to schengen 's computerized crime database is prized by most police unions in switzerland , it is loathed by swiss left-wingers who oppose the step into the area . " no would mean durable isolation " for many swiss living near austria , france , germany and italy , the outcome will make little difference . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : customs checks on imports and shopping baskets will remain , while many smaller borders posts have already been deserted and given way to random checks .
pro-europeans are eyeing sunday 's result as a guide to the climate in switzerland before another referendum in september . swiss voters are due to give their verdict on the extension of an agreement on the free movement of labor to the eu 's 10 new member states , at the very moment when political debate in western europe is beset by fears about cheaper competition from the east . " if the ' yes ' -lrb- to schengen -rrb- wins , it will be encouraging for the referendum on free movement .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 04.06.2005 exploring einstein 's laboratory großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he has become a cult figure , not only in the world of science an exhibition organized by the max planck institute in berlin pays tribute to the scientist 100 years after he published his theory of relativity and 50 years since his death .
but the show goes much further than that . along berlin ’ s boulevard unter den linden , a series of bright red letters " e " have been installed .
they represent " einstein , " " energy " or " e = mc ² " in places associated with the scientist 's life in the german capital .
these red letters are intended to draw attention to one of the highlights of germany 's current einstein year : the exhibition " chief engineer of the universe . "
it introduces visitors to various competing views in understanding our world .
for the max planck institute for the history of science , which organized the show , albert einstein 's key role in shaping the world view on fundamental questions of the nature of space , gravitation and the invisible forces of magnetism , radiation and electricity makes him the " chief engineer of the universe . "
the feel of a modern laboratory the institute 's professor jürgen renn does not intend to relate a hero 's tale , though .
he says the exhibition " is more an exercise in presenting the adventure of scientific research and its history in an attractive and understandable style . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the exhibit wants to create a certain atmosphere " sure , that 's a challenge , " said renn .
" we 've tried to create an atmosphere , which can also be grasped aesthetically . "
he said the organizers had created something like a giant modern laboratory .
" entering that , the visitor feels the bustle , but also the inquisitiveness that drives these scientists , " said renn .
" these are emotional qualities , which we have tried to put into practice . "
more than just einstein 's face the exhibition is a giant laboratory on three floors .
historic experiments have been set up with original tools .
curious views into the sub-atomic world are made accessible in dark studios .
einstein himself explains scientific advances in original film footage .
for the show , the institute collected more than 1,000 exhibits from around the world .
contemporary documents are on display , some of which have never been published before .
at one point in the exhibition , the audience is suddenly blinded by bright light and left alone in a white room .
exhibition organizer stefan iglhaut explained that this is about looking at the world in a different way .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is probably the most famous photograph of einstein " i think this is an unusual way to make einstein understandable and interesting , " said iglhaut .
" we 're not only explaining his theories , but also finding metaphors and pictures which impress our audience .
we want them to take home more than just einstein 's face . "
everybody knows his face : the weird old guy with the gray mop of hair sticking his tongue out at the world .
but the exhibition communicates the historical context of einstein 's influence and the special challenges which arose for him as a human being and as a scientist .
a desk with a history einstein 's life is illuminated against the background of the political and social upheavals of his time .
visitors follow him from his childhood in the middle-class world of the family electrical business , through his time in switzerland , to the tense world of the jewry caught between anti-semitism and new zionist beginnings .
in 1933 , einstein 's books were burnt by germans just outside the museum .
in the same year , einstein emigrated to the united states , where he experienced " a tense atmosphere of fortified democracy and political mistrust , " said renn .
renn 's favorite exhibit is einstein 's desk .
" he had to leave it behind in berlin when the nazis forced him to emigrate , " he said .
" the french ambassador helped him to have it transferred to his office in princeton .
since then , this is the first time this very moving piece of furniture with its dramatic history has made it back to germany . "
it 's rather unspectacular : a simple , fairly small wooden desk .
but here einstein worked to change the world .
in 1905 , his " special theory of relativity " revolutionized our understanding of space and time , while e = mc ² became the most famous equation in physics .
einstein succeeded in moving young and old einstein once said it was important to never stop asking .
" one can not help but marvel reverently at the secrets of eternity , life and the wonderful structure of reality , " the famous scientist said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors can also see einstein 's impact on the world today throughout the exhibition , more than 50 multimedia stations encourage visitors to ask their own questions .
it concludes with einstein 's impact on today 's science and culture .
twenty-four seats are arranged along a white conference table .
one after another , today 's leading scientists give their views on the " secrets of eternity , life and the wonderful structure of reality . "
einstein , his colleagues and this exhibition have succeeded in moving young and old .
the success of this exhibition is that it maintains a balance between historical reflection on successive changes in world views , information on the life and work of albert einstein - the " chief engineer of the universe " - and how these themes relate to challenges that we face today . peter zimmermann -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de following in einstein 's footsteps as part of the " einstein year " , which the 50th anniversary of the death of the physicist and the 100th jubilee of the relativity theory , enthusiasts can trace the path of the genius across germany .

thus , it 's unlikely gerhard schröder will waste much time consoling his close friend jacques chirac for the failed referendum in france . the german chancellor is in a defiant mood now that dutch and french voters have rejected the new eu charter and plunged the european union into severe crisis .
one day ahead of his meeting with jacques chirac in berlin , schröder vowed to press ahead towards the goal of a fully-fledged constitution . " i will not accept attempts to stop the entire project simply because two countries rejected it , " he said .
" germany has adopted the constitution as well as a number of other countries .
only at the end of the ratification process will we be able to decide what to do next .
that is why any form of overreaction is totally misplaced . " a tricky situation yet the two leaders are in a dilemma .
stopping the ratification process is apparently unacceptable to the german chancellor .
a renegotiation of the treaty or new votes in the countries opposed to it has also been widely ruled out . what may come under discussion during the crisis talks are ways to extract key provisions in the treaty such as streamlining the eu voting system and establishing the post of an eu foreign minister so that are not subject to referendums . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people hold up the eu flag during a rally through the streets of warsaw , sunday may 15 , 2005 .
another possibility would be to continue with the ratification process and assess the situation at the end of it in 2006 .
berlin appears to be placing some hope on a much-underrated annex to the constitution treaty which allows for an eu summit meeting to discuss further steps if at least 20 of the 25 eu members have ratified the charter . german foreign minister joschka fischer also believes that the constitution treaty is not dead as yet . " i don ’ t think that there is a better treaty to be found anywhere , " fischer said .
" so we have to work hard to rescue it .
obviously we have to put some of our foreign policy objectives on hold for the time being , because of the eu ’ s internal problems , but the world wo n't just stand by and wait for us . " dipping popularity at home as chirac and schröder form a common , pro-constitution front when they sit down to their working dinner in berlin , they might also reflect that they share something else - plummeting popularity ratings at home . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel schröder 's social democrats suffered a devastating defeat in a state election last month , prompting him to call for a general election this september , 12 months ahead of schedule .
opinion polls show he will lose to the conservative opposition christian democrats of angela merkel -lrb- photo -rrb- . chirac meanwhile suffered the humiliation of seeing his people ignore his appeals for them to ratify the constitution and spent the week looking , to many analysts , like a lame duck president . the " no " vote forced him into a government reshuffle , promoting former health minister philippe douste-blazy to foreign minister . douste-blazy was candid about the future , saying : " we are obviously in a difficult situation after two negative referendums . " chirac 's spokesman meanwhile said he would use the brussels summit to assure his eu colleagues of france 's commitment to the bloc and its " anchoring within the union " in the coming weeks . schröder 's new flexibility in an attempt to pour oil into troubled waters , gerhard schröder has already signaled flexibility in an ongoing row over eu financing which has pitted net contributors to the budget against recipients .
although no details were given by the chancellor , a deal could include a rise in german eu contributions beyond the current 1 percent of gross national product . schröder ’ s new flexibility could perhaps include concessions towards britain which enjoys a rebate from eu coffers that most members want scrapped .
it wouldn ’ t be the first time that germany has sought to buy europe out of its troubles and it ’ s a prospect that could even keep prime minister tony blair from canceling the british referendum and declaring the constitution dead once and for all . blair will meet schröder in berlin on june 13 . uwe hessler -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder 's shuttle diplomacy to save eu germany forced the pace friday as european leaders scrambled to resolve the deep political crisis over the eu constitution , with chancellor gerhard schröder scheduling a series of meetings with eu leaders .

thus , it 's unlikely gerhard schröder will waste much time consoling his close friend jacques chirac for the failed referendum in france . the german chancellor is in a defiant mood now that dutch and french voters have rejected the new eu charter and plunged the european union into severe crisis .
one day ahead of his meeting with jacques chirac in berlin , schröder vowed to press ahead towards the goal of a fully-fledged constitution . " i will not accept attempts to stop the entire project simply because two countries rejected it , " he said .
" germany has adopted the constitution as well as a number of other countries .
only at the end of the ratification process will we be able to decide what to do next .
that is why any form of overreaction is totally misplaced . " a tricky situation yet the two leaders are in a dilemma .
stopping the ratification process is apparently unacceptable to the german chancellor .
a renegotiation of the treaty or new votes in the countries opposed to it has also been widely ruled out . what may come under discussion during the crisis talks are ways to extract key provisions in the treaty such as streamlining the eu voting system and establishing the post of an eu foreign minister so that are not subject to referendums . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people hold up the eu flag during a rally through the streets of warsaw , sunday may 15 , 2005 .
another possibility would be to continue with the ratification process and assess the situation at the end of it in 2006 .
berlin appears to be placing some hope on a much-underrated annex to the constitution treaty which allows for an eu summit meeting to discuss further steps if at least 20 of the 25 eu members have ratified the charter . german foreign minister joschka fischer also believes that the constitution treaty is not dead as yet . " i don ’ t think that there is a better treaty to be found anywhere , " fischer said .
" so we have to work hard to rescue it .

there have been " nos " before - from denmark or ireland over the maastricht and nice treaties , for example .
but the constitution is especially significant and of course the french " no " in particular carries a lot of weight .
if you look at the type of discussions which are now going on , you start to worry that we 're walking on quicksand , and there 's nothing you can do about it . but you get the impression it 's not just hyperbole - after this double " no , " europe seems almost paralyzed . we have to recognize that the constitution was already too late .
it should have happened before the european union took in the ten new members last year .
the 25-strong eu wo n't work with the current body of legislation , because the decision-making processes are so complicated and so difficult . everyone said that , if one country rejected the constitution , then it would n't happen at all , so is n't it already dead as a dodo ? no , not if we handle it properly .
in the draft constitution , it says 20 states have to sign it by october 2006 , two years after it was originally put forward : if not , then the european council has to find other ways ahead .
we 'll have to see whether any country is going to pull out , or whether there 'll have to be a new dialogue with any of them .
but i believe we can only do that if we have a change both in policy and in atmosphere - otherwise the french people wo n't be willing to follow us then either . bildunterschrift : a woman walks past " yes " and " no " campaign posters for france 's referendum on the european union constitution in may , 2005 . you 're saying , then , that the double " no " means that we need a different policy change in europe ? we have to take this seriously because the citizens were n't against the constitution per se .
the constitution makes everything more transparent - you wo n't be able to make decisions behind closed doors anymore - and citizens ' rights , democracy and the authority of the national parliaments vis-à-vis the eu will all be strengthened .
if we go back to the nice treaty again , then the distance between the eu and its citizens will grow even more .
we have to have dialogue - but we do n't have to decide everything .
we do n't have to regulate everything in europe , and especially not in a way that contradicts the principles of competitiveness .
and we also have to make it clear that europe has borders , because people are feeling overwhelmed . european citizens in france and the netherlands said " no , " but the first thing we hear from brussels is " we 'll keep on , " so , we 'll keep on ratifying : is that really the right response to the " non and " née ? " well , i think it 's right that the process of ratification should continue and that the other peoples should be consulted in accordance with their own constitutions .
but the process will only be successful if the consolidation phase i have described really does happen and the people feel that we politicians have received and understood this message . now , let 's assume that perhaps not just five but seven countries say no : would that bury the constitution ? then it really will be as dead as a dodo .
and i fear the european union will then be in a real crisis situation - because of the decision-making apparatus and because we will , in the long run , still be so detached that there will be less and less support for the european ideal . could you imagine renegotiating the constitution treaty piecemeal to meet some countries halfway ? it has to be dealt with the same way in each country .
we 've now got 11 countries which have ratified it .
we 'd have to start from scratch again . is n't that a pandora 's box ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : socialist party supporters celebrate in amsterdam , netherlands , after the announcement of preliminary results of the referendum on the proposed european union constitution .
dutch voters overwhelmingly rejected the treaty .
it really is a pandora 's box : but we 've got a breakdown of the vote which shows how mixed the messages from france were .
le pen and the far right sent a completely different message to the left wing , who were talking about a great social europe .
that , in turn , put the british and scandinavians off .
we have to emphasize that , in a federation of 25 countries , not everyone will be able to specify exactly what he wants to have . europe is in crisis and one should n't just ask what to do but who should actually do it ?
it 's a very unusual situation : the french president amongst the ashes his presidency ; the german chancellor - the other half of the franco-german engine - weakened by new elections ; tony blair re-elected but also probably on the way ; berlusconi in difficulties ; things in poland unclear .
who exactly is going to pull the european carriage out of the ditch ? well , firstly , having managed to make such a mess , these gentlemen now have a chance to mount a rescue attempt as their swan-song : for example , they could quickly agree on financial prospects for the next seven years and thereby demonstrate their competence . secondly , : the leadership of europe is up for grabs and it should be the job of the european commission to take care of that as jaques delors once did .
the commission president jose manuel barroso needs to get on with it . is he strong enough ? he knows exactly what 's at stake .
i have the impression that he only needs the will - and to see - that he has a central role to play . for perhaps the first time in the last ten years , you can not ignore the real scepticism about europe right across the political spectrum .
various things are behind it : fear of globalization , fear of the franco-german directorate . where does this euroscepticism come from ?
is the brussels dreamboat , for example , a bit too far above people 's heads ? yes , on the one hand , you have to realize that this is a scepticism about politics as a whole , because at least half the motivation for the " no " in both countries had its roots in domestic politics .
the belgian government only has the support of 19 percent of the voters , and raffarin and chirac 's popularity is stellar , to put it ironically . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dark clouds hover over the eu but on the other hand , we have to admit that we did n't explain that eu expansion had political and economic advantages .
people believe more and more outsiders are coming in while there 's already 10- 12 percent unemployment and they think they are going to take their jobs - and at the same time , they see that in the context of the negotiations with turkey .
all this has had disastrous psychological consequences , especially when politicians did not set out to win people over . i mean , the politicians should have known this : they always say , europe is too expensive and the commission did this or that without asking us , although they all agreed to it . if your policies on europe are always going to follow the same pattern where , in the first sentence , you say " i 'm in favor of europe " and then you come up with three pages blaming your failures on the eu , well , then there 's the problem .
i do n't think the german government 's policies are much different to those of other countries : " when the sun shines , it was berlin , when it rains , it was brussels . " does expansion have to stop ? i think so . in two weeks , 25 heads of state and government will meet for what could be a crisis summit .
from an mep 's perspective , what signal should it send europe 's citizens ? it would be great if they could manage to sort out the future finances .
it would give a boost by demonstrating competence .
also , they have to say to the people : " we have got your message .
we have to do some things differently . "
and if they really manage to do that , in the next 12 months we will be able to approach the people with the continuing process of ratification , because they will say that the constitution is o.k. and that the leaders have learnt how to deal with such a constitution properly . europe should be more modest ? yes , it has to be more modest : we should have more confidence in the people .
and we have to recognize one thing in particular : in a democracy , objective reality is n't reality , it 's what people see as reality .
and if we politicians ca n't accept that , then we 've been trying to sell a pig in a poke . the interview was conducted by alexander kudascheff send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de crisis talks to assess eu charter wreckage german chancellor schröder will meet french president chirac for a working dinner in berlin saturday to salvage the eu 's constitution after dutch and french voters categorically rejected the new charter this week .

there have been " nos " before - from denmark or ireland over the maastricht and nice treaties , for example .
but the constitution is especially significant and of course the french " no " in particular carries a lot of weight .
if you look at the type of discussions which are now going on , you start to worry that we 're walking on quicksand , and there 's nothing you can do about it . but you get the impression it 's not just hyperbole - after this double " no , " europe seems almost paralyzed . we have to recognize that the constitution was already too late .
it should have happened before the european union took in the ten new members last year .
the 25-strong eu wo n't work with the current body of legislation , because the decision-making processes are so complicated and so difficult . everyone said that , if one country rejected the constitution , then it would n't happen at all , so is n't it already dead as a dodo ? no , not if we handle it properly .
in the draft constitution , it says 20 states have to sign it by october 2006 , two years after it was originally put forward : if not , then the european council has to find other ways ahead .
we 'll have to see whether any country is going to pull out , or whether there 'll have to be a new dialogue with any of them .
but i believe we can only do that if we have a change both in policy and in atmosphere - otherwise the french people wo n't be willing to follow us then either . bildunterschrift : a woman walks past " yes " and " no " campaign posters for france 's referendum on the european union constitution in may , 2005 . you 're saying , then , that the double " no " means that we need a different policy change in europe ? we have to take this seriously because the citizens were n't against the constitution per se .
the constitution makes everything more transparent - you wo n't be able to make decisions behind closed doors anymore - and citizens ' rights , democracy and the authority of the national parliaments vis-à-vis the eu will all be strengthened .
if we go back to the nice treaty again , then the distance between the eu and its citizens will grow even more .
we have to have dialogue - but we do n't have to decide everything .
we do n't have to regulate everything in europe , and especially not in a way that contradicts the principles of competitiveness .
and we also have to make it clear that europe has borders , because people are feeling overwhelmed . european citizens in france and the netherlands said " no , " but the first thing we hear from brussels is " we 'll keep on , " so , we 'll keep on ratifying : is that really the right response to the " non and " née ? " well , i think it 's right that the process of ratification should continue and that the other peoples should be consulted in accordance with their own constitutions .
but the process will only be successful if the consolidation phase i have described really does happen and the people feel that we politicians have received and understood this message . now , let 's assume that perhaps not just five but seven countries say no : would that bury the constitution ? then it really will be as dead as a dodo .
and i fear the european union will then be in a real crisis situation - because of the decision-making apparatus and because we will , in the long run , still be so detached that there will be less and less support for the european ideal . could you imagine renegotiating the constitution treaty piecemeal to meet some countries halfway ? it has to be dealt with the same way in each country .
we 've now got 11 countries which have ratified it .
we 'd have to start from scratch again . is n't that a pandora 's box ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : socialist party supporters celebrate in amsterdam , netherlands , after the announcement of preliminary results of the referendum on the proposed european union constitution .
dutch voters overwhelmingly rejected the treaty .
it really is a pandora 's box : but we 've got a breakdown of the vote which shows how mixed the messages from france were .
le pen and the far right sent a completely different message to the left wing , who were talking about a great social europe .
that , in turn , put the british and scandinavians off .
we have to emphasize that , in a federation of 25 countries , not everyone will be able to specify exactly what he wants to have . europe is in crisis and one should n't just ask what to do but who should actually do it ?
it 's a very unusual situation : the french president amongst the ashes his presidency ; the german chancellor - the other half of the franco-german engine - weakened by new elections ; tony blair re-elected but also probably on the way ; berlusconi in difficulties ; things in poland unclear .
who exactly is going to pull the european carriage out of the ditch ? well , firstly , having managed to make such a mess , these gentlemen now have a chance to mount a rescue attempt as their swan-song : for example , they could quickly agree on financial prospects for the next seven years and thereby demonstrate their competence . secondly , : the leadership of europe is up for grabs and it should be the job of the european commission to take care of that as jaques delors once did .
the commission president jose manuel barroso needs to get on with it . is he strong enough ? he knows exactly what 's at stake .
i have the impression that he only needs the will - and to see - that he has a central role to play . for perhaps the first time in the last ten years , you can not ignore the real scepticism about europe right across the political spectrum .
various things are behind it : fear of globalization , fear of the franco-german directorate . where does this euroscepticism come from ?
is the brussels dreamboat , for example , a bit too far above people 's heads ? yes , on the one hand , you have to realize that this is a scepticism about politics as a whole , because at least half the motivation for the " no " in both countries had its roots in domestic politics .
the belgian government only has the support of 19 percent of the voters , and raffarin and chirac 's popularity is stellar , to put it ironically . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dark clouds hover over the eu but on the other hand , we have to admit that we did n't explain that eu expansion had political and economic advantages .
people believe more and more outsiders are coming in while there 's already 10- 12 percent unemployment and they think they are going to take their jobs - and at the same time , they see that in the context of the negotiations with turkey .
all this has had disastrous psychological consequences , especially when politicians did not set out to win people over . i mean , the politicians should have known this : they always say , europe is too expensive and the commission did this or that without asking us , although they all agreed to it . if your policies on europe are always going to follow the same pattern where , in the first sentence , you say " i 'm in favor of europe " and then you come up with three pages blaming your failures on the eu , well , then there 's the problem .
i do n't think the german government 's policies are much different to those of other countries : " when the sun shines , it was berlin , when it rains , it was brussels . " does expansion have to stop ? i think so . in two weeks , 25 heads of state and government will meet for what could be a crisis summit .
from an mep 's perspective , what signal should it send europe 's citizens ? it would be great if they could manage to sort out the future finances .
it would give a boost by demonstrating competence .
also , they have to say to the people : " we have got your message .
we have to do some things differently . "
and if they really manage to do that , in the next 12 months we will be able to approach the people with the continuing process of ratification , because they will say that the constitution is o.k. and that the leaders have learnt how to deal with such a constitution properly . europe should be more modest ? yes , it has to be more modest : we should have more confidence in the people .

who exactly is going to pull the european carriage out of the ditch ? well , firstly , having managed to make such a mess , these gentlemen now have a chance to mount a rescue attempt as their swan-song : for example , they could quickly agree on financial prospects for the next seven years and thereby demonstrate their competence . secondly , : the leadership of europe is up for grabs and it should be the job of the european commission to take care of that as jaques delors once did .
the commission president jose manuel barroso needs to get on with it . is he strong enough ? he knows exactly what 's at stake .
i have the impression that he only needs the will - and to see - that he has a central role to play . for perhaps the first time in the last ten years , you can not ignore the real scepticism about europe right across the political spectrum .
various things are behind it : fear of globalization , fear of the franco-german directorate . where does this euroscepticism come from ?
is the brussels dreamboat , for example , a bit too far above people 's heads ? yes , on the one hand , you have to realize that this is a scepticism about politics as a whole , because at least half the motivation for the " no " in both countries had its roots in domestic politics .
the belgian government only has the support of 19 percent of the voters , and raffarin and chirac 's popularity is stellar , to put it ironically . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dark clouds hover over the eu but on the other hand , we have to admit that we did n't explain that eu expansion had political and economic advantages .
people believe more and more outsiders are coming in while there 's already 10- 12 percent unemployment and they think they are going to take their jobs - and at the same time , they see that in the context of the negotiations with turkey .
all this has had disastrous psychological consequences , especially when politicians did not set out to win people over . i mean , the politicians should have known this : they always say , europe is too expensive and the commission did this or that without asking us , although they all agreed to it . if your policies on europe are always going to follow the same pattern where , in the first sentence , you say " i 'm in favor of europe " and then you come up with three pages blaming your failures on the eu , well , then there 's the problem .
i do n't think the german government 's policies are much different to those of other countries : " when the sun shines , it was berlin , when it rains , it was brussels . " does expansion have to stop ? i think so . in two weeks , 25 heads of state and government will meet for what could be a crisis summit .
from an mep 's perspective , what signal should it send europe 's citizens ? it would be great if they could manage to sort out the future finances .
it would give a boost by demonstrating competence .
also , they have to say to the people : " we have got your message .
we have to do some things differently . "
and if they really manage to do that , in the next 12 months we will be able to approach the people with the continuing process of ratification , because they will say that the constitution is o.k. and that the leaders have learnt how to deal with such a constitution properly . europe should be more modest ? yes , it has to be more modest : we should have more confidence in the people .
and we have to recognize one thing in particular : in a democracy , objective reality is n't reality , it 's what people see as reality .
and if we politicians ca n't accept that , then we 've been trying to sell a pig in a poke . the interview was conducted by alexander kudascheff send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de crisis talks to assess eu charter wreckage german chancellor schröder will meet french president chirac for a working dinner in berlin saturday to salvage the eu 's constitution after dutch and french voters categorically rejected the new charter this week .
-lrb- june 4 , 2005 -rrb- schröder 's shuttle diplomacy to save eu germany forced the pace friday as european leaders scrambled to resolve the deep political crisis over the eu constitution , with chancellor gerhard schröder scheduling a series of meetings with eu leaders .

while some fear that the " no " could all but bury the treaty , most eu leaders said its ratification should continue .

" if the constitution does not come into effect , we remain with the treaty of nice , and the whole of europe agrees that nice was not sufficient for enlargement , " martin schulz , head of the socialist group in the european parliament , told the süddeutsche zeitung . voters in france and the netherlands rejected the constitution in referendums during the past seven days .
romania and bulgaria are due to enter the eu in 2007 and turkey is seeking membership . in the same newspaper klaus hansch , a german social democrat and former president of the parliament , said that european citizens were " very sceptical about a new enlargement " adding that the prospect of turkish membership had played " a very major role " in the " no " votes in france and the netherlands . " europe needs a phase of consolidation which will last much longer than five years , " he said . germans increasingly against treaty the statements come amid a rash of unofficial surveys in the country which show that a rising number of germans are increasingly skeptical of the new embattled eu constitution - a fact that 's being attributed to the lack of a real referendum on the treaty in germany .
the country voted only in the parliament to ratify the treaty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch cows wear protest signs ahead of the referendum on the eu constitution in oosthuizen , 32 km north of amsterdam .
the dutch word " boe " refers to the sound cows make and , like the english " boo , " signals disapproval .
on saturday , the mass-selling daily bild headlined " 96.9 percent against the eu constitution " on its front page , pointing to a survey it conducted among 390,694 readers along with television station rtl .
experts are warning that the recent rejections of the treaty by france and the netherlands are creating a ripple effect , leading to a surge of negative attitudes towards the eu constitution among germans . in one poll carried out by the institute polis for news magazine focus , 44 percent of those surveyed said they were in favor of the treaty with 39 against . full membership for new candidates on hold ? the head of the european affairs commission of the lower house of the german parliament , matthias wissman , for his part said that full membership for new candidates was " out of range for a long time . " wissmann , a christian democrat , told sunday 's welt am sonntag , there should be a " new architecture " for the european union , with eurozone countries at the centre , and those that do not use the single european currency further out . in an outer circle would be " those countries we can not consider full members for a long time but which have a european outlook . " erdogan : nothing but full membership wissmann referred to candidates for eventual membership , including croatia , macedonia and ukraine , as well as turkey , whose prime minister recep tayyip erdogan repeated in an interview with sunday 's bild am sonntag that his government would not accept anything but full membership . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan a " partnership " with the eu , as suggested by french and german right-wingers in particular , would be against the spirit of the relations between the two sides and break europe 's commitments to ankara , erdogan added . he said turkey had fulfilled the political criteria required by brussels and was busy implementing the necessary reforms .
while the french and dutch rejection of the constitution were " cause for concern , " erdogan said the eu had overcome such setbacks in the past . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de crisis talks to assess eu charter wreckage german chancellor schröder will meet french president chirac for a working dinner in berlin saturday to salvage the eu 's constitution after dutch and french voters categorically rejected the new charter this week .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 04.06.2005 exploring einstein 's laboratory großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he has become a cult figure , not only in the world of science an exhibition organized by the max planck institute in berlin pays tribute to the scientist 100 years after he published his theory of relativity and 50 years since his death .
but the show goes much further than that . along berlin ’ s boulevard unter den linden , a series of bright red letters " e " have been installed .
they represent " einstein , " " energy " or " e = mc ² " in places associated with the scientist 's life in the german capital .
these red letters are intended to draw attention to one of the highlights of germany 's current einstein year : the exhibition " chief engineer of the universe . "
it introduces visitors to various competing views in understanding our world .
for the max planck institute for the history of science , which organized the show , albert einstein 's key role in shaping the world view on fundamental questions of the nature of space , gravitation and the invisible forces of magnetism , radiation and electricity makes him the " chief engineer of the universe . "
the feel of a modern laboratory the institute 's professor jürgen renn does not intend to relate a hero 's tale , though .
he says the exhibition " is more an exercise in presenting the adventure of scientific research and its history in an attractive and understandable style . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the exhibit wants to create a certain atmosphere " sure , that 's a challenge , " said renn .
" we 've tried to create an atmosphere , which can also be grasped aesthetically . "
he said the organizers had created something like a giant modern laboratory .
" entering that , the visitor feels the bustle , but also the inquisitiveness that drives these scientists , " said renn .
" these are emotional qualities , which we have tried to put into practice . "
more than just einstein 's face the exhibition is a giant laboratory on three floors .
historic experiments have been set up with original tools .
curious views into the sub-atomic world are made accessible in dark studios .
einstein himself explains scientific advances in original film footage .
for the show , the institute collected more than 1,000 exhibits from around the world .
contemporary documents are on display , some of which have never been published before .
at one point in the exhibition , the audience is suddenly blinded by bright light and left alone in a white room .
exhibition organizer stefan iglhaut explained that this is about looking at the world in a different way .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is probably the most famous photograph of einstein " i think this is an unusual way to make einstein understandable and interesting , " said iglhaut .
" we 're not only explaining his theories , but also finding metaphors and pictures which impress our audience .
we want them to take home more than just einstein 's face . "
everybody knows his face : the weird old guy with the gray mop of hair sticking his tongue out at the world .
but the exhibition communicates the historical context of einstein 's influence and the special challenges which arose for him as a human being and as a scientist .
a desk with a history einstein 's life is illuminated against the background of the political and social upheavals of his time .
visitors follow him from his childhood in the middle-class world of the family electrical business , through his time in switzerland , to the tense world of the jewry caught between anti-semitism and new zionist beginnings .
in 1933 , einstein 's books were burnt by germans just outside the museum .
in the same year , einstein emigrated to the united states , where he experienced " a tense atmosphere of fortified democracy and political mistrust , " said renn .
renn 's favorite exhibit is einstein 's desk .
" he had to leave it behind in berlin when the nazis forced him to emigrate , " he said .
" the french ambassador helped him to have it transferred to his office in princeton .
since then , this is the first time this very moving piece of furniture with its dramatic history has made it back to germany . "
it 's rather unspectacular : a simple , fairly small wooden desk .
but here einstein worked to change the world .
in 1905 , his " special theory of relativity " revolutionized our understanding of space and time , while e = mc ² became the most famous equation in physics .
einstein succeeded in moving young and old einstein once said it was important to never stop asking .
" one can not help but marvel reverently at the secrets of eternity , life and the wonderful structure of reality , " the famous scientist said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors can also see einstein 's impact on the world today throughout the exhibition , more than 50 multimedia stations encourage visitors to ask their own questions .
it concludes with einstein 's impact on today 's science and culture .
twenty-four seats are arranged along a white conference table .
one after another , today 's leading scientists give their views on the " secrets of eternity , life and the wonderful structure of reality . "
einstein , his colleagues and this exhibition have succeeded in moving young and old .
the success of this exhibition is that it maintains a balance between historical reflection on successive changes in world views , information on the life and work of albert einstein - the " chief engineer of the universe " - and how these themes relate to challenges that we face today . peter zimmermann -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de following in einstein 's footsteps as part of the " einstein year " , which the 50th anniversary of the death of the physicist and the 100th jubilee of the relativity theory , enthusiasts can trace the path of the genius across germany .

but the show goes much further than that . along berlin ’ s boulevard unter den linden , a series of bright red letters " e " have been installed .
they represent " einstein , " " energy " or " e = mc ² " in places associated with the scientist 's life in the german capital .
these red letters are intended to draw attention to one of the highlights of germany 's current einstein year : the exhibition " chief engineer of the universe . "
it introduces visitors to various competing views in understanding our world .
for the max planck institute for the history of science , which organized the show , albert einstein 's key role in shaping the world view on fundamental questions of the nature of space , gravitation and the invisible forces of magnetism , radiation and electricity makes him the " chief engineer of the universe . "
the feel of a modern laboratory the institute 's professor jürgen renn does not intend to relate a hero 's tale , though .
he says the exhibition " is more an exercise in presenting the adventure of scientific research and its history in an attractive and understandable style . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the exhibit wants to create a certain atmosphere " sure , that 's a challenge , " said renn .
" we 've tried to create an atmosphere , which can also be grasped aesthetically . "
he said the organizers had created something like a giant modern laboratory .
" entering that , the visitor feels the bustle , but also the inquisitiveness that drives these scientists , " said renn .
" these are emotional qualities , which we have tried to put into practice . "
more than just einstein 's face the exhibition is a giant laboratory on three floors .
historic experiments have been set up with original tools .
curious views into the sub-atomic world are made accessible in dark studios .
einstein himself explains scientific advances in original film footage .
for the show , the institute collected more than 1,000 exhibits from around the world .
contemporary documents are on display , some of which have never been published before .
at one point in the exhibition , the audience is suddenly blinded by bright light and left alone in a white room .
exhibition organizer stefan iglhaut explained that this is about looking at the world in a different way .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is probably the most famous photograph of einstein " i think this is an unusual way to make einstein understandable and interesting , " said iglhaut .
" we 're not only explaining his theories , but also finding metaphors and pictures which impress our audience .
we want them to take home more than just einstein 's face . "
everybody knows his face : the weird old guy with the gray mop of hair sticking his tongue out at the world .
but the exhibition communicates the historical context of einstein 's influence and the special challenges which arose for him as a human being and as a scientist .
a desk with a history einstein 's life is illuminated against the background of the political and social upheavals of his time .
visitors follow him from his childhood in the middle-class world of the family electrical business , through his time in switzerland , to the tense world of the jewry caught between anti-semitism and new zionist beginnings .
in 1933 , einstein 's books were burnt by germans just outside the museum .
in the same year , einstein emigrated to the united states , where he experienced " a tense atmosphere of fortified democracy and political mistrust , " said renn .
renn 's favorite exhibit is einstein 's desk .
" he had to leave it behind in berlin when the nazis forced him to emigrate , " he said .
" the french ambassador helped him to have it transferred to his office in princeton .
since then , this is the first time this very moving piece of furniture with its dramatic history has made it back to germany . "
it 's rather unspectacular : a simple , fairly small wooden desk .
but here einstein worked to change the world .
in 1905 , his " special theory of relativity " revolutionized our understanding of space and time , while e = mc ² became the most famous equation in physics .
einstein succeeded in moving young and old einstein once said it was important to never stop asking .
" one can not help but marvel reverently at the secrets of eternity , life and the wonderful structure of reality , " the famous scientist said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors can also see einstein 's impact on the world today throughout the exhibition , more than 50 multimedia stations encourage visitors to ask their own questions .
it concludes with einstein 's impact on today 's science and culture .
twenty-four seats are arranged along a white conference table .
one after another , today 's leading scientists give their views on the " secrets of eternity , life and the wonderful structure of reality . "
einstein , his colleagues and this exhibition have succeeded in moving young and old .
the success of this exhibition is that it maintains a balance between historical reflection on successive changes in world views , information on the life and work of albert einstein - the " chief engineer of the universe " - and how these themes relate to challenges that we face today . peter zimmermann -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de following in einstein 's footsteps as part of the " einstein year " , which the 50th anniversary of the death of the physicist and the 100th jubilee of the relativity theory , enthusiasts can trace the path of the genius across germany .

but the show goes much further than that . along berlin ’ s boulevard unter den linden , a series of bright red letters " e " have been installed .
they represent " einstein , " " energy " or " e = mc ² " in places associated with the scientist 's life in the german capital .
these red letters are intended to draw attention to one of the highlights of germany 's current einstein year : the exhibition " chief engineer of the universe . "
it introduces visitors to various competing views in understanding our world .
for the max planck institute for the history of science , which organized the show , albert einstein 's key role in shaping the world view on fundamental questions of the nature of space , gravitation and the invisible forces of magnetism , radiation and electricity makes him the " chief engineer of the universe . "
the feel of a modern laboratory the institute 's professor jürgen renn does not intend to relate a hero 's tale , though .
he says the exhibition " is more an exercise in presenting the adventure of scientific research and its history in an attractive and understandable style . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the exhibit wants to create a certain atmosphere " sure , that 's a challenge , " said renn .
" we 've tried to create an atmosphere , which can also be grasped aesthetically . "
he said the organizers had created something like a giant modern laboratory .
" entering that , the visitor feels the bustle , but also the inquisitiveness that drives these scientists , " said renn .
" these are emotional qualities , which we have tried to put into practice . "
more than just einstein 's face the exhibition is a giant laboratory on three floors .
historic experiments have been set up with original tools .
curious views into the sub-atomic world are made accessible in dark studios .
einstein himself explains scientific advances in original film footage .
for the show , the institute collected more than 1,000 exhibits from around the world .
contemporary documents are on display , some of which have never been published before .
at one point in the exhibition , the audience is suddenly blinded by bright light and left alone in a white room .
exhibition organizer stefan iglhaut explained that this is about looking at the world in a different way .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is probably the most famous photograph of einstein " i think this is an unusual way to make einstein understandable and interesting , " said iglhaut .
" we 're not only explaining his theories , but also finding metaphors and pictures which impress our audience .
we want them to take home more than just einstein 's face . "
everybody knows his face : the weird old guy with the gray mop of hair sticking his tongue out at the world .
but the exhibition communicates the historical context of einstein 's influence and the special challenges which arose for him as a human being and as a scientist .
a desk with a history einstein 's life is illuminated against the background of the political and social upheavals of his time .
visitors follow him from his childhood in the middle-class world of the family electrical business , through his time in switzerland , to the tense world of the jewry caught between anti-semitism and new zionist beginnings .
in 1933 , einstein 's books were burnt by germans just outside the museum .
in the same year , einstein emigrated to the united states , where he experienced " a tense atmosphere of fortified democracy and political mistrust , " said renn .
renn 's favorite exhibit is einstein 's desk .
" he had to leave it behind in berlin when the nazis forced him to emigrate , " he said .
" the french ambassador helped him to have it transferred to his office in princeton .
since then , this is the first time this very moving piece of furniture with its dramatic history has made it back to germany . "
it 's rather unspectacular : a simple , fairly small wooden desk .
but here einstein worked to change the world .
in 1905 , his " special theory of relativity " revolutionized our understanding of space and time , while e = mc ² became the most famous equation in physics .
einstein succeeded in moving young and old einstein once said it was important to never stop asking .
" one can not help but marvel reverently at the secrets of eternity , life and the wonderful structure of reality , " the famous scientist said .

one after another , today 's leading scientists give their views on the " secrets of eternity , life and the wonderful structure of reality . "
einstein , his colleagues and this exhibition have succeeded in moving young and old .
the success of this exhibition is that it maintains a balance between historical reflection on successive changes in world views , information on the life and work of albert einstein - the " chief engineer of the universe " - and how these themes relate to challenges that we face today . peter zimmermann -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de following in einstein 's footsteps as part of the " einstein year " , which the 50th anniversary of the death of the physicist and the 100th jubilee of the relativity theory , enthusiasts can trace the path of the genius across germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 04.06.2005 crisis talks to assess eu charter wreckage großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saving the new eu treaty will top saturday night 's agenda german chancellor schröder will meet french president chirac for a working dinner in berlin saturday to salvage the eu 's constitution after dutch and french voters categorically rejected the new charter this week . despite the resounding blow dealt to the document by the two eu founder members , the german chancellor is eager to see the ratification process to continue in the remaining countries of the 25-nation bloc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac warmly received schröder earlier in may in paris .
thus , it 's unlikely gerhard schröder will waste much time consoling his close friend jacques chirac for the failed referendum in france . the german chancellor is in a defiant mood now that dutch and french voters have rejected the new eu charter and plunged the european union into severe crisis .
one day ahead of his meeting with jacques chirac in berlin , schröder vowed to press ahead towards the goal of a fully-fledged constitution . " i will not accept attempts to stop the entire project simply because two countries rejected it , " he said .
" germany has adopted the constitution as well as a number of other countries .
only at the end of the ratification process will we be able to decide what to do next .
that is why any form of overreaction is totally misplaced . " a tricky situation yet the two leaders are in a dilemma .
stopping the ratification process is apparently unacceptable to the german chancellor .
a renegotiation of the treaty or new votes in the countries opposed to it has also been widely ruled out . what may come under discussion during the crisis talks are ways to extract key provisions in the treaty such as streamlining the eu voting system and establishing the post of an eu foreign minister so that are not subject to referendums . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people hold up the eu flag during a rally through the streets of warsaw , sunday may 15 , 2005 .
another possibility would be to continue with the ratification process and assess the situation at the end of it in 2006 .
berlin appears to be placing some hope on a much-underrated annex to the constitution treaty which allows for an eu summit meeting to discuss further steps if at least 20 of the 25 eu members have ratified the charter . german foreign minister joschka fischer also believes that the constitution treaty is not dead as yet . " i don ’ t think that there is a better treaty to be found anywhere , " fischer said .
" so we have to work hard to rescue it .
obviously we have to put some of our foreign policy objectives on hold for the time being , because of the eu ’ s internal problems , but the world wo n't just stand by and wait for us . " dipping popularity at home as chirac and schröder form a common , pro-constitution front when they sit down to their working dinner in berlin , they might also reflect that they share something else - plummeting popularity ratings at home . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel schröder 's social democrats suffered a devastating defeat in a state election last month , prompting him to call for a general election this september , 12 months ahead of schedule .
opinion polls show he will lose to the conservative opposition christian democrats of angela merkel -lrb- photo -rrb- . chirac meanwhile suffered the humiliation of seeing his people ignore his appeals for them to ratify the constitution and spent the week looking , to many analysts , like a lame duck president . the " no " vote forced him into a government reshuffle , promoting former health minister philippe douste-blazy to foreign minister . douste-blazy was candid about the future , saying : " we are obviously in a difficult situation after two negative referendums . " chirac 's spokesman meanwhile said he would use the brussels summit to assure his eu colleagues of france 's commitment to the bloc and its " anchoring within the union " in the coming weeks . schröder 's new flexibility in an attempt to pour oil into troubled waters , gerhard schröder has already signaled flexibility in an ongoing row over eu financing which has pitted net contributors to the budget against recipients .
although no details were given by the chancellor , a deal could include a rise in german eu contributions beyond the current 1 percent of gross national product . schröder ’ s new flexibility could perhaps include concessions towards britain which enjoys a rebate from eu coffers that most members want scrapped .
it wouldn ’ t be the first time that germany has sought to buy europe out of its troubles and it ’ s a prospect that could even keep prime minister tony blair from canceling the british referendum and declaring the constitution dead once and for all . blair will meet schröder in berlin on june 13 . uwe hessler -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder 's shuttle diplomacy to save eu germany forced the pace friday as european leaders scrambled to resolve the deep political crisis over the eu constitution , with chancellor gerhard schröder scheduling a series of meetings with eu leaders .

while some fear that the " no " could all but bury the treaty , most eu leaders said its ratification should continue .

thus , it 's unlikely gerhard schröder will waste much time consoling his close friend jacques chirac for the failed referendum in france . the german chancellor is in a defiant mood now that dutch and french voters have rejected the new eu charter and plunged the european union into severe crisis .
one day ahead of his meeting with jacques chirac in berlin , schröder vowed to press ahead towards the goal of a fully-fledged constitution . " i will not accept attempts to stop the entire project simply because two countries rejected it , " he said .
" germany has adopted the constitution as well as a number of other countries .
only at the end of the ratification process will we be able to decide what to do next .
that is why any form of overreaction is totally misplaced . " a tricky situation yet the two leaders are in a dilemma .
stopping the ratification process is apparently unacceptable to the german chancellor .
a renegotiation of the treaty or new votes in the countries opposed to it has also been widely ruled out . what may come under discussion during the crisis talks are ways to extract key provisions in the treaty such as streamlining the eu voting system and establishing the post of an eu foreign minister so that are not subject to referendums . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people hold up the eu flag during a rally through the streets of warsaw , sunday may 15 , 2005 .
another possibility would be to continue with the ratification process and assess the situation at the end of it in 2006 .
berlin appears to be placing some hope on a much-underrated annex to the constitution treaty which allows for an eu summit meeting to discuss further steps if at least 20 of the 25 eu members have ratified the charter . german foreign minister joschka fischer also believes that the constitution treaty is not dead as yet . " i don ’ t think that there is a better treaty to be found anywhere , " fischer said .
" so we have to work hard to rescue it .
obviously we have to put some of our foreign policy objectives on hold for the time being , because of the eu ’ s internal problems , but the world wo n't just stand by and wait for us . " dipping popularity at home as chirac and schröder form a common , pro-constitution front when they sit down to their working dinner in berlin , they might also reflect that they share something else - plummeting popularity ratings at home . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel schröder 's social democrats suffered a devastating defeat in a state election last month , prompting him to call for a general election this september , 12 months ahead of schedule .
opinion polls show he will lose to the conservative opposition christian democrats of angela merkel -lrb- photo -rrb- . chirac meanwhile suffered the humiliation of seeing his people ignore his appeals for them to ratify the constitution and spent the week looking , to many analysts , like a lame duck president . the " no " vote forced him into a government reshuffle , promoting former health minister philippe douste-blazy to foreign minister . douste-blazy was candid about the future , saying : " we are obviously in a difficult situation after two negative referendums . " chirac 's spokesman meanwhile said he would use the brussels summit to assure his eu colleagues of france 's commitment to the bloc and its " anchoring within the union " in the coming weeks . schröder 's new flexibility in an attempt to pour oil into troubled waters , gerhard schröder has already signaled flexibility in an ongoing row over eu financing which has pitted net contributors to the budget against recipients .
although no details were given by the chancellor , a deal could include a rise in german eu contributions beyond the current 1 percent of gross national product . schröder ’ s new flexibility could perhaps include concessions towards britain which enjoys a rebate from eu coffers that most members want scrapped .
it wouldn ’ t be the first time that germany has sought to buy europe out of its troubles and it ’ s a prospect that could even keep prime minister tony blair from canceling the british referendum and declaring the constitution dead once and for all . blair will meet schröder in berlin on june 13 . uwe hessler -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder 's shuttle diplomacy to save eu germany forced the pace friday as european leaders scrambled to resolve the deep political crisis over the eu constitution , with chancellor gerhard schröder scheduling a series of meetings with eu leaders .
-lrb- june 3 , 2005 -rrb- europe 's motor plans emergency summit germany and france , for so long the driving force behind european integration , will hold an emergency summit this weekend to discuss the crisis unfolding after the french and dutch rejection of the eu constitution .

there have been " nos " before - from denmark or ireland over the maastricht and nice treaties , for example .
but the constitution is especially significant and of course the french " no " in particular carries a lot of weight .
if you look at the type of discussions which are now going on , you start to worry that we 're walking on quicksand , and there 's nothing you can do about it . but you get the impression it 's not just hyperbole - after this double " no , " europe seems almost paralyzed . we have to recognize that the constitution was already too late .
it should have happened before the european union took in the ten new members last year .
the 25-strong eu wo n't work with the current body of legislation , because the decision-making processes are so complicated and so difficult . everyone said that , if one country rejected the constitution , then it would n't happen at all , so is n't it already dead as a dodo ? no , not if we handle it properly .
in the draft constitution , it says 20 states have to sign it by october 2006 , two years after it was originally put forward : if not , then the european council has to find other ways ahead .
we 'll have to see whether any country is going to pull out , or whether there 'll have to be a new dialogue with any of them .
but i believe we can only do that if we have a change both in policy and in atmosphere - otherwise the french people wo n't be willing to follow us then either . bildunterschrift : a woman walks past " yes " and " no " campaign posters for france 's referendum on the european union constitution in may , 2005 . you 're saying , then , that the double " no " means that we need a different policy change in europe ? we have to take this seriously because the citizens were n't against the constitution per se .
the constitution makes everything more transparent - you wo n't be able to make decisions behind closed doors anymore - and citizens ' rights , democracy and the authority of the national parliaments vis-à-vis the eu will all be strengthened .
if we go back to the nice treaty again , then the distance between the eu and its citizens will grow even more .
we have to have dialogue - but we do n't have to decide everything .
we do n't have to regulate everything in europe , and especially not in a way that contradicts the principles of competitiveness .
and we also have to make it clear that europe has borders , because people are feeling overwhelmed . european citizens in france and the netherlands said " no , " but the first thing we hear from brussels is " we 'll keep on , " so , we 'll keep on ratifying : is that really the right response to the " non and " née ? " well , i think it 's right that the process of ratification should continue and that the other peoples should be consulted in accordance with their own constitutions .
but the process will only be successful if the consolidation phase i have described really does happen and the people feel that we politicians have received and understood this message . now , let 's assume that perhaps not just five but seven countries say no : would that bury the constitution ? then it really will be as dead as a dodo .
and i fear the european union will then be in a real crisis situation - because of the decision-making apparatus and because we will , in the long run , still be so detached that there will be less and less support for the european ideal . could you imagine renegotiating the constitution treaty piecemeal to meet some countries halfway ? it has to be dealt with the same way in each country .
we 've now got 11 countries which have ratified it .
we 'd have to start from scratch again . is n't that a pandora 's box ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : socialist party supporters celebrate in amsterdam , netherlands , after the announcement of preliminary results of the referendum on the proposed european union constitution .
dutch voters overwhelmingly rejected the treaty .
it really is a pandora 's box : but we 've got a breakdown of the vote which shows how mixed the messages from france were .
le pen and the far right sent a completely different message to the left wing , who were talking about a great social europe .
that , in turn , put the british and scandinavians off .
we have to emphasize that , in a federation of 25 countries , not everyone will be able to specify exactly what he wants to have . europe is in crisis and one should n't just ask what to do but who should actually do it ?
it 's a very unusual situation : the french president amongst the ashes his presidency ; the german chancellor - the other half of the franco-german engine - weakened by new elections ; tony blair re-elected but also probably on the way ; berlusconi in difficulties ; things in poland unclear .
who exactly is going to pull the european carriage out of the ditch ? well , firstly , having managed to make such a mess , these gentlemen now have a chance to mount a rescue attempt as their swan-song : for example , they could quickly agree on financial prospects for the next seven years and thereby demonstrate their competence . secondly , : the leadership of europe is up for grabs and it should be the job of the european commission to take care of that as jaques delors once did .
the commission president jose manuel barroso needs to get on with it . is he strong enough ? he knows exactly what 's at stake .
i have the impression that he only needs the will - and to see - that he has a central role to play . for perhaps the first time in the last ten years , you can not ignore the real scepticism about europe right across the political spectrum .
various things are behind it : fear of globalization , fear of the franco-german directorate . where does this euroscepticism come from ?
is the brussels dreamboat , for example , a bit too far above people 's heads ? yes , on the one hand , you have to realize that this is a scepticism about politics as a whole , because at least half the motivation for the " no " in both countries had its roots in domestic politics .
the belgian government only has the support of 19 percent of the voters , and raffarin and chirac 's popularity is stellar , to put it ironically . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dark clouds hover over the eu but on the other hand , we have to admit that we did n't explain that eu expansion had political and economic advantages .
people believe more and more outsiders are coming in while there 's already 10- 12 percent unemployment and they think they are going to take their jobs - and at the same time , they see that in the context of the negotiations with turkey .
all this has had disastrous psychological consequences , especially when politicians did not set out to win people over . i mean , the politicians should have known this : they always say , europe is too expensive and the commission did this or that without asking us , although they all agreed to it . if your policies on europe are always going to follow the same pattern where , in the first sentence , you say " i 'm in favor of europe " and then you come up with three pages blaming your failures on the eu , well , then there 's the problem .
i do n't think the german government 's policies are much different to those of other countries : " when the sun shines , it was berlin , when it rains , it was brussels . " does expansion have to stop ? i think so . in two weeks , 25 heads of state and government will meet for what could be a crisis summit .
from an mep 's perspective , what signal should it send europe 's citizens ? it would be great if they could manage to sort out the future finances .
it would give a boost by demonstrating competence .
also , they have to say to the people : " we have got your message .
we have to do some things differently . "
and if they really manage to do that , in the next 12 months we will be able to approach the people with the continuing process of ratification , because they will say that the constitution is o.k. and that the leaders have learnt how to deal with such a constitution properly . europe should be more modest ? yes , it has to be more modest : we should have more confidence in the people .
and we have to recognize one thing in particular : in a democracy , objective reality is n't reality , it 's what people see as reality .
and if we politicians ca n't accept that , then we 've been trying to sell a pig in a poke . the interview was conducted by alexander kudascheff send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de crisis talks to assess eu charter wreckage german chancellor schröder will meet french president chirac for a working dinner in berlin saturday to salvage the eu 's constitution after dutch and french voters categorically rejected the new charter this week .

the commission president jose manuel barroso needs to get on with it . is he strong enough ? he knows exactly what 's at stake .

all this has had disastrous psychological consequences , especially when politicians did not set out to win people over . i mean , the politicians should have known this : they always say , europe is too expensive and the commission did this or that without asking us , although they all agreed to it . if your policies on europe are always going to follow the same pattern where , in the first sentence , you say " i 'm in favor of europe " and then you come up with three pages blaming your failures on the eu , well , then there 's the problem .
i do n't think the german government 's policies are much different to those of other countries : " when the sun shines , it was berlin , when it rains , it was brussels . " does expansion have to stop ? i think so . in two weeks , 25 heads of state and government will meet for what could be a crisis summit .

there have been " nos " before - from denmark or ireland over the maastricht and nice treaties , for example .
but the constitution is especially significant and of course the french " no " in particular carries a lot of weight .
if you look at the type of discussions which are now going on , you start to worry that we 're walking on quicksand , and there 's nothing you can do about it . but you get the impression it 's not just hyperbole - after this double " no , " europe seems almost paralyzed . we have to recognize that the constitution was already too late .
it should have happened before the european union took in the ten new members last year .
the 25-strong eu wo n't work with the current body of legislation , because the decision-making processes are so complicated and so difficult . everyone said that , if one country rejected the constitution , then it would n't happen at all , so is n't it already dead as a dodo ? no , not if we handle it properly .
in the draft constitution , it says 20 states have to sign it by october 2006 , two years after it was originally put forward : if not , then the european council has to find other ways ahead .
we 'll have to see whether any country is going to pull out , or whether there 'll have to be a new dialogue with any of them .
but i believe we can only do that if we have a change both in policy and in atmosphere - otherwise the french people wo n't be willing to follow us then either . bildunterschrift : a woman walks past " yes " and " no " campaign posters for france 's referendum on the european union constitution in may , 2005 . you 're saying , then , that the double " no " means that we need a different policy change in europe ? we have to take this seriously because the citizens were n't against the constitution per se .
the constitution makes everything more transparent - you wo n't be able to make decisions behind closed doors anymore - and citizens ' rights , democracy and the authority of the national parliaments vis-à-vis the eu will all be strengthened .
if we go back to the nice treaty again , then the distance between the eu and its citizens will grow even more .
we have to have dialogue - but we do n't have to decide everything .
we do n't have to regulate everything in europe , and especially not in a way that contradicts the principles of competitiveness .
and we also have to make it clear that europe has borders , because people are feeling overwhelmed . european citizens in france and the netherlands said " no , " but the first thing we hear from brussels is " we 'll keep on , " so , we 'll keep on ratifying : is that really the right response to the " non and " née ? " well , i think it 's right that the process of ratification should continue and that the other peoples should be consulted in accordance with their own constitutions .
but the process will only be successful if the consolidation phase i have described really does happen and the people feel that we politicians have received and understood this message . now , let 's assume that perhaps not just five but seven countries say no : would that bury the constitution ? then it really will be as dead as a dodo .
and i fear the european union will then be in a real crisis situation - because of the decision-making apparatus and because we will , in the long run , still be so detached that there will be less and less support for the european ideal . could you imagine renegotiating the constitution treaty piecemeal to meet some countries halfway ? it has to be dealt with the same way in each country .
we 've now got 11 countries which have ratified it .
we 'd have to start from scratch again . is n't that a pandora 's box ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : socialist party supporters celebrate in amsterdam , netherlands , after the announcement of preliminary results of the referendum on the proposed european union constitution .

the constitution makes everything more transparent - you wo n't be able to make decisions behind closed doors anymore - and citizens ' rights , democracy and the authority of the national parliaments vis-à-vis the eu will all be strengthened .
if we go back to the nice treaty again , then the distance between the eu and its citizens will grow even more .
we have to have dialogue - but we do n't have to decide everything .
we do n't have to regulate everything in europe , and especially not in a way that contradicts the principles of competitiveness .
and we also have to make it clear that europe has borders , because people are feeling overwhelmed . european citizens in france and the netherlands said " no , " but the first thing we hear from brussels is " we 'll keep on , " so , we 'll keep on ratifying : is that really the right response to the " non and " née ? " well , i think it 's right that the process of ratification should continue and that the other peoples should be consulted in accordance with their own constitutions .
but the process will only be successful if the consolidation phase i have described really does happen and the people feel that we politicians have received and understood this message . now , let 's assume that perhaps not just five but seven countries say no : would that bury the constitution ? then it really will be as dead as a dodo .
and i fear the european union will then be in a real crisis situation - because of the decision-making apparatus and because we will , in the long run , still be so detached that there will be less and less support for the european ideal . could you imagine renegotiating the constitution treaty piecemeal to meet some countries halfway ? it has to be dealt with the same way in each country .
we 've now got 11 countries which have ratified it .
we 'd have to start from scratch again . is n't that a pandora 's box ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : socialist party supporters celebrate in amsterdam , netherlands , after the announcement of preliminary results of the referendum on the proposed european union constitution .
dutch voters overwhelmingly rejected the treaty .
it really is a pandora 's box : but we 've got a breakdown of the vote which shows how mixed the messages from france were .
le pen and the far right sent a completely different message to the left wing , who were talking about a great social europe .
that , in turn , put the british and scandinavians off .
we have to emphasize that , in a federation of 25 countries , not everyone will be able to specify exactly what he wants to have . europe is in crisis and one should n't just ask what to do but who should actually do it ?
it 's a very unusual situation : the french president amongst the ashes his presidency ; the german chancellor - the other half of the franco-german engine - weakened by new elections ; tony blair re-elected but also probably on the way ; berlusconi in difficulties ; things in poland unclear .
who exactly is going to pull the european carriage out of the ditch ? well , firstly , having managed to make such a mess , these gentlemen now have a chance to mount a rescue attempt as their swan-song : for example , they could quickly agree on financial prospects for the next seven years and thereby demonstrate their competence . secondly , : the leadership of europe is up for grabs and it should be the job of the european commission to take care of that as jaques delors once did .
the commission president jose manuel barroso needs to get on with it . is he strong enough ? he knows exactly what 's at stake .
i have the impression that he only needs the will - and to see - that he has a central role to play . for perhaps the first time in the last ten years , you can not ignore the real scepticism about europe right across the political spectrum .
various things are behind it : fear of globalization , fear of the franco-german directorate . where does this euroscepticism come from ?
is the brussels dreamboat , for example , a bit too far above people 's heads ? yes , on the one hand , you have to realize that this is a scepticism about politics as a whole , because at least half the motivation for the " no " in both countries had its roots in domestic politics .
the belgian government only has the support of 19 percent of the voters , and raffarin and chirac 's popularity is stellar , to put it ironically . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dark clouds hover over the eu but on the other hand , we have to admit that we did n't explain that eu expansion had political and economic advantages .
people believe more and more outsiders are coming in while there 's already 10- 12 percent unemployment and they think they are going to take their jobs - and at the same time , they see that in the context of the negotiations with turkey .
all this has had disastrous psychological consequences , especially when politicians did not set out to win people over . i mean , the politicians should have known this : they always say , europe is too expensive and the commission did this or that without asking us , although they all agreed to it . if your policies on europe are always going to follow the same pattern where , in the first sentence , you say " i 'm in favor of europe " and then you come up with three pages blaming your failures on the eu , well , then there 's the problem .
i do n't think the german government 's policies are much different to those of other countries : " when the sun shines , it was berlin , when it rains , it was brussels . " does expansion have to stop ? i think so . in two weeks , 25 heads of state and government will meet for what could be a crisis summit .
from an mep 's perspective , what signal should it send europe 's citizens ? it would be great if they could manage to sort out the future finances .
it would give a boost by demonstrating competence .
also , they have to say to the people : " we have got your message .
we have to do some things differently . "
and if they really manage to do that , in the next 12 months we will be able to approach the people with the continuing process of ratification , because they will say that the constitution is o.k. and that the leaders have learnt how to deal with such a constitution properly . europe should be more modest ? yes , it has to be more modest : we should have more confidence in the people .
and we have to recognize one thing in particular : in a democracy , objective reality is n't reality , it 's what people see as reality .
and if we politicians ca n't accept that , then we 've been trying to sell a pig in a poke . the interview was conducted by alexander kudascheff send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de crisis talks to assess eu charter wreckage german chancellor schröder will meet french president chirac for a working dinner in berlin saturday to salvage the eu 's constitution after dutch and french voters categorically rejected the new charter this week .

but a study shows the country is gaining a growing number of foreign brains . knowledge is international .
for precisely this reason , germany has become a significant hub of learning , said education and research minister edelgard bulmahn .
" germany belongs to the winners in the race for the smartest heads , " bulmahn said .
" in the 1990s , we had an alarming brain drain in germany .
since 2001 , we 've managed to achieve a turn of the tide . "
according to a study by the german student services studentenwerk , every tenth student in germany comes from abroad .
this makes germany just as attractive a place to study as britain .
the percentage of foreign students is even higher than in the united states .
the number of foreign students has increased since the 1990s from 150,000 to some 230,000 , the study said .
asian interest in german institutions german universities are probably also so popular because there are no tuition fees .
this is a reason why so many students from developing countries and newly industrializing nations come to germany .
a strong increase in interest in german universities is especially noticeable from asia .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign students are increasingly filling german university libraries at the same time , 15 percent of the more than 1.7 million german students spend at least part of their studies abroad .
this makes them generally more mobile than their counterparts from britain , australia or the united states .
bulmahn said this " welcome development " was somewhat marred , however .
despite reforms , children from socially weak families were still neglected for foreign study .
only 55,000 germans go abroad solely for studying .
brain drain to germany still , the minister takes a positive stock of the matter .

" in addition , we are attracting more scientists from abroad every year since the german government has created the general conditions for an internationally competitive research base . "
the controversial junior professorship had helped stop the brain drain , she said .
this position enables up-and-coming scientists to teach and research independently sooner if they can present an outstanding dissertation .

" an emotional reaction is always possible , " said yves christen , head of the swiss pro-eu movement , nomes . polling booths were already open in some parts of the country friday while most postal ballots - a large proportion of votes many areas - had already been cast .
the result is due on sunday . swiss hostile to closer eu ties christen was counting on a 51 to 55 percent " yes " vote in a country that traditionally has shown suspicion if not outright hostility to closer ties with the eu in recent decades . swiss voters , who have the final say on key legislation several times a year , narrowly rejected a broad economic agreement with brussels in 1992 after a heated campaign . another motion by pro-eu campaigners in 2001 calling for eu membership talks was swept aside by 77 percent of voters .
instead , the swiss have approved a host of specialized accords with the eu to ease trade , labor , educational and technical ties in recent years . fear of loss of sovereignty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the entry to the town of schengen in luxembourg .
the schengen area , named after a small town in luxembourg where the treaty was signed in 1985 , now includes 13 eu states , as well as iceland and norway . the agreement abolishes systematic identity checks on travelers within the area and provides for a common visa in return for stronger controls on the area 's outer fringe , as well as closer cooperation between police forces . schengen 's swiss opponents say that amounts to giving up a chunk of their sovereignty to brussels . " we do n't trust an organization that ca n't manage to resolve its enormous internal problems , " said hans fehr , a parliamentarian for the right-wing swiss people 's party -lrb- svp -rrb- and head of an isolationist lobby group , the association for a neutral and independent switzerland -lrb- auns -rrb- . with the vote also covering membership of the eu 's dublin agreement on handling asylum seekers , lurid anti-schengen campaign leaflets have raised fears of rising crime and job losses to illicit immigrant labor . with the exception of the svp , all the major political parties are supporting the step into schengen , which has already been approved by parliament . " the svp is preying on people 's fears , " said didier berberat , a socialist party mp . while access to schengen 's computerized crime database is prized by most police unions in switzerland , it is loathed by swiss left-wingers who oppose the step into the area . " no would mean durable isolation " for many swiss living near austria , france , germany and italy , the outcome will make little difference . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : customs checks on imports and shopping baskets will remain , while many smaller borders posts have already been deserted and given way to random checks .
pro-europeans are eyeing sunday 's result as a guide to the climate in switzerland before another referendum in september . swiss voters are due to give their verdict on the extension of an agreement on the free movement of labor to the eu 's 10 new member states , at the very moment when political debate in western europe is beset by fears about cheaper competition from the east . " if the ' yes ' -lrb- to schengen -rrb- wins , it will be encouraging for the referendum on free movement .
but a ' no ' in september would be a minor disaster : it would mean durable isolation for switzerland , " christen said . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu in agony after constitution fiasco europe agonized over the eu constitution 's future thursday after dutch voters rejected it wednesday .

but a study shows the country is gaining a growing number of foreign brains . knowledge is international .
for precisely this reason , germany has become a significant hub of learning , said education and research minister edelgard bulmahn .
" germany belongs to the winners in the race for the smartest heads , " bulmahn said .
" in the 1990s , we had an alarming brain drain in germany .
since 2001 , we 've managed to achieve a turn of the tide . "
according to a study by the german student services studentenwerk , every tenth student in germany comes from abroad .
this makes germany just as attractive a place to study as britain .
the percentage of foreign students is even higher than in the united states .
the number of foreign students has increased since the 1990s from 150,000 to some 230,000 , the study said .
asian interest in german institutions german universities are probably also so popular because there are no tuition fees .
this is a reason why so many students from developing countries and newly industrializing nations come to germany .
a strong increase in interest in german universities is especially noticeable from asia .

bulmahn said this " welcome development " was somewhat marred , however .
despite reforms , children from socially weak families were still neglected for foreign study .
only 55,000 germans go abroad solely for studying .
brain drain to germany still , the minister takes a positive stock of the matter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education and research minister edelgard bulmahn has been keen to attract more brainpower to germany " the mobility of german students can be seen worldwide , as well as the increase in the number of foreign students here , " bulmahn said .
" in addition , we are attracting more scientists from abroad every year since the german government has created the general conditions for an internationally competitive research base . "
the controversial junior professorship had helped stop the brain drain , she said .
this position enables up-and-coming scientists to teach and research independently sooner if they can present an outstanding dissertation .
the federal government supports these posts with an average of 60,000 euros -lrb- $ 73,640 -rrb- per position .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 04.06.2005 exploring einstein 's laboratory großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he has become a cult figure , not only in the world of science an exhibition organized by the max planck institute in berlin pays tribute to the scientist 100 years after he published his theory of relativity and 50 years since his death .
but the show goes much further than that . along berlin ’ s boulevard unter den linden , a series of bright red letters " e " have been installed .
they represent " einstein , " " energy " or " e = mc ² " in places associated with the scientist 's life in the german capital .
these red letters are intended to draw attention to one of the highlights of germany 's current einstein year : the exhibition " chief engineer of the universe . "
it introduces visitors to various competing views in understanding our world .
for the max planck institute for the history of science , which organized the show , albert einstein 's key role in shaping the world view on fundamental questions of the nature of space , gravitation and the invisible forces of magnetism , radiation and electricity makes him the " chief engineer of the universe . "
the feel of a modern laboratory the institute 's professor jürgen renn does not intend to relate a hero 's tale , though .
he says the exhibition " is more an exercise in presenting the adventure of scientific research and its history in an attractive and understandable style . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the exhibit wants to create a certain atmosphere " sure , that 's a challenge , " said renn .
" we 've tried to create an atmosphere , which can also be grasped aesthetically . "
he said the organizers had created something like a giant modern laboratory .
" entering that , the visitor feels the bustle , but also the inquisitiveness that drives these scientists , " said renn .
" these are emotional qualities , which we have tried to put into practice . "
more than just einstein 's face the exhibition is a giant laboratory on three floors .
historic experiments have been set up with original tools .
curious views into the sub-atomic world are made accessible in dark studios .
einstein himself explains scientific advances in original film footage .
for the show , the institute collected more than 1,000 exhibits from around the world .
contemporary documents are on display , some of which have never been published before .
at one point in the exhibition , the audience is suddenly blinded by bright light and left alone in a white room .
exhibition organizer stefan iglhaut explained that this is about looking at the world in a different way .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is probably the most famous photograph of einstein " i think this is an unusual way to make einstein understandable and interesting , " said iglhaut .
" we 're not only explaining his theories , but also finding metaphors and pictures which impress our audience .
we want them to take home more than just einstein 's face . "
everybody knows his face : the weird old guy with the gray mop of hair sticking his tongue out at the world .
but the exhibition communicates the historical context of einstein 's influence and the special challenges which arose for him as a human being and as a scientist .
a desk with a history einstein 's life is illuminated against the background of the political and social upheavals of his time .
visitors follow him from his childhood in the middle-class world of the family electrical business , through his time in switzerland , to the tense world of the jewry caught between anti-semitism and new zionist beginnings .
in 1933 , einstein 's books were burnt by germans just outside the museum .
in the same year , einstein emigrated to the united states , where he experienced " a tense atmosphere of fortified democracy and political mistrust , " said renn .
renn 's favorite exhibit is einstein 's desk .
" he had to leave it behind in berlin when the nazis forced him to emigrate , " he said .
" the french ambassador helped him to have it transferred to his office in princeton .
since then , this is the first time this very moving piece of furniture with its dramatic history has made it back to germany . "
it 's rather unspectacular : a simple , fairly small wooden desk .
but here einstein worked to change the world .
in 1905 , his " special theory of relativity " revolutionized our understanding of space and time , while e = mc ² became the most famous equation in physics .
einstein succeeded in moving young and old einstein once said it was important to never stop asking .
" one can not help but marvel reverently at the secrets of eternity , life and the wonderful structure of reality , " the famous scientist said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors can also see einstein 's impact on the world today throughout the exhibition , more than 50 multimedia stations encourage visitors to ask their own questions .
it concludes with einstein 's impact on today 's science and culture .
twenty-four seats are arranged along a white conference table .
one after another , today 's leading scientists give their views on the " secrets of eternity , life and the wonderful structure of reality . "
einstein , his colleagues and this exhibition have succeeded in moving young and old .
the success of this exhibition is that it maintains a balance between historical reflection on successive changes in world views , information on the life and work of albert einstein - the " chief engineer of the universe " - and how these themes relate to challenges that we face today . peter zimmermann -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de following in einstein 's footsteps as part of the " einstein year " , which the 50th anniversary of the death of the physicist and the 100th jubilee of the relativity theory , enthusiasts can trace the path of the genius across germany .

thus , it 's unlikely gerhard schröder will waste much time consoling his close friend jacques chirac for the failed referendum in france . the german chancellor is in a defiant mood now that dutch and french voters have rejected the new eu charter and plunged the european union into severe crisis .
one day ahead of his meeting with jacques chirac in berlin , schröder vowed to press ahead towards the goal of a fully-fledged constitution . " i will not accept attempts to stop the entire project simply because two countries rejected it , " he said .
" germany has adopted the constitution as well as a number of other countries .
only at the end of the ratification process will we be able to decide what to do next .
that is why any form of overreaction is totally misplaced . " a tricky situation yet the two leaders are in a dilemma .
stopping the ratification process is apparently unacceptable to the german chancellor .
a renegotiation of the treaty or new votes in the countries opposed to it has also been widely ruled out . what may come under discussion during the crisis talks are ways to extract key provisions in the treaty such as streamlining the eu voting system and establishing the post of an eu foreign minister so that are not subject to referendums . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people hold up the eu flag during a rally through the streets of warsaw , sunday may 15 , 2005 .
another possibility would be to continue with the ratification process and assess the situation at the end of it in 2006 .
berlin appears to be placing some hope on a much-underrated annex to the constitution treaty which allows for an eu summit meeting to discuss further steps if at least 20 of the 25 eu members have ratified the charter . german foreign minister joschka fischer also believes that the constitution treaty is not dead as yet . " i don ’ t think that there is a better treaty to be found anywhere , " fischer said .

opinion polls show he will lose to the conservative opposition christian democrats of angela merkel -lrb- photo -rrb- . chirac meanwhile suffered the humiliation of seeing his people ignore his appeals for them to ratify the constitution and spent the week looking , to many analysts , like a lame duck president . the " no " vote forced him into a government reshuffle , promoting former health minister philippe douste-blazy to foreign minister . douste-blazy was candid about the future , saying : " we are obviously in a difficult situation after two negative referendums . " chirac 's spokesman meanwhile said he would use the brussels summit to assure his eu colleagues of france 's commitment to the bloc and its " anchoring within the union " in the coming weeks . schröder 's new flexibility in an attempt to pour oil into troubled waters , gerhard schröder has already signaled flexibility in an ongoing row over eu financing which has pitted net contributors to the budget against recipients .
although no details were given by the chancellor , a deal could include a rise in german eu contributions beyond the current 1 percent of gross national product . schröder ’ s new flexibility could perhaps include concessions towards britain which enjoys a rebate from eu coffers that most members want scrapped .
it wouldn ’ t be the first time that germany has sought to buy europe out of its troubles and it ’ s a prospect that could even keep prime minister tony blair from canceling the british referendum and declaring the constitution dead once and for all . blair will meet schröder in berlin on june 13 . uwe hessler -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder 's shuttle diplomacy to save eu germany forced the pace friday as european leaders scrambled to resolve the deep political crisis over the eu constitution , with chancellor gerhard schröder scheduling a series of meetings with eu leaders .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 04.06.2005 exploring einstein 's laboratory großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he has become a cult figure , not only in the world of science an exhibition organized by the max planck institute in berlin pays tribute to the scientist 100 years after he published his theory of relativity and 50 years since his death .
but the show goes much further than that . along berlin ’ s boulevard unter den linden , a series of bright red letters " e " have been installed .
they represent " einstein , " " energy " or " e = mc ² " in places associated with the scientist 's life in the german capital .
these red letters are intended to draw attention to one of the highlights of germany 's current einstein year : the exhibition " chief engineer of the universe . "
it introduces visitors to various competing views in understanding our world .
for the max planck institute for the history of science , which organized the show , albert einstein 's key role in shaping the world view on fundamental questions of the nature of space , gravitation and the invisible forces of magnetism , radiation and electricity makes him the " chief engineer of the universe . "
the feel of a modern laboratory the institute 's professor jürgen renn does not intend to relate a hero 's tale , though .
he says the exhibition " is more an exercise in presenting the adventure of scientific research and its history in an attractive and understandable style . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the exhibit wants to create a certain atmosphere " sure , that 's a challenge , " said renn .
" we 've tried to create an atmosphere , which can also be grasped aesthetically . "
he said the organizers had created something like a giant modern laboratory .
" entering that , the visitor feels the bustle , but also the inquisitiveness that drives these scientists , " said renn .
" these are emotional qualities , which we have tried to put into practice . "
more than just einstein 's face the exhibition is a giant laboratory on three floors .
historic experiments have been set up with original tools .
curious views into the sub-atomic world are made accessible in dark studios .
einstein himself explains scientific advances in original film footage .
for the show , the institute collected more than 1,000 exhibits from around the world .
contemporary documents are on display , some of which have never been published before .
at one point in the exhibition , the audience is suddenly blinded by bright light and left alone in a white room .
exhibition organizer stefan iglhaut explained that this is about looking at the world in a different way .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is probably the most famous photograph of einstein " i think this is an unusual way to make einstein understandable and interesting , " said iglhaut .
" we 're not only explaining his theories , but also finding metaphors and pictures which impress our audience .
we want them to take home more than just einstein 's face . "
everybody knows his face : the weird old guy with the gray mop of hair sticking his tongue out at the world .
but the exhibition communicates the historical context of einstein 's influence and the special challenges which arose for him as a human being and as a scientist .
a desk with a history einstein 's life is illuminated against the background of the political and social upheavals of his time .
visitors follow him from his childhood in the middle-class world of the family electrical business , through his time in switzerland , to the tense world of the jewry caught between anti-semitism and new zionist beginnings .
in 1933 , einstein 's books were burnt by germans just outside the museum .
in the same year , einstein emigrated to the united states , where he experienced " a tense atmosphere of fortified democracy and political mistrust , " said renn .
renn 's favorite exhibit is einstein 's desk .
" he had to leave it behind in berlin when the nazis forced him to emigrate , " he said .
" the french ambassador helped him to have it transferred to his office in princeton .
since then , this is the first time this very moving piece of furniture with its dramatic history has made it back to germany . "
it 's rather unspectacular : a simple , fairly small wooden desk .
but here einstein worked to change the world .
in 1905 , his " special theory of relativity " revolutionized our understanding of space and time , while e = mc ² became the most famous equation in physics .
einstein succeeded in moving young and old einstein once said it was important to never stop asking .
" one can not help but marvel reverently at the secrets of eternity , life and the wonderful structure of reality , " the famous scientist said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors can also see einstein 's impact on the world today throughout the exhibition , more than 50 multimedia stations encourage visitors to ask their own questions .
it concludes with einstein 's impact on today 's science and culture .
twenty-four seats are arranged along a white conference table .
one after another , today 's leading scientists give their views on the " secrets of eternity , life and the wonderful structure of reality . "
einstein , his colleagues and this exhibition have succeeded in moving young and old .
the success of this exhibition is that it maintains a balance between historical reflection on successive changes in world views , information on the life and work of albert einstein - the " chief engineer of the universe " - and how these themes relate to challenges that we face today . peter zimmermann -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de following in einstein 's footsteps as part of the " einstein year " , which the 50th anniversary of the death of the physicist and the 100th jubilee of the relativity theory , enthusiasts can trace the path of the genius across germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 04.06.2005 germany popular with foreign students großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a growing number of foreign faces in germany 's lecture halls universities and politicians are repeatedly complaining that germany 's smartest brains are packing up and leaving to study and research abroad .
but a study shows the country is gaining a growing number of foreign brains . knowledge is international .
for precisely this reason , germany has become a significant hub of learning , said education and research minister edelgard bulmahn .
" germany belongs to the winners in the race for the smartest heads , " bulmahn said .
" in the 1990s , we had an alarming brain drain in germany .
since 2001 , we 've managed to achieve a turn of the tide . "
according to a study by the german student services studentenwerk , every tenth student in germany comes from abroad .
this makes germany just as attractive a place to study as britain .
the percentage of foreign students is even higher than in the united states .
the number of foreign students has increased since the 1990s from 150,000 to some 230,000 , the study said .
asian interest in german institutions german universities are probably also so popular because there are no tuition fees .
this is a reason why so many students from developing countries and newly industrializing nations come to germany .
a strong increase in interest in german universities is especially noticeable from asia .
" we have really managed to attract a significantly larger share of students from regions which are booming economically , " bulmahn said .
" these are our future trade partners and these students are the ambassadors which we need in those countries . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign students are increasingly filling german university libraries at the same time , 15 percent of the more than 1.7 million german students spend at least part of their studies abroad .
this makes them generally more mobile than their counterparts from britain , australia or the united states .
bulmahn said this " welcome development " was somewhat marred , however .
despite reforms , children from socially weak families were still neglected for foreign study .
only 55,000 germans go abroad solely for studying .
brain drain to germany still , the minister takes a positive stock of the matter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education and research minister edelgard bulmahn has been keen to attract more brainpower to germany " the mobility of german students can be seen worldwide , as well as the increase in the number of foreign students here , " bulmahn said .
" in addition , we are attracting more scientists from abroad every year since the german government has created the general conditions for an internationally competitive research base . "
the controversial junior professorship had helped stop the brain drain , she said .
this position enables up-and-coming scientists to teach and research independently sooner if they can present an outstanding dissertation .
the federal government supports these posts with an average of 60,000 euros -lrb- $ 73,640 -rrb- per position .
the junior professorship has attracted talented foreign up-and-coming scientists to germany and also brought young top german researchers back home .
so , if at all , there can only be talk of brain drain to germany . karin kails -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de paying for european research the eu has over 400 funding programs , many of which are dedicated to particular fields of research ranging from nuclear science to bee keeping .
but how do scientists get their hands on the money ?

thus , it 's unlikely gerhard schröder will waste much time consoling his close friend jacques chirac for the failed referendum in france . the german chancellor is in a defiant mood now that dutch and french voters have rejected the new eu charter and plunged the european union into severe crisis .
one day ahead of his meeting with jacques chirac in berlin , schröder vowed to press ahead towards the goal of a fully-fledged constitution . " i will not accept attempts to stop the entire project simply because two countries rejected it , " he said .
" germany has adopted the constitution as well as a number of other countries .
only at the end of the ratification process will we be able to decide what to do next .
that is why any form of overreaction is totally misplaced . " a tricky situation yet the two leaders are in a dilemma .
stopping the ratification process is apparently unacceptable to the german chancellor .
a renegotiation of the treaty or new votes in the countries opposed to it has also been widely ruled out . what may come under discussion during the crisis talks are ways to extract key provisions in the treaty such as streamlining the eu voting system and establishing the post of an eu foreign minister so that are not subject to referendums . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people hold up the eu flag during a rally through the streets of warsaw , sunday may 15 , 2005 .
another possibility would be to continue with the ratification process and assess the situation at the end of it in 2006 .
berlin appears to be placing some hope on a much-underrated annex to the constitution treaty which allows for an eu summit meeting to discuss further steps if at least 20 of the 25 eu members have ratified the charter . german foreign minister joschka fischer also believes that the constitution treaty is not dead as yet . " i don ’ t think that there is a better treaty to be found anywhere , " fischer said .
" so we have to work hard to rescue it .
obviously we have to put some of our foreign policy objectives on hold for the time being , because of the eu ’ s internal problems , but the world wo n't just stand by and wait for us . " dipping popularity at home as chirac and schröder form a common , pro-constitution front when they sit down to their working dinner in berlin , they might also reflect that they share something else - plummeting popularity ratings at home . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel schröder 's social democrats suffered a devastating defeat in a state election last month , prompting him to call for a general election this september , 12 months ahead of schedule .
opinion polls show he will lose to the conservative opposition christian democrats of angela merkel -lrb- photo -rrb- . chirac meanwhile suffered the humiliation of seeing his people ignore his appeals for them to ratify the constitution and spent the week looking , to many analysts , like a lame duck president . the " no " vote forced him into a government reshuffle , promoting former health minister philippe douste-blazy to foreign minister . douste-blazy was candid about the future , saying : " we are obviously in a difficult situation after two negative referendums . " chirac 's spokesman meanwhile said he would use the brussels summit to assure his eu colleagues of france 's commitment to the bloc and its " anchoring within the union " in the coming weeks . schröder 's new flexibility in an attempt to pour oil into troubled waters , gerhard schröder has already signaled flexibility in an ongoing row over eu financing which has pitted net contributors to the budget against recipients .
although no details were given by the chancellor , a deal could include a rise in german eu contributions beyond the current 1 percent of gross national product . schröder ’ s new flexibility could perhaps include concessions towards britain which enjoys a rebate from eu coffers that most members want scrapped .
it wouldn ’ t be the first time that germany has sought to buy europe out of its troubles and it ’ s a prospect that could even keep prime minister tony blair from canceling the british referendum and declaring the constitution dead once and for all . blair will meet schröder in berlin on june 13 . uwe hessler -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder 's shuttle diplomacy to save eu germany forced the pace friday as european leaders scrambled to resolve the deep political crisis over the eu constitution , with chancellor gerhard schröder scheduling a series of meetings with eu leaders .

thus , it 's unlikely gerhard schröder will waste much time consoling his close friend jacques chirac for the failed referendum in france . the german chancellor is in a defiant mood now that dutch and french voters have rejected the new eu charter and plunged the european union into severe crisis .
one day ahead of his meeting with jacques chirac in berlin , schröder vowed to press ahead towards the goal of a fully-fledged constitution . " i will not accept attempts to stop the entire project simply because two countries rejected it , " he said .
" germany has adopted the constitution as well as a number of other countries .
only at the end of the ratification process will we be able to decide what to do next .
that is why any form of overreaction is totally misplaced . " a tricky situation yet the two leaders are in a dilemma .
stopping the ratification process is apparently unacceptable to the german chancellor .

these red letters are intended to draw attention to one of the highlights of germany 's current einstein year : the exhibition " chief engineer of the universe . "
it introduces visitors to various competing views in understanding our world .
for the max planck institute for the history of science , which organized the show , albert einstein 's key role in shaping the world view on fundamental questions of the nature of space , gravitation and the invisible forces of magnetism , radiation and electricity makes him the " chief engineer of the universe . "

a desk with a history einstein 's life is illuminated against the background of the political and social upheavals of his time .
visitors follow him from his childhood in the middle-class world of the family electrical business , through his time in switzerland , to the tense world of the jewry caught between anti-semitism and new zionist beginnings .

in the same year , einstein emigrated to the united states , where he experienced " a tense atmosphere of fortified democracy and political mistrust , " said renn .

einstein , his colleagues and this exhibition have succeeded in moving young and old .

thus , it 's unlikely gerhard schröder will waste much time consoling his close friend jacques chirac for the failed referendum in france . the german chancellor is in a defiant mood now that dutch and french voters have rejected the new eu charter and plunged the european union into severe crisis .
one day ahead of his meeting with jacques chirac in berlin , schröder vowed to press ahead towards the goal of a fully-fledged constitution . " i will not accept attempts to stop the entire project simply because two countries rejected it , " he said .
" germany has adopted the constitution as well as a number of other countries .
only at the end of the ratification process will we be able to decide what to do next .
that is why any form of overreaction is totally misplaced . " a tricky situation yet the two leaders are in a dilemma .
stopping the ratification process is apparently unacceptable to the german chancellor .
a renegotiation of the treaty or new votes in the countries opposed to it has also been widely ruled out . what may come under discussion during the crisis talks are ways to extract key provisions in the treaty such as streamlining the eu voting system and establishing the post of an eu foreign minister so that are not subject to referendums . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people hold up the eu flag during a rally through the streets of warsaw , sunday may 15 , 2005 .
another possibility would be to continue with the ratification process and assess the situation at the end of it in 2006 .
berlin appears to be placing some hope on a much-underrated annex to the constitution treaty which allows for an eu summit meeting to discuss further steps if at least 20 of the 25 eu members have ratified the charter . german foreign minister joschka fischer also believes that the constitution treaty is not dead as yet . " i don ’ t think that there is a better treaty to be found anywhere , " fischer said .
" so we have to work hard to rescue it .
obviously we have to put some of our foreign policy objectives on hold for the time being , because of the eu ’ s internal problems , but the world wo n't just stand by and wait for us . " dipping popularity at home as chirac and schröder form a common , pro-constitution front when they sit down to their working dinner in berlin , they might also reflect that they share something else - plummeting popularity ratings at home . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel schröder 's social democrats suffered a devastating defeat in a state election last month , prompting him to call for a general election this september , 12 months ahead of schedule .
opinion polls show he will lose to the conservative opposition christian democrats of angela merkel -lrb- photo -rrb- . chirac meanwhile suffered the humiliation of seeing his people ignore his appeals for them to ratify the constitution and spent the week looking , to many analysts , like a lame duck president . the " no " vote forced him into a government reshuffle , promoting former health minister philippe douste-blazy to foreign minister . douste-blazy was candid about the future , saying : " we are obviously in a difficult situation after two negative referendums . " chirac 's spokesman meanwhile said he would use the brussels summit to assure his eu colleagues of france 's commitment to the bloc and its " anchoring within the union " in the coming weeks . schröder 's new flexibility in an attempt to pour oil into troubled waters , gerhard schröder has already signaled flexibility in an ongoing row over eu financing which has pitted net contributors to the budget against recipients .
although no details were given by the chancellor , a deal could include a rise in german eu contributions beyond the current 1 percent of gross national product . schröder ’ s new flexibility could perhaps include concessions towards britain which enjoys a rebate from eu coffers that most members want scrapped .
it wouldn ’ t be the first time that germany has sought to buy europe out of its troubles and it ’ s a prospect that could even keep prime minister tony blair from canceling the british referendum and declaring the constitution dead once and for all . blair will meet schröder in berlin on june 13 . uwe hessler -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder 's shuttle diplomacy to save eu germany forced the pace friday as european leaders scrambled to resolve the deep political crisis over the eu constitution , with chancellor gerhard schröder scheduling a series of meetings with eu leaders .

" an emotional reaction is always possible , " said yves christen , head of the swiss pro-eu movement , nomes . polling booths were already open in some parts of the country friday while most postal ballots - a large proportion of votes many areas - had already been cast .
the result is due on sunday . swiss hostile to closer eu ties christen was counting on a 51 to 55 percent " yes " vote in a country that traditionally has shown suspicion if not outright hostility to closer ties with the eu in recent decades . swiss voters , who have the final say on key legislation several times a year , narrowly rejected a broad economic agreement with brussels in 1992 after a heated campaign . another motion by pro-eu campaigners in 2001 calling for eu membership talks was swept aside by 77 percent of voters .
instead , the swiss have approved a host of specialized accords with the eu to ease trade , labor , educational and technical ties in recent years . fear of loss of sovereignty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the entry to the town of schengen in luxembourg .
the schengen area , named after a small town in luxembourg where the treaty was signed in 1985 , now includes 13 eu states , as well as iceland and norway . the agreement abolishes systematic identity checks on travelers within the area and provides for a common visa in return for stronger controls on the area 's outer fringe , as well as closer cooperation between police forces . schengen 's swiss opponents say that amounts to giving up a chunk of their sovereignty to brussels . " we do n't trust an organization that ca n't manage to resolve its enormous internal problems , " said hans fehr , a parliamentarian for the right-wing swiss people 's party -lrb- svp -rrb- and head of an isolationist lobby group , the association for a neutral and independent switzerland -lrb- auns -rrb- . with the vote also covering membership of the eu 's dublin agreement on handling asylum seekers , lurid anti-schengen campaign leaflets have raised fears of rising crime and job losses to illicit immigrant labor . with the exception of the svp , all the major political parties are supporting the step into schengen , which has already been approved by parliament . " the svp is preying on people 's fears , " said didier berberat , a socialist party mp . while access to schengen 's computerized crime database is prized by most police unions in switzerland , it is loathed by swiss left-wingers who oppose the step into the area . " no would mean durable isolation " for many swiss living near austria , france , germany and italy , the outcome will make little difference . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : customs checks on imports and shopping baskets will remain , while many smaller borders posts have already been deserted and given way to random checks .
pro-europeans are eyeing sunday 's result as a guide to the climate in switzerland before another referendum in september . swiss voters are due to give their verdict on the extension of an agreement on the free movement of labor to the eu 's 10 new member states , at the very moment when political debate in western europe is beset by fears about cheaper competition from the east . " if the ' yes ' -lrb- to schengen -rrb- wins , it will be encouraging for the referendum on free movement .
but a ' no ' in september would be a minor disaster : it would mean durable isolation for switzerland , " christen said . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu in agony after constitution fiasco europe agonized over the eu constitution 's future thursday after dutch voters rejected it wednesday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 04.06.2005 exploring einstein 's laboratory großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he has become a cult figure , not only in the world of science an exhibition organized by the max planck institute in berlin pays tribute to the scientist 100 years after he published his theory of relativity and 50 years since his death .
but the show goes much further than that . along berlin ’ s boulevard unter den linden , a series of bright red letters " e " have been installed .
they represent " einstein , " " energy " or " e = mc ² " in places associated with the scientist 's life in the german capital .
these red letters are intended to draw attention to one of the highlights of germany 's current einstein year : the exhibition " chief engineer of the universe . "
it introduces visitors to various competing views in understanding our world .
for the max planck institute for the history of science , which organized the show , albert einstein 's key role in shaping the world view on fundamental questions of the nature of space , gravitation and the invisible forces of magnetism , radiation and electricity makes him the " chief engineer of the universe . "
the feel of a modern laboratory the institute 's professor jürgen renn does not intend to relate a hero 's tale , though .
he says the exhibition " is more an exercise in presenting the adventure of scientific research and its history in an attractive and understandable style . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the exhibit wants to create a certain atmosphere " sure , that 's a challenge , " said renn .
" we 've tried to create an atmosphere , which can also be grasped aesthetically . "
he said the organizers had created something like a giant modern laboratory .
" entering that , the visitor feels the bustle , but also the inquisitiveness that drives these scientists , " said renn .
" these are emotional qualities , which we have tried to put into practice . "
more than just einstein 's face the exhibition is a giant laboratory on three floors .
historic experiments have been set up with original tools .
curious views into the sub-atomic world are made accessible in dark studios .
einstein himself explains scientific advances in original film footage .
for the show , the institute collected more than 1,000 exhibits from around the world .
contemporary documents are on display , some of which have never been published before .
at one point in the exhibition , the audience is suddenly blinded by bright light and left alone in a white room .
exhibition organizer stefan iglhaut explained that this is about looking at the world in a different way .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is probably the most famous photograph of einstein " i think this is an unusual way to make einstein understandable and interesting , " said iglhaut .
" we 're not only explaining his theories , but also finding metaphors and pictures which impress our audience .
we want them to take home more than just einstein 's face . "
everybody knows his face : the weird old guy with the gray mop of hair sticking his tongue out at the world .
but the exhibition communicates the historical context of einstein 's influence and the special challenges which arose for him as a human being and as a scientist .
a desk with a history einstein 's life is illuminated against the background of the political and social upheavals of his time .
visitors follow him from his childhood in the middle-class world of the family electrical business , through his time in switzerland , to the tense world of the jewry caught between anti-semitism and new zionist beginnings .
in 1933 , einstein 's books were burnt by germans just outside the museum .
in the same year , einstein emigrated to the united states , where he experienced " a tense atmosphere of fortified democracy and political mistrust , " said renn .
renn 's favorite exhibit is einstein 's desk .
" he had to leave it behind in berlin when the nazis forced him to emigrate , " he said .
" the french ambassador helped him to have it transferred to his office in princeton .
since then , this is the first time this very moving piece of furniture with its dramatic history has made it back to germany . "
it 's rather unspectacular : a simple , fairly small wooden desk .
but here einstein worked to change the world .
in 1905 , his " special theory of relativity " revolutionized our understanding of space and time , while e = mc ² became the most famous equation in physics .
einstein succeeded in moving young and old einstein once said it was important to never stop asking .
" one can not help but marvel reverently at the secrets of eternity , life and the wonderful structure of reality , " the famous scientist said .

there have been " nos " before - from denmark or ireland over the maastricht and nice treaties , for example .
but the constitution is especially significant and of course the french " no " in particular carries a lot of weight .
if you look at the type of discussions which are now going on , you start to worry that we 're walking on quicksand , and there 's nothing you can do about it . but you get the impression it 's not just hyperbole - after this double " no , " europe seems almost paralyzed . we have to recognize that the constitution was already too late .
it should have happened before the european union took in the ten new members last year .
the 25-strong eu wo n't work with the current body of legislation , because the decision-making processes are so complicated and so difficult . everyone said that , if one country rejected the constitution , then it would n't happen at all , so is n't it already dead as a dodo ? no , not if we handle it properly .
in the draft constitution , it says 20 states have to sign it by october 2006 , two years after it was originally put forward : if not , then the european council has to find other ways ahead .
we 'll have to see whether any country is going to pull out , or whether there 'll have to be a new dialogue with any of them .
but i believe we can only do that if we have a change both in policy and in atmosphere - otherwise the french people wo n't be willing to follow us then either . bildunterschrift : a woman walks past " yes " and " no " campaign posters for france 's referendum on the european union constitution in may , 2005 . you 're saying , then , that the double " no " means that we need a different policy change in europe ? we have to take this seriously because the citizens were n't against the constitution per se .
the constitution makes everything more transparent - you wo n't be able to make decisions behind closed doors anymore - and citizens ' rights , democracy and the authority of the national parliaments vis-à-vis the eu will all be strengthened .
if we go back to the nice treaty again , then the distance between the eu and its citizens will grow even more .
we have to have dialogue - but we do n't have to decide everything .
we do n't have to regulate everything in europe , and especially not in a way that contradicts the principles of competitiveness .
and we also have to make it clear that europe has borders , because people are feeling overwhelmed . european citizens in france and the netherlands said " no , " but the first thing we hear from brussels is " we 'll keep on , " so , we 'll keep on ratifying : is that really the right response to the " non and " née ? " well , i think it 's right that the process of ratification should continue and that the other peoples should be consulted in accordance with their own constitutions .
but the process will only be successful if the consolidation phase i have described really does happen and the people feel that we politicians have received and understood this message . now , let 's assume that perhaps not just five but seven countries say no : would that bury the constitution ? then it really will be as dead as a dodo .
and i fear the european union will then be in a real crisis situation - because of the decision-making apparatus and because we will , in the long run , still be so detached that there will be less and less support for the european ideal . could you imagine renegotiating the constitution treaty piecemeal to meet some countries halfway ? it has to be dealt with the same way in each country .

dutch voters overwhelmingly rejected the treaty .
it really is a pandora 's box : but we 've got a breakdown of the vote which shows how mixed the messages from france were .

it 's a very unusual situation : the french president amongst the ashes his presidency ; the german chancellor - the other half of the franco-german engine - weakened by new elections ; tony blair re-elected but also probably on the way ; berlusconi in difficulties ; things in poland unclear .
who exactly is going to pull the european carriage out of the ditch ? well , firstly , having managed to make such a mess , these gentlemen now have a chance to mount a rescue attempt as their swan-song : for example , they could quickly agree on financial prospects for the next seven years and thereby demonstrate their competence . secondly , : the leadership of europe is up for grabs and it should be the job of the european commission to take care of that as jaques delors once did .
the commission president jose manuel barroso needs to get on with it . is he strong enough ? he knows exactly what 's at stake .
i have the impression that he only needs the will - and to see - that he has a central role to play . for perhaps the first time in the last ten years , you can not ignore the real scepticism about europe right across the political spectrum .
various things are behind it : fear of globalization , fear of the franco-german directorate . where does this euroscepticism come from ?
is the brussels dreamboat , for example , a bit too far above people 's heads ? yes , on the one hand , you have to realize that this is a scepticism about politics as a whole , because at least half the motivation for the " no " in both countries had its roots in domestic politics .

people believe more and more outsiders are coming in while there 's already 10- 12 percent unemployment and they think they are going to take their jobs - and at the same time , they see that in the context of the negotiations with turkey .
all this has had disastrous psychological consequences , especially when politicians did not set out to win people over . i mean , the politicians should have known this : they always say , europe is too expensive and the commission did this or that without asking us , although they all agreed to it . if your policies on europe are always going to follow the same pattern where , in the first sentence , you say " i 'm in favor of europe " and then you come up with three pages blaming your failures on the eu , well , then there 's the problem .
i do n't think the german government 's policies are much different to those of other countries : " when the sun shines , it was berlin , when it rains , it was brussels . " does expansion have to stop ? i think so . in two weeks , 25 heads of state and government will meet for what could be a crisis summit .
from an mep 's perspective , what signal should it send europe 's citizens ? it would be great if they could manage to sort out the future finances .
it would give a boost by demonstrating competence .
also , they have to say to the people : " we have got your message .
we have to do some things differently . "
and if they really manage to do that , in the next 12 months we will be able to approach the people with the continuing process of ratification , because they will say that the constitution is o.k. and that the leaders have learnt how to deal with such a constitution properly . europe should be more modest ? yes , it has to be more modest : we should have more confidence in the people .
and we have to recognize one thing in particular : in a democracy , objective reality is n't reality , it 's what people see as reality .

if you look at the type of discussions which are now going on , you start to worry that we 're walking on quicksand , and there 's nothing you can do about it . but you get the impression it 's not just hyperbole - after this double " no , " europe seems almost paralyzed . we have to recognize that the constitution was already too late .
it should have happened before the european union took in the ten new members last year .
the 25-strong eu wo n't work with the current body of legislation , because the decision-making processes are so complicated and so difficult . everyone said that , if one country rejected the constitution , then it would n't happen at all , so is n't it already dead as a dodo ? no , not if we handle it properly .
in the draft constitution , it says 20 states have to sign it by october 2006 , two years after it was originally put forward : if not , then the european council has to find other ways ahead .
we 'll have to see whether any country is going to pull out , or whether there 'll have to be a new dialogue with any of them .
but i believe we can only do that if we have a change both in policy and in atmosphere - otherwise the french people wo n't be willing to follow us then either . bildunterschrift : a woman walks past " yes " and " no " campaign posters for france 's referendum on the european union constitution in may , 2005 . you 're saying , then , that the double " no " means that we need a different policy change in europe ? we have to take this seriously because the citizens were n't against the constitution per se .
the constitution makes everything more transparent - you wo n't be able to make decisions behind closed doors anymore - and citizens ' rights , democracy and the authority of the national parliaments vis-à-vis the eu will all be strengthened .
if we go back to the nice treaty again , then the distance between the eu and its citizens will grow even more .
we have to have dialogue - but we do n't have to decide everything .
we do n't have to regulate everything in europe , and especially not in a way that contradicts the principles of competitiveness .
and we also have to make it clear that europe has borders , because people are feeling overwhelmed . european citizens in france and the netherlands said " no , " but the first thing we hear from brussels is " we 'll keep on , " so , we 'll keep on ratifying : is that really the right response to the " non and " née ? " well , i think it 's right that the process of ratification should continue and that the other peoples should be consulted in accordance with their own constitutions .
but the process will only be successful if the consolidation phase i have described really does happen and the people feel that we politicians have received and understood this message . now , let 's assume that perhaps not just five but seven countries say no : would that bury the constitution ? then it really will be as dead as a dodo .
and i fear the european union will then be in a real crisis situation - because of the decision-making apparatus and because we will , in the long run , still be so detached that there will be less and less support for the european ideal . could you imagine renegotiating the constitution treaty piecemeal to meet some countries halfway ? it has to be dealt with the same way in each country .
we 've now got 11 countries which have ratified it .
we 'd have to start from scratch again . is n't that a pandora 's box ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : socialist party supporters celebrate in amsterdam , netherlands , after the announcement of preliminary results of the referendum on the proposed european union constitution .
dutch voters overwhelmingly rejected the treaty .
it really is a pandora 's box : but we 've got a breakdown of the vote which shows how mixed the messages from france were .
le pen and the far right sent a completely different message to the left wing , who were talking about a great social europe .
that , in turn , put the british and scandinavians off .
we have to emphasize that , in a federation of 25 countries , not everyone will be able to specify exactly what he wants to have . europe is in crisis and one should n't just ask what to do but who should actually do it ?
it 's a very unusual situation : the french president amongst the ashes his presidency ; the german chancellor - the other half of the franco-german engine - weakened by new elections ; tony blair re-elected but also probably on the way ; berlusconi in difficulties ; things in poland unclear .
who exactly is going to pull the european carriage out of the ditch ? well , firstly , having managed to make such a mess , these gentlemen now have a chance to mount a rescue attempt as their swan-song : for example , they could quickly agree on financial prospects for the next seven years and thereby demonstrate their competence . secondly , : the leadership of europe is up for grabs and it should be the job of the european commission to take care of that as jaques delors once did .
the commission president jose manuel barroso needs to get on with it . is he strong enough ? he knows exactly what 's at stake .
i have the impression that he only needs the will - and to see - that he has a central role to play . for perhaps the first time in the last ten years , you can not ignore the real scepticism about europe right across the political spectrum .
various things are behind it : fear of globalization , fear of the franco-german directorate . where does this euroscepticism come from ?
is the brussels dreamboat , for example , a bit too far above people 's heads ? yes , on the one hand , you have to realize that this is a scepticism about politics as a whole , because at least half the motivation for the " no " in both countries had its roots in domestic politics .
the belgian government only has the support of 19 percent of the voters , and raffarin and chirac 's popularity is stellar , to put it ironically . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dark clouds hover over the eu but on the other hand , we have to admit that we did n't explain that eu expansion had political and economic advantages .
people believe more and more outsiders are coming in while there 's already 10- 12 percent unemployment and they think they are going to take their jobs - and at the same time , they see that in the context of the negotiations with turkey .
all this has had disastrous psychological consequences , especially when politicians did not set out to win people over . i mean , the politicians should have known this : they always say , europe is too expensive and the commission did this or that without asking us , although they all agreed to it . if your policies on europe are always going to follow the same pattern where , in the first sentence , you say " i 'm in favor of europe " and then you come up with three pages blaming your failures on the eu , well , then there 's the problem .
i do n't think the german government 's policies are much different to those of other countries : " when the sun shines , it was berlin , when it rains , it was brussels . " does expansion have to stop ? i think so . in two weeks , 25 heads of state and government will meet for what could be a crisis summit .
from an mep 's perspective , what signal should it send europe 's citizens ? it would be great if they could manage to sort out the future finances .
it would give a boost by demonstrating competence .
also , they have to say to the people : " we have got your message .
we have to do some things differently . "
and if they really manage to do that , in the next 12 months we will be able to approach the people with the continuing process of ratification , because they will say that the constitution is o.k. and that the leaders have learnt how to deal with such a constitution properly . europe should be more modest ? yes , it has to be more modest : we should have more confidence in the people .
and we have to recognize one thing in particular : in a democracy , objective reality is n't reality , it 's what people see as reality .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 04.06.2005 exploring einstein 's laboratory großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he has become a cult figure , not only in the world of science an exhibition organized by the max planck institute in berlin pays tribute to the scientist 100 years after he published his theory of relativity and 50 years since his death .
but the show goes much further than that . along berlin ’ s boulevard unter den linden , a series of bright red letters " e " have been installed .
they represent " einstein , " " energy " or " e = mc ² " in places associated with the scientist 's life in the german capital .
these red letters are intended to draw attention to one of the highlights of germany 's current einstein year : the exhibition " chief engineer of the universe . "
it introduces visitors to various competing views in understanding our world .
for the max planck institute for the history of science , which organized the show , albert einstein 's key role in shaping the world view on fundamental questions of the nature of space , gravitation and the invisible forces of magnetism , radiation and electricity makes him the " chief engineer of the universe . "
the feel of a modern laboratory the institute 's professor jürgen renn does not intend to relate a hero 's tale , though .
he says the exhibition " is more an exercise in presenting the adventure of scientific research and its history in an attractive and understandable style . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the exhibit wants to create a certain atmosphere " sure , that 's a challenge , " said renn .
" we 've tried to create an atmosphere , which can also be grasped aesthetically . "
he said the organizers had created something like a giant modern laboratory .
" entering that , the visitor feels the bustle , but also the inquisitiveness that drives these scientists , " said renn .
" these are emotional qualities , which we have tried to put into practice . "
more than just einstein 's face the exhibition is a giant laboratory on three floors .
historic experiments have been set up with original tools .
curious views into the sub-atomic world are made accessible in dark studios .
einstein himself explains scientific advances in original film footage .
for the show , the institute collected more than 1,000 exhibits from around the world .
contemporary documents are on display , some of which have never been published before .
at one point in the exhibition , the audience is suddenly blinded by bright light and left alone in a white room .
exhibition organizer stefan iglhaut explained that this is about looking at the world in a different way .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is probably the most famous photograph of einstein " i think this is an unusual way to make einstein understandable and interesting , " said iglhaut .
" we 're not only explaining his theories , but also finding metaphors and pictures which impress our audience .
we want them to take home more than just einstein 's face . "
everybody knows his face : the weird old guy with the gray mop of hair sticking his tongue out at the world .
but the exhibition communicates the historical context of einstein 's influence and the special challenges which arose for him as a human being and as a scientist .
a desk with a history einstein 's life is illuminated against the background of the political and social upheavals of his time .
visitors follow him from his childhood in the middle-class world of the family electrical business , through his time in switzerland , to the tense world of the jewry caught between anti-semitism and new zionist beginnings .
in 1933 , einstein 's books were burnt by germans just outside the museum .
in the same year , einstein emigrated to the united states , where he experienced " a tense atmosphere of fortified democracy and political mistrust , " said renn .
renn 's favorite exhibit is einstein 's desk .
" he had to leave it behind in berlin when the nazis forced him to emigrate , " he said .
" the french ambassador helped him to have it transferred to his office in princeton .
since then , this is the first time this very moving piece of furniture with its dramatic history has made it back to germany . "
it 's rather unspectacular : a simple , fairly small wooden desk .
but here einstein worked to change the world .
in 1905 , his " special theory of relativity " revolutionized our understanding of space and time , while e = mc ² became the most famous equation in physics .
einstein succeeded in moving young and old einstein once said it was important to never stop asking .
" one can not help but marvel reverently at the secrets of eternity , life and the wonderful structure of reality , " the famous scientist said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors can also see einstein 's impact on the world today throughout the exhibition , more than 50 multimedia stations encourage visitors to ask their own questions .
it concludes with einstein 's impact on today 's science and culture .
twenty-four seats are arranged along a white conference table .
one after another , today 's leading scientists give their views on the " secrets of eternity , life and the wonderful structure of reality . "
einstein , his colleagues and this exhibition have succeeded in moving young and old .
the success of this exhibition is that it maintains a balance between historical reflection on successive changes in world views , information on the life and work of albert einstein - the " chief engineer of the universe " - and how these themes relate to challenges that we face today . peter zimmermann -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de following in einstein 's footsteps as part of the " einstein year " , which the 50th anniversary of the death of the physicist and the 100th jubilee of the relativity theory , enthusiasts can trace the path of the genius across germany .

for 6 june is exactly 30 years to the day since the votes were counted in the only nationwide referendum the british people have ever had on europe .
the choice was whether or not britain should stay in the european common market , having joined just two years earlier .
to start with , two-thirds of the public wanted britain out , but by end the figures were exactly reversed .
so how did this remarkable transformation come about ?
it 's a tragi-comic tale of high politics and low cunning that yoked together the strangest of bedfellows .
it was rather like tip-toeing into a brothel lord hurd on this day : 1975 vote from the start of the campaign it was clear that there was nothing like a balance of power between the two sides .
the yes campaign was well staffed , well funded and well organised and consisted of like-minded people from the centre ground of the three main parties - tories , labour and liberals .
the no campaign by contrast was far less compatible .
it came largely from the left wing of the labour party , the right wing of the tories and the far fringes beyond from the national front to the communist party .
and they had minimal resources .
" we were operating on a shoe-string compared to the rolls royce operation on the other side , " recalled john mills , national agent of the no campaign .
' slightly daring ' the leader of the yes campaign was the europhile labour home secretary roy jenkins .
he was delighted to share public platforms with top tories and liberals .
" of course we did n't know each other very well to start with , " said the former conservative minister douglas hurd .
" there was a slightly daring feel about working together with people who were normally your political enemies .
" it was rather like tip-toeing into a brothel .
you felt that you were doing something which might or might not be pleasant but was certainly rather risque . "
the yes campaign won 67 % of the vote 30 years ago the no campaign eschewed such dangerous liaisons .
and the fact that leading anti-marketeers included such figures as enoch powell , tony benn and dr ian paisley played into the hands of the pro-europeans ' strategy .
" the whole thrust of our campaign was to depict the anti-marketeers as unreliable people - dangerous people who would lead you down the wrong path , " said the yes campaign treasurer , lord mcalpine .
" it was n't so much that it was sensible to stay in , but that anybody who proposed that we came out was off their rocker or virtually marxist . "
i put this point to tony benn , who was then labour 's industry minister - saying that opinion polls at the time all gave a negative rating to the leading no campaigners like himself and powell - while the yes men all had a positive rating .
" if you have n't got a single newspaper supporting you , you do n't expect good coverage , " he said .
" it 's quite straightforward - nothing strange about it . "
margaret thatcher has now come round to my view tony benn tony benn had a point .
thirty years ago all the press was pro-europe , including rupert murdoch 's sun , the daily mail and the daily telegraph .
it was a world turned on its head .
at the time one of the leading pro-marketeers was the newly-elected leader of the conservative party , margaret thatcher .
she turned out in a sweater made up from the flags of all the nine common market countries and called for " a big yes vote for europe " .
when the referendum votes were counted 30 years ago , it was clear the well-oiled yes machine had succeeded in dramatically transforming public opinion .
constitution vote so how does tony benn see things now ?
" you have to make your case - and sometimes you win , sometimes you lose .
but in the sense that margaret thatcher has now come round to my view , rupert murdoch has now come round to my view , it was n't unsuccessful , was it ? "
back in 1975 , the combined forces of the political establishment , the national press and a sophisticated marketing campaign persuaded a doubtful public of the case for saying yes .
but in 2005 would a sceptical , if not cynical , british public be convinced in the same way ?
the governments of france and the netherlands failed spectacularly to secure a yes verdict , despite having similar apparent advantages .
and tony blair 's government clearly has no appetite to share their experience .
michael cockerell 's film " how we fell for europe " was broadcast on bbc two at 20:25bst on saturday , 4 june , 2005 .

for 6 june is exactly 30 years to the day since the votes were counted in the only nationwide referendum the british people have ever had on europe .
the choice was whether or not britain should stay in the european common market , having joined just two years earlier .
to start with , two-thirds of the public wanted britain out , but by end the figures were exactly reversed .
so how did this remarkable transformation come about ?
it 's a tragi-comic tale of high politics and low cunning that yoked together the strangest of bedfellows .
it was rather like tip-toeing into a brothel lord hurd on this day : 1975 vote from the start of the campaign it was clear that there was nothing like a balance of power between the two sides .
the yes campaign was well staffed , well funded and well organised and consisted of like-minded people from the centre ground of the three main parties - tories , labour and liberals .
the no campaign by contrast was far less compatible .
it came largely from the left wing of the labour party , the right wing of the tories and the far fringes beyond from the national front to the communist party .
and they had minimal resources .
" we were operating on a shoe-string compared to the rolls royce operation on the other side , " recalled john mills , national agent of the no campaign .
' slightly daring ' the leader of the yes campaign was the europhile labour home secretary roy jenkins .
he was delighted to share public platforms with top tories and liberals .
" of course we did n't know each other very well to start with , " said the former conservative minister douglas hurd .
" there was a slightly daring feel about working together with people who were normally your political enemies .
" it was rather like tip-toeing into a brothel .
you felt that you were doing something which might or might not be pleasant but was certainly rather risque . "
the yes campaign won 67 % of the vote 30 years ago the no campaign eschewed such dangerous liaisons .
and the fact that leading anti-marketeers included such figures as enoch powell , tony benn and dr ian paisley played into the hands of the pro-europeans ' strategy .
" the whole thrust of our campaign was to depict the anti-marketeers as unreliable people - dangerous people who would lead you down the wrong path , " said the yes campaign treasurer , lord mcalpine .
" it was n't so much that it was sensible to stay in , but that anybody who proposed that we came out was off their rocker or virtually marxist . "
i put this point to tony benn , who was then labour 's industry minister - saying that opinion polls at the time all gave a negative rating to the leading no campaigners like himself and powell - while the yes men all had a positive rating .
" if you have n't got a single newspaper supporting you , you do n't expect good coverage , " he said .
" it 's quite straightforward - nothing strange about it . "
margaret thatcher has now come round to my view tony benn tony benn had a point .
thirty years ago all the press was pro-europe , including rupert murdoch 's sun , the daily mail and the daily telegraph .
it was a world turned on its head .
