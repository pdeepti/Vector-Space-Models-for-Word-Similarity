a recent and fatal teenage attack on a seven-year-old boy near berlin has promoted cries from the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- for germany to review its liberal approach to dealing with criminals , however young they are . it was a particularly brutal and gratuitous crime , in which a boy of 16 beat an innocent child and neighbor to death , and subsequently attributed his violence to " personal frustration . "
it can be of no surprise to anyone that such savage behavior should unleash calls for tighter measures to prevent any future repetition of such tragedies .
but opinions on exactly how to deal with germany 's delinquent youngsters vary enormously .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a correction center in northern germany some say they should be given the benefit of the doubt on the grounds that they can not be held fully responsible for their own actions until they come of age .
others refute such claims as dangerously naïve , bellowing that acts of such evil ill-will should be paid for through the iron bars of a correction center .
there are currently some 6,000 criminals serving their time in juvenile offenders institutes across the country , but if the cdu had its way , that figure could be far higher .
in a statement issued following the horrific juvenile attack last month , chairman of the cdu berlin parliamentary group , andreas gram , and cdu legal expert , nicolas zimmer , called for a radical rethink .
" the soft touch era is finally over .
the justice system should react more swiftly to the first cases and signs of a criminal career , and be quicker to sentence violent young criminals to imprisonment , " they said .
no more coddling among other things , they propose detaining " profoundly dangerous and criminal children and youths " in special purpose , enclosed premises and reducing the age of criminal responsibility below its current minimum of 14 .
they have also called for the regulation which currently allows young adults up to the age of 21 to be tried under juvenile law , to be replaced by a statute which would treat them according to the same laws as adults .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu want youngsters to be tried as adults the warden of berlin 's plötzensee correctional institute for juveniles , marius fiedler , says that such debates date back decades , and that they are too general to be widely effective .
" you always just have to do the right thing , and you can only do that by looking at each individual case .
it 's a matter of recognizing the problems early on and steering the youngsters in the right direction . "
he added that there is only one 16 year-old inmate at the berlin center and none who are younger .
so does that render the cdu plea to reduce the age of accountability unnecessary , or is it an indication that the system is simply too lax ?
prevention is better than cure fact is , germany is not particularly tough on its young lawbreakers .
chairman of the juvenile court association bernd sonnen says the system is geared to try and work with criminal youngsters in such a way that they can avoid being incarcerated and prevent a career in crime before it is too late .
" between 66 and 69 percent of youth crimes in germany are resolved out of court .
the offenders can repair damage they have caused , they can take part in anti-aggression training or in mediated face to face sessions with their victims , " he explained .
" the success rate of the latter is particularly successful , and the advantage is that they do not become labeled criminals which is often a self-fulfilling prophecy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as many as 69 percent of youth crimes never make it to court but that is of little consolation to the victims of the crimes which continue to be part of the fabric of society here . sonnen says he can understand the calls to lock delinquents away , and the belief that a harder stance will prevent re-offending , but adds that it simply is n't the truth of the matter .
" sure , putting people behind bars is the toughest measure we have on offer , but it is also proven that it creates the highest rate of repeat offending .
when someone has been locked up for a given period and is then suddenly set free , they are highly likely to just go out and commit another crime , " he said .
rise in violent juvenile crime marius fiedler agrees that a jail sentence should be an absolute last resort .
" of course there are countries which are much tougher with their young criminals .
the state of california locks away about eight times the number of juveniles that we do , but are crime levels there are lower as a result ? " the governor asked .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the overwhelming majority of prisoners in germany are male sixty percent of the 554 male prisoners detained at the berlin young offenders institute are there as a result of committing violent crimes , from armed robbery to murder , and the picture is much the same across germany as a whole .
although crimes such as theft are declining , reported incidences of juvenile violence are indeed on the rise , but sonnen says the onus is on the word reported .
" we have become sensitized to violence and we are prepared to do something about it , to denounce violent crime .
whereas ten years ago school directors would have denied any sign of brutality in their establishments , they are now willing to admit that the problem exists , " he explained .
family problems and more often than not , the problem is the consequence of other , personal problems which date back to early childhood days .

for some it is the best they have ever known .

a recent and fatal teenage attack on a seven-year-old boy near berlin has promoted cries from the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- for germany to review its liberal approach to dealing with criminals , however young they are . it was a particularly brutal and gratuitous crime , in which a boy of 16 beat an innocent child and neighbor to death , and subsequently attributed his violence to " personal frustration . "
it can be of no surprise to anyone that such savage behavior should unleash calls for tighter measures to prevent any future repetition of such tragedies .
but opinions on exactly how to deal with germany 's delinquent youngsters vary enormously .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a correction center in northern germany some say they should be given the benefit of the doubt on the grounds that they can not be held fully responsible for their own actions until they come of age .
others refute such claims as dangerously naïve , bellowing that acts of such evil ill-will should be paid for through the iron bars of a correction center .
there are currently some 6,000 criminals serving their time in juvenile offenders institutes across the country , but if the cdu had its way , that figure could be far higher .
in a statement issued following the horrific juvenile attack last month , chairman of the cdu berlin parliamentary group , andreas gram , and cdu legal expert , nicolas zimmer , called for a radical rethink .
" the soft touch era is finally over .
the justice system should react more swiftly to the first cases and signs of a criminal career , and be quicker to sentence violent young criminals to imprisonment , " they said .
no more coddling among other things , they propose detaining " profoundly dangerous and criminal children and youths " in special purpose , enclosed premises and reducing the age of criminal responsibility below its current minimum of 14 .
they have also called for the regulation which currently allows young adults up to the age of 21 to be tried under juvenile law , to be replaced by a statute which would treat them according to the same laws as adults .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu want youngsters to be tried as adults the warden of berlin 's plötzensee correctional institute for juveniles , marius fiedler , says that such debates date back decades , and that they are too general to be widely effective .
" you always just have to do the right thing , and you can only do that by looking at each individual case .
it 's a matter of recognizing the problems early on and steering the youngsters in the right direction . "
he added that there is only one 16 year-old inmate at the berlin center and none who are younger .
so does that render the cdu plea to reduce the age of accountability unnecessary , or is it an indication that the system is simply too lax ?
prevention is better than cure fact is , germany is not particularly tough on its young lawbreakers .
chairman of the juvenile court association bernd sonnen says the system is geared to try and work with criminal youngsters in such a way that they can avoid being incarcerated and prevent a career in crime before it is too late .
" between 66 and 69 percent of youth crimes in germany are resolved out of court .
the offenders can repair damage they have caused , they can take part in anti-aggression training or in mediated face to face sessions with their victims , " he explained .
" the success rate of the latter is particularly successful , and the advantage is that they do not become labeled criminals which is often a self-fulfilling prophecy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as many as 69 percent of youth crimes never make it to court but that is of little consolation to the victims of the crimes which continue to be part of the fabric of society here . sonnen says he can understand the calls to lock delinquents away , and the belief that a harder stance will prevent re-offending , but adds that it simply is n't the truth of the matter .
" sure , putting people behind bars is the toughest measure we have on offer , but it is also proven that it creates the highest rate of repeat offending .
when someone has been locked up for a given period and is then suddenly set free , they are highly likely to just go out and commit another crime , " he said .
rise in violent juvenile crime marius fiedler agrees that a jail sentence should be an absolute last resort .
" of course there are countries which are much tougher with their young criminals .

accordingly , the league is finding it hard to attract the world 's best players . both domestically and abroad , the only consistently serious contender in german soccer is fc bayern munich .
the bavarian club is the bundesliga 's traditional powerhouse and the home of past german greats like midfielder franz beckenbauer , goal-scoring maestro gerd müller and keeper sepp maier . the club is also the place to find current stars like oliver kahn , michael ballack and bastian schweinsteiger .
but bayern 's strength is the rest of the league 's weakness and without munich holding the banner high , german soccer would have a hard time being represented in international competitions such as the champions league .
" germany is lacking , with the exception of bayern munich , clubs with international power , " was the assessment of hamburg sv president bernd hoffmann in an interview with the tagesspiegel newspaper .
" the bundesliga is not the top place for stars to be playing .
we don ’ t have the financial strength like the english clubs and have not been successful the past few years , " he said .

european club scouts are travelling around the world to seek the next pele .
if you scour the rosters of bundesliga clubs , then you wouldn ’ t necessarily know that you are looking at a german club .
whether it be lucio , d ’ alessandro , vittek or van der vaart , the big names in the league are no longer a " who ’ s who " of german soccer .
in the 2004-05 season , only the english premiership had more foreign players -lrb- 56 percent -rrb- than the bundeliga ’ s 48 percent .
heading into the 2005-06 season , that percentage dropped down to 42.6 percent as cost-cutting measures increase .
financial woes have forced club management to rethink policies .
" i think that the clubs learned their lesson after the kirch -lrb- media company -rrb- crisis , " said german soccer league -lrb- dfl -rrb- managing director christian seifert before the season .
" they are investing more in their youth programs . "
nevertheless , the transfer deadline which expired on august 31 , revealed that clubs would not hesitate to improve their lot by turning to players from abroad .
young brazilians , some of whom shined at the under-20 world championships this summer , figured in many of the deals .
dortmund 's bad example the bosses at borussia dortmund could talk all day long about how costly foreign talent can be .
it almost cost the club its league license .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : borussia dortmund stood on the brink of ruin after taking the 1997 champions league , the ruhr valley club went on a spending spree .
to finance the expensive transfers , the club decided , among other things , to go public and list itself on the stock exchange during the high-flying days of the internet boom .
to pull it off , the whole scheme was dependent on one thing - winning .
this they failed to do and dortmund was just a hair away from declaring bankruptcy last season .
it may sound dumb but the financial health off the field and the success on it rests more and more on the ability of the team directors to find talent before they blossom , that is , before they become overpriced .
bayern recipe for success some complain munich have an unfair advantage in that if a good player wants true international recognition , he will receive it in the bavarian capital .
it becomes an upward spiral of success .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international midfielder sebastian deisler is not a starter at bayern munich the team wins , receives more money which it can spend , and in turn , get better players when needed .
still , being a very good german player , even being on the national squad , is no guarantee for success at bayern .
just talk to sebastian deisler and bastian schweinsteiger who both frequently are used as substitutes .
" there aren ’ t many german players who can play at the level demanded by bayern munich , " bayern coach felix magath said recently .
the gaps are filled in by exceptional , but not necessarily exorbitantly-priced players , such as the central defenders lucio from brazil and valérien ismaël from france or dutch striker roy makaay .
but as if to highlight the deficits of german club soccer , none of those three play exceptional roles in their national teams . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new crop of brazilians in bundesliga before the transfer window came to a close on aug .

accordingly , the league is finding it hard to attract the world 's best players . both domestically and abroad , the only consistently serious contender in german soccer is fc bayern munich .
the bavarian club is the bundesliga 's traditional powerhouse and the home of past german greats like midfielder franz beckenbauer , goal-scoring maestro gerd müller and keeper sepp maier . the club is also the place to find current stars like oliver kahn , michael ballack and bastian schweinsteiger .
but bayern 's strength is the rest of the league 's weakness and without munich holding the banner high , german soccer would have a hard time being represented in international competitions such as the champions league .
" germany is lacking , with the exception of bayern munich , clubs with international power , " was the assessment of hamburg sv president bernd hoffmann in an interview with the tagesspiegel newspaper .
" the bundesliga is not the top place for stars to be playing .
we don ’ t have the financial strength like the english clubs and have not been successful the past few years , " he said .

the chancellor , who was largely written off by political analysts in recent months , has managed to halve the gap in the last week after a televised debate with merkel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " wherever i go , i encounter a lot of support .
the tide is turning , " schröder was quoted as telling the sunday edition of the bild newspaper . " at the end of the day , it is the voters who decide who will become their next chancellor . "
the chancellor , whose personal approval ratings have jumped by 11 points since august according to one poll , said the latest polls prove that " the supposed mood for change no longer exists " among the electorate and announced a few extra rallies for the final week of campaigning .
cdu losing ground by contrast , the cdu and their sister bavarian party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- appeared to be faltering in the last days leading up to the election .
several leading surveys at the weekend showed the cdu / csu losing ground , raising conservatives ' fears that they could once again squander a big lead to schröder , who rallied from 12 points behind in six weeks to win the last election in 2002 .
one poll by the emnid institute showed the cdu dropping 1.5 points to 40.5 percent of the vote last week , while the spd surged 3.5 points to 34 percent .
the spd has now gained 8 points in the last month while the cdu has lost 3 points .
another opinion poll showed that the cdu / csu and their preferred coalition partner , the free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- would fall just short of the 48.5 percent of votes needed for a governing majority .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many believe that the most likely outcome of the elections thus would be a so-called " grand coalition " between merkel 's conservatives and the spd with her as chancellor .
but her allies fear that this would make it impossible to implement changes intended to push-start germany 's spluttering economy .
" it is a nightmare vision , " the prime minister of the eastern state of saxony , georg milbrandt , has warned .
" it is pointless to think that a grand coalition could get things moving . "
the kirchhof factor the conservatives ' campaign has also been hit by the appointment by merkel of paul kirchhof as the party 's shadow finance minister if the cdu / csu came to power .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kirchhof -lrb- photo -rrb- , a former constitutional judge and heidelberg university professor who has proposed radical tax reforms and committed a series of political gaffes in media interviews , has become a sort of punching bag for the spd .
schröder , who has slammed merkel 's reform vision as cold and inhuman and painted a grim picture of what it would do to germany 's social welfare system , has also repeatedly attacked kirchhof .
the chancellor has stressed that kirchhof 's tax reforms , including a flat 25 percent tax rate without tax breaks , are unrealistic - a tactic that pollster say has begun to affect voters who are already scared off by kirchhof .
" kirchhof has unleashed a wave of insecurity among voters , " richard hilmer , head of infratest dimap , told reuters .
" if this trend continues , schröder could even reach his goal of 38 percent .
in any case , the chances of a spd coalition with the greens and fdp are much higher now . "
damage control merkel and several other cdu leaders have now begun to distance themselves from kirchhof and instead hinted that they might try and get back friedrich merz , a respected finance expert and former head of the cdu parliamentary faction .
the fdp meanwhile held a one-day conference in berlin on sunday at which party leaders downplayed the bad news from the polling institutes and defended merkel 's reform vision .
bildunterschrift : but the press reported sunday that fdp leader guido westerwelle -lrb- photo -rrb- too was trying to distance the party from radical tax reform proposals by paul kirchhof .
" this election is not just about clever people 's big dreams , it is about creating jobs for germans , " daily der tagespiegel quoted him as saying .
the weekly magazine der spiegel on sunday said kirchhof , " was becoming a liability " and putting at risk merkel 's hopes of avoiding a grand coalition . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no miracle cure for german economy for an election that is being fought on economic issues , many germans seem to believe that the fortunes of europe 's biggest economy will not change even if conservative challenger angela merkel wins the sept .

but over the weekend , it was n't cellists and violinists at center stage , rather djs , breakdancers and beat boxers . at leipzig 's kohlrabizirkus venue , technicians were busy behind huge boards during sound check .
the bass and treble levels have to be perfectly balanced since the world 's best djs were about to go head to head during this first hop-hop championship . the hip hop world challenge , hosted by top german hip-hop star thomas d and the american mc freestyle , aimed to demonstrate germany 's openness to youth culture and artistic expression .
it was supported by the cultural fund of the german football federation , which is eager to show the country in the best possible light ahead of the 2006 fifa world cup , which will take place in germany next summer . still , that the fund 's committee would give the green light for a hip-hop competition was nonetheless a surprise to organizer norbert seiler , known to hip-hop fans as " parago . " " hip hop is an integral part of german youth culture today , " seiler told dw-world .
" everyone runs around in baggy pants , you can see it in the language , in the music .
so i told the committee , if you want to encourage culture - and the point of the cultural program is to show germany as a tolerant and artistically cosmopolitan host country - then the hip-hop fest ca n't be left out . " more than just music since its beginnings in the mid-eighties , hip-hop has developed from an underground subculture to an art form with three disciplines .
for the hip-hop world challenge , participants competed in break-dance , beat box , and dj skills . bildunterschrift : hip hop world challenge 2005 " break dancing is a kind of rhythmical floor acrobatics .
these are the kids that roll on their backs and pedal the air with their feet and stand on one hand , " seiler said .
" the djs play with records , scratching them and juggling the beats .
in beat box you make sounds and rhythms with your own voice , there 's no instruments allowed . " among the competitors at the hip hop world challenge was the belgian threesome pyro-man .
in perfect rhythmic and melodic harmony , the trio beat boxed effortlessly between styles .
pyro-man member jerome said beat boxing allowed him full artistic freedom . " beat box offers you all possible stylistic options ; you are n't restricted in any way .
pop , jungle , drum and bass , funk , punk : anything goes , " said jerome . scratching and juggling the beats the french dj pfel then took center stage .

the chancellor , who was largely written off by political analysts in recent months , has managed to halve the gap in the last week after a televised debate with merkel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " wherever i go , i encounter a lot of support .
the tide is turning , " schröder was quoted as telling the sunday edition of the bild newspaper . " at the end of the day , it is the voters who decide who will become their next chancellor . "
the chancellor , whose personal approval ratings have jumped by 11 points since august according to one poll , said the latest polls prove that " the supposed mood for change no longer exists " among the electorate and announced a few extra rallies for the final week of campaigning .
cdu losing ground by contrast , the cdu and their sister bavarian party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- appeared to be faltering in the last days leading up to the election .
several leading surveys at the weekend showed the cdu / csu losing ground , raising conservatives ' fears that they could once again squander a big lead to schröder , who rallied from 12 points behind in six weeks to win the last election in 2002 .
one poll by the emnid institute showed the cdu dropping 1.5 points to 40.5 percent of the vote last week , while the spd surged 3.5 points to 34 percent .
the spd has now gained 8 points in the last month while the cdu has lost 3 points .
another opinion poll showed that the cdu / csu and their preferred coalition partner , the free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- would fall just short of the 48.5 percent of votes needed for a governing majority .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many believe that the most likely outcome of the elections thus would be a so-called " grand coalition " between merkel 's conservatives and the spd with her as chancellor .
but her allies fear that this would make it impossible to implement changes intended to push-start germany 's spluttering economy .
" it is a nightmare vision , " the prime minister of the eastern state of saxony , georg milbrandt , has warned .
" it is pointless to think that a grand coalition could get things moving . "
the kirchhof factor the conservatives ' campaign has also been hit by the appointment by merkel of paul kirchhof as the party 's shadow finance minister if the cdu / csu came to power .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kirchhof -lrb- photo -rrb- , a former constitutional judge and heidelberg university professor who has proposed radical tax reforms and committed a series of political gaffes in media interviews , has become a sort of punching bag for the spd .
schröder , who has slammed merkel 's reform vision as cold and inhuman and painted a grim picture of what it would do to germany 's social welfare system , has also repeatedly attacked kirchhof .
the chancellor has stressed that kirchhof 's tax reforms , including a flat 25 percent tax rate without tax breaks , are unrealistic - a tactic that pollster say has begun to affect voters who are already scared off by kirchhof .
" kirchhof has unleashed a wave of insecurity among voters , " richard hilmer , head of infratest dimap , told reuters .
" if this trend continues , schröder could even reach his goal of 38 percent .
in any case , the chances of a spd coalition with the greens and fdp are much higher now . "
damage control merkel and several other cdu leaders have now begun to distance themselves from kirchhof and instead hinted that they might try and get back friedrich merz , a respected finance expert and former head of the cdu parliamentary faction .
the fdp meanwhile held a one-day conference in berlin on sunday at which party leaders downplayed the bad news from the polling institutes and defended merkel 's reform vision .
bildunterschrift : but the press reported sunday that fdp leader guido westerwelle -lrb- photo -rrb- too was trying to distance the party from radical tax reform proposals by paul kirchhof .
" this election is not just about clever people 's big dreams , it is about creating jobs for germans , " daily der tagespiegel quoted him as saying .

a replacement has already been found in franz schönhuber , the former national leader of another right wing-extremist party , but there is n't enough time to reprint ballots before sunday . as the race for the chancellery becomes tighter with the election just days away , politicians and legal experts are mulling the ramifications of a late vote in dresden , with some saying that a delayed election could throw into question the legality of the national vote . experts such as werner patzelt , a political scientist from dresden university , predicted political turmoil if the race turns out to be extremely narrow as in the last election , where social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- only had about 6,000 votes more than the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german parliament 's make-up might not be known until oct .
2 " should the question of whether we 'll see a grand coalition -lrb- cdu and spd -rrb- or one between the cdu and the -lrb- free-market -rrb- liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- hinge on a single mandate , then indeed the postponed election in the dresden constituency may be of crucial importance , " he told dw-radio . splitti n g the electio n ? hans meyer , a professor of constitutional law and former president of berlin 's humboldt university , said he believes the election outcome will be challenged should dresdeners vote after the results in the rest of the country have already become public . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have two votes in an interview with bavarian public broadcaster br , meyer added that dresdeners should at least vote for a party on sunday .
in germany , each voter has two votes - one to elect a direct candidate for his or her constituency and another to choose a political party that then gets parliamentary seats according to the percentage of votes it achieves . one party that supports such a splitting of votes in dresden is germany 's new left party , which consists of the successor party to the former communist party of east germany and disgruntled social democrats from western germany . distorti n g results ? " that way we want to avoid distortions which would happen if dresdeners already know the result from the rest of the country , " hendrik thalheim , a party spokesman , told the newspaper die tageszeitu n g . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters of chancellor gerhard schröder might end up voting for the left party in dresden .
the left party fears that a late election in dresden could harm their chances to win a direct seat in dresden .
others believe , however , that a late vote might actually help the party as social democrats might tactically support the left party 's candidate to prevent an extra seat for the christian democrats , whose candidate is leading in the polls . the africa compariso n while local candidates for other parties also complained about the postponed election , officials at the national level said they did n't see this as a problem . " maybe it 's possible in africa to hold back election results for a couple of weeks , but you can not do that in germany , " dirk niebel , the fdp 's general secretary , said on the morning show of germany 's public broadcasters . other legal experts also said that there was nothing illegal about a late vote in dresden . " there 's no law that forbids this , " gottfried mahrenholz , a former constitutional court judge , told german public radio , deutschlandfunk .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 12.09.2005 the lot of young german offenders großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how far can youths go before they wind up behind bars ?
a recent and fatal teenage attack on a seven-year-old boy near berlin has promoted cries from the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- for germany to review its liberal approach to dealing with criminals , however young they are . it was a particularly brutal and gratuitous crime , in which a boy of 16 beat an innocent child and neighbor to death , and subsequently attributed his violence to " personal frustration . "
it can be of no surprise to anyone that such savage behavior should unleash calls for tighter measures to prevent any future repetition of such tragedies .
but opinions on exactly how to deal with germany 's delinquent youngsters vary enormously .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a correction center in northern germany some say they should be given the benefit of the doubt on the grounds that they can not be held fully responsible for their own actions until they come of age .
others refute such claims as dangerously naïve , bellowing that acts of such evil ill-will should be paid for through the iron bars of a correction center .
there are currently some 6,000 criminals serving their time in juvenile offenders institutes across the country , but if the cdu had its way , that figure could be far higher .
in a statement issued following the horrific juvenile attack last month , chairman of the cdu berlin parliamentary group , andreas gram , and cdu legal expert , nicolas zimmer , called for a radical rethink .
" the soft touch era is finally over .
the justice system should react more swiftly to the first cases and signs of a criminal career , and be quicker to sentence violent young criminals to imprisonment , " they said .
no more coddling among other things , they propose detaining " profoundly dangerous and criminal children and youths " in special purpose , enclosed premises and reducing the age of criminal responsibility below its current minimum of 14 .
they have also called for the regulation which currently allows young adults up to the age of 21 to be tried under juvenile law , to be replaced by a statute which would treat them according to the same laws as adults .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu want youngsters to be tried as adults the warden of berlin 's plötzensee correctional institute for juveniles , marius fiedler , says that such debates date back decades , and that they are too general to be widely effective .
" you always just have to do the right thing , and you can only do that by looking at each individual case .
it 's a matter of recognizing the problems early on and steering the youngsters in the right direction . "
he added that there is only one 16 year-old inmate at the berlin center and none who are younger .
so does that render the cdu plea to reduce the age of accountability unnecessary , or is it an indication that the system is simply too lax ?
prevention is better than cure fact is , germany is not particularly tough on its young lawbreakers .
chairman of the juvenile court association bernd sonnen says the system is geared to try and work with criminal youngsters in such a way that they can avoid being incarcerated and prevent a career in crime before it is too late .
" between 66 and 69 percent of youth crimes in germany are resolved out of court .
the offenders can repair damage they have caused , they can take part in anti-aggression training or in mediated face to face sessions with their victims , " he explained .
" the success rate of the latter is particularly successful , and the advantage is that they do not become labeled criminals which is often a self-fulfilling prophecy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as many as 69 percent of youth crimes never make it to court but that is of little consolation to the victims of the crimes which continue to be part of the fabric of society here . sonnen says he can understand the calls to lock delinquents away , and the belief that a harder stance will prevent re-offending , but adds that it simply is n't the truth of the matter .
" sure , putting people behind bars is the toughest measure we have on offer , but it is also proven that it creates the highest rate of repeat offending .
when someone has been locked up for a given period and is then suddenly set free , they are highly likely to just go out and commit another crime , " he said .
rise in violent juvenile crime marius fiedler agrees that a jail sentence should be an absolute last resort .
" of course there are countries which are much tougher with their young criminals .
the state of california locks away about eight times the number of juveniles that we do , but are crime levels there are lower as a result ? " the governor asked .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the overwhelming majority of prisoners in germany are male sixty percent of the 554 male prisoners detained at the berlin young offenders institute are there as a result of committing violent crimes , from armed robbery to murder , and the picture is much the same across germany as a whole .
although crimes such as theft are declining , reported incidences of juvenile violence are indeed on the rise , but sonnen says the onus is on the word reported .
" we have become sensitized to violence and we are prepared to do something about it , to denounce violent crime .
whereas ten years ago school directors would have denied any sign of brutality in their establishments , they are now willing to admit that the problem exists , " he explained .
family problems and more often than not , the problem is the consequence of other , personal problems which date back to early childhood days .
fiedler says if there is anything that the young men who walk through the correction center gates have in common , it is bad family relations and a poor education .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a glance inside with that in mind , places like berlin plötzensee operate a strictly no punishment policy , but offer an extensive range of schooling , apprenticeship and work opportunities to try and generate a different sense of self-worth in the youngsters while they are inside .
for some it is the best they have ever known .
" a lot of them develop well inside , then shortly before their release date , they do something silly so their sentence is extended .
they do it because they are afraid of life , and of having to leave this protected space , " fiedler said . tamsin walker , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany moves to protect stalking victims germany 's upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , has passed a bill that would provide better protection for victims of stalking .

a recent and fatal teenage attack on a seven-year-old boy near berlin has promoted cries from the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- for germany to review its liberal approach to dealing with criminals , however young they are . it was a particularly brutal and gratuitous crime , in which a boy of 16 beat an innocent child and neighbor to death , and subsequently attributed his violence to " personal frustration . "
it can be of no surprise to anyone that such savage behavior should unleash calls for tighter measures to prevent any future repetition of such tragedies .
but opinions on exactly how to deal with germany 's delinquent youngsters vary enormously .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a correction center in northern germany some say they should be given the benefit of the doubt on the grounds that they can not be held fully responsible for their own actions until they come of age .
others refute such claims as dangerously naïve , bellowing that acts of such evil ill-will should be paid for through the iron bars of a correction center .
there are currently some 6,000 criminals serving their time in juvenile offenders institutes across the country , but if the cdu had its way , that figure could be far higher .
in a statement issued following the horrific juvenile attack last month , chairman of the cdu berlin parliamentary group , andreas gram , and cdu legal expert , nicolas zimmer , called for a radical rethink .
" the soft touch era is finally over .
the justice system should react more swiftly to the first cases and signs of a criminal career , and be quicker to sentence violent young criminals to imprisonment , " they said .
no more coddling among other things , they propose detaining " profoundly dangerous and criminal children and youths " in special purpose , enclosed premises and reducing the age of criminal responsibility below its current minimum of 14 .
they have also called for the regulation which currently allows young adults up to the age of 21 to be tried under juvenile law , to be replaced by a statute which would treat them according to the same laws as adults .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu want youngsters to be tried as adults the warden of berlin 's plötzensee correctional institute for juveniles , marius fiedler , says that such debates date back decades , and that they are too general to be widely effective .
" you always just have to do the right thing , and you can only do that by looking at each individual case .
it 's a matter of recognizing the problems early on and steering the youngsters in the right direction . "
he added that there is only one 16 year-old inmate at the berlin center and none who are younger .
so does that render the cdu plea to reduce the age of accountability unnecessary , or is it an indication that the system is simply too lax ?
prevention is better than cure fact is , germany is not particularly tough on its young lawbreakers .
chairman of the juvenile court association bernd sonnen says the system is geared to try and work with criminal youngsters in such a way that they can avoid being incarcerated and prevent a career in crime before it is too late .
" between 66 and 69 percent of youth crimes in germany are resolved out of court .
the offenders can repair damage they have caused , they can take part in anti-aggression training or in mediated face to face sessions with their victims , " he explained .
" the success rate of the latter is particularly successful , and the advantage is that they do not become labeled criminals which is often a self-fulfilling prophecy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as many as 69 percent of youth crimes never make it to court but that is of little consolation to the victims of the crimes which continue to be part of the fabric of society here . sonnen says he can understand the calls to lock delinquents away , and the belief that a harder stance will prevent re-offending , but adds that it simply is n't the truth of the matter .
" sure , putting people behind bars is the toughest measure we have on offer , but it is also proven that it creates the highest rate of repeat offending .
when someone has been locked up for a given period and is then suddenly set free , they are highly likely to just go out and commit another crime , " he said .

a replacement has already been found in franz schönhuber , the former national leader of another right wing-extremist party , but there is n't enough time to reprint ballots before sunday . as the race for the chancellery becomes tighter with the election just days away , politicians and legal experts are mulling the ramifications of a late vote in dresden , with some saying that a delayed election could throw into question the legality of the national vote . experts such as werner patzelt , a political scientist from dresden university , predicted political turmoil if the race turns out to be extremely narrow as in the last election , where social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- only had about 6,000 votes more than the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german parliament 's make-up might not be known until oct .
2 " should the question of whether we 'll see a grand coalition -lrb- cdu and spd -rrb- or one between the cdu and the -lrb- free-market -rrb- liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- hinge on a single mandate , then indeed the postponed election in the dresden constituency may be of crucial importance , " he told dw-radio . splitti n g the electio n ? hans meyer , a professor of constitutional law and former president of berlin 's humboldt university , said he believes the election outcome will be challenged should dresdeners vote after the results in the rest of the country have already become public . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have two votes in an interview with bavarian public broadcaster br , meyer added that dresdeners should at least vote for a party on sunday .
in germany , each voter has two votes - one to elect a direct candidate for his or her constituency and another to choose a political party that then gets parliamentary seats according to the percentage of votes it achieves . one party that supports such a splitting of votes in dresden is germany 's new left party , which consists of the successor party to the former communist party of east germany and disgruntled social democrats from western germany . distorti n g results ? " that way we want to avoid distortions which would happen if dresdeners already know the result from the rest of the country , " hendrik thalheim , a party spokesman , told the newspaper die tageszeitu n g . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters of chancellor gerhard schröder might end up voting for the left party in dresden .
the left party fears that a late election in dresden could harm their chances to win a direct seat in dresden .
others believe , however , that a late vote might actually help the party as social democrats might tactically support the left party 's candidate to prevent an extra seat for the christian democrats , whose candidate is leading in the polls . the africa compariso n while local candidates for other parties also complained about the postponed election , officials at the national level said they did n't see this as a problem . " maybe it 's possible in africa to hold back election results for a couple of weeks , but you can not do that in germany , " dirk niebel , the fdp 's general secretary , said on the morning show of germany 's public broadcasters . other legal experts also said that there was nothing illegal about a late vote in dresden . " there 's no law that forbids this , " gottfried mahrenholz , a former constitutional court judge , told german public radio , deutschlandfunk .
late votes already took place in 1961 and 1965 after candidates died shortly before the election . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de election 2005 click here for dw-world 's complete election coverage .

the chancellor , who was largely written off by political analysts in recent months , has managed to halve the gap in the last week after a televised debate with merkel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " wherever i go , i encounter a lot of support .
the tide is turning , " schröder was quoted as telling the sunday edition of the bild newspaper . " at the end of the day , it is the voters who decide who will become their next chancellor . "
the chancellor , whose personal approval ratings have jumped by 11 points since august according to one poll , said the latest polls prove that " the supposed mood for change no longer exists " among the electorate and announced a few extra rallies for the final week of campaigning .
cdu losing ground by contrast , the cdu and their sister bavarian party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- appeared to be faltering in the last days leading up to the election .
several leading surveys at the weekend showed the cdu / csu losing ground , raising conservatives ' fears that they could once again squander a big lead to schröder , who rallied from 12 points behind in six weeks to win the last election in 2002 .
one poll by the emnid institute showed the cdu dropping 1.5 points to 40.5 percent of the vote last week , while the spd surged 3.5 points to 34 percent .
the spd has now gained 8 points in the last month while the cdu has lost 3 points .
another opinion poll showed that the cdu / csu and their preferred coalition partner , the free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- would fall just short of the 48.5 percent of votes needed for a governing majority .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many believe that the most likely outcome of the elections thus would be a so-called " grand coalition " between merkel 's conservatives and the spd with her as chancellor .
but her allies fear that this would make it impossible to implement changes intended to push-start germany 's spluttering economy .
" it is a nightmare vision , " the prime minister of the eastern state of saxony , georg milbrandt , has warned .
" it is pointless to think that a grand coalition could get things moving . "
the kirchhof factor the conservatives ' campaign has also been hit by the appointment by merkel of paul kirchhof as the party 's shadow finance minister if the cdu / csu came to power .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kirchhof -lrb- photo -rrb- , a former constitutional judge and heidelberg university professor who has proposed radical tax reforms and committed a series of political gaffes in media interviews , has become a sort of punching bag for the spd .
schröder , who has slammed merkel 's reform vision as cold and inhuman and painted a grim picture of what it would do to germany 's social welfare system , has also repeatedly attacked kirchhof .
the chancellor has stressed that kirchhof 's tax reforms , including a flat 25 percent tax rate without tax breaks , are unrealistic - a tactic that pollster say has begun to affect voters who are already scared off by kirchhof .
" kirchhof has unleashed a wave of insecurity among voters , " richard hilmer , head of infratest dimap , told reuters .
" if this trend continues , schröder could even reach his goal of 38 percent .
in any case , the chances of a spd coalition with the greens and fdp are much higher now . "
damage control merkel and several other cdu leaders have now begun to distance themselves from kirchhof and instead hinted that they might try and get back friedrich merz , a respected finance expert and former head of the cdu parliamentary faction .
the fdp meanwhile held a one-day conference in berlin on sunday at which party leaders downplayed the bad news from the polling institutes and defended merkel 's reform vision .
bildunterschrift : but the press reported sunday that fdp leader guido westerwelle -lrb- photo -rrb- too was trying to distance the party from radical tax reform proposals by paul kirchhof .
" this election is not just about clever people 's big dreams , it is about creating jobs for germans , " daily der tagespiegel quoted him as saying .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 12.09.2005 the lot of young german offenders großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how far can youths go before they wind up behind bars ?
a recent and fatal teenage attack on a seven-year-old boy near berlin has promoted cries from the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- for germany to review its liberal approach to dealing with criminals , however young they are . it was a particularly brutal and gratuitous crime , in which a boy of 16 beat an innocent child and neighbor to death , and subsequently attributed his violence to " personal frustration . "
it can be of no surprise to anyone that such savage behavior should unleash calls for tighter measures to prevent any future repetition of such tragedies .
but opinions on exactly how to deal with germany 's delinquent youngsters vary enormously .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a correction center in northern germany some say they should be given the benefit of the doubt on the grounds that they can not be held fully responsible for their own actions until they come of age .
others refute such claims as dangerously naïve , bellowing that acts of such evil ill-will should be paid for through the iron bars of a correction center .
there are currently some 6,000 criminals serving their time in juvenile offenders institutes across the country , but if the cdu had its way , that figure could be far higher .
in a statement issued following the horrific juvenile attack last month , chairman of the cdu berlin parliamentary group , andreas gram , and cdu legal expert , nicolas zimmer , called for a radical rethink .
" the soft touch era is finally over .
the justice system should react more swiftly to the first cases and signs of a criminal career , and be quicker to sentence violent young criminals to imprisonment , " they said .
no more coddling among other things , they propose detaining " profoundly dangerous and criminal children and youths " in special purpose , enclosed premises and reducing the age of criminal responsibility below its current minimum of 14 .
they have also called for the regulation which currently allows young adults up to the age of 21 to be tried under juvenile law , to be replaced by a statute which would treat them according to the same laws as adults .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu want youngsters to be tried as adults the warden of berlin 's plötzensee correctional institute for juveniles , marius fiedler , says that such debates date back decades , and that they are too general to be widely effective .
" you always just have to do the right thing , and you can only do that by looking at each individual case .
it 's a matter of recognizing the problems early on and steering the youngsters in the right direction . "
he added that there is only one 16 year-old inmate at the berlin center and none who are younger .
so does that render the cdu plea to reduce the age of accountability unnecessary , or is it an indication that the system is simply too lax ?
prevention is better than cure fact is , germany is not particularly tough on its young lawbreakers .
chairman of the juvenile court association bernd sonnen says the system is geared to try and work with criminal youngsters in such a way that they can avoid being incarcerated and prevent a career in crime before it is too late .
" between 66 and 69 percent of youth crimes in germany are resolved out of court .
the offenders can repair damage they have caused , they can take part in anti-aggression training or in mediated face to face sessions with their victims , " he explained .
" the success rate of the latter is particularly successful , and the advantage is that they do not become labeled criminals which is often a self-fulfilling prophecy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as many as 69 percent of youth crimes never make it to court but that is of little consolation to the victims of the crimes which continue to be part of the fabric of society here . sonnen says he can understand the calls to lock delinquents away , and the belief that a harder stance will prevent re-offending , but adds that it simply is n't the truth of the matter .
" sure , putting people behind bars is the toughest measure we have on offer , but it is also proven that it creates the highest rate of repeat offending .
when someone has been locked up for a given period and is then suddenly set free , they are highly likely to just go out and commit another crime , " he said .
rise in violent juvenile crime marius fiedler agrees that a jail sentence should be an absolute last resort .
" of course there are countries which are much tougher with their young criminals .
the state of california locks away about eight times the number of juveniles that we do , but are crime levels there are lower as a result ? " the governor asked .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the overwhelming majority of prisoners in germany are male sixty percent of the 554 male prisoners detained at the berlin young offenders institute are there as a result of committing violent crimes , from armed robbery to murder , and the picture is much the same across germany as a whole .
although crimes such as theft are declining , reported incidences of juvenile violence are indeed on the rise , but sonnen says the onus is on the word reported .
" we have become sensitized to violence and we are prepared to do something about it , to denounce violent crime .
whereas ten years ago school directors would have denied any sign of brutality in their establishments , they are now willing to admit that the problem exists , " he explained .
family problems and more often than not , the problem is the consequence of other , personal problems which date back to early childhood days .
fiedler says if there is anything that the young men who walk through the correction center gates have in common , it is bad family relations and a poor education .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a glance inside with that in mind , places like berlin plötzensee operate a strictly no punishment policy , but offer an extensive range of schooling , apprenticeship and work opportunities to try and generate a different sense of self-worth in the youngsters while they are inside .
for some it is the best they have ever known .
" a lot of them develop well inside , then shortly before their release date , they do something silly so their sentence is extended .
they do it because they are afraid of life , and of having to leave this protected space , " fiedler said . tamsin walker , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany moves to protect stalking victims germany 's upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , has passed a bill that would provide better protection for victims of stalking .

the chancellor , who was largely written off by political analysts in recent months , has managed to halve the gap in the last week after a televised debate with merkel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " wherever i go , i encounter a lot of support .
the tide is turning , " schröder was quoted as telling the sunday edition of the bild newspaper . " at the end of the day , it is the voters who decide who will become their next chancellor . "
the chancellor , whose personal approval ratings have jumped by 11 points since august according to one poll , said the latest polls prove that " the supposed mood for change no longer exists " among the electorate and announced a few extra rallies for the final week of campaigning .
cdu losing ground by contrast , the cdu and their sister bavarian party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- appeared to be faltering in the last days leading up to the election .
several leading surveys at the weekend showed the cdu / csu losing ground , raising conservatives ' fears that they could once again squander a big lead to schröder , who rallied from 12 points behind in six weeks to win the last election in 2002 .
one poll by the emnid institute showed the cdu dropping 1.5 points to 40.5 percent of the vote last week , while the spd surged 3.5 points to 34 percent .
the spd has now gained 8 points in the last month while the cdu has lost 3 points .
another opinion poll showed that the cdu / csu and their preferred coalition partner , the free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- would fall just short of the 48.5 percent of votes needed for a governing majority .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many believe that the most likely outcome of the elections thus would be a so-called " grand coalition " between merkel 's conservatives and the spd with her as chancellor .
but her allies fear that this would make it impossible to implement changes intended to push-start germany 's spluttering economy .
" it is a nightmare vision , " the prime minister of the eastern state of saxony , georg milbrandt , has warned .
" it is pointless to think that a grand coalition could get things moving . "
the kirchhof factor the conservatives ' campaign has also been hit by the appointment by merkel of paul kirchhof as the party 's shadow finance minister if the cdu / csu came to power .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kirchhof -lrb- photo -rrb- , a former constitutional judge and heidelberg university professor who has proposed radical tax reforms and committed a series of political gaffes in media interviews , has become a sort of punching bag for the spd .
schröder , who has slammed merkel 's reform vision as cold and inhuman and painted a grim picture of what it would do to germany 's social welfare system , has also repeatedly attacked kirchhof .
the chancellor has stressed that kirchhof 's tax reforms , including a flat 25 percent tax rate without tax breaks , are unrealistic - a tactic that pollster say has begun to affect voters who are already scared off by kirchhof .
" kirchhof has unleashed a wave of insecurity among voters , " richard hilmer , head of infratest dimap , told reuters .
" if this trend continues , schröder could even reach his goal of 38 percent .
in any case , the chances of a spd coalition with the greens and fdp are much higher now . "
damage control merkel and several other cdu leaders have now begun to distance themselves from kirchhof and instead hinted that they might try and get back friedrich merz , a respected finance expert and former head of the cdu parliamentary faction .
the fdp meanwhile held a one-day conference in berlin on sunday at which party leaders downplayed the bad news from the polling institutes and defended merkel 's reform vision .
bildunterschrift : but the press reported sunday that fdp leader guido westerwelle -lrb- photo -rrb- too was trying to distance the party from radical tax reform proposals by paul kirchhof .
" this election is not just about clever people 's big dreams , it is about creating jobs for germans , " daily der tagespiegel quoted him as saying .

cdu losing ground by contrast , the cdu and their sister bavarian party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- appeared to be faltering in the last days leading up to the election .
several leading surveys at the weekend showed the cdu / csu losing ground , raising conservatives ' fears that they could once again squander a big lead to schröder , who rallied from 12 points behind in six weeks to win the last election in 2002 .
one poll by the emnid institute showed the cdu dropping 1.5 points to 40.5 percent of the vote last week , while the spd surged 3.5 points to 34 percent .
the spd has now gained 8 points in the last month while the cdu has lost 3 points .
another opinion poll showed that the cdu / csu and their preferred coalition partner , the free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- would fall just short of the 48.5 percent of votes needed for a governing majority .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many believe that the most likely outcome of the elections thus would be a so-called " grand coalition " between merkel 's conservatives and the spd with her as chancellor .
but her allies fear that this would make it impossible to implement changes intended to push-start germany 's spluttering economy .
" it is a nightmare vision , " the prime minister of the eastern state of saxony , georg milbrandt , has warned .
" it is pointless to think that a grand coalition could get things moving . "
the kirchhof factor the conservatives ' campaign has also been hit by the appointment by merkel of paul kirchhof as the party 's shadow finance minister if the cdu / csu came to power .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kirchhof -lrb- photo -rrb- , a former constitutional judge and heidelberg university professor who has proposed radical tax reforms and committed a series of political gaffes in media interviews , has become a sort of punching bag for the spd .
schröder , who has slammed merkel 's reform vision as cold and inhuman and painted a grim picture of what it would do to germany 's social welfare system , has also repeatedly attacked kirchhof .
the chancellor has stressed that kirchhof 's tax reforms , including a flat 25 percent tax rate without tax breaks , are unrealistic - a tactic that pollster say has begun to affect voters who are already scared off by kirchhof .
" kirchhof has unleashed a wave of insecurity among voters , " richard hilmer , head of infratest dimap , told reuters .
" if this trend continues , schröder could even reach his goal of 38 percent .
in any case , the chances of a spd coalition with the greens and fdp are much higher now . "
damage control merkel and several other cdu leaders have now begun to distance themselves from kirchhof and instead hinted that they might try and get back friedrich merz , a respected finance expert and former head of the cdu parliamentary faction .
the fdp meanwhile held a one-day conference in berlin on sunday at which party leaders downplayed the bad news from the polling institutes and defended merkel 's reform vision .
bildunterschrift : but the press reported sunday that fdp leader guido westerwelle -lrb- photo -rrb- too was trying to distance the party from radical tax reform proposals by paul kirchhof .
" this election is not just about clever people 's big dreams , it is about creating jobs for germans , " daily der tagespiegel quoted him as saying .
the weekly magazine der spiegel on sunday said kirchhof , " was becoming a liability " and putting at risk merkel 's hopes of avoiding a grand coalition . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no miracle cure for german economy for an election that is being fought on economic issues , many germans seem to believe that the fortunes of europe 's biggest economy will not change even if conservative challenger angela merkel wins the sept .

whether it be lucio , d ’ alessandro , vittek or van der vaart , the big names in the league are no longer a " who ’ s who " of german soccer .
in the 2004-05 season , only the english premiership had more foreign players -lrb- 56 percent -rrb- than the bundeliga ’ s 48 percent .
heading into the 2005-06 season , that percentage dropped down to 42.6 percent as cost-cutting measures increase .
financial woes have forced club management to rethink policies .
" i think that the clubs learned their lesson after the kirch -lrb- media company -rrb- crisis , " said german soccer league -lrb- dfl -rrb- managing director christian seifert before the season .
" they are investing more in their youth programs . "
nevertheless , the transfer deadline which expired on august 31 , revealed that clubs would not hesitate to improve their lot by turning to players from abroad .
young brazilians , some of whom shined at the under-20 world championships this summer , figured in many of the deals .
dortmund 's bad example the bosses at borussia dortmund could talk all day long about how costly foreign talent can be .
it almost cost the club its league license .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : borussia dortmund stood on the brink of ruin after taking the 1997 champions league , the ruhr valley club went on a spending spree .
to finance the expensive transfers , the club decided , among other things , to go public and list itself on the stock exchange during the high-flying days of the internet boom .
to pull it off , the whole scheme was dependent on one thing - winning .
this they failed to do and dortmund was just a hair away from declaring bankruptcy last season .
it may sound dumb but the financial health off the field and the success on it rests more and more on the ability of the team directors to find talent before they blossom , that is , before they become overpriced .
bayern recipe for success some complain munich have an unfair advantage in that if a good player wants true international recognition , he will receive it in the bavarian capital .
it becomes an upward spiral of success .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international midfielder sebastian deisler is not a starter at bayern munich the team wins , receives more money which it can spend , and in turn , get better players when needed .
still , being a very good german player , even being on the national squad , is no guarantee for success at bayern .
just talk to sebastian deisler and bastian schweinsteiger who both frequently are used as substitutes .
" there aren ’ t many german players who can play at the level demanded by bayern munich , " bayern coach felix magath said recently .
the gaps are filled in by exceptional , but not necessarily exorbitantly-priced players , such as the central defenders lucio from brazil and valérien ismaël from france or dutch striker roy makaay .
but as if to highlight the deficits of german club soccer , none of those three play exceptional roles in their national teams . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new crop of brazilians in bundesliga before the transfer window came to a close on aug .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 12.09.2005 the lot of young german offenders großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how far can youths go before they wind up behind bars ?
a recent and fatal teenage attack on a seven-year-old boy near berlin has promoted cries from the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- for germany to review its liberal approach to dealing with criminals , however young they are . it was a particularly brutal and gratuitous crime , in which a boy of 16 beat an innocent child and neighbor to death , and subsequently attributed his violence to " personal frustration . "
it can be of no surprise to anyone that such savage behavior should unleash calls for tighter measures to prevent any future repetition of such tragedies .
but opinions on exactly how to deal with germany 's delinquent youngsters vary enormously .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a correction center in northern germany some say they should be given the benefit of the doubt on the grounds that they can not be held fully responsible for their own actions until they come of age .
others refute such claims as dangerously naïve , bellowing that acts of such evil ill-will should be paid for through the iron bars of a correction center .
there are currently some 6,000 criminals serving their time in juvenile offenders institutes across the country , but if the cdu had its way , that figure could be far higher .
in a statement issued following the horrific juvenile attack last month , chairman of the cdu berlin parliamentary group , andreas gram , and cdu legal expert , nicolas zimmer , called for a radical rethink .
" the soft touch era is finally over .
the justice system should react more swiftly to the first cases and signs of a criminal career , and be quicker to sentence violent young criminals to imprisonment , " they said .
no more coddling among other things , they propose detaining " profoundly dangerous and criminal children and youths " in special purpose , enclosed premises and reducing the age of criminal responsibility below its current minimum of 14 .
they have also called for the regulation which currently allows young adults up to the age of 21 to be tried under juvenile law , to be replaced by a statute which would treat them according to the same laws as adults .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu want youngsters to be tried as adults the warden of berlin 's plötzensee correctional institute for juveniles , marius fiedler , says that such debates date back decades , and that they are too general to be widely effective .
" you always just have to do the right thing , and you can only do that by looking at each individual case .
it 's a matter of recognizing the problems early on and steering the youngsters in the right direction . "
he added that there is only one 16 year-old inmate at the berlin center and none who are younger .
so does that render the cdu plea to reduce the age of accountability unnecessary , or is it an indication that the system is simply too lax ?
prevention is better than cure fact is , germany is not particularly tough on its young lawbreakers .
chairman of the juvenile court association bernd sonnen says the system is geared to try and work with criminal youngsters in such a way that they can avoid being incarcerated and prevent a career in crime before it is too late .
" between 66 and 69 percent of youth crimes in germany are resolved out of court .
the offenders can repair damage they have caused , they can take part in anti-aggression training or in mediated face to face sessions with their victims , " he explained .
" the success rate of the latter is particularly successful , and the advantage is that they do not become labeled criminals which is often a self-fulfilling prophecy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as many as 69 percent of youth crimes never make it to court but that is of little consolation to the victims of the crimes which continue to be part of the fabric of society here . sonnen says he can understand the calls to lock delinquents away , and the belief that a harder stance will prevent re-offending , but adds that it simply is n't the truth of the matter .
" sure , putting people behind bars is the toughest measure we have on offer , but it is also proven that it creates the highest rate of repeat offending .
when someone has been locked up for a given period and is then suddenly set free , they are highly likely to just go out and commit another crime , " he said .
rise in violent juvenile crime marius fiedler agrees that a jail sentence should be an absolute last resort .
" of course there are countries which are much tougher with their young criminals .
the state of california locks away about eight times the number of juveniles that we do , but are crime levels there are lower as a result ? " the governor asked .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the overwhelming majority of prisoners in germany are male sixty percent of the 554 male prisoners detained at the berlin young offenders institute are there as a result of committing violent crimes , from armed robbery to murder , and the picture is much the same across germany as a whole .
although crimes such as theft are declining , reported incidences of juvenile violence are indeed on the rise , but sonnen says the onus is on the word reported .
" we have become sensitized to violence and we are prepared to do something about it , to denounce violent crime .
whereas ten years ago school directors would have denied any sign of brutality in their establishments , they are now willing to admit that the problem exists , " he explained .
family problems and more often than not , the problem is the consequence of other , personal problems which date back to early childhood days .
fiedler says if there is anything that the young men who walk through the correction center gates have in common , it is bad family relations and a poor education .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a glance inside with that in mind , places like berlin plötzensee operate a strictly no punishment policy , but offer an extensive range of schooling , apprenticeship and work opportunities to try and generate a different sense of self-worth in the youngsters while they are inside .
for some it is the best they have ever known .
" a lot of them develop well inside , then shortly before their release date , they do something silly so their sentence is extended .
they do it because they are afraid of life , and of having to leave this protected space , " fiedler said . tamsin walker , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany moves to protect stalking victims germany 's upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , has passed a bill that would provide better protection for victims of stalking .

" braun 's suggestions were outlined in 20-point memo entitled " economic expectations of the future government " which is now posted on the dihk web site . the memo outlines in no vague terms the need for germany to abandon it 's moto of " protect the environment at any cost . " among other suggestions , the braun plan calls for reductions in environmental regulations and bureaucracy , improved dialog with business and industry , changes in law governing use of chemicals -lrb- reach -rrb- , and a retraction of germany 's plan to cut greenhouse gas by 40 percent by 2020 . less then enthusiastic reaction the reaction to ludwig-braun 's proposals did not go over very well with members of chancellor gerhard schröders red-green coalition which maintains the need for strict environmental regulations not only in germany , but throughout all of the worlds major economies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german environment minister jürgen trittin does not think that environmental regulation and industry should oppose each other schröder 's often outspoken environmental minister jürgen trittin , a member of the green party , called braun 's suggestions " a complete subordination of environmental concerns to that of private industry . " he went on to suggest that chamber was trying to twist the facts by making the association that protecting the environment need come at the cost of economic growth and investment . call for boycott the german alliance for renewable energy took their reaction a step further by calling for all businesses who manufacture green products or products that run on sustainable energy to withhold their mandatory dues to the dihk in protest of their stance on environmental protection . economic topics have dominated the 2005 election campaign and industry leaders clearly feel confident enough that schröder 's conservative challenger angela merkel will win the poll on sept .

but over the weekend , it was n't cellists and violinists at center stage , rather djs , breakdancers and beat boxers . at leipzig 's kohlrabizirkus venue , technicians were busy behind huge boards during sound check .
the bass and treble levels have to be perfectly balanced since the world 's best djs were about to go head to head during this first hop-hop championship . the hip hop world challenge , hosted by top german hip-hop star thomas d and the american mc freestyle , aimed to demonstrate germany 's openness to youth culture and artistic expression .
it was supported by the cultural fund of the german football federation , which is eager to show the country in the best possible light ahead of the 2006 fifa world cup , which will take place in germany next summer . still , that the fund 's committee would give the green light for a hip-hop competition was nonetheless a surprise to organizer norbert seiler , known to hip-hop fans as " parago .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 12.09.2005 the lot of young german offenders großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how far can youths go before they wind up behind bars ?
a recent and fatal teenage attack on a seven-year-old boy near berlin has promoted cries from the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- for germany to review its liberal approach to dealing with criminals , however young they are . it was a particularly brutal and gratuitous crime , in which a boy of 16 beat an innocent child and neighbor to death , and subsequently attributed his violence to " personal frustration . "
it can be of no surprise to anyone that such savage behavior should unleash calls for tighter measures to prevent any future repetition of such tragedies .
but opinions on exactly how to deal with germany 's delinquent youngsters vary enormously .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a correction center in northern germany some say they should be given the benefit of the doubt on the grounds that they can not be held fully responsible for their own actions until they come of age .
others refute such claims as dangerously naïve , bellowing that acts of such evil ill-will should be paid for through the iron bars of a correction center .
there are currently some 6,000 criminals serving their time in juvenile offenders institutes across the country , but if the cdu had its way , that figure could be far higher .
in a statement issued following the horrific juvenile attack last month , chairman of the cdu berlin parliamentary group , andreas gram , and cdu legal expert , nicolas zimmer , called for a radical rethink .
" the soft touch era is finally over .
the justice system should react more swiftly to the first cases and signs of a criminal career , and be quicker to sentence violent young criminals to imprisonment , " they said .
no more coddling among other things , they propose detaining " profoundly dangerous and criminal children and youths " in special purpose , enclosed premises and reducing the age of criminal responsibility below its current minimum of 14 .
they have also called for the regulation which currently allows young adults up to the age of 21 to be tried under juvenile law , to be replaced by a statute which would treat them according to the same laws as adults .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu want youngsters to be tried as adults the warden of berlin 's plötzensee correctional institute for juveniles , marius fiedler , says that such debates date back decades , and that they are too general to be widely effective .
" you always just have to do the right thing , and you can only do that by looking at each individual case .
it 's a matter of recognizing the problems early on and steering the youngsters in the right direction . "
he added that there is only one 16 year-old inmate at the berlin center and none who are younger .
so does that render the cdu plea to reduce the age of accountability unnecessary , or is it an indication that the system is simply too lax ?
prevention is better than cure fact is , germany is not particularly tough on its young lawbreakers .
chairman of the juvenile court association bernd sonnen says the system is geared to try and work with criminal youngsters in such a way that they can avoid being incarcerated and prevent a career in crime before it is too late .
" between 66 and 69 percent of youth crimes in germany are resolved out of court .
the offenders can repair damage they have caused , they can take part in anti-aggression training or in mediated face to face sessions with their victims , " he explained .
" the success rate of the latter is particularly successful , and the advantage is that they do not become labeled criminals which is often a self-fulfilling prophecy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as many as 69 percent of youth crimes never make it to court but that is of little consolation to the victims of the crimes which continue to be part of the fabric of society here . sonnen says he can understand the calls to lock delinquents away , and the belief that a harder stance will prevent re-offending , but adds that it simply is n't the truth of the matter .
" sure , putting people behind bars is the toughest measure we have on offer , but it is also proven that it creates the highest rate of repeat offending .
when someone has been locked up for a given period and is then suddenly set free , they are highly likely to just go out and commit another crime , " he said .
rise in violent juvenile crime marius fiedler agrees that a jail sentence should be an absolute last resort .
" of course there are countries which are much tougher with their young criminals .
the state of california locks away about eight times the number of juveniles that we do , but are crime levels there are lower as a result ? " the governor asked .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the overwhelming majority of prisoners in germany are male sixty percent of the 554 male prisoners detained at the berlin young offenders institute are there as a result of committing violent crimes , from armed robbery to murder , and the picture is much the same across germany as a whole .
although crimes such as theft are declining , reported incidences of juvenile violence are indeed on the rise , but sonnen says the onus is on the word reported .
" we have become sensitized to violence and we are prepared to do something about it , to denounce violent crime .
whereas ten years ago school directors would have denied any sign of brutality in their establishments , they are now willing to admit that the problem exists , " he explained .
family problems and more often than not , the problem is the consequence of other , personal problems which date back to early childhood days .
fiedler says if there is anything that the young men who walk through the correction center gates have in common , it is bad family relations and a poor education .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a glance inside with that in mind , places like berlin plötzensee operate a strictly no punishment policy , but offer an extensive range of schooling , apprenticeship and work opportunities to try and generate a different sense of self-worth in the youngsters while they are inside .
for some it is the best they have ever known .
" a lot of them develop well inside , then shortly before their release date , they do something silly so their sentence is extended .
they do it because they are afraid of life , and of having to leave this protected space , " fiedler said . tamsin walker , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany moves to protect stalking victims germany 's upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , has passed a bill that would provide better protection for victims of stalking .

a recent and fatal teenage attack on a seven-year-old boy near berlin has promoted cries from the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- for germany to review its liberal approach to dealing with criminals , however young they are . it was a particularly brutal and gratuitous crime , in which a boy of 16 beat an innocent child and neighbor to death , and subsequently attributed his violence to " personal frustration . "
it can be of no surprise to anyone that such savage behavior should unleash calls for tighter measures to prevent any future repetition of such tragedies .
but opinions on exactly how to deal with germany 's delinquent youngsters vary enormously .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a correction center in northern germany some say they should be given the benefit of the doubt on the grounds that they can not be held fully responsible for their own actions until they come of age .
others refute such claims as dangerously naïve , bellowing that acts of such evil ill-will should be paid for through the iron bars of a correction center .
there are currently some 6,000 criminals serving their time in juvenile offenders institutes across the country , but if the cdu had its way , that figure could be far higher .
in a statement issued following the horrific juvenile attack last month , chairman of the cdu berlin parliamentary group , andreas gram , and cdu legal expert , nicolas zimmer , called for a radical rethink .
" the soft touch era is finally over .
the justice system should react more swiftly to the first cases and signs of a criminal career , and be quicker to sentence violent young criminals to imprisonment , " they said .
no more coddling among other things , they propose detaining " profoundly dangerous and criminal children and youths " in special purpose , enclosed premises and reducing the age of criminal responsibility below its current minimum of 14 .
they have also called for the regulation which currently allows young adults up to the age of 21 to be tried under juvenile law , to be replaced by a statute which would treat them according to the same laws as adults .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu want youngsters to be tried as adults the warden of berlin 's plötzensee correctional institute for juveniles , marius fiedler , says that such debates date back decades , and that they are too general to be widely effective .
" you always just have to do the right thing , and you can only do that by looking at each individual case .
it 's a matter of recognizing the problems early on and steering the youngsters in the right direction . "

" sure , putting people behind bars is the toughest measure we have on offer , but it is also proven that it creates the highest rate of repeat offending .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 12.09.2005 the lot of young german offenders großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how far can youths go before they wind up behind bars ?
a recent and fatal teenage attack on a seven-year-old boy near berlin has promoted cries from the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- for germany to review its liberal approach to dealing with criminals , however young they are . it was a particularly brutal and gratuitous crime , in which a boy of 16 beat an innocent child and neighbor to death , and subsequently attributed his violence to " personal frustration . "
it can be of no surprise to anyone that such savage behavior should unleash calls for tighter measures to prevent any future repetition of such tragedies .
but opinions on exactly how to deal with germany 's delinquent youngsters vary enormously .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a correction center in northern germany some say they should be given the benefit of the doubt on the grounds that they can not be held fully responsible for their own actions until they come of age .
others refute such claims as dangerously naïve , bellowing that acts of such evil ill-will should be paid for through the iron bars of a correction center .
there are currently some 6,000 criminals serving their time in juvenile offenders institutes across the country , but if the cdu had its way , that figure could be far higher .
in a statement issued following the horrific juvenile attack last month , chairman of the cdu berlin parliamentary group , andreas gram , and cdu legal expert , nicolas zimmer , called for a radical rethink .
" the soft touch era is finally over .
the justice system should react more swiftly to the first cases and signs of a criminal career , and be quicker to sentence violent young criminals to imprisonment , " they said .
no more coddling among other things , they propose detaining " profoundly dangerous and criminal children and youths " in special purpose , enclosed premises and reducing the age of criminal responsibility below its current minimum of 14 .
they have also called for the regulation which currently allows young adults up to the age of 21 to be tried under juvenile law , to be replaced by a statute which would treat them according to the same laws as adults .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu want youngsters to be tried as adults the warden of berlin 's plötzensee correctional institute for juveniles , marius fiedler , says that such debates date back decades , and that they are too general to be widely effective .
" you always just have to do the right thing , and you can only do that by looking at each individual case .
it 's a matter of recognizing the problems early on and steering the youngsters in the right direction . "
he added that there is only one 16 year-old inmate at the berlin center and none who are younger .
so does that render the cdu plea to reduce the age of accountability unnecessary , or is it an indication that the system is simply too lax ?
prevention is better than cure fact is , germany is not particularly tough on its young lawbreakers .
chairman of the juvenile court association bernd sonnen says the system is geared to try and work with criminal youngsters in such a way that they can avoid being incarcerated and prevent a career in crime before it is too late .
" between 66 and 69 percent of youth crimes in germany are resolved out of court .
the offenders can repair damage they have caused , they can take part in anti-aggression training or in mediated face to face sessions with their victims , " he explained .
" the success rate of the latter is particularly successful , and the advantage is that they do not become labeled criminals which is often a self-fulfilling prophecy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as many as 69 percent of youth crimes never make it to court but that is of little consolation to the victims of the crimes which continue to be part of the fabric of society here . sonnen says he can understand the calls to lock delinquents away , and the belief that a harder stance will prevent re-offending , but adds that it simply is n't the truth of the matter .

18 . instead , with less than a week to go before election day , kirchhof 's audacious proposals for a flat-rate tax of 25 percent have boomeranged on her , slashing the cdu / csu 's 21-point lead over chancellor gerhard schröder and his social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- in the opinion polls to a paltry seven points . that may not be enough for schröder to be re-elected , but it could force merkel and the cdu / csu into a " grand coalition " with his spd party , a horror scenario for many , particularly the free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , who have set their hearts on becoming junior partner in the new conservative government . backpedalling fast bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul kirchhof consequently , top fdp politicians have been quick to urge merkel to distance herself from kirchhof . germans should vote on the cdu / csu 's election program " not the visions of a scientist , " said the party 's tax expert hermann otto solms . and the fdp 's honorary chairman , otto graf lambsdorff , warned that kirchhof 's nomination was " a risk that may turn out to be bigger than its usefulness . " even the fdp 's chief whip wolfgang gerhardt said on ard public television that while he respected kirchhof , the university professor was politically inexperienced . the spd 's strong recovery in the polls also appears to be unnerving merkel , who insisted sunday that the cdu / csu 's aim was simply to lower the top and bottom rates of income tax . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel " anything beyond that is pie in the sky , " merkel said , appearing to sideline kirchhof and his radical ideas . nevertheless , officially at least , the shadow finance minister remains on board . " our team of experts is going to meet on wednesday and professor kirchhof will definitely be there , " said cdu chief whip volker kauder in berlin on monday . gift for schröder ironically , the nomination of kirchhof has been a godsend for schröder , who was trailing badly in the opinion polls as voters punished him for the deeply unpopular structural and economic reforms he has imposed during his seven years in office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kirchhof has provided gerhard schröder with a breath of fresh air ever media-canny , schröder has tried to turn the tables on merkel , arguing that kirchhof 's visions would make germany an even starker and colder place , carefully ignoring the fact that the university professor 's proposals are not actually contained in the official cdu / csu manifesto . press voices and with the spd bouncing back in the polls , experts do indeed believe that kirchhof could ultimately prove to be merkel 's undoing . the weekly magazine der spiegel made the " battle over kirchhof " its front page story on monday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fdp head guido westerwelle , angela merkel and csu head edmund stoiber the berlin-based daily tagesspiegel said that the election result " is still open .
the reason for this development is kirchhof .
if there is no cdu / csu-fdp majority on september 18 then kirchhof will have had a major part to play in this state of affairs . " but not everyone was being hoodwinked by the political machinations over kirchhof , who increasingly appears to have become an unwitting pawn in the last-minute election battle . the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung said schröder was purposely portraying kirchhof to be a " mad scientist , a social demon who would like nothing more than to put his guinea pigs , the german people , into a deep freeze . " and the left-wing daily tageszeitung satirized the spd 's efforts to portray kirchhof as some sort of blood-sucking vampire on its front page . the headline , " kirchhof , symphony of horror , " was an allusion to the name of f.w. murnau 's classic 1922 film " nosferatu , symphonies des grauens , " below which was a still of the bald , fanged vampire from that same film . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " change is needed to get germany moving " german conservative leader angela merkel is currently favored to become chancellor after the sept .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the 2005/2006 bundesliga season bayern top as flying dutchman takes off bremen stick with record breaking bayern ballack header saves bayern record teams fight to keep pace with bayern sports -pipe- 12.09.2005 is the bundesliga too weak ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ismaël and makaay are stars in the bundesliga , but not internationally germany 's bundesliga may be one of the biggest soccer leagues in europe , but it 's far from the richest or most competitive .
accordingly , the league is finding it hard to attract the world 's best players . both domestically and abroad , the only consistently serious contender in german soccer is fc bayern munich .
the bavarian club is the bundesliga 's traditional powerhouse and the home of past german greats like midfielder franz beckenbauer , goal-scoring maestro gerd müller and keeper sepp maier . the club is also the place to find current stars like oliver kahn , michael ballack and bastian schweinsteiger .
but bayern 's strength is the rest of the league 's weakness and without munich holding the banner high , german soccer would have a hard time being represented in international competitions such as the champions league .
" germany is lacking , with the exception of bayern munich , clubs with international power , " was the assessment of hamburg sv president bernd hoffmann in an interview with the tagesspiegel newspaper .
" the bundesliga is not the top place for stars to be playing .
we don ’ t have the financial strength like the english clubs and have not been successful the past few years , " he said .
brazilians like germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke 04 manager rudi assauer -lrb- r -rrb- with clubs newest young talent , brazilian rafinha the hunt for top talent has long stopped being a national affair .
european club scouts are travelling around the world to seek the next pele .
if you scour the rosters of bundesliga clubs , then you wouldn ’ t necessarily know that you are looking at a german club .
whether it be lucio , d ’ alessandro , vittek or van der vaart , the big names in the league are no longer a " who ’ s who " of german soccer .
in the 2004-05 season , only the english premiership had more foreign players -lrb- 56 percent -rrb- than the bundeliga ’ s 48 percent .
heading into the 2005-06 season , that percentage dropped down to 42.6 percent as cost-cutting measures increase .
financial woes have forced club management to rethink policies .
" i think that the clubs learned their lesson after the kirch -lrb- media company -rrb- crisis , " said german soccer league -lrb- dfl -rrb- managing director christian seifert before the season .
" they are investing more in their youth programs . "
nevertheless , the transfer deadline which expired on august 31 , revealed that clubs would not hesitate to improve their lot by turning to players from abroad .
young brazilians , some of whom shined at the under-20 world championships this summer , figured in many of the deals .
dortmund 's bad example the bosses at borussia dortmund could talk all day long about how costly foreign talent can be .
it almost cost the club its league license .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : borussia dortmund stood on the brink of ruin after taking the 1997 champions league , the ruhr valley club went on a spending spree .
to finance the expensive transfers , the club decided , among other things , to go public and list itself on the stock exchange during the high-flying days of the internet boom .
to pull it off , the whole scheme was dependent on one thing - winning .
this they failed to do and dortmund was just a hair away from declaring bankruptcy last season .
it may sound dumb but the financial health off the field and the success on it rests more and more on the ability of the team directors to find talent before they blossom , that is , before they become overpriced .
bayern recipe for success some complain munich have an unfair advantage in that if a good player wants true international recognition , he will receive it in the bavarian capital .
it becomes an upward spiral of success .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international midfielder sebastian deisler is not a starter at bayern munich the team wins , receives more money which it can spend , and in turn , get better players when needed .
still , being a very good german player , even being on the national squad , is no guarantee for success at bayern .
just talk to sebastian deisler and bastian schweinsteiger who both frequently are used as substitutes .
" there aren ’ t many german players who can play at the level demanded by bayern munich , " bayern coach felix magath said recently .
the gaps are filled in by exceptional , but not necessarily exorbitantly-priced players , such as the central defenders lucio from brazil and valérien ismaël from france or dutch striker roy makaay .

the chancellor , who was largely written off by political analysts in recent months , has managed to halve the gap in the last week after a televised debate with merkel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " wherever i go , i encounter a lot of support .
the tide is turning , " schröder was quoted as telling the sunday edition of the bild newspaper . " at the end of the day , it is the voters who decide who will become their next chancellor . "
the chancellor , whose personal approval ratings have jumped by 11 points since august according to one poll , said the latest polls prove that " the supposed mood for change no longer exists " among the electorate and announced a few extra rallies for the final week of campaigning .
cdu losing ground by contrast , the cdu and their sister bavarian party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- appeared to be faltering in the last days leading up to the election .
several leading surveys at the weekend showed the cdu / csu losing ground , raising conservatives ' fears that they could once again squander a big lead to schröder , who rallied from 12 points behind in six weeks to win the last election in 2002 .
one poll by the emnid institute showed the cdu dropping 1.5 points to 40.5 percent of the vote last week , while the spd surged 3.5 points to 34 percent .
the spd has now gained 8 points in the last month while the cdu has lost 3 points .
another opinion poll showed that the cdu / csu and their preferred coalition partner , the free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- would fall just short of the 48.5 percent of votes needed for a governing majority .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many believe that the most likely outcome of the elections thus would be a so-called " grand coalition " between merkel 's conservatives and the spd with her as chancellor .
but her allies fear that this would make it impossible to implement changes intended to push-start germany 's spluttering economy .
" it is a nightmare vision , " the prime minister of the eastern state of saxony , georg milbrandt , has warned .
" it is pointless to think that a grand coalition could get things moving . "
the kirchhof factor the conservatives ' campaign has also been hit by the appointment by merkel of paul kirchhof as the party 's shadow finance minister if the cdu / csu came to power .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kirchhof -lrb- photo -rrb- , a former constitutional judge and heidelberg university professor who has proposed radical tax reforms and committed a series of political gaffes in media interviews , has become a sort of punching bag for the spd .
schröder , who has slammed merkel 's reform vision as cold and inhuman and painted a grim picture of what it would do to germany 's social welfare system , has also repeatedly attacked kirchhof .
the chancellor has stressed that kirchhof 's tax reforms , including a flat 25 percent tax rate without tax breaks , are unrealistic - a tactic that pollster say has begun to affect voters who are already scared off by kirchhof .
" kirchhof has unleashed a wave of insecurity among voters , " richard hilmer , head of infratest dimap , told reuters .
" if this trend continues , schröder could even reach his goal of 38 percent .
in any case , the chances of a spd coalition with the greens and fdp are much higher now . "
damage control merkel and several other cdu leaders have now begun to distance themselves from kirchhof and instead hinted that they might try and get back friedrich merz , a respected finance expert and former head of the cdu parliamentary faction .
the fdp meanwhile held a one-day conference in berlin on sunday at which party leaders downplayed the bad news from the polling institutes and defended merkel 's reform vision .
bildunterschrift : but the press reported sunday that fdp leader guido westerwelle -lrb- photo -rrb- too was trying to distance the party from radical tax reform proposals by paul kirchhof .

the chancellor , who was largely written off by political analysts in recent months , has managed to halve the gap in the last week after a televised debate with merkel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " wherever i go , i encounter a lot of support .
the tide is turning , " schröder was quoted as telling the sunday edition of the bild newspaper . " at the end of the day , it is the voters who decide who will become their next chancellor . "
the chancellor , whose personal approval ratings have jumped by 11 points since august according to one poll , said the latest polls prove that " the supposed mood for change no longer exists " among the electorate and announced a few extra rallies for the final week of campaigning .
cdu losing ground by contrast , the cdu and their sister bavarian party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- appeared to be faltering in the last days leading up to the election .
several leading surveys at the weekend showed the cdu / csu losing ground , raising conservatives ' fears that they could once again squander a big lead to schröder , who rallied from 12 points behind in six weeks to win the last election in 2002 .
one poll by the emnid institute showed the cdu dropping 1.5 points to 40.5 percent of the vote last week , while the spd surged 3.5 points to 34 percent .
the spd has now gained 8 points in the last month while the cdu has lost 3 points .
another opinion poll showed that the cdu / csu and their preferred coalition partner , the free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- would fall just short of the 48.5 percent of votes needed for a governing majority .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many believe that the most likely outcome of the elections thus would be a so-called " grand coalition " between merkel 's conservatives and the spd with her as chancellor .
but her allies fear that this would make it impossible to implement changes intended to push-start germany 's spluttering economy .
" it is a nightmare vision , " the prime minister of the eastern state of saxony , georg milbrandt , has warned .
" it is pointless to think that a grand coalition could get things moving . "
the kirchhof factor the conservatives ' campaign has also been hit by the appointment by merkel of paul kirchhof as the party 's shadow finance minister if the cdu / csu came to power .

schröder , who has slammed merkel 's reform vision as cold and inhuman and painted a grim picture of what it would do to germany 's social welfare system , has also repeatedly attacked kirchhof .
the chancellor has stressed that kirchhof 's tax reforms , including a flat 25 percent tax rate without tax breaks , are unrealistic - a tactic that pollster say has begun to affect voters who are already scared off by kirchhof .
" kirchhof has unleashed a wave of insecurity among voters , " richard hilmer , head of infratest dimap , told reuters .
" if this trend continues , schröder could even reach his goal of 38 percent .
in any case , the chances of a spd coalition with the greens and fdp are much higher now . "

a replacement has already been found in franz schönhuber , the former national leader of another right wing-extremist party , but there is n't enough time to reprint ballots before sunday . as the race for the chancellery becomes tighter with the election just days away , politicians and legal experts are mulling the ramifications of a late vote in dresden , with some saying that a delayed election could throw into question the legality of the national vote . experts such as werner patzelt , a political scientist from dresden university , predicted political turmoil if the race turns out to be extremely narrow as in the last election , where social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- only had about 6,000 votes more than the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german parliament 's make-up might not be known until oct .
2 " should the question of whether we 'll see a grand coalition -lrb- cdu and spd -rrb- or one between the cdu and the -lrb- free-market -rrb- liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- hinge on a single mandate , then indeed the postponed election in the dresden constituency may be of crucial importance , " he told dw-radio . splitti n g the electio n ? hans meyer , a professor of constitutional law and former president of berlin 's humboldt university , said he believes the election outcome will be challenged should dresdeners vote after the results in the rest of the country have already become public . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have two votes in an interview with bavarian public broadcaster br , meyer added that dresdeners should at least vote for a party on sunday .
in germany , each voter has two votes - one to elect a direct candidate for his or her constituency and another to choose a political party that then gets parliamentary seats according to the percentage of votes it achieves . one party that supports such a splitting of votes in dresden is germany 's new left party , which consists of the successor party to the former communist party of east germany and disgruntled social democrats from western germany . distorti n g results ?

the left party fears that a late election in dresden could harm their chances to win a direct seat in dresden .
others believe , however , that a late vote might actually help the party as social democrats might tactically support the left party 's candidate to prevent an extra seat for the christian democrats , whose candidate is leading in the polls . the africa compariso n while local candidates for other parties also complained about the postponed election , officials at the national level said they did n't see this as a problem . " maybe it 's possible in africa to hold back election results for a couple of weeks , but you can not do that in germany , " dirk niebel , the fdp 's general secretary , said on the morning show of germany 's public broadcasters . other legal experts also said that there was nothing illegal about a late vote in dresden . " there 's no law that forbids this , " gottfried mahrenholz , a former constitutional court judge , told german public radio , deutschlandfunk .

but over the weekend , it was n't cellists and violinists at center stage , rather djs , breakdancers and beat boxers . at leipzig 's kohlrabizirkus venue , technicians were busy behind huge boards during sound check .
the bass and treble levels have to be perfectly balanced since the world 's best djs were about to go head to head during this first hop-hop championship . the hip hop world challenge , hosted by top german hip-hop star thomas d and the american mc freestyle , aimed to demonstrate germany 's openness to youth culture and artistic expression .
it was supported by the cultural fund of the german football federation , which is eager to show the country in the best possible light ahead of the 2006 fifa world cup , which will take place in germany next summer . still , that the fund 's committee would give the green light for a hip-hop competition was nonetheless a surprise to organizer norbert seiler , known to hip-hop fans as " parago . " " hip hop is an integral part of german youth culture today , " seiler told dw-world .
" everyone runs around in baggy pants , you can see it in the language , in the music .
so i told the committee , if you want to encourage culture - and the point of the cultural program is to show germany as a tolerant and artistically cosmopolitan host country - then the hip-hop fest ca n't be left out . " more than just music since its beginnings in the mid-eighties , hip-hop has developed from an underground subculture to an art form with three disciplines .
for the hip-hop world challenge , participants competed in break-dance , beat box , and dj skills . bildunterschrift : hip hop world challenge 2005 " break dancing is a kind of rhythmical floor acrobatics .
these are the kids that roll on their backs and pedal the air with their feet and stand on one hand , " seiler said .
" the djs play with records , scratching them and juggling the beats .
in beat box you make sounds and rhythms with your own voice , there 's no instruments allowed . " among the competitors at the hip hop world challenge was the belgian threesome pyro-man .
in perfect rhythmic and melodic harmony , the trio beat boxed effortlessly between styles .
pyro-man member jerome said beat boxing allowed him full artistic freedom . " beat box offers you all possible stylistic options ; you are n't restricted in any way .
pop , jungle , drum and bass , funk , punk : anything goes , " said jerome . scratching and juggling the beats the french dj pfel then took center stage .
with a look of intense concentration on his face , his hands fly over the vinyl spinning in front of him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hip hop culture emerged in the ‘ 80s in new york city he is no newcomer to the hip-hop scene , having competed in the dj world championships in 2003 and 2004 .
he came to leipzig to show off his stuff , but said the competition was sure to be stiff . " the jury looks at a lot of things .
you 've got to be musical and original .
you ca n't use a sound that 's been used a thousand times , " he said .
" then there 's the technical part .
you have to avoid goofing up with your hand work .
finally there 's the show .

18 . instead , with less than a week to go before election day , kirchhof 's audacious proposals for a flat-rate tax of 25 percent have boomeranged on her , slashing the cdu / csu 's 21-point lead over chancellor gerhard schröder and his social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- in the opinion polls to a paltry seven points . that may not be enough for schröder to be re-elected , but it could force merkel and the cdu / csu into a " grand coalition " with his spd party , a horror scenario for many , particularly the free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , who have set their hearts on becoming junior partner in the new conservative government . backpedalling fast bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul kirchhof consequently , top fdp politicians have been quick to urge merkel to distance herself from kirchhof . germans should vote on the cdu / csu 's election program " not the visions of a scientist , " said the party 's tax expert hermann otto solms . and the fdp 's honorary chairman , otto graf lambsdorff , warned that kirchhof 's nomination was " a risk that may turn out to be bigger than its usefulness . " even the fdp 's chief whip wolfgang gerhardt said on ard public television that while he respected kirchhof , the university professor was politically inexperienced . the spd 's strong recovery in the polls also appears to be unnerving merkel , who insisted sunday that the cdu / csu 's aim was simply to lower the top and bottom rates of income tax . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel " anything beyond that is pie in the sky , " merkel said , appearing to sideline kirchhof and his radical ideas . nevertheless , officially at least , the shadow finance minister remains on board . " our team of experts is going to meet on wednesday and professor kirchhof will definitely be there , " said cdu chief whip volker kauder in berlin on monday . gift for schröder ironically , the nomination of kirchhof has been a godsend for schröder , who was trailing badly in the opinion polls as voters punished him for the deeply unpopular structural and economic reforms he has imposed during his seven years in office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kirchhof has provided gerhard schröder with a breath of fresh air ever media-canny , schröder has tried to turn the tables on merkel , arguing that kirchhof 's visions would make germany an even starker and colder place , carefully ignoring the fact that the university professor 's proposals are not actually contained in the official cdu / csu manifesto . press voices and with the spd bouncing back in the polls , experts do indeed believe that kirchhof could ultimately prove to be merkel 's undoing . the weekly magazine der spiegel made the " battle over kirchhof " its front page story on monday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fdp head guido westerwelle , angela merkel and csu head edmund stoiber the berlin-based daily tagesspiegel said that the election result " is still open .
the reason for this development is kirchhof .
if there is no cdu / csu-fdp majority on september 18 then kirchhof will have had a major part to play in this state of affairs . " but not everyone was being hoodwinked by the political machinations over kirchhof , who increasingly appears to have become an unwitting pawn in the last-minute election battle . the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung said schröder was purposely portraying kirchhof to be a " mad scientist , a social demon who would like nothing more than to put his guinea pigs , the german people , into a deep freeze . " and the left-wing daily tageszeitung satirized the spd 's efforts to portray kirchhof as some sort of blood-sucking vampire on its front page . the headline , " kirchhof , symphony of horror , " was an allusion to the name of f.w. murnau 's classic 1922 film " nosferatu , symphonies des grauens , " below which was a still of the bald , fanged vampire from that same film . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " change is needed to get germany moving " german conservative leader angela merkel is currently favored to become chancellor after the sept .

young brazilians , some of whom shined at the under-20 world championships this summer , figured in many of the deals .
dortmund 's bad example the bosses at borussia dortmund could talk all day long about how costly foreign talent can be .
it almost cost the club its league license .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : borussia dortmund stood on the brink of ruin after taking the 1997 champions league , the ruhr valley club went on a spending spree .
to finance the expensive transfers , the club decided , among other things , to go public and list itself on the stock exchange during the high-flying days of the internet boom .
to pull it off , the whole scheme was dependent on one thing - winning .
this they failed to do and dortmund was just a hair away from declaring bankruptcy last season .
it may sound dumb but the financial health off the field and the success on it rests more and more on the ability of the team directors to find talent before they blossom , that is , before they become overpriced .
bayern recipe for success some complain munich have an unfair advantage in that if a good player wants true international recognition , he will receive it in the bavarian capital .
it becomes an upward spiral of success .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international midfielder sebastian deisler is not a starter at bayern munich the team wins , receives more money which it can spend , and in turn , get better players when needed .
still , being a very good german player , even being on the national squad , is no guarantee for success at bayern .
just talk to sebastian deisler and bastian schweinsteiger who both frequently are used as substitutes .
" there aren ’ t many german players who can play at the level demanded by bayern munich , " bayern coach felix magath said recently .
the gaps are filled in by exceptional , but not necessarily exorbitantly-priced players , such as the central defenders lucio from brazil and valérien ismaël from france or dutch striker roy makaay .
but as if to highlight the deficits of german club soccer , none of those three play exceptional roles in their national teams . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new crop of brazilians in bundesliga before the transfer window came to a close on aug .

a recent and fatal teenage attack on a seven-year-old boy near berlin has promoted cries from the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- for germany to review its liberal approach to dealing with criminals , however young they are . it was a particularly brutal and gratuitous crime , in which a boy of 16 beat an innocent child and neighbor to death , and subsequently attributed his violence to " personal frustration . "
it can be of no surprise to anyone that such savage behavior should unleash calls for tighter measures to prevent any future repetition of such tragedies .
but opinions on exactly how to deal with germany 's delinquent youngsters vary enormously .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a correction center in northern germany some say they should be given the benefit of the doubt on the grounds that they can not be held fully responsible for their own actions until they come of age .
others refute such claims as dangerously naïve , bellowing that acts of such evil ill-will should be paid for through the iron bars of a correction center .
there are currently some 6,000 criminals serving their time in juvenile offenders institutes across the country , but if the cdu had its way , that figure could be far higher .
in a statement issued following the horrific juvenile attack last month , chairman of the cdu berlin parliamentary group , andreas gram , and cdu legal expert , nicolas zimmer , called for a radical rethink .
" the soft touch era is finally over .
the justice system should react more swiftly to the first cases and signs of a criminal career , and be quicker to sentence violent young criminals to imprisonment , " they said .
no more coddling among other things , they propose detaining " profoundly dangerous and criminal children and youths " in special purpose , enclosed premises and reducing the age of criminal responsibility below its current minimum of 14 .
they have also called for the regulation which currently allows young adults up to the age of 21 to be tried under juvenile law , to be replaced by a statute which would treat them according to the same laws as adults .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu want youngsters to be tried as adults the warden of berlin 's plötzensee correctional institute for juveniles , marius fiedler , says that such debates date back decades , and that they are too general to be widely effective .
" you always just have to do the right thing , and you can only do that by looking at each individual case .
it 's a matter of recognizing the problems early on and steering the youngsters in the right direction . "
he added that there is only one 16 year-old inmate at the berlin center and none who are younger .
so does that render the cdu plea to reduce the age of accountability unnecessary , or is it an indication that the system is simply too lax ?
prevention is better than cure fact is , germany is not particularly tough on its young lawbreakers .
chairman of the juvenile court association bernd sonnen says the system is geared to try and work with criminal youngsters in such a way that they can avoid being incarcerated and prevent a career in crime before it is too late .
" between 66 and 69 percent of youth crimes in germany are resolved out of court .
the offenders can repair damage they have caused , they can take part in anti-aggression training or in mediated face to face sessions with their victims , " he explained .
" the success rate of the latter is particularly successful , and the advantage is that they do not become labeled criminals which is often a self-fulfilling prophecy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as many as 69 percent of youth crimes never make it to court but that is of little consolation to the victims of the crimes which continue to be part of the fabric of society here . sonnen says he can understand the calls to lock delinquents away , and the belief that a harder stance will prevent re-offending , but adds that it simply is n't the truth of the matter .
" sure , putting people behind bars is the toughest measure we have on offer , but it is also proven that it creates the highest rate of repeat offending .

a recent and fatal teenage attack on a seven-year-old boy near berlin has promoted cries from the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- for germany to review its liberal approach to dealing with criminals , however young they are . it was a particularly brutal and gratuitous crime , in which a boy of 16 beat an innocent child and neighbor to death , and subsequently attributed his violence to " personal frustration . "
it can be of no surprise to anyone that such savage behavior should unleash calls for tighter measures to prevent any future repetition of such tragedies .
but opinions on exactly how to deal with germany 's delinquent youngsters vary enormously .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a correction center in northern germany some say they should be given the benefit of the doubt on the grounds that they can not be held fully responsible for their own actions until they come of age .
others refute such claims as dangerously naïve , bellowing that acts of such evil ill-will should be paid for through the iron bars of a correction center .
there are currently some 6,000 criminals serving their time in juvenile offenders institutes across the country , but if the cdu had its way , that figure could be far higher .
in a statement issued following the horrific juvenile attack last month , chairman of the cdu berlin parliamentary group , andreas gram , and cdu legal expert , nicolas zimmer , called for a radical rethink .
" the soft touch era is finally over .
the justice system should react more swiftly to the first cases and signs of a criminal career , and be quicker to sentence violent young criminals to imprisonment , " they said .
no more coddling among other things , they propose detaining " profoundly dangerous and criminal children and youths " in special purpose , enclosed premises and reducing the age of criminal responsibility below its current minimum of 14 .
they have also called for the regulation which currently allows young adults up to the age of 21 to be tried under juvenile law , to be replaced by a statute which would treat them according to the same laws as adults .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu want youngsters to be tried as adults the warden of berlin 's plötzensee correctional institute for juveniles , marius fiedler , says that such debates date back decades , and that they are too general to be widely effective .
" you always just have to do the right thing , and you can only do that by looking at each individual case .
it 's a matter of recognizing the problems early on and steering the youngsters in the right direction . "
he added that there is only one 16 year-old inmate at the berlin center and none who are younger .
so does that render the cdu plea to reduce the age of accountability unnecessary , or is it an indication that the system is simply too lax ?
prevention is better than cure fact is , germany is not particularly tough on its young lawbreakers .
chairman of the juvenile court association bernd sonnen says the system is geared to try and work with criminal youngsters in such a way that they can avoid being incarcerated and prevent a career in crime before it is too late .
" between 66 and 69 percent of youth crimes in germany are resolved out of court .
the offenders can repair damage they have caused , they can take part in anti-aggression training or in mediated face to face sessions with their victims , " he explained .
" the success rate of the latter is particularly successful , and the advantage is that they do not become labeled criminals which is often a self-fulfilling prophecy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as many as 69 percent of youth crimes never make it to court but that is of little consolation to the victims of the crimes which continue to be part of the fabric of society here . sonnen says he can understand the calls to lock delinquents away , and the belief that a harder stance will prevent re-offending , but adds that it simply is n't the truth of the matter .
" sure , putting people behind bars is the toughest measure we have on offer , but it is also proven that it creates the highest rate of repeat offending .
when someone has been locked up for a given period and is then suddenly set free , they are highly likely to just go out and commit another crime , " he said .

" of course there are countries which are much tougher with their young criminals .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 12.09.2005 the lot of young german offenders großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how far can youths go before they wind up behind bars ?
a recent and fatal teenage attack on a seven-year-old boy near berlin has promoted cries from the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- for germany to review its liberal approach to dealing with criminals , however young they are . it was a particularly brutal and gratuitous crime , in which a boy of 16 beat an innocent child and neighbor to death , and subsequently attributed his violence to " personal frustration . "
it can be of no surprise to anyone that such savage behavior should unleash calls for tighter measures to prevent any future repetition of such tragedies .
but opinions on exactly how to deal with germany 's delinquent youngsters vary enormously .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a correction center in northern germany some say they should be given the benefit of the doubt on the grounds that they can not be held fully responsible for their own actions until they come of age .
others refute such claims as dangerously naïve , bellowing that acts of such evil ill-will should be paid for through the iron bars of a correction center .
there are currently some 6,000 criminals serving their time in juvenile offenders institutes across the country , but if the cdu had its way , that figure could be far higher .
in a statement issued following the horrific juvenile attack last month , chairman of the cdu berlin parliamentary group , andreas gram , and cdu legal expert , nicolas zimmer , called for a radical rethink .
" the soft touch era is finally over .
the justice system should react more swiftly to the first cases and signs of a criminal career , and be quicker to sentence violent young criminals to imprisonment , " they said .
no more coddling among other things , they propose detaining " profoundly dangerous and criminal children and youths " in special purpose , enclosed premises and reducing the age of criminal responsibility below its current minimum of 14 .
they have also called for the regulation which currently allows young adults up to the age of 21 to be tried under juvenile law , to be replaced by a statute which would treat them according to the same laws as adults .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu want youngsters to be tried as adults the warden of berlin 's plötzensee correctional institute for juveniles , marius fiedler , says that such debates date back decades , and that they are too general to be widely effective .
" you always just have to do the right thing , and you can only do that by looking at each individual case .
it 's a matter of recognizing the problems early on and steering the youngsters in the right direction . "
he added that there is only one 16 year-old inmate at the berlin center and none who are younger .
so does that render the cdu plea to reduce the age of accountability unnecessary , or is it an indication that the system is simply too lax ?
prevention is better than cure fact is , germany is not particularly tough on its young lawbreakers .
chairman of the juvenile court association bernd sonnen says the system is geared to try and work with criminal youngsters in such a way that they can avoid being incarcerated and prevent a career in crime before it is too late .
" between 66 and 69 percent of youth crimes in germany are resolved out of court .
the offenders can repair damage they have caused , they can take part in anti-aggression training or in mediated face to face sessions with their victims , " he explained .
" the success rate of the latter is particularly successful , and the advantage is that they do not become labeled criminals which is often a self-fulfilling prophecy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as many as 69 percent of youth crimes never make it to court but that is of little consolation to the victims of the crimes which continue to be part of the fabric of society here . sonnen says he can understand the calls to lock delinquents away , and the belief that a harder stance will prevent re-offending , but adds that it simply is n't the truth of the matter .
" sure , putting people behind bars is the toughest measure we have on offer , but it is also proven that it creates the highest rate of repeat offending .
when someone has been locked up for a given period and is then suddenly set free , they are highly likely to just go out and commit another crime , " he said .
rise in violent juvenile crime marius fiedler agrees that a jail sentence should be an absolute last resort .
" of course there are countries which are much tougher with their young criminals .
the state of california locks away about eight times the number of juveniles that we do , but are crime levels there are lower as a result ? " the governor asked .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the overwhelming majority of prisoners in germany are male sixty percent of the 554 male prisoners detained at the berlin young offenders institute are there as a result of committing violent crimes , from armed robbery to murder , and the picture is much the same across germany as a whole .
although crimes such as theft are declining , reported incidences of juvenile violence are indeed on the rise , but sonnen says the onus is on the word reported .
" we have become sensitized to violence and we are prepared to do something about it , to denounce violent crime .
whereas ten years ago school directors would have denied any sign of brutality in their establishments , they are now willing to admit that the problem exists , " he explained .
family problems and more often than not , the problem is the consequence of other , personal problems which date back to early childhood days .
fiedler says if there is anything that the young men who walk through the correction center gates have in common , it is bad family relations and a poor education .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a glance inside with that in mind , places like berlin plötzensee operate a strictly no punishment policy , but offer an extensive range of schooling , apprenticeship and work opportunities to try and generate a different sense of self-worth in the youngsters while they are inside .
for some it is the best they have ever known .
" a lot of them develop well inside , then shortly before their release date , they do something silly so their sentence is extended .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the 2005/2006 bundesliga season bayern top as flying dutchman takes off bremen stick with record breaking bayern ballack header saves bayern record teams fight to keep pace with bayern sports -pipe- 12.09.2005 is the bundesliga too weak ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ismaël and makaay are stars in the bundesliga , but not internationally germany 's bundesliga may be one of the biggest soccer leagues in europe , but it 's far from the richest or most competitive .
accordingly , the league is finding it hard to attract the world 's best players . both domestically and abroad , the only consistently serious contender in german soccer is fc bayern munich .
the bavarian club is the bundesliga 's traditional powerhouse and the home of past german greats like midfielder franz beckenbauer , goal-scoring maestro gerd müller and keeper sepp maier . the club is also the place to find current stars like oliver kahn , michael ballack and bastian schweinsteiger .
but bayern 's strength is the rest of the league 's weakness and without munich holding the banner high , german soccer would have a hard time being represented in international competitions such as the champions league .
" germany is lacking , with the exception of bayern munich , clubs with international power , " was the assessment of hamburg sv president bernd hoffmann in an interview with the tagesspiegel newspaper .
" the bundesliga is not the top place for stars to be playing .
we don ’ t have the financial strength like the english clubs and have not been successful the past few years , " he said .
brazilians like germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke 04 manager rudi assauer -lrb- r -rrb- with clubs newest young talent , brazilian rafinha the hunt for top talent has long stopped being a national affair .
european club scouts are travelling around the world to seek the next pele .
if you scour the rosters of bundesliga clubs , then you wouldn ’ t necessarily know that you are looking at a german club .
whether it be lucio , d ’ alessandro , vittek or van der vaart , the big names in the league are no longer a " who ’ s who " of german soccer .
in the 2004-05 season , only the english premiership had more foreign players -lrb- 56 percent -rrb- than the bundeliga ’ s 48 percent .
heading into the 2005-06 season , that percentage dropped down to 42.6 percent as cost-cutting measures increase .
financial woes have forced club management to rethink policies .
" i think that the clubs learned their lesson after the kirch -lrb- media company -rrb- crisis , " said german soccer league -lrb- dfl -rrb- managing director christian seifert before the season .
" they are investing more in their youth programs . "
nevertheless , the transfer deadline which expired on august 31 , revealed that clubs would not hesitate to improve their lot by turning to players from abroad .
young brazilians , some of whom shined at the under-20 world championships this summer , figured in many of the deals .
dortmund 's bad example the bosses at borussia dortmund could talk all day long about how costly foreign talent can be .
it almost cost the club its league license .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : borussia dortmund stood on the brink of ruin after taking the 1997 champions league , the ruhr valley club went on a spending spree .
to finance the expensive transfers , the club decided , among other things , to go public and list itself on the stock exchange during the high-flying days of the internet boom .
to pull it off , the whole scheme was dependent on one thing - winning .
this they failed to do and dortmund was just a hair away from declaring bankruptcy last season .
it may sound dumb but the financial health off the field and the success on it rests more and more on the ability of the team directors to find talent before they blossom , that is , before they become overpriced .
bayern recipe for success some complain munich have an unfair advantage in that if a good player wants true international recognition , he will receive it in the bavarian capital .
it becomes an upward spiral of success .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international midfielder sebastian deisler is not a starter at bayern munich the team wins , receives more money which it can spend , and in turn , get better players when needed .
still , being a very good german player , even being on the national squad , is no guarantee for success at bayern .
just talk to sebastian deisler and bastian schweinsteiger who both frequently are used as substitutes .
" there aren ’ t many german players who can play at the level demanded by bayern munich , " bayern coach felix magath said recently .
the gaps are filled in by exceptional , but not necessarily exorbitantly-priced players , such as the central defenders lucio from brazil and valérien ismaël from france or dutch striker roy makaay .
but as if to highlight the deficits of german club soccer , none of those three play exceptional roles in their national teams . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new crop of brazilians in bundesliga before the transfer window came to a close on aug .

germany remains opposed to us desires to merge nato peacekeepers and the us-led coalition there . defense ministers from the 26-nation military body will look at a range of issues , including the alliances own development over the next decade , forces in iraq and in the balkans and the situation in sudan .
but afghanistan will probably provide the most substantial item on the menu , ahead of the country 's first parliamentary elections in 30 years on saturday . nato , in charge of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan , has beefed up its troop levels in the run-up to the ballots , which has seen a surge in violence across the country . bildunterschrift : german armored vehicles from isaf at the informal talks in berlin , which are being held under tight security , the ministers will discuss the planned extension of isaf into the south of the country early next year , in the latest stage of its expansion around the country after starting in the capital kabul . britain , canada and the netherlands are to lead the move into the south , joining some 18,000 us soldiers who have long been fighting al qaeda and taliban fighters , in particular along the eastern border with pakistan . merging operations ? washington is eager to see isaf active across the whole country by the end of 2006 - and also has expressed interest in merging or , at a minimum , increasing cooperation between its own operation enduring freedom troops -lrb- oef -rrb- and the nato-led force . that push faces strong reservations from some european allies - notably from germany , france and turkey who oppose a full merger , fearing that it would turn peacekeepers into targets for the opponents of the kabul government under hamid karsai .
the oef force now bears the brunt of the insurgency . in an interview with the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper on monday , german defense minister peter struck that the answer from germany would be a " clear no . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck " that would make the situation for our soldiers doubly dangerous and worsen the current climate in afghanistan , " he said , ahead of the two-day meeting . in an interview with dw-tv , struck said that the taliban were fighting " the last fight in the truest sense of the word " to destabilize elections on sept .
18th , although he added that there was no reason to fear that large attacks are being planned in the north were some german isaf forces are stationed . stronger political outlook struck also said he wanted the alliance to adopt a more political orientation when tackling security issues . " the signal from berlin should be that nato will respond to new threats not only militarily , but politically as well , " he said in the run-up to the meeting , adding that it would mean defense ministers have a stronger influence on decisions made by foreign ministers . in the longer term , the nato ministers will seek to focus on what the alliance - whose operations have spread over the last year into iraq and sudan - should look like in 2015-2020 . on wednesday the west 's former military bloc will meet with their russian counterpart sergei ivanov , for regular talks which increasingly focus on the fight against terrorism . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato approves aid for katrina relief nato on friday approved a us request for it to play a bigger role in transporting and coordinating european aid for the victims of hurricane katrina .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 12.09.2005 merkel 's finance minister strategy backfires großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul kirchhof has become a liability for angela merkel paul kirchhof , the finance expert that angela merkel tapped as possible finance minister , has become a dangerous liability that could cost the conservatives victory , observers said monday . when merkel named the 62-year-old university professor and former constitutional court judge her shadow finance minister last month , she clearly believed the appointment - kirchhof is widely respected and regarded as a brilliant thinker by his peers - was a coup that would cement an expected win on sept .
18 . instead , with less than a week to go before election day , kirchhof 's audacious proposals for a flat-rate tax of 25 percent have boomeranged on her , slashing the cdu / csu 's 21-point lead over chancellor gerhard schröder and his social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- in the opinion polls to a paltry seven points . that may not be enough for schröder to be re-elected , but it could force merkel and the cdu / csu into a " grand coalition " with his spd party , a horror scenario for many , particularly the free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , who have set their hearts on becoming junior partner in the new conservative government . backpedalling fast bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul kirchhof consequently , top fdp politicians have been quick to urge merkel to distance herself from kirchhof . germans should vote on the cdu / csu 's election program " not the visions of a scientist , " said the party 's tax expert hermann otto solms . and the fdp 's honorary chairman , otto graf lambsdorff , warned that kirchhof 's nomination was " a risk that may turn out to be bigger than its usefulness . " even the fdp 's chief whip wolfgang gerhardt said on ard public television that while he respected kirchhof , the university professor was politically inexperienced . the spd 's strong recovery in the polls also appears to be unnerving merkel , who insisted sunday that the cdu / csu 's aim was simply to lower the top and bottom rates of income tax . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel " anything beyond that is pie in the sky , " merkel said , appearing to sideline kirchhof and his radical ideas . nevertheless , officially at least , the shadow finance minister remains on board . " our team of experts is going to meet on wednesday and professor kirchhof will definitely be there , " said cdu chief whip volker kauder in berlin on monday . gift for schröder ironically , the nomination of kirchhof has been a godsend for schröder , who was trailing badly in the opinion polls as voters punished him for the deeply unpopular structural and economic reforms he has imposed during his seven years in office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kirchhof has provided gerhard schröder with a breath of fresh air ever media-canny , schröder has tried to turn the tables on merkel , arguing that kirchhof 's visions would make germany an even starker and colder place , carefully ignoring the fact that the university professor 's proposals are not actually contained in the official cdu / csu manifesto . press voices and with the spd bouncing back in the polls , experts do indeed believe that kirchhof could ultimately prove to be merkel 's undoing . the weekly magazine der spiegel made the " battle over kirchhof " its front page story on monday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fdp head guido westerwelle , angela merkel and csu head edmund stoiber the berlin-based daily tagesspiegel said that the election result " is still open .
the reason for this development is kirchhof .
if there is no cdu / csu-fdp majority on september 18 then kirchhof will have had a major part to play in this state of affairs . " but not everyone was being hoodwinked by the political machinations over kirchhof , who increasingly appears to have become an unwitting pawn in the last-minute election battle . the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung said schröder was purposely portraying kirchhof to be a " mad scientist , a social demon who would like nothing more than to put his guinea pigs , the german people , into a deep freeze . " and the left-wing daily tageszeitung satirized the spd 's efforts to portray kirchhof as some sort of blood-sucking vampire on its front page . the headline , " kirchhof , symphony of horror , " was an allusion to the name of f.w. murnau 's classic 1922 film " nosferatu , symphonies des grauens , " below which was a still of the bald , fanged vampire from that same film . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " change is needed to get germany moving " german conservative leader angela merkel is currently favored to become chancellor after the sept .

18 . instead , with less than a week to go before election day , kirchhof 's audacious proposals for a flat-rate tax of 25 percent have boomeranged on her , slashing the cdu / csu 's 21-point lead over chancellor gerhard schröder and his social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- in the opinion polls to a paltry seven points . that may not be enough for schröder to be re-elected , but it could force merkel and the cdu / csu into a " grand coalition " with his spd party , a horror scenario for many , particularly the free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , who have set their hearts on becoming junior partner in the new conservative government . backpedalling fast bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul kirchhof consequently , top fdp politicians have been quick to urge merkel to distance herself from kirchhof . germans should vote on the cdu / csu 's election program " not the visions of a scientist , " said the party 's tax expert hermann otto solms . and the fdp 's honorary chairman , otto graf lambsdorff , warned that kirchhof 's nomination was " a risk that may turn out to be bigger than its usefulness . " even the fdp 's chief whip wolfgang gerhardt said on ard public television that while he respected kirchhof , the university professor was politically inexperienced . the spd 's strong recovery in the polls also appears to be unnerving merkel , who insisted sunday that the cdu / csu 's aim was simply to lower the top and bottom rates of income tax . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel " anything beyond that is pie in the sky , " merkel said , appearing to sideline kirchhof and his radical ideas . nevertheless , officially at least , the shadow finance minister remains on board . " our team of experts is going to meet on wednesday and professor kirchhof will definitely be there , " said cdu chief whip volker kauder in berlin on monday . gift for schröder ironically , the nomination of kirchhof has been a godsend for schröder , who was trailing badly in the opinion polls as voters punished him for the deeply unpopular structural and economic reforms he has imposed during his seven years in office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kirchhof has provided gerhard schröder with a breath of fresh air ever media-canny , schröder has tried to turn the tables on merkel , arguing that kirchhof 's visions would make germany an even starker and colder place , carefully ignoring the fact that the university professor 's proposals are not actually contained in the official cdu / csu manifesto . press voices and with the spd bouncing back in the polls , experts do indeed believe that kirchhof could ultimately prove to be merkel 's undoing . the weekly magazine der spiegel made the " battle over kirchhof " its front page story on monday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fdp head guido westerwelle , angela merkel and csu head edmund stoiber the berlin-based daily tagesspiegel said that the election result " is still open .
the reason for this development is kirchhof .
if there is no cdu / csu-fdp majority on september 18 then kirchhof will have had a major part to play in this state of affairs . " but not everyone was being hoodwinked by the political machinations over kirchhof , who increasingly appears to have become an unwitting pawn in the last-minute election battle . the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung said schröder was purposely portraying kirchhof to be a " mad scientist , a social demon who would like nothing more than to put his guinea pigs , the german people , into a deep freeze . " and the left-wing daily tageszeitung satirized the spd 's efforts to portray kirchhof as some sort of blood-sucking vampire on its front page . the headline , " kirchhof , symphony of horror , " was an allusion to the name of f.w. murnau 's classic 1922 film " nosferatu , symphonies des grauens , " below which was a still of the bald , fanged vampire from that same film . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " change is needed to get germany moving " german conservative leader angela merkel is currently favored to become chancellor after the sept .

the chancellor , who was largely written off by political analysts in recent months , has managed to halve the gap in the last week after a televised debate with merkel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " wherever i go , i encounter a lot of support .
the tide is turning , " schröder was quoted as telling the sunday edition of the bild newspaper . " at the end of the day , it is the voters who decide who will become their next chancellor . "
the chancellor , whose personal approval ratings have jumped by 11 points since august according to one poll , said the latest polls prove that " the supposed mood for change no longer exists " among the electorate and announced a few extra rallies for the final week of campaigning .
cdu losing ground by contrast , the cdu and their sister bavarian party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- appeared to be faltering in the last days leading up to the election .
several leading surveys at the weekend showed the cdu / csu losing ground , raising conservatives ' fears that they could once again squander a big lead to schröder , who rallied from 12 points behind in six weeks to win the last election in 2002 .
one poll by the emnid institute showed the cdu dropping 1.5 points to 40.5 percent of the vote last week , while the spd surged 3.5 points to 34 percent .
the spd has now gained 8 points in the last month while the cdu has lost 3 points .
another opinion poll showed that the cdu / csu and their preferred coalition partner , the free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- would fall just short of the 48.5 percent of votes needed for a governing majority .

the chancellor has stressed that kirchhof 's tax reforms , including a flat 25 percent tax rate without tax breaks , are unrealistic - a tactic that pollster say has begun to affect voters who are already scared off by kirchhof .
" kirchhof has unleashed a wave of insecurity among voters , " richard hilmer , head of infratest dimap , told reuters .

one poll by the emnid institute showed the cdu dropping 1.5 points to 40.5 percent of the vote last week , while the spd surged 3.5 points to 34 percent .
the spd has now gained 8 points in the last month while the cdu has lost 3 points .

the chancellor has stressed that kirchhof 's tax reforms , including a flat 25 percent tax rate without tax breaks , are unrealistic - a tactic that pollster say has begun to affect voters who are already scared off by kirchhof .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 12.09.2005 merkel 's finance minister strategy backfires großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul kirchhof has become a liability for angela merkel paul kirchhof , the finance expert that angela merkel tapped as possible finance minister , has become a dangerous liability that could cost the conservatives victory , observers said monday . when merkel named the 62-year-old university professor and former constitutional court judge her shadow finance minister last month , she clearly believed the appointment - kirchhof is widely respected and regarded as a brilliant thinker by his peers - was a coup that would cement an expected win on sept .
18 . instead , with less than a week to go before election day , kirchhof 's audacious proposals for a flat-rate tax of 25 percent have boomeranged on her , slashing the cdu / csu 's 21-point lead over chancellor gerhard schröder and his social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- in the opinion polls to a paltry seven points . that may not be enough for schröder to be re-elected , but it could force merkel and the cdu / csu into a " grand coalition " with his spd party , a horror scenario for many , particularly the free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , who have set their hearts on becoming junior partner in the new conservative government . backpedalling fast bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul kirchhof consequently , top fdp politicians have been quick to urge merkel to distance herself from kirchhof . germans should vote on the cdu / csu 's election program " not the visions of a scientist , " said the party 's tax expert hermann otto solms . and the fdp 's honorary chairman , otto graf lambsdorff , warned that kirchhof 's nomination was " a risk that may turn out to be bigger than its usefulness . " even the fdp 's chief whip wolfgang gerhardt said on ard public television that while he respected kirchhof , the university professor was politically inexperienced . the spd 's strong recovery in the polls also appears to be unnerving merkel , who insisted sunday that the cdu / csu 's aim was simply to lower the top and bottom rates of income tax . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel " anything beyond that is pie in the sky , " merkel said , appearing to sideline kirchhof and his radical ideas . nevertheless , officially at least , the shadow finance minister remains on board . " our team of experts is going to meet on wednesday and professor kirchhof will definitely be there , " said cdu chief whip volker kauder in berlin on monday . gift for schröder ironically , the nomination of kirchhof has been a godsend for schröder , who was trailing badly in the opinion polls as voters punished him for the deeply unpopular structural and economic reforms he has imposed during his seven years in office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kirchhof has provided gerhard schröder with a breath of fresh air ever media-canny , schröder has tried to turn the tables on merkel , arguing that kirchhof 's visions would make germany an even starker and colder place , carefully ignoring the fact that the university professor 's proposals are not actually contained in the official cdu / csu manifesto . press voices and with the spd bouncing back in the polls , experts do indeed believe that kirchhof could ultimately prove to be merkel 's undoing . the weekly magazine der spiegel made the " battle over kirchhof " its front page story on monday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fdp head guido westerwelle , angela merkel and csu head edmund stoiber the berlin-based daily tagesspiegel said that the election result " is still open .

a replacement has already been found in franz schönhuber , the former national leader of another right wing-extremist party , but there is n't enough time to reprint ballots before sunday . as the race for the chancellery becomes tighter with the election just days away , politicians and legal experts are mulling the ramifications of a late vote in dresden , with some saying that a delayed election could throw into question the legality of the national vote . experts such as werner patzelt , a political scientist from dresden university , predicted political turmoil if the race turns out to be extremely narrow as in the last election , where social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- only had about 6,000 votes more than the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german parliament 's make-up might not be known until oct .
2 " should the question of whether we 'll see a grand coalition -lrb- cdu and spd -rrb- or one between the cdu and the -lrb- free-market -rrb- liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- hinge on a single mandate , then indeed the postponed election in the dresden constituency may be of crucial importance , " he told dw-radio . splitti n g the electio n ? hans meyer , a professor of constitutional law and former president of berlin 's humboldt university , said he believes the election outcome will be challenged should dresdeners vote after the results in the rest of the country have already become public . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have two votes in an interview with bavarian public broadcaster br , meyer added that dresdeners should at least vote for a party on sunday .
in germany , each voter has two votes - one to elect a direct candidate for his or her constituency and another to choose a political party that then gets parliamentary seats according to the percentage of votes it achieves . one party that supports such a splitting of votes in dresden is germany 's new left party , which consists of the successor party to the former communist party of east germany and disgruntled social democrats from western germany . distorti n g results ? " that way we want to avoid distortions which would happen if dresdeners already know the result from the rest of the country , " hendrik thalheim , a party spokesman , told the newspaper die tageszeitu n g . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters of chancellor gerhard schröder might end up voting for the left party in dresden .
the left party fears that a late election in dresden could harm their chances to win a direct seat in dresden .
others believe , however , that a late vote might actually help the party as social democrats might tactically support the left party 's candidate to prevent an extra seat for the christian democrats , whose candidate is leading in the polls . the africa compariso n while local candidates for other parties also complained about the postponed election , officials at the national level said they did n't see this as a problem . " maybe it 's possible in africa to hold back election results for a couple of weeks , but you can not do that in germany , " dirk niebel , the fdp 's general secretary , said on the morning show of germany 's public broadcasters . other legal experts also said that there was nothing illegal about a late vote in dresden . " there 's no law that forbids this , " gottfried mahrenholz , a former constitutional court judge , told german public radio , deutschlandfunk .
late votes already took place in 1961 and 1965 after candidates died shortly before the election . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de election 2005 click here for dw-world 's complete election coverage .

a replacement has already been found in franz schönhuber , the former national leader of another right wing-extremist party , but there is n't enough time to reprint ballots before sunday . as the race for the chancellery becomes tighter with the election just days away , politicians and legal experts are mulling the ramifications of a late vote in dresden , with some saying that a delayed election could throw into question the legality of the national vote . experts such as werner patzelt , a political scientist from dresden university , predicted political turmoil if the race turns out to be extremely narrow as in the last election , where social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- only had about 6,000 votes more than the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german parliament 's make-up might not be known until oct .
2 " should the question of whether we 'll see a grand coalition -lrb- cdu and spd -rrb- or one between the cdu and the -lrb- free-market -rrb- liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- hinge on a single mandate , then indeed the postponed election in the dresden constituency may be of crucial importance , " he told dw-radio . splitti n g the electio n ? hans meyer , a professor of constitutional law and former president of berlin 's humboldt university , said he believes the election outcome will be challenged should dresdeners vote after the results in the rest of the country have already become public . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have two votes in an interview with bavarian public broadcaster br , meyer added that dresdeners should at least vote for a party on sunday .
in germany , each voter has two votes - one to elect a direct candidate for his or her constituency and another to choose a political party that then gets parliamentary seats according to the percentage of votes it achieves . one party that supports such a splitting of votes in dresden is germany 's new left party , which consists of the successor party to the former communist party of east germany and disgruntled social democrats from western germany . distorti n g results ? " that way we want to avoid distortions which would happen if dresdeners already know the result from the rest of the country , " hendrik thalheim , a party spokesman , told the newspaper die tageszeitu n g . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters of chancellor gerhard schröder might end up voting for the left party in dresden .
the left party fears that a late election in dresden could harm their chances to win a direct seat in dresden .
others believe , however , that a late vote might actually help the party as social democrats might tactically support the left party 's candidate to prevent an extra seat for the christian democrats , whose candidate is leading in the polls . the africa compariso n while local candidates for other parties also complained about the postponed election , officials at the national level said they did n't see this as a problem . " maybe it 's possible in africa to hold back election results for a couple of weeks , but you can not do that in germany , " dirk niebel , the fdp 's general secretary , said on the morning show of germany 's public broadcasters . other legal experts also said that there was nothing illegal about a late vote in dresden . " there 's no law that forbids this , " gottfried mahrenholz , a former constitutional court judge , told german public radio , deutschlandfunk .
late votes already took place in 1961 and 1965 after candidates died shortly before the election . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de election 2005 click here for dw-world 's complete election coverage .
parties in tight race as german polls loom just over a week before germany heads to the polls , the death of a far-right candidate and the shrinking of the once-solid lead enjoyed by the conservatives have complicated the outcome of the general elections .

the chancellor , who was largely written off by political analysts in recent months , has managed to halve the gap in the last week after a televised debate with merkel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " wherever i go , i encounter a lot of support .
the tide is turning , " schröder was quoted as telling the sunday edition of the bild newspaper . " at the end of the day , it is the voters who decide who will become their next chancellor . "
the chancellor , whose personal approval ratings have jumped by 11 points since august according to one poll , said the latest polls prove that " the supposed mood for change no longer exists " among the electorate and announced a few extra rallies for the final week of campaigning .
cdu losing ground by contrast , the cdu and their sister bavarian party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- appeared to be faltering in the last days leading up to the election .
several leading surveys at the weekend showed the cdu / csu losing ground , raising conservatives ' fears that they could once again squander a big lead to schröder , who rallied from 12 points behind in six weeks to win the last election in 2002 .
one poll by the emnid institute showed the cdu dropping 1.5 points to 40.5 percent of the vote last week , while the spd surged 3.5 points to 34 percent .
the spd has now gained 8 points in the last month while the cdu has lost 3 points .
another opinion poll showed that the cdu / csu and their preferred coalition partner , the free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- would fall just short of the 48.5 percent of votes needed for a governing majority .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many believe that the most likely outcome of the elections thus would be a so-called " grand coalition " between merkel 's conservatives and the spd with her as chancellor .
but her allies fear that this would make it impossible to implement changes intended to push-start germany 's spluttering economy .
" it is a nightmare vision , " the prime minister of the eastern state of saxony , georg milbrandt , has warned .
" it is pointless to think that a grand coalition could get things moving . "
the kirchhof factor the conservatives ' campaign has also been hit by the appointment by merkel of paul kirchhof as the party 's shadow finance minister if the cdu / csu came to power .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kirchhof -lrb- photo -rrb- , a former constitutional judge and heidelberg university professor who has proposed radical tax reforms and committed a series of political gaffes in media interviews , has become a sort of punching bag for the spd .
schröder , who has slammed merkel 's reform vision as cold and inhuman and painted a grim picture of what it would do to germany 's social welfare system , has also repeatedly attacked kirchhof .
the chancellor has stressed that kirchhof 's tax reforms , including a flat 25 percent tax rate without tax breaks , are unrealistic - a tactic that pollster say has begun to affect voters who are already scared off by kirchhof .
" kirchhof has unleashed a wave of insecurity among voters , " richard hilmer , head of infratest dimap , told reuters .
" if this trend continues , schröder could even reach his goal of 38 percent .
in any case , the chances of a spd coalition with the greens and fdp are much higher now . "
damage control merkel and several other cdu leaders have now begun to distance themselves from kirchhof and instead hinted that they might try and get back friedrich merz , a respected finance expert and former head of the cdu parliamentary faction .
the fdp meanwhile held a one-day conference in berlin on sunday at which party leaders downplayed the bad news from the polling institutes and defended merkel 's reform vision .
bildunterschrift : but the press reported sunday that fdp leader guido westerwelle -lrb- photo -rrb- too was trying to distance the party from radical tax reform proposals by paul kirchhof .
" this election is not just about clever people 's big dreams , it is about creating jobs for germans , " daily der tagespiegel quoted him as saying .
the weekly magazine der spiegel on sunday said kirchhof , " was becoming a liability " and putting at risk merkel 's hopes of avoiding a grand coalition . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no miracle cure for german economy for an election that is being fought on economic issues , many germans seem to believe that the fortunes of europe 's biggest economy will not change even if conservative challenger angela merkel wins the sept .

the chancellor , who was largely written off by political analysts in recent months , has managed to halve the gap in the last week after a televised debate with merkel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " wherever i go , i encounter a lot of support .
the tide is turning , " schröder was quoted as telling the sunday edition of the bild newspaper . " at the end of the day , it is the voters who decide who will become their next chancellor . "
the chancellor , whose personal approval ratings have jumped by 11 points since august according to one poll , said the latest polls prove that " the supposed mood for change no longer exists " among the electorate and announced a few extra rallies for the final week of campaigning .
cdu losing ground by contrast , the cdu and their sister bavarian party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- appeared to be faltering in the last days leading up to the election .
several leading surveys at the weekend showed the cdu / csu losing ground , raising conservatives ' fears that they could once again squander a big lead to schröder , who rallied from 12 points behind in six weeks to win the last election in 2002 .
one poll by the emnid institute showed the cdu dropping 1.5 points to 40.5 percent of the vote last week , while the spd surged 3.5 points to 34 percent .
the spd has now gained 8 points in the last month while the cdu has lost 3 points .

but her allies fear that this would make it impossible to implement changes intended to push-start germany 's spluttering economy .
" it is a nightmare vision , " the prime minister of the eastern state of saxony , georg milbrandt , has warned .
" it is pointless to think that a grand coalition could get things moving . "
the kirchhof factor the conservatives ' campaign has also been hit by the appointment by merkel of paul kirchhof as the party 's shadow finance minister if the cdu / csu came to power .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kirchhof -lrb- photo -rrb- , a former constitutional judge and heidelberg university professor who has proposed radical tax reforms and committed a series of political gaffes in media interviews , has become a sort of punching bag for the spd .
schröder , who has slammed merkel 's reform vision as cold and inhuman and painted a grim picture of what it would do to germany 's social welfare system , has also repeatedly attacked kirchhof .
the chancellor has stressed that kirchhof 's tax reforms , including a flat 25 percent tax rate without tax breaks , are unrealistic - a tactic that pollster say has begun to affect voters who are already scared off by kirchhof .
" kirchhof has unleashed a wave of insecurity among voters , " richard hilmer , head of infratest dimap , told reuters .
" if this trend continues , schröder could even reach his goal of 38 percent .
in any case , the chances of a spd coalition with the greens and fdp are much higher now . "
damage control merkel and several other cdu leaders have now begun to distance themselves from kirchhof and instead hinted that they might try and get back friedrich merz , a respected finance expert and former head of the cdu parliamentary faction .
the fdp meanwhile held a one-day conference in berlin on sunday at which party leaders downplayed the bad news from the polling institutes and defended merkel 's reform vision .

" this election is not just about clever people 's big dreams , it is about creating jobs for germans , " daily der tagespiegel quoted him as saying .

the chancellor , who was largely written off by political analysts in recent months , has managed to halve the gap in the last week after a televised debate with merkel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " wherever i go , i encounter a lot of support .
the tide is turning , " schröder was quoted as telling the sunday edition of the bild newspaper . " at the end of the day , it is the voters who decide who will become their next chancellor . "
the chancellor , whose personal approval ratings have jumped by 11 points since august according to one poll , said the latest polls prove that " the supposed mood for change no longer exists " among the electorate and announced a few extra rallies for the final week of campaigning .
cdu losing ground by contrast , the cdu and their sister bavarian party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- appeared to be faltering in the last days leading up to the election .
several leading surveys at the weekend showed the cdu / csu losing ground , raising conservatives ' fears that they could once again squander a big lead to schröder , who rallied from 12 points behind in six weeks to win the last election in 2002 .
one poll by the emnid institute showed the cdu dropping 1.5 points to 40.5 percent of the vote last week , while the spd surged 3.5 points to 34 percent .
the spd has now gained 8 points in the last month while the cdu has lost 3 points .
another opinion poll showed that the cdu / csu and their preferred coalition partner , the free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- would fall just short of the 48.5 percent of votes needed for a governing majority .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many believe that the most likely outcome of the elections thus would be a so-called " grand coalition " between merkel 's conservatives and the spd with her as chancellor .
but her allies fear that this would make it impossible to implement changes intended to push-start germany 's spluttering economy .
" it is a nightmare vision , " the prime minister of the eastern state of saxony , georg milbrandt , has warned .
" it is pointless to think that a grand coalition could get things moving . "
the kirchhof factor the conservatives ' campaign has also been hit by the appointment by merkel of paul kirchhof as the party 's shadow finance minister if the cdu / csu came to power .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kirchhof -lrb- photo -rrb- , a former constitutional judge and heidelberg university professor who has proposed radical tax reforms and committed a series of political gaffes in media interviews , has become a sort of punching bag for the spd .
schröder , who has slammed merkel 's reform vision as cold and inhuman and painted a grim picture of what it would do to germany 's social welfare system , has also repeatedly attacked kirchhof .
the chancellor has stressed that kirchhof 's tax reforms , including a flat 25 percent tax rate without tax breaks , are unrealistic - a tactic that pollster say has begun to affect voters who are already scared off by kirchhof .
" kirchhof has unleashed a wave of insecurity among voters , " richard hilmer , head of infratest dimap , told reuters .
" if this trend continues , schröder could even reach his goal of 38 percent .
in any case , the chances of a spd coalition with the greens and fdp are much higher now . "
damage control merkel and several other cdu leaders have now begun to distance themselves from kirchhof and instead hinted that they might try and get back friedrich merz , a respected finance expert and former head of the cdu parliamentary faction .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 12.09.2005 the lot of young german offenders großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how far can youths go before they wind up behind bars ?
a recent and fatal teenage attack on a seven-year-old boy near berlin has promoted cries from the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- for germany to review its liberal approach to dealing with criminals , however young they are . it was a particularly brutal and gratuitous crime , in which a boy of 16 beat an innocent child and neighbor to death , and subsequently attributed his violence to " personal frustration . "
it can be of no surprise to anyone that such savage behavior should unleash calls for tighter measures to prevent any future repetition of such tragedies .
but opinions on exactly how to deal with germany 's delinquent youngsters vary enormously .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a correction center in northern germany some say they should be given the benefit of the doubt on the grounds that they can not be held fully responsible for their own actions until they come of age .
others refute such claims as dangerously naïve , bellowing that acts of such evil ill-will should be paid for through the iron bars of a correction center .
there are currently some 6,000 criminals serving their time in juvenile offenders institutes across the country , but if the cdu had its way , that figure could be far higher .
in a statement issued following the horrific juvenile attack last month , chairman of the cdu berlin parliamentary group , andreas gram , and cdu legal expert , nicolas zimmer , called for a radical rethink .
" the soft touch era is finally over .
the justice system should react more swiftly to the first cases and signs of a criminal career , and be quicker to sentence violent young criminals to imprisonment , " they said .
no more coddling among other things , they propose detaining " profoundly dangerous and criminal children and youths " in special purpose , enclosed premises and reducing the age of criminal responsibility below its current minimum of 14 .
they have also called for the regulation which currently allows young adults up to the age of 21 to be tried under juvenile law , to be replaced by a statute which would treat them according to the same laws as adults .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu want youngsters to be tried as adults the warden of berlin 's plötzensee correctional institute for juveniles , marius fiedler , says that such debates date back decades , and that they are too general to be widely effective .
" you always just have to do the right thing , and you can only do that by looking at each individual case .
it 's a matter of recognizing the problems early on and steering the youngsters in the right direction . "
he added that there is only one 16 year-old inmate at the berlin center and none who are younger .
so does that render the cdu plea to reduce the age of accountability unnecessary , or is it an indication that the system is simply too lax ?
prevention is better than cure fact is , germany is not particularly tough on its young lawbreakers .
chairman of the juvenile court association bernd sonnen says the system is geared to try and work with criminal youngsters in such a way that they can avoid being incarcerated and prevent a career in crime before it is too late .
" between 66 and 69 percent of youth crimes in germany are resolved out of court .
the offenders can repair damage they have caused , they can take part in anti-aggression training or in mediated face to face sessions with their victims , " he explained .
" the success rate of the latter is particularly successful , and the advantage is that they do not become labeled criminals which is often a self-fulfilling prophecy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as many as 69 percent of youth crimes never make it to court but that is of little consolation to the victims of the crimes which continue to be part of the fabric of society here . sonnen says he can understand the calls to lock delinquents away , and the belief that a harder stance will prevent re-offending , but adds that it simply is n't the truth of the matter .
" sure , putting people behind bars is the toughest measure we have on offer , but it is also proven that it creates the highest rate of repeat offending .
when someone has been locked up for a given period and is then suddenly set free , they are highly likely to just go out and commit another crime , " he said .
rise in violent juvenile crime marius fiedler agrees that a jail sentence should be an absolute last resort .
" of course there are countries which are much tougher with their young criminals .
the state of california locks away about eight times the number of juveniles that we do , but are crime levels there are lower as a result ? " the governor asked .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the overwhelming majority of prisoners in germany are male sixty percent of the 554 male prisoners detained at the berlin young offenders institute are there as a result of committing violent crimes , from armed robbery to murder , and the picture is much the same across germany as a whole .
although crimes such as theft are declining , reported incidences of juvenile violence are indeed on the rise , but sonnen says the onus is on the word reported .
" we have become sensitized to violence and we are prepared to do something about it , to denounce violent crime .
whereas ten years ago school directors would have denied any sign of brutality in their establishments , they are now willing to admit that the problem exists , " he explained .
family problems and more often than not , the problem is the consequence of other , personal problems which date back to early childhood days .
fiedler says if there is anything that the young men who walk through the correction center gates have in common , it is bad family relations and a poor education .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a glance inside with that in mind , places like berlin plötzensee operate a strictly no punishment policy , but offer an extensive range of schooling , apprenticeship and work opportunities to try and generate a different sense of self-worth in the youngsters while they are inside .
for some it is the best they have ever known .
" a lot of them develop well inside , then shortly before their release date , they do something silly so their sentence is extended .
they do it because they are afraid of life , and of having to leave this protected space , " fiedler said . tamsin walker , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany moves to protect stalking victims germany 's upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , has passed a bill that would provide better protection for victims of stalking .

germany remains opposed to us desires to merge nato peacekeepers and the us-led coalition there . defense ministers from the 26-nation military body will look at a range of issues , including the alliances own development over the next decade , forces in iraq and in the balkans and the situation in sudan .
but afghanistan will probably provide the most substantial item on the menu , ahead of the country 's first parliamentary elections in 30 years on saturday . nato , in charge of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan , has beefed up its troop levels in the run-up to the ballots , which has seen a surge in violence across the country . bildunterschrift : german armored vehicles from isaf at the informal talks in berlin , which are being held under tight security , the ministers will discuss the planned extension of isaf into the south of the country early next year , in the latest stage of its expansion around the country after starting in the capital kabul . britain , canada and the netherlands are to lead the move into the south , joining some 18,000 us soldiers who have long been fighting al qaeda and taliban fighters , in particular along the eastern border with pakistan . merging operations ? washington is eager to see isaf active across the whole country by the end of 2006 - and also has expressed interest in merging or , at a minimum , increasing cooperation between its own operation enduring freedom troops -lrb- oef -rrb- and the nato-led force . that push faces strong reservations from some european allies - notably from germany , france and turkey who oppose a full merger , fearing that it would turn peacekeepers into targets for the opponents of the kabul government under hamid karsai .
the oef force now bears the brunt of the insurgency . in an interview with the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper on monday , german defense minister peter struck that the answer from germany would be a " clear no . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck " that would make the situation for our soldiers doubly dangerous and worsen the current climate in afghanistan , " he said , ahead of the two-day meeting . in an interview with dw-tv , struck said that the taliban were fighting " the last fight in the truest sense of the word " to destabilize elections on sept .
18th , although he added that there was no reason to fear that large attacks are being planned in the north were some german isaf forces are stationed . stronger political outlook struck also said he wanted the alliance to adopt a more political orientation when tackling security issues . " the signal from berlin should be that nato will respond to new threats not only militarily , but politically as well , " he said in the run-up to the meeting , adding that it would mean defense ministers have a stronger influence on decisions made by foreign ministers . in the longer term , the nato ministers will seek to focus on what the alliance - whose operations have spread over the last year into iraq and sudan - should look like in 2015-2020 . on wednesday the west 's former military bloc will meet with their russian counterpart sergei ivanov , for regular talks which increasingly focus on the fight against terrorism . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato approves aid for katrina relief nato on friday approved a us request for it to play a bigger role in transporting and coordinating european aid for the victims of hurricane katrina .

18 . instead , with less than a week to go before election day , kirchhof 's audacious proposals for a flat-rate tax of 25 percent have boomeranged on her , slashing the cdu / csu 's 21-point lead over chancellor gerhard schröder and his social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- in the opinion polls to a paltry seven points . that may not be enough for schröder to be re-elected , but it could force merkel and the cdu / csu into a " grand coalition " with his spd party , a horror scenario for many , particularly the free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , who have set their hearts on becoming junior partner in the new conservative government . backpedalling fast bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul kirchhof consequently , top fdp politicians have been quick to urge merkel to distance herself from kirchhof . germans should vote on the cdu / csu 's election program " not the visions of a scientist , " said the party 's tax expert hermann otto solms . and the fdp 's honorary chairman , otto graf lambsdorff , warned that kirchhof 's nomination was " a risk that may turn out to be bigger than its usefulness . " even the fdp 's chief whip wolfgang gerhardt said on ard public television that while he respected kirchhof , the university professor was politically inexperienced . the spd 's strong recovery in the polls also appears to be unnerving merkel , who insisted sunday that the cdu / csu 's aim was simply to lower the top and bottom rates of income tax . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel " anything beyond that is pie in the sky , " merkel said , appearing to sideline kirchhof and his radical ideas . nevertheless , officially at least , the shadow finance minister remains on board . " our team of experts is going to meet on wednesday and professor kirchhof will definitely be there , " said cdu chief whip volker kauder in berlin on monday . gift for schröder ironically , the nomination of kirchhof has been a godsend for schröder , who was trailing badly in the opinion polls as voters punished him for the deeply unpopular structural and economic reforms he has imposed during his seven years in office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kirchhof has provided gerhard schröder with a breath of fresh air ever media-canny , schröder has tried to turn the tables on merkel , arguing that kirchhof 's visions would make germany an even starker and colder place , carefully ignoring the fact that the university professor 's proposals are not actually contained in the official cdu / csu manifesto . press voices and with the spd bouncing back in the polls , experts do indeed believe that kirchhof could ultimately prove to be merkel 's undoing . the weekly magazine der spiegel made the " battle over kirchhof " its front page story on monday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fdp head guido westerwelle , angela merkel and csu head edmund stoiber the berlin-based daily tagesspiegel said that the election result " is still open .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 12.09.2005 all eyes on dresden in german election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden is bound to become election central if the race is close germany 's election on sunday could face legal challenges amid allegations of unfairness : voters in the eastern city of dresden will head to the polls two weeks later due to the death of a parliamentary candidate . the election in dresden was postponed by germany 's federal election commissioner after kerstin lorenz , the candidate for the neo-nazi national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- died of a stroke last week .
a replacement has already been found in franz schönhuber , the former national leader of another right wing-extremist party , but there is n't enough time to reprint ballots before sunday . as the race for the chancellery becomes tighter with the election just days away , politicians and legal experts are mulling the ramifications of a late vote in dresden , with some saying that a delayed election could throw into question the legality of the national vote . experts such as werner patzelt , a political scientist from dresden university , predicted political turmoil if the race turns out to be extremely narrow as in the last election , where social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- only had about 6,000 votes more than the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german parliament 's make-up might not be known until oct .
2 " should the question of whether we 'll see a grand coalition -lrb- cdu and spd -rrb- or one between the cdu and the -lrb- free-market -rrb- liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- hinge on a single mandate , then indeed the postponed election in the dresden constituency may be of crucial importance , " he told dw-radio . splitti n g the electio n ? hans meyer , a professor of constitutional law and former president of berlin 's humboldt university , said he believes the election outcome will be challenged should dresdeners vote after the results in the rest of the country have already become public . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have two votes in an interview with bavarian public broadcaster br , meyer added that dresdeners should at least vote for a party on sunday .
in germany , each voter has two votes - one to elect a direct candidate for his or her constituency and another to choose a political party that then gets parliamentary seats according to the percentage of votes it achieves . one party that supports such a splitting of votes in dresden is germany 's new left party , which consists of the successor party to the former communist party of east germany and disgruntled social democrats from western germany . distorti n g results ? " that way we want to avoid distortions which would happen if dresdeners already know the result from the rest of the country , " hendrik thalheim , a party spokesman , told the newspaper die tageszeitu n g . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters of chancellor gerhard schröder might end up voting for the left party in dresden .

a replacement has already been found in franz schönhuber , the former national leader of another right wing-extremist party , but there is n't enough time to reprint ballots before sunday . as the race for the chancellery becomes tighter with the election just days away , politicians and legal experts are mulling the ramifications of a late vote in dresden , with some saying that a delayed election could throw into question the legality of the national vote . experts such as werner patzelt , a political scientist from dresden university , predicted political turmoil if the race turns out to be extremely narrow as in the last election , where social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- only had about 6,000 votes more than the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german parliament 's make-up might not be known until oct .
2 " should the question of whether we 'll see a grand coalition -lrb- cdu and spd -rrb- or one between the cdu and the -lrb- free-market -rrb- liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- hinge on a single mandate , then indeed the postponed election in the dresden constituency may be of crucial importance , " he told dw-radio . splitti n g the electio n ? hans meyer , a professor of constitutional law and former president of berlin 's humboldt university , said he believes the election outcome will be challenged should dresdeners vote after the results in the rest of the country have already become public . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have two votes in an interview with bavarian public broadcaster br , meyer added that dresdeners should at least vote for a party on sunday .
in germany , each voter has two votes - one to elect a direct candidate for his or her constituency and another to choose a political party that then gets parliamentary seats according to the percentage of votes it achieves . one party that supports such a splitting of votes in dresden is germany 's new left party , which consists of the successor party to the former communist party of east germany and disgruntled social democrats from western germany . distorti n g results ? " that way we want to avoid distortions which would happen if dresdeners already know the result from the rest of the country , " hendrik thalheim , a party spokesman , told the newspaper die tageszeitu n g . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters of chancellor gerhard schröder might end up voting for the left party in dresden .
the left party fears that a late election in dresden could harm their chances to win a direct seat in dresden .
others believe , however , that a late vote might actually help the party as social democrats might tactically support the left party 's candidate to prevent an extra seat for the christian democrats , whose candidate is leading in the polls . the africa compariso n while local candidates for other parties also complained about the postponed election , officials at the national level said they did n't see this as a problem . " maybe it 's possible in africa to hold back election results for a couple of weeks , but you can not do that in germany , " dirk niebel , the fdp 's general secretary , said on the morning show of germany 's public broadcasters . other legal experts also said that there was nothing illegal about a late vote in dresden . " there 's no law that forbids this , " gottfried mahrenholz , a former constitutional court judge , told german public radio , deutschlandfunk .
late votes already took place in 1961 and 1965 after candidates died shortly before the election . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de election 2005 click here for dw-world 's complete election coverage .

the chancellor , who was largely written off by political analysts in recent months , has managed to halve the gap in the last week after a televised debate with merkel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " wherever i go , i encounter a lot of support .
the tide is turning , " schröder was quoted as telling the sunday edition of the bild newspaper . " at the end of the day , it is the voters who decide who will become their next chancellor . "
the chancellor , whose personal approval ratings have jumped by 11 points since august according to one poll , said the latest polls prove that " the supposed mood for change no longer exists " among the electorate and announced a few extra rallies for the final week of campaigning .
cdu losing ground by contrast , the cdu and their sister bavarian party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- appeared to be faltering in the last days leading up to the election .
several leading surveys at the weekend showed the cdu / csu losing ground , raising conservatives ' fears that they could once again squander a big lead to schröder , who rallied from 12 points behind in six weeks to win the last election in 2002 .
one poll by the emnid institute showed the cdu dropping 1.5 points to 40.5 percent of the vote last week , while the spd surged 3.5 points to 34 percent .
the spd has now gained 8 points in the last month while the cdu has lost 3 points .
another opinion poll showed that the cdu / csu and their preferred coalition partner , the free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- would fall just short of the 48.5 percent of votes needed for a governing majority .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many believe that the most likely outcome of the elections thus would be a so-called " grand coalition " between merkel 's conservatives and the spd with her as chancellor .
but her allies fear that this would make it impossible to implement changes intended to push-start germany 's spluttering economy .
" it is a nightmare vision , " the prime minister of the eastern state of saxony , georg milbrandt , has warned .
" it is pointless to think that a grand coalition could get things moving . "
the kirchhof factor the conservatives ' campaign has also been hit by the appointment by merkel of paul kirchhof as the party 's shadow finance minister if the cdu / csu came to power .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kirchhof -lrb- photo -rrb- , a former constitutional judge and heidelberg university professor who has proposed radical tax reforms and committed a series of political gaffes in media interviews , has become a sort of punching bag for the spd .
schröder , who has slammed merkel 's reform vision as cold and inhuman and painted a grim picture of what it would do to germany 's social welfare system , has also repeatedly attacked kirchhof .
the chancellor has stressed that kirchhof 's tax reforms , including a flat 25 percent tax rate without tax breaks , are unrealistic - a tactic that pollster say has begun to affect voters who are already scared off by kirchhof .
" kirchhof has unleashed a wave of insecurity among voters , " richard hilmer , head of infratest dimap , told reuters .
" if this trend continues , schröder could even reach his goal of 38 percent .
in any case , the chances of a spd coalition with the greens and fdp are much higher now . "
damage control merkel and several other cdu leaders have now begun to distance themselves from kirchhof and instead hinted that they might try and get back friedrich merz , a respected finance expert and former head of the cdu parliamentary faction .

the chancellor , who was largely written off by political analysts in recent months , has managed to halve the gap in the last week after a televised debate with merkel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " wherever i go , i encounter a lot of support .
the tide is turning , " schröder was quoted as telling the sunday edition of the bild newspaper . " at the end of the day , it is the voters who decide who will become their next chancellor . "
the chancellor , whose personal approval ratings have jumped by 11 points since august according to one poll , said the latest polls prove that " the supposed mood for change no longer exists " among the electorate and announced a few extra rallies for the final week of campaigning .
cdu losing ground by contrast , the cdu and their sister bavarian party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- appeared to be faltering in the last days leading up to the election .
several leading surveys at the weekend showed the cdu / csu losing ground , raising conservatives ' fears that they could once again squander a big lead to schröder , who rallied from 12 points behind in six weeks to win the last election in 2002 .
one poll by the emnid institute showed the cdu dropping 1.5 points to 40.5 percent of the vote last week , while the spd surged 3.5 points to 34 percent .
the spd has now gained 8 points in the last month while the cdu has lost 3 points .
another opinion poll showed that the cdu / csu and their preferred coalition partner , the free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- would fall just short of the 48.5 percent of votes needed for a governing majority .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many believe that the most likely outcome of the elections thus would be a so-called " grand coalition " between merkel 's conservatives and the spd with her as chancellor .
but her allies fear that this would make it impossible to implement changes intended to push-start germany 's spluttering economy .
" it is a nightmare vision , " the prime minister of the eastern state of saxony , georg milbrandt , has warned .
" it is pointless to think that a grand coalition could get things moving . "
the kirchhof factor the conservatives ' campaign has also been hit by the appointment by merkel of paul kirchhof as the party 's shadow finance minister if the cdu / csu came to power .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 12.09.2005 the lot of young german offenders großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how far can youths go before they wind up behind bars ?
a recent and fatal teenage attack on a seven-year-old boy near berlin has promoted cries from the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- for germany to review its liberal approach to dealing with criminals , however young they are . it was a particularly brutal and gratuitous crime , in which a boy of 16 beat an innocent child and neighbor to death , and subsequently attributed his violence to " personal frustration . "
it can be of no surprise to anyone that such savage behavior should unleash calls for tighter measures to prevent any future repetition of such tragedies .
but opinions on exactly how to deal with germany 's delinquent youngsters vary enormously .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a correction center in northern germany some say they should be given the benefit of the doubt on the grounds that they can not be held fully responsible for their own actions until they come of age .
others refute such claims as dangerously naïve , bellowing that acts of such evil ill-will should be paid for through the iron bars of a correction center .
there are currently some 6,000 criminals serving their time in juvenile offenders institutes across the country , but if the cdu had its way , that figure could be far higher .
in a statement issued following the horrific juvenile attack last month , chairman of the cdu berlin parliamentary group , andreas gram , and cdu legal expert , nicolas zimmer , called for a radical rethink .
" the soft touch era is finally over .
the justice system should react more swiftly to the first cases and signs of a criminal career , and be quicker to sentence violent young criminals to imprisonment , " they said .
no more coddling among other things , they propose detaining " profoundly dangerous and criminal children and youths " in special purpose , enclosed premises and reducing the age of criminal responsibility below its current minimum of 14 .
they have also called for the regulation which currently allows young adults up to the age of 21 to be tried under juvenile law , to be replaced by a statute which would treat them according to the same laws as adults .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu want youngsters to be tried as adults the warden of berlin 's plötzensee correctional institute for juveniles , marius fiedler , says that such debates date back decades , and that they are too general to be widely effective .
" you always just have to do the right thing , and you can only do that by looking at each individual case .
it 's a matter of recognizing the problems early on and steering the youngsters in the right direction . "
he added that there is only one 16 year-old inmate at the berlin center and none who are younger .
so does that render the cdu plea to reduce the age of accountability unnecessary , or is it an indication that the system is simply too lax ?
prevention is better than cure fact is , germany is not particularly tough on its young lawbreakers .
chairman of the juvenile court association bernd sonnen says the system is geared to try and work with criminal youngsters in such a way that they can avoid being incarcerated and prevent a career in crime before it is too late .
" between 66 and 69 percent of youth crimes in germany are resolved out of court .
the offenders can repair damage they have caused , they can take part in anti-aggression training or in mediated face to face sessions with their victims , " he explained .
" the success rate of the latter is particularly successful , and the advantage is that they do not become labeled criminals which is often a self-fulfilling prophecy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as many as 69 percent of youth crimes never make it to court but that is of little consolation to the victims of the crimes which continue to be part of the fabric of society here . sonnen says he can understand the calls to lock delinquents away , and the belief that a harder stance will prevent re-offending , but adds that it simply is n't the truth of the matter .
" sure , putting people behind bars is the toughest measure we have on offer , but it is also proven that it creates the highest rate of repeat offending .
when someone has been locked up for a given period and is then suddenly set free , they are highly likely to just go out and commit another crime , " he said .
rise in violent juvenile crime marius fiedler agrees that a jail sentence should be an absolute last resort .
" of course there are countries which are much tougher with their young criminals .

a recent and fatal teenage attack on a seven-year-old boy near berlin has promoted cries from the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- for germany to review its liberal approach to dealing with criminals , however young they are . it was a particularly brutal and gratuitous crime , in which a boy of 16 beat an innocent child and neighbor to death , and subsequently attributed his violence to " personal frustration . "
it can be of no surprise to anyone that such savage behavior should unleash calls for tighter measures to prevent any future repetition of such tragedies .
but opinions on exactly how to deal with germany 's delinquent youngsters vary enormously .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a correction center in northern germany some say they should be given the benefit of the doubt on the grounds that they can not be held fully responsible for their own actions until they come of age .
others refute such claims as dangerously naïve , bellowing that acts of such evil ill-will should be paid for through the iron bars of a correction center .
there are currently some 6,000 criminals serving their time in juvenile offenders institutes across the country , but if the cdu had its way , that figure could be far higher .
in a statement issued following the horrific juvenile attack last month , chairman of the cdu berlin parliamentary group , andreas gram , and cdu legal expert , nicolas zimmer , called for a radical rethink .
" the soft touch era is finally over .
the justice system should react more swiftly to the first cases and signs of a criminal career , and be quicker to sentence violent young criminals to imprisonment , " they said .
no more coddling among other things , they propose detaining " profoundly dangerous and criminal children and youths " in special purpose , enclosed premises and reducing the age of criminal responsibility below its current minimum of 14 .
they have also called for the regulation which currently allows young adults up to the age of 21 to be tried under juvenile law , to be replaced by a statute which would treat them according to the same laws as adults .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu want youngsters to be tried as adults the warden of berlin 's plötzensee correctional institute for juveniles , marius fiedler , says that such debates date back decades , and that they are too general to be widely effective .
" you always just have to do the right thing , and you can only do that by looking at each individual case .
it 's a matter of recognizing the problems early on and steering the youngsters in the right direction . "
he added that there is only one 16 year-old inmate at the berlin center and none who are younger .
so does that render the cdu plea to reduce the age of accountability unnecessary , or is it an indication that the system is simply too lax ?
prevention is better than cure fact is , germany is not particularly tough on its young lawbreakers .
chairman of the juvenile court association bernd sonnen says the system is geared to try and work with criminal youngsters in such a way that they can avoid being incarcerated and prevent a career in crime before it is too late .
" between 66 and 69 percent of youth crimes in germany are resolved out of court .
the offenders can repair damage they have caused , they can take part in anti-aggression training or in mediated face to face sessions with their victims , " he explained .
" the success rate of the latter is particularly successful , and the advantage is that they do not become labeled criminals which is often a self-fulfilling prophecy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as many as 69 percent of youth crimes never make it to court but that is of little consolation to the victims of the crimes which continue to be part of the fabric of society here . sonnen says he can understand the calls to lock delinquents away , and the belief that a harder stance will prevent re-offending , but adds that it simply is n't the truth of the matter .
" sure , putting people behind bars is the toughest measure we have on offer , but it is also proven that it creates the highest rate of repeat offending .
when someone has been locked up for a given period and is then suddenly set free , they are highly likely to just go out and commit another crime , " he said .

18 . instead , with less than a week to go before election day , kirchhof 's audacious proposals for a flat-rate tax of 25 percent have boomeranged on her , slashing the cdu / csu 's 21-point lead over chancellor gerhard schröder and his social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- in the opinion polls to a paltry seven points . that may not be enough for schröder to be re-elected , but it could force merkel and the cdu / csu into a " grand coalition " with his spd party , a horror scenario for many , particularly the free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , who have set their hearts on becoming junior partner in the new conservative government . backpedalling fast bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul kirchhof consequently , top fdp politicians have been quick to urge merkel to distance herself from kirchhof . germans should vote on the cdu / csu 's election program " not the visions of a scientist , " said the party 's tax expert hermann otto solms . and the fdp 's honorary chairman , otto graf lambsdorff , warned that kirchhof 's nomination was " a risk that may turn out to be bigger than its usefulness . " even the fdp 's chief whip wolfgang gerhardt said on ard public television that while he respected kirchhof , the university professor was politically inexperienced . the spd 's strong recovery in the polls also appears to be unnerving merkel , who insisted sunday that the cdu / csu 's aim was simply to lower the top and bottom rates of income tax . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel " anything beyond that is pie in the sky , " merkel said , appearing to sideline kirchhof and his radical ideas . nevertheless , officially at least , the shadow finance minister remains on board . " our team of experts is going to meet on wednesday and professor kirchhof will definitely be there , " said cdu chief whip volker kauder in berlin on monday . gift for schröder ironically , the nomination of kirchhof has been a godsend for schröder , who was trailing badly in the opinion polls as voters punished him for the deeply unpopular structural and economic reforms he has imposed during his seven years in office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kirchhof has provided gerhard schröder with a breath of fresh air ever media-canny , schröder has tried to turn the tables on merkel , arguing that kirchhof 's visions would make germany an even starker and colder place , carefully ignoring the fact that the university professor 's proposals are not actually contained in the official cdu / csu manifesto . press voices and with the spd bouncing back in the polls , experts do indeed believe that kirchhof could ultimately prove to be merkel 's undoing . the weekly magazine der spiegel made the " battle over kirchhof " its front page story on monday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fdp head guido westerwelle , angela merkel and csu head edmund stoiber the berlin-based daily tagesspiegel said that the election result " is still open .
the reason for this development is kirchhof .
if there is no cdu / csu-fdp majority on september 18 then kirchhof will have had a major part to play in this state of affairs . " but not everyone was being hoodwinked by the political machinations over kirchhof , who increasingly appears to have become an unwitting pawn in the last-minute election battle . the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung said schröder was purposely portraying kirchhof to be a " mad scientist , a social demon who would like nothing more than to put his guinea pigs , the german people , into a deep freeze . " and the left-wing daily tageszeitung satirized the spd 's efforts to portray kirchhof as some sort of blood-sucking vampire on its front page . the headline , " kirchhof , symphony of horror , " was an allusion to the name of f.w. murnau 's classic 1922 film " nosferatu , symphonies des grauens , " below which was a still of the bald , fanged vampire from that same film . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " change is needed to get germany moving " german conservative leader angela merkel is currently favored to become chancellor after the sept .

18 . instead , with less than a week to go before election day , kirchhof 's audacious proposals for a flat-rate tax of 25 percent have boomeranged on her , slashing the cdu / csu 's 21-point lead over chancellor gerhard schröder and his social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- in the opinion polls to a paltry seven points . that may not be enough for schröder to be re-elected , but it could force merkel and the cdu / csu into a " grand coalition " with his spd party , a horror scenario for many , particularly the free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , who have set their hearts on becoming junior partner in the new conservative government . backpedalling fast bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul kirchhof consequently , top fdp politicians have been quick to urge merkel to distance herself from kirchhof . germans should vote on the cdu / csu 's election program " not the visions of a scientist , " said the party 's tax expert hermann otto solms . and the fdp 's honorary chairman , otto graf lambsdorff , warned that kirchhof 's nomination was " a risk that may turn out to be bigger than its usefulness . " even the fdp 's chief whip wolfgang gerhardt said on ard public television that while he respected kirchhof , the university professor was politically inexperienced . the spd 's strong recovery in the polls also appears to be unnerving merkel , who insisted sunday that the cdu / csu 's aim was simply to lower the top and bottom rates of income tax . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel " anything beyond that is pie in the sky , " merkel said , appearing to sideline kirchhof and his radical ideas . nevertheless , officially at least , the shadow finance minister remains on board . " our team of experts is going to meet on wednesday and professor kirchhof will definitely be there , " said cdu chief whip volker kauder in berlin on monday . gift for schröder ironically , the nomination of kirchhof has been a godsend for schröder , who was trailing badly in the opinion polls as voters punished him for the deeply unpopular structural and economic reforms he has imposed during his seven years in office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kirchhof has provided gerhard schröder with a breath of fresh air ever media-canny , schröder has tried to turn the tables on merkel , arguing that kirchhof 's visions would make germany an even starker and colder place , carefully ignoring the fact that the university professor 's proposals are not actually contained in the official cdu / csu manifesto . press voices and with the spd bouncing back in the polls , experts do indeed believe that kirchhof could ultimately prove to be merkel 's undoing . the weekly magazine der spiegel made the " battle over kirchhof " its front page story on monday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fdp head guido westerwelle , angela merkel and csu head edmund stoiber the berlin-based daily tagesspiegel said that the election result " is still open .
the reason for this development is kirchhof .
if there is no cdu / csu-fdp majority on september 18 then kirchhof will have had a major part to play in this state of affairs . " but not everyone was being hoodwinked by the political machinations over kirchhof , who increasingly appears to have become an unwitting pawn in the last-minute election battle . the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung said schröder was purposely portraying kirchhof to be a " mad scientist , a social demon who would like nothing more than to put his guinea pigs , the german people , into a deep freeze . " and the left-wing daily tageszeitung satirized the spd 's efforts to portray kirchhof as some sort of blood-sucking vampire on its front page . the headline , " kirchhof , symphony of horror , " was an allusion to the name of f.w. murnau 's classic 1922 film " nosferatu , symphonies des grauens , " below which was a still of the bald , fanged vampire from that same film . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " change is needed to get germany moving " german conservative leader angela merkel is currently favored to become chancellor after the sept .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 12.09.2005 the lot of young german offenders großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how far can youths go before they wind up behind bars ?
a recent and fatal teenage attack on a seven-year-old boy near berlin has promoted cries from the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- for germany to review its liberal approach to dealing with criminals , however young they are . it was a particularly brutal and gratuitous crime , in which a boy of 16 beat an innocent child and neighbor to death , and subsequently attributed his violence to " personal frustration . "
it can be of no surprise to anyone that such savage behavior should unleash calls for tighter measures to prevent any future repetition of such tragedies .
but opinions on exactly how to deal with germany 's delinquent youngsters vary enormously .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a correction center in northern germany some say they should be given the benefit of the doubt on the grounds that they can not be held fully responsible for their own actions until they come of age .
others refute such claims as dangerously naïve , bellowing that acts of such evil ill-will should be paid for through the iron bars of a correction center .
there are currently some 6,000 criminals serving their time in juvenile offenders institutes across the country , but if the cdu had its way , that figure could be far higher .
in a statement issued following the horrific juvenile attack last month , chairman of the cdu berlin parliamentary group , andreas gram , and cdu legal expert , nicolas zimmer , called for a radical rethink .
" the soft touch era is finally over .
the justice system should react more swiftly to the first cases and signs of a criminal career , and be quicker to sentence violent young criminals to imprisonment , " they said .
no more coddling among other things , they propose detaining " profoundly dangerous and criminal children and youths " in special purpose , enclosed premises and reducing the age of criminal responsibility below its current minimum of 14 .
they have also called for the regulation which currently allows young adults up to the age of 21 to be tried under juvenile law , to be replaced by a statute which would treat them according to the same laws as adults .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu want youngsters to be tried as adults the warden of berlin 's plötzensee correctional institute for juveniles , marius fiedler , says that such debates date back decades , and that they are too general to be widely effective .
" you always just have to do the right thing , and you can only do that by looking at each individual case .
it 's a matter of recognizing the problems early on and steering the youngsters in the right direction . "
he added that there is only one 16 year-old inmate at the berlin center and none who are younger .
so does that render the cdu plea to reduce the age of accountability unnecessary , or is it an indication that the system is simply too lax ?
prevention is better than cure fact is , germany is not particularly tough on its young lawbreakers .
chairman of the juvenile court association bernd sonnen says the system is geared to try and work with criminal youngsters in such a way that they can avoid being incarcerated and prevent a career in crime before it is too late .
" between 66 and 69 percent of youth crimes in germany are resolved out of court .
the offenders can repair damage they have caused , they can take part in anti-aggression training or in mediated face to face sessions with their victims , " he explained .
" the success rate of the latter is particularly successful , and the advantage is that they do not become labeled criminals which is often a self-fulfilling prophecy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as many as 69 percent of youth crimes never make it to court but that is of little consolation to the victims of the crimes which continue to be part of the fabric of society here . sonnen says he can understand the calls to lock delinquents away , and the belief that a harder stance will prevent re-offending , but adds that it simply is n't the truth of the matter .
" sure , putting people behind bars is the toughest measure we have on offer , but it is also proven that it creates the highest rate of repeat offending .
when someone has been locked up for a given period and is then suddenly set free , they are highly likely to just go out and commit another crime , " he said .
rise in violent juvenile crime marius fiedler agrees that a jail sentence should be an absolute last resort .
" of course there are countries which are much tougher with their young criminals .
the state of california locks away about eight times the number of juveniles that we do , but are crime levels there are lower as a result ? " the governor asked .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the overwhelming majority of prisoners in germany are male sixty percent of the 554 male prisoners detained at the berlin young offenders institute are there as a result of committing violent crimes , from armed robbery to murder , and the picture is much the same across germany as a whole .
although crimes such as theft are declining , reported incidences of juvenile violence are indeed on the rise , but sonnen says the onus is on the word reported .
" we have become sensitized to violence and we are prepared to do something about it , to denounce violent crime .
whereas ten years ago school directors would have denied any sign of brutality in their establishments , they are now willing to admit that the problem exists , " he explained .
family problems and more often than not , the problem is the consequence of other , personal problems which date back to early childhood days .
fiedler says if there is anything that the young men who walk through the correction center gates have in common , it is bad family relations and a poor education .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a glance inside with that in mind , places like berlin plötzensee operate a strictly no punishment policy , but offer an extensive range of schooling , apprenticeship and work opportunities to try and generate a different sense of self-worth in the youngsters while they are inside .
for some it is the best they have ever known .
" a lot of them develop well inside , then shortly before their release date , they do something silly so their sentence is extended .
they do it because they are afraid of life , and of having to leave this protected space , " fiedler said . tamsin walker , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany moves to protect stalking victims germany 's upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , has passed a bill that would provide better protection for victims of stalking .

" braun 's suggestions were outlined in 20-point memo entitled " economic expectations of the future government " which is now posted on the dihk web site . the memo outlines in no vague terms the need for germany to abandon it 's moto of " protect the environment at any cost . " among other suggestions , the braun plan calls for reductions in environmental regulations and bureaucracy , improved dialog with business and industry , changes in law governing use of chemicals -lrb- reach -rrb- , and a retraction of germany 's plan to cut greenhouse gas by 40 percent by 2020 . less then enthusiastic reaction the reaction to ludwig-braun 's proposals did not go over very well with members of chancellor gerhard schröders red-green coalition which maintains the need for strict environmental regulations not only in germany , but throughout all of the worlds major economies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german environment minister jürgen trittin does not think that environmental regulation and industry should oppose each other schröder 's often outspoken environmental minister jürgen trittin , a member of the green party , called braun 's suggestions " a complete subordination of environmental concerns to that of private industry . " he went on to suggest that chamber was trying to twist the facts by making the association that protecting the environment need come at the cost of economic growth and investment . call for boycott the german alliance for renewable energy took their reaction a step further by calling for all businesses who manufacture green products or products that run on sustainable energy to withhold their mandatory dues to the dihk in protest of their stance on environmental protection . economic topics have dominated the 2005 election campaign and industry leaders clearly feel confident enough that schröder 's conservative challenger angela merkel will win the poll on sept .
18 that they begin to try to influence government policy . however , with schröder 's social democrats surging in recent opinion polls , braun might not be doing the business community any favors by pushing for radical changes to government policy since environmental protection remains an issue that most germans feel very strongly about .

accordingly , the league is finding it hard to attract the world 's best players . both domestically and abroad , the only consistently serious contender in german soccer is fc bayern munich .
the bavarian club is the bundesliga 's traditional powerhouse and the home of past german greats like midfielder franz beckenbauer , goal-scoring maestro gerd müller and keeper sepp maier . the club is also the place to find current stars like oliver kahn , michael ballack and bastian schweinsteiger .
but bayern 's strength is the rest of the league 's weakness and without munich holding the banner high , german soccer would have a hard time being represented in international competitions such as the champions league .
" germany is lacking , with the exception of bayern munich , clubs with international power , " was the assessment of hamburg sv president bernd hoffmann in an interview with the tagesspiegel newspaper .
" the bundesliga is not the top place for stars to be playing .
we don ’ t have the financial strength like the english clubs and have not been successful the past few years , " he said .
brazilians like germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke 04 manager rudi assauer -lrb- r -rrb- with clubs newest young talent , brazilian rafinha the hunt for top talent has long stopped being a national affair .
european club scouts are travelling around the world to seek the next pele .
if you scour the rosters of bundesliga clubs , then you wouldn ’ t necessarily know that you are looking at a german club .
whether it be lucio , d ’ alessandro , vittek or van der vaart , the big names in the league are no longer a " who ’ s who " of german soccer .
in the 2004-05 season , only the english premiership had more foreign players -lrb- 56 percent -rrb- than the bundeliga ’ s 48 percent .
heading into the 2005-06 season , that percentage dropped down to 42.6 percent as cost-cutting measures increase .
financial woes have forced club management to rethink policies .
" i think that the clubs learned their lesson after the kirch -lrb- media company -rrb- crisis , " said german soccer league -lrb- dfl -rrb- managing director christian seifert before the season .
" they are investing more in their youth programs . "
nevertheless , the transfer deadline which expired on august 31 , revealed that clubs would not hesitate to improve their lot by turning to players from abroad .
young brazilians , some of whom shined at the under-20 world championships this summer , figured in many of the deals .
dortmund 's bad example the bosses at borussia dortmund could talk all day long about how costly foreign talent can be .
it almost cost the club its league license .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : borussia dortmund stood on the brink of ruin after taking the 1997 champions league , the ruhr valley club went on a spending spree .
to finance the expensive transfers , the club decided , among other things , to go public and list itself on the stock exchange during the high-flying days of the internet boom .
to pull it off , the whole scheme was dependent on one thing - winning .
this they failed to do and dortmund was just a hair away from declaring bankruptcy last season .
it may sound dumb but the financial health off the field and the success on it rests more and more on the ability of the team directors to find talent before they blossom , that is , before they become overpriced .
bayern recipe for success some complain munich have an unfair advantage in that if a good player wants true international recognition , he will receive it in the bavarian capital .
it becomes an upward spiral of success .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international midfielder sebastian deisler is not a starter at bayern munich the team wins , receives more money which it can spend , and in turn , get better players when needed .
still , being a very good german player , even being on the national squad , is no guarantee for success at bayern .
just talk to sebastian deisler and bastian schweinsteiger who both frequently are used as substitutes .
" there aren ’ t many german players who can play at the level demanded by bayern munich , " bayern coach felix magath said recently .
the gaps are filled in by exceptional , but not necessarily exorbitantly-priced players , such as the central defenders lucio from brazil and valérien ismaël from france or dutch striker roy makaay .
but as if to highlight the deficits of german club soccer , none of those three play exceptional roles in their national teams . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new crop of brazilians in bundesliga before the transfer window came to a close on aug .

" he went on to suggest that chamber was trying to twist the facts by making the association that protecting the environment need come at the cost of economic growth and investment . call for boycott the german alliance for renewable energy took their reaction a step further by calling for all businesses who manufacture green products or products that run on sustainable energy to withhold their mandatory dues to the dihk in protest of their stance on environmental protection . economic topics have dominated the 2005 election campaign and industry leaders clearly feel confident enough that schröder 's conservative challenger angela merkel will win the poll on sept .

18 . instead , with less than a week to go before election day , kirchhof 's audacious proposals for a flat-rate tax of 25 percent have boomeranged on her , slashing the cdu / csu 's 21-point lead over chancellor gerhard schröder and his social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- in the opinion polls to a paltry seven points . that may not be enough for schröder to be re-elected , but it could force merkel and the cdu / csu into a " grand coalition " with his spd party , a horror scenario for many , particularly the free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , who have set their hearts on becoming junior partner in the new conservative government . backpedalling fast bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul kirchhof consequently , top fdp politicians have been quick to urge merkel to distance herself from kirchhof . germans should vote on the cdu / csu 's election program " not the visions of a scientist , " said the party 's tax expert hermann otto solms . and the fdp 's honorary chairman , otto graf lambsdorff , warned that kirchhof 's nomination was " a risk that may turn out to be bigger than its usefulness . " even the fdp 's chief whip wolfgang gerhardt said on ard public television that while he respected kirchhof , the university professor was politically inexperienced . the spd 's strong recovery in the polls also appears to be unnerving merkel , who insisted sunday that the cdu / csu 's aim was simply to lower the top and bottom rates of income tax . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel " anything beyond that is pie in the sky , " merkel said , appearing to sideline kirchhof and his radical ideas . nevertheless , officially at least , the shadow finance minister remains on board . " our team of experts is going to meet on wednesday and professor kirchhof will definitely be there , " said cdu chief whip volker kauder in berlin on monday . gift for schröder ironically , the nomination of kirchhof has been a godsend for schröder , who was trailing badly in the opinion polls as voters punished him for the deeply unpopular structural and economic reforms he has imposed during his seven years in office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kirchhof has provided gerhard schröder with a breath of fresh air ever media-canny , schröder has tried to turn the tables on merkel , arguing that kirchhof 's visions would make germany an even starker and colder place , carefully ignoring the fact that the university professor 's proposals are not actually contained in the official cdu / csu manifesto . press voices and with the spd bouncing back in the polls , experts do indeed believe that kirchhof could ultimately prove to be merkel 's undoing . the weekly magazine der spiegel made the " battle over kirchhof " its front page story on monday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fdp head guido westerwelle , angela merkel and csu head edmund stoiber the berlin-based daily tagesspiegel said that the election result " is still open .
the reason for this development is kirchhof .
if there is no cdu / csu-fdp majority on september 18 then kirchhof will have had a major part to play in this state of affairs . " but not everyone was being hoodwinked by the political machinations over kirchhof , who increasingly appears to have become an unwitting pawn in the last-minute election battle . the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung said schröder was purposely portraying kirchhof to be a " mad scientist , a social demon who would like nothing more than to put his guinea pigs , the german people , into a deep freeze . " and the left-wing daily tageszeitung satirized the spd 's efforts to portray kirchhof as some sort of blood-sucking vampire on its front page . the headline , " kirchhof , symphony of horror , " was an allusion to the name of f.w. murnau 's classic 1922 film " nosferatu , symphonies des grauens , " below which was a still of the bald , fanged vampire from that same film . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " change is needed to get germany moving " german conservative leader angela merkel is currently favored to become chancellor after the sept .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the 2005/2006 bundesliga season bayern top as flying dutchman takes off bremen stick with record breaking bayern ballack header saves bayern record teams fight to keep pace with bayern sports -pipe- 12.09.2005 is the bundesliga too weak ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ismaël and makaay are stars in the bundesliga , but not internationally germany 's bundesliga may be one of the biggest soccer leagues in europe , but it 's far from the richest or most competitive .
accordingly , the league is finding it hard to attract the world 's best players . both domestically and abroad , the only consistently serious contender in german soccer is fc bayern munich .
the bavarian club is the bundesliga 's traditional powerhouse and the home of past german greats like midfielder franz beckenbauer , goal-scoring maestro gerd müller and keeper sepp maier . the club is also the place to find current stars like oliver kahn , michael ballack and bastian schweinsteiger .
but bayern 's strength is the rest of the league 's weakness and without munich holding the banner high , german soccer would have a hard time being represented in international competitions such as the champions league .
" germany is lacking , with the exception of bayern munich , clubs with international power , " was the assessment of hamburg sv president bernd hoffmann in an interview with the tagesspiegel newspaper .
" the bundesliga is not the top place for stars to be playing .
we don ’ t have the financial strength like the english clubs and have not been successful the past few years , " he said .
brazilians like germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke 04 manager rudi assauer -lrb- r -rrb- with clubs newest young talent , brazilian rafinha the hunt for top talent has long stopped being a national affair .
european club scouts are travelling around the world to seek the next pele .
if you scour the rosters of bundesliga clubs , then you wouldn ’ t necessarily know that you are looking at a german club .
whether it be lucio , d ’ alessandro , vittek or van der vaart , the big names in the league are no longer a " who ’ s who " of german soccer .
in the 2004-05 season , only the english premiership had more foreign players -lrb- 56 percent -rrb- than the bundeliga ’ s 48 percent .
heading into the 2005-06 season , that percentage dropped down to 42.6 percent as cost-cutting measures increase .
financial woes have forced club management to rethink policies .
" i think that the clubs learned their lesson after the kirch -lrb- media company -rrb- crisis , " said german soccer league -lrb- dfl -rrb- managing director christian seifert before the season .
" they are investing more in their youth programs . "
nevertheless , the transfer deadline which expired on august 31 , revealed that clubs would not hesitate to improve their lot by turning to players from abroad .
young brazilians , some of whom shined at the under-20 world championships this summer , figured in many of the deals .
dortmund 's bad example the bosses at borussia dortmund could talk all day long about how costly foreign talent can be .
it almost cost the club its league license .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : borussia dortmund stood on the brink of ruin after taking the 1997 champions league , the ruhr valley club went on a spending spree .
to finance the expensive transfers , the club decided , among other things , to go public and list itself on the stock exchange during the high-flying days of the internet boom .
to pull it off , the whole scheme was dependent on one thing - winning .
this they failed to do and dortmund was just a hair away from declaring bankruptcy last season .
it may sound dumb but the financial health off the field and the success on it rests more and more on the ability of the team directors to find talent before they blossom , that is , before they become overpriced .
bayern recipe for success some complain munich have an unfair advantage in that if a good player wants true international recognition , he will receive it in the bavarian capital .
it becomes an upward spiral of success .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international midfielder sebastian deisler is not a starter at bayern munich the team wins , receives more money which it can spend , and in turn , get better players when needed .
still , being a very good german player , even being on the national squad , is no guarantee for success at bayern .
just talk to sebastian deisler and bastian schweinsteiger who both frequently are used as substitutes .
" there aren ’ t many german players who can play at the level demanded by bayern munich , " bayern coach felix magath said recently .
the gaps are filled in by exceptional , but not necessarily exorbitantly-priced players , such as the central defenders lucio from brazil and valérien ismaël from france or dutch striker roy makaay .
but as if to highlight the deficits of german club soccer , none of those three play exceptional roles in their national teams . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new crop of brazilians in bundesliga before the transfer window came to a close on aug .

a recent and fatal teenage attack on a seven-year-old boy near berlin has promoted cries from the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- for germany to review its liberal approach to dealing with criminals , however young they are . it was a particularly brutal and gratuitous crime , in which a boy of 16 beat an innocent child and neighbor to death , and subsequently attributed his violence to " personal frustration . "
it can be of no surprise to anyone that such savage behavior should unleash calls for tighter measures to prevent any future repetition of such tragedies .
but opinions on exactly how to deal with germany 's delinquent youngsters vary enormously .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a correction center in northern germany some say they should be given the benefit of the doubt on the grounds that they can not be held fully responsible for their own actions until they come of age .
others refute such claims as dangerously naïve , bellowing that acts of such evil ill-will should be paid for through the iron bars of a correction center .
there are currently some 6,000 criminals serving their time in juvenile offenders institutes across the country , but if the cdu had its way , that figure could be far higher .
in a statement issued following the horrific juvenile attack last month , chairman of the cdu berlin parliamentary group , andreas gram , and cdu legal expert , nicolas zimmer , called for a radical rethink .
" the soft touch era is finally over .
the justice system should react more swiftly to the first cases and signs of a criminal career , and be quicker to sentence violent young criminals to imprisonment , " they said .
no more coddling among other things , they propose detaining " profoundly dangerous and criminal children and youths " in special purpose , enclosed premises and reducing the age of criminal responsibility below its current minimum of 14 .
they have also called for the regulation which currently allows young adults up to the age of 21 to be tried under juvenile law , to be replaced by a statute which would treat them according to the same laws as adults .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu want youngsters to be tried as adults the warden of berlin 's plötzensee correctional institute for juveniles , marius fiedler , says that such debates date back decades , and that they are too general to be widely effective .
" you always just have to do the right thing , and you can only do that by looking at each individual case .
it 's a matter of recognizing the problems early on and steering the youngsters in the right direction . "
he added that there is only one 16 year-old inmate at the berlin center and none who are younger .
so does that render the cdu plea to reduce the age of accountability unnecessary , or is it an indication that the system is simply too lax ?
prevention is better than cure fact is , germany is not particularly tough on its young lawbreakers .
chairman of the juvenile court association bernd sonnen says the system is geared to try and work with criminal youngsters in such a way that they can avoid being incarcerated and prevent a career in crime before it is too late .
" between 66 and 69 percent of youth crimes in germany are resolved out of court .
the offenders can repair damage they have caused , they can take part in anti-aggression training or in mediated face to face sessions with their victims , " he explained .
" the success rate of the latter is particularly successful , and the advantage is that they do not become labeled criminals which is often a self-fulfilling prophecy . "

" sure , putting people behind bars is the toughest measure we have on offer , but it is also proven that it creates the highest rate of repeat offending .

a recent and fatal teenage attack on a seven-year-old boy near berlin has promoted cries from the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- for germany to review its liberal approach to dealing with criminals , however young they are . it was a particularly brutal and gratuitous crime , in which a boy of 16 beat an innocent child and neighbor to death , and subsequently attributed his violence to " personal frustration . "
it can be of no surprise to anyone that such savage behavior should unleash calls for tighter measures to prevent any future repetition of such tragedies .
but opinions on exactly how to deal with germany 's delinquent youngsters vary enormously .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a correction center in northern germany some say they should be given the benefit of the doubt on the grounds that they can not be held fully responsible for their own actions until they come of age .
others refute such claims as dangerously naïve , bellowing that acts of such evil ill-will should be paid for through the iron bars of a correction center .
there are currently some 6,000 criminals serving their time in juvenile offenders institutes across the country , but if the cdu had its way , that figure could be far higher .
in a statement issued following the horrific juvenile attack last month , chairman of the cdu berlin parliamentary group , andreas gram , and cdu legal expert , nicolas zimmer , called for a radical rethink .
" the soft touch era is finally over .
the justice system should react more swiftly to the first cases and signs of a criminal career , and be quicker to sentence violent young criminals to imprisonment , " they said .
no more coddling among other things , they propose detaining " profoundly dangerous and criminal children and youths " in special purpose , enclosed premises and reducing the age of criminal responsibility below its current minimum of 14 .
they have also called for the regulation which currently allows young adults up to the age of 21 to be tried under juvenile law , to be replaced by a statute which would treat them according to the same laws as adults .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu want youngsters to be tried as adults the warden of berlin 's plötzensee correctional institute for juveniles , marius fiedler , says that such debates date back decades , and that they are too general to be widely effective .
" you always just have to do the right thing , and you can only do that by looking at each individual case .
it 's a matter of recognizing the problems early on and steering the youngsters in the right direction . "
he added that there is only one 16 year-old inmate at the berlin center and none who are younger .
so does that render the cdu plea to reduce the age of accountability unnecessary , or is it an indication that the system is simply too lax ?
prevention is better than cure fact is , germany is not particularly tough on its young lawbreakers .
chairman of the juvenile court association bernd sonnen says the system is geared to try and work with criminal youngsters in such a way that they can avoid being incarcerated and prevent a career in crime before it is too late .
" between 66 and 69 percent of youth crimes in germany are resolved out of court .
the offenders can repair damage they have caused , they can take part in anti-aggression training or in mediated face to face sessions with their victims , " he explained .
" the success rate of the latter is particularly successful , and the advantage is that they do not become labeled criminals which is often a self-fulfilling prophecy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as many as 69 percent of youth crimes never make it to court but that is of little consolation to the victims of the crimes which continue to be part of the fabric of society here . sonnen says he can understand the calls to lock delinquents away , and the belief that a harder stance will prevent re-offending , but adds that it simply is n't the truth of the matter .
" sure , putting people behind bars is the toughest measure we have on offer , but it is also proven that it creates the highest rate of repeat offending .
when someone has been locked up for a given period and is then suddenly set free , they are highly likely to just go out and commit another crime , " he said .
rise in violent juvenile crime marius fiedler agrees that a jail sentence should be an absolute last resort .
" of course there are countries which are much tougher with their young criminals .
the state of california locks away about eight times the number of juveniles that we do , but are crime levels there are lower as a result ? " the governor asked .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the overwhelming majority of prisoners in germany are male sixty percent of the 554 male prisoners detained at the berlin young offenders institute are there as a result of committing violent crimes , from armed robbery to murder , and the picture is much the same across germany as a whole .
although crimes such as theft are declining , reported incidences of juvenile violence are indeed on the rise , but sonnen says the onus is on the word reported .
" we have become sensitized to violence and we are prepared to do something about it , to denounce violent crime .
whereas ten years ago school directors would have denied any sign of brutality in their establishments , they are now willing to admit that the problem exists , " he explained .
family problems and more often than not , the problem is the consequence of other , personal problems which date back to early childhood days .
fiedler says if there is anything that the young men who walk through the correction center gates have in common , it is bad family relations and a poor education .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a glance inside with that in mind , places like berlin plötzensee operate a strictly no punishment policy , but offer an extensive range of schooling , apprenticeship and work opportunities to try and generate a different sense of self-worth in the youngsters while they are inside .
for some it is the best they have ever known .
" a lot of them develop well inside , then shortly before their release date , they do something silly so their sentence is extended .
they do it because they are afraid of life , and of having to leave this protected space , " fiedler said . tamsin walker , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany moves to protect stalking victims germany 's upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , has passed a bill that would provide better protection for victims of stalking .

the chancellor , who was largely written off by political analysts in recent months , has managed to halve the gap in the last week after a televised debate with merkel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " wherever i go , i encounter a lot of support .
the tide is turning , " schröder was quoted as telling the sunday edition of the bild newspaper . " at the end of the day , it is the voters who decide who will become their next chancellor . "
the chancellor , whose personal approval ratings have jumped by 11 points since august according to one poll , said the latest polls prove that " the supposed mood for change no longer exists " among the electorate and announced a few extra rallies for the final week of campaigning .
cdu losing ground by contrast , the cdu and their sister bavarian party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- appeared to be faltering in the last days leading up to the election .
several leading surveys at the weekend showed the cdu / csu losing ground , raising conservatives ' fears that they could once again squander a big lead to schröder , who rallied from 12 points behind in six weeks to win the last election in 2002 .

a recent and fatal teenage attack on a seven-year-old boy near berlin has promoted cries from the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- for germany to review its liberal approach to dealing with criminals , however young they are . it was a particularly brutal and gratuitous crime , in which a boy of 16 beat an innocent child and neighbor to death , and subsequently attributed his violence to " personal frustration . "
it can be of no surprise to anyone that such savage behavior should unleash calls for tighter measures to prevent any future repetition of such tragedies .
but opinions on exactly how to deal with germany 's delinquent youngsters vary enormously .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a correction center in northern germany some say they should be given the benefit of the doubt on the grounds that they can not be held fully responsible for their own actions until they come of age .
others refute such claims as dangerously naïve , bellowing that acts of such evil ill-will should be paid for through the iron bars of a correction center .
there are currently some 6,000 criminals serving their time in juvenile offenders institutes across the country , but if the cdu had its way , that figure could be far higher .
in a statement issued following the horrific juvenile attack last month , chairman of the cdu berlin parliamentary group , andreas gram , and cdu legal expert , nicolas zimmer , called for a radical rethink .
" the soft touch era is finally over .
the justice system should react more swiftly to the first cases and signs of a criminal career , and be quicker to sentence violent young criminals to imprisonment , " they said .
no more coddling among other things , they propose detaining " profoundly dangerous and criminal children and youths " in special purpose , enclosed premises and reducing the age of criminal responsibility below its current minimum of 14 .
they have also called for the regulation which currently allows young adults up to the age of 21 to be tried under juvenile law , to be replaced by a statute which would treat them according to the same laws as adults .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu want youngsters to be tried as adults the warden of berlin 's plötzensee correctional institute for juveniles , marius fiedler , says that such debates date back decades , and that they are too general to be widely effective .
" you always just have to do the right thing , and you can only do that by looking at each individual case .
it 's a matter of recognizing the problems early on and steering the youngsters in the right direction . "
he added that there is only one 16 year-old inmate at the berlin center and none who are younger .
so does that render the cdu plea to reduce the age of accountability unnecessary , or is it an indication that the system is simply too lax ?
prevention is better than cure fact is , germany is not particularly tough on its young lawbreakers .
chairman of the juvenile court association bernd sonnen says the system is geared to try and work with criminal youngsters in such a way that they can avoid being incarcerated and prevent a career in crime before it is too late .
" between 66 and 69 percent of youth crimes in germany are resolved out of court .
the offenders can repair damage they have caused , they can take part in anti-aggression training or in mediated face to face sessions with their victims , " he explained .
" the success rate of the latter is particularly successful , and the advantage is that they do not become labeled criminals which is often a self-fulfilling prophecy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as many as 69 percent of youth crimes never make it to court but that is of little consolation to the victims of the crimes which continue to be part of the fabric of society here . sonnen says he can understand the calls to lock delinquents away , and the belief that a harder stance will prevent re-offending , but adds that it simply is n't the truth of the matter .
" sure , putting people behind bars is the toughest measure we have on offer , but it is also proven that it creates the highest rate of repeat offending .
when someone has been locked up for a given period and is then suddenly set free , they are highly likely to just go out and commit another crime , " he said .
rise in violent juvenile crime marius fiedler agrees that a jail sentence should be an absolute last resort .
" of course there are countries which are much tougher with their young criminals .
the state of california locks away about eight times the number of juveniles that we do , but are crime levels there are lower as a result ? " the governor asked .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the overwhelming majority of prisoners in germany are male sixty percent of the 554 male prisoners detained at the berlin young offenders institute are there as a result of committing violent crimes , from armed robbery to murder , and the picture is much the same across germany as a whole .
although crimes such as theft are declining , reported incidences of juvenile violence are indeed on the rise , but sonnen says the onus is on the word reported .
" we have become sensitized to violence and we are prepared to do something about it , to denounce violent crime .
whereas ten years ago school directors would have denied any sign of brutality in their establishments , they are now willing to admit that the problem exists , " he explained .
family problems and more often than not , the problem is the consequence of other , personal problems which date back to early childhood days .
fiedler says if there is anything that the young men who walk through the correction center gates have in common , it is bad family relations and a poor education .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a glance inside with that in mind , places like berlin plötzensee operate a strictly no punishment policy , but offer an extensive range of schooling , apprenticeship and work opportunities to try and generate a different sense of self-worth in the youngsters while they are inside .
for some it is the best they have ever known .
" a lot of them develop well inside , then shortly before their release date , they do something silly so their sentence is extended .
they do it because they are afraid of life , and of having to leave this protected space , " fiedler said . tamsin walker , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany moves to protect stalking victims germany 's upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , has passed a bill that would provide better protection for victims of stalking .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the 2005/2006 bundesliga season bayern top as flying dutchman takes off bremen stick with record breaking bayern ballack header saves bayern record teams fight to keep pace with bayern sports -pipe- 12.09.2005 is the bundesliga too weak ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ismaël and makaay are stars in the bundesliga , but not internationally germany 's bundesliga may be one of the biggest soccer leagues in europe , but it 's far from the richest or most competitive .
accordingly , the league is finding it hard to attract the world 's best players . both domestically and abroad , the only consistently serious contender in german soccer is fc bayern munich .
the bavarian club is the bundesliga 's traditional powerhouse and the home of past german greats like midfielder franz beckenbauer , goal-scoring maestro gerd müller and keeper sepp maier . the club is also the place to find current stars like oliver kahn , michael ballack and bastian schweinsteiger .
but bayern 's strength is the rest of the league 's weakness and without munich holding the banner high , german soccer would have a hard time being represented in international competitions such as the champions league .
" germany is lacking , with the exception of bayern munich , clubs with international power , " was the assessment of hamburg sv president bernd hoffmann in an interview with the tagesspiegel newspaper .
" the bundesliga is not the top place for stars to be playing .
we don ’ t have the financial strength like the english clubs and have not been successful the past few years , " he said .
brazilians like germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke 04 manager rudi assauer -lrb- r -rrb- with clubs newest young talent , brazilian rafinha the hunt for top talent has long stopped being a national affair .
european club scouts are travelling around the world to seek the next pele .
if you scour the rosters of bundesliga clubs , then you wouldn ’ t necessarily know that you are looking at a german club .
whether it be lucio , d ’ alessandro , vittek or van der vaart , the big names in the league are no longer a " who ’ s who " of german soccer .
in the 2004-05 season , only the english premiership had more foreign players -lrb- 56 percent -rrb- than the bundeliga ’ s 48 percent .
heading into the 2005-06 season , that percentage dropped down to 42.6 percent as cost-cutting measures increase .
financial woes have forced club management to rethink policies .
" i think that the clubs learned their lesson after the kirch -lrb- media company -rrb- crisis , " said german soccer league -lrb- dfl -rrb- managing director christian seifert before the season .
" they are investing more in their youth programs . "
nevertheless , the transfer deadline which expired on august 31 , revealed that clubs would not hesitate to improve their lot by turning to players from abroad .
young brazilians , some of whom shined at the under-20 world championships this summer , figured in many of the deals .
dortmund 's bad example the bosses at borussia dortmund could talk all day long about how costly foreign talent can be .
it almost cost the club its league license .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : borussia dortmund stood on the brink of ruin after taking the 1997 champions league , the ruhr valley club went on a spending spree .
to finance the expensive transfers , the club decided , among other things , to go public and list itself on the stock exchange during the high-flying days of the internet boom .
to pull it off , the whole scheme was dependent on one thing - winning .
this they failed to do and dortmund was just a hair away from declaring bankruptcy last season .
it may sound dumb but the financial health off the field and the success on it rests more and more on the ability of the team directors to find talent before they blossom , that is , before they become overpriced .
bayern recipe for success some complain munich have an unfair advantage in that if a good player wants true international recognition , he will receive it in the bavarian capital .
it becomes an upward spiral of success .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international midfielder sebastian deisler is not a starter at bayern munich the team wins , receives more money which it can spend , and in turn , get better players when needed .
still , being a very good german player , even being on the national squad , is no guarantee for success at bayern .
just talk to sebastian deisler and bastian schweinsteiger who both frequently are used as substitutes .
" there aren ’ t many german players who can play at the level demanded by bayern munich , " bayern coach felix magath said recently .
the gaps are filled in by exceptional , but not necessarily exorbitantly-priced players , such as the central defenders lucio from brazil and valérien ismaël from france or dutch striker roy makaay .
but as if to highlight the deficits of german club soccer , none of those three play exceptional roles in their national teams . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new crop of brazilians in bundesliga before the transfer window came to a close on aug .

germany remains opposed to us desires to merge nato peacekeepers and the us-led coalition there . defense ministers from the 26-nation military body will look at a range of issues , including the alliances own development over the next decade , forces in iraq and in the balkans and the situation in sudan .
but afghanistan will probably provide the most substantial item on the menu , ahead of the country 's first parliamentary elections in 30 years on saturday . nato , in charge of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan , has beefed up its troop levels in the run-up to the ballots , which has seen a surge in violence across the country . bildunterschrift : german armored vehicles from isaf at the informal talks in berlin , which are being held under tight security , the ministers will discuss the planned extension of isaf into the south of the country early next year , in the latest stage of its expansion around the country after starting in the capital kabul . britain , canada and the netherlands are to lead the move into the south , joining some 18,000 us soldiers who have long been fighting al qaeda and taliban fighters , in particular along the eastern border with pakistan . merging operations ? washington is eager to see isaf active across the whole country by the end of 2006 - and also has expressed interest in merging or , at a minimum , increasing cooperation between its own operation enduring freedom troops -lrb- oef -rrb- and the nato-led force . that push faces strong reservations from some european allies - notably from germany , france and turkey who oppose a full merger , fearing that it would turn peacekeepers into targets for the opponents of the kabul government under hamid karsai .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 12.09.2005 the lot of young german offenders großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how far can youths go before they wind up behind bars ?
a recent and fatal teenage attack on a seven-year-old boy near berlin has promoted cries from the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- for germany to review its liberal approach to dealing with criminals , however young they are . it was a particularly brutal and gratuitous crime , in which a boy of 16 beat an innocent child and neighbor to death , and subsequently attributed his violence to " personal frustration . "
it can be of no surprise to anyone that such savage behavior should unleash calls for tighter measures to prevent any future repetition of such tragedies .
but opinions on exactly how to deal with germany 's delinquent youngsters vary enormously .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a correction center in northern germany some say they should be given the benefit of the doubt on the grounds that they can not be held fully responsible for their own actions until they come of age .
others refute such claims as dangerously naïve , bellowing that acts of such evil ill-will should be paid for through the iron bars of a correction center .
there are currently some 6,000 criminals serving their time in juvenile offenders institutes across the country , but if the cdu had its way , that figure could be far higher .
in a statement issued following the horrific juvenile attack last month , chairman of the cdu berlin parliamentary group , andreas gram , and cdu legal expert , nicolas zimmer , called for a radical rethink .
" the soft touch era is finally over .
the justice system should react more swiftly to the first cases and signs of a criminal career , and be quicker to sentence violent young criminals to imprisonment , " they said .
no more coddling among other things , they propose detaining " profoundly dangerous and criminal children and youths " in special purpose , enclosed premises and reducing the age of criminal responsibility below its current minimum of 14 .
they have also called for the regulation which currently allows young adults up to the age of 21 to be tried under juvenile law , to be replaced by a statute which would treat them according to the same laws as adults .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu want youngsters to be tried as adults the warden of berlin 's plötzensee correctional institute for juveniles , marius fiedler , says that such debates date back decades , and that they are too general to be widely effective .
" you always just have to do the right thing , and you can only do that by looking at each individual case .
it 's a matter of recognizing the problems early on and steering the youngsters in the right direction . "
he added that there is only one 16 year-old inmate at the berlin center and none who are younger .
so does that render the cdu plea to reduce the age of accountability unnecessary , or is it an indication that the system is simply too lax ?
prevention is better than cure fact is , germany is not particularly tough on its young lawbreakers .
chairman of the juvenile court association bernd sonnen says the system is geared to try and work with criminal youngsters in such a way that they can avoid being incarcerated and prevent a career in crime before it is too late .
" between 66 and 69 percent of youth crimes in germany are resolved out of court .
the offenders can repair damage they have caused , they can take part in anti-aggression training or in mediated face to face sessions with their victims , " he explained .
" the success rate of the latter is particularly successful , and the advantage is that they do not become labeled criminals which is often a self-fulfilling prophecy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as many as 69 percent of youth crimes never make it to court but that is of little consolation to the victims of the crimes which continue to be part of the fabric of society here . sonnen says he can understand the calls to lock delinquents away , and the belief that a harder stance will prevent re-offending , but adds that it simply is n't the truth of the matter .
" sure , putting people behind bars is the toughest measure we have on offer , but it is also proven that it creates the highest rate of repeat offending .
when someone has been locked up for a given period and is then suddenly set free , they are highly likely to just go out and commit another crime , " he said .
rise in violent juvenile crime marius fiedler agrees that a jail sentence should be an absolute last resort .
" of course there are countries which are much tougher with their young criminals .
the state of california locks away about eight times the number of juveniles that we do , but are crime levels there are lower as a result ? " the governor asked .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the overwhelming majority of prisoners in germany are male sixty percent of the 554 male prisoners detained at the berlin young offenders institute are there as a result of committing violent crimes , from armed robbery to murder , and the picture is much the same across germany as a whole .
although crimes such as theft are declining , reported incidences of juvenile violence are indeed on the rise , but sonnen says the onus is on the word reported .
" we have become sensitized to violence and we are prepared to do something about it , to denounce violent crime .
whereas ten years ago school directors would have denied any sign of brutality in their establishments , they are now willing to admit that the problem exists , " he explained .
family problems and more often than not , the problem is the consequence of other , personal problems which date back to early childhood days .
fiedler says if there is anything that the young men who walk through the correction center gates have in common , it is bad family relations and a poor education .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a glance inside with that in mind , places like berlin plötzensee operate a strictly no punishment policy , but offer an extensive range of schooling , apprenticeship and work opportunities to try and generate a different sense of self-worth in the youngsters while they are inside .
for some it is the best they have ever known .
" a lot of them develop well inside , then shortly before their release date , they do something silly so their sentence is extended .
they do it because they are afraid of life , and of having to leave this protected space , " fiedler said . tamsin walker , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany moves to protect stalking victims germany 's upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , has passed a bill that would provide better protection for victims of stalking .

" i think that the clubs learned their lesson after the kirch -lrb- media company -rrb- crisis , " said german soccer league -lrb- dfl -rrb- managing director christian seifert before the season .
" they are investing more in their youth programs . "
nevertheless , the transfer deadline which expired on august 31 , revealed that clubs would not hesitate to improve their lot by turning to players from abroad .
young brazilians , some of whom shined at the under-20 world championships this summer , figured in many of the deals .
dortmund 's bad example the bosses at borussia dortmund could talk all day long about how costly foreign talent can be .
it almost cost the club its league license .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : borussia dortmund stood on the brink of ruin after taking the 1997 champions league , the ruhr valley club went on a spending spree .
to finance the expensive transfers , the club decided , among other things , to go public and list itself on the stock exchange during the high-flying days of the internet boom .
to pull it off , the whole scheme was dependent on one thing - winning .
this they failed to do and dortmund was just a hair away from declaring bankruptcy last season .
it may sound dumb but the financial health off the field and the success on it rests more and more on the ability of the team directors to find talent before they blossom , that is , before they become overpriced .
bayern recipe for success some complain munich have an unfair advantage in that if a good player wants true international recognition , he will receive it in the bavarian capital .
it becomes an upward spiral of success .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international midfielder sebastian deisler is not a starter at bayern munich the team wins , receives more money which it can spend , and in turn , get better players when needed .
still , being a very good german player , even being on the national squad , is no guarantee for success at bayern .
just talk to sebastian deisler and bastian schweinsteiger who both frequently are used as substitutes .
" there aren ’ t many german players who can play at the level demanded by bayern munich , " bayern coach felix magath said recently .
the gaps are filled in by exceptional , but not necessarily exorbitantly-priced players , such as the central defenders lucio from brazil and valérien ismaël from france or dutch striker roy makaay .
but as if to highlight the deficits of german club soccer , none of those three play exceptional roles in their national teams . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new crop of brazilians in bundesliga before the transfer window came to a close on aug .

a replacement has already been found in franz schönhuber , the former national leader of another right wing-extremist party , but there is n't enough time to reprint ballots before sunday . as the race for the chancellery becomes tighter with the election just days away , politicians and legal experts are mulling the ramifications of a late vote in dresden , with some saying that a delayed election could throw into question the legality of the national vote . experts such as werner patzelt , a political scientist from dresden university , predicted political turmoil if the race turns out to be extremely narrow as in the last election , where social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- only had about 6,000 votes more than the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german parliament 's make-up might not be known until oct .
2 " should the question of whether we 'll see a grand coalition -lrb- cdu and spd -rrb- or one between the cdu and the -lrb- free-market -rrb- liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- hinge on a single mandate , then indeed the postponed election in the dresden constituency may be of crucial importance , " he told dw-radio . splitti n g the electio n ? hans meyer , a professor of constitutional law and former president of berlin 's humboldt university , said he believes the election outcome will be challenged should dresdeners vote after the results in the rest of the country have already become public . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have two votes in an interview with bavarian public broadcaster br , meyer added that dresdeners should at least vote for a party on sunday .
in germany , each voter has two votes - one to elect a direct candidate for his or her constituency and another to choose a political party that then gets parliamentary seats according to the percentage of votes it achieves . one party that supports such a splitting of votes in dresden is germany 's new left party , which consists of the successor party to the former communist party of east germany and disgruntled social democrats from western germany . distorti n g results ? " that way we want to avoid distortions which would happen if dresdeners already know the result from the rest of the country , " hendrik thalheim , a party spokesman , told the newspaper die tageszeitu n g . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters of chancellor gerhard schröder might end up voting for the left party in dresden .
the left party fears that a late election in dresden could harm their chances to win a direct seat in dresden .
others believe , however , that a late vote might actually help the party as social democrats might tactically support the left party 's candidate to prevent an extra seat for the christian democrats , whose candidate is leading in the polls . the africa compariso n while local candidates for other parties also complained about the postponed election , officials at the national level said they did n't see this as a problem . " maybe it 's possible in africa to hold back election results for a couple of weeks , but you can not do that in germany , " dirk niebel , the fdp 's general secretary , said on the morning show of germany 's public broadcasters . other legal experts also said that there was nothing illegal about a late vote in dresden . " there 's no law that forbids this , " gottfried mahrenholz , a former constitutional court judge , told german public radio , deutschlandfunk .
late votes already took place in 1961 and 1965 after candidates died shortly before the election . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de election 2005 click here for dw-world 's complete election coverage .

but over the weekend , it was n't cellists and violinists at center stage , rather djs , breakdancers and beat boxers . at leipzig 's kohlrabizirkus venue , technicians were busy behind huge boards during sound check .
the bass and treble levels have to be perfectly balanced since the world 's best djs were about to go head to head during this first hop-hop championship . the hip hop world challenge , hosted by top german hip-hop star thomas d and the american mc freestyle , aimed to demonstrate germany 's openness to youth culture and artistic expression .
it was supported by the cultural fund of the german football federation , which is eager to show the country in the best possible light ahead of the 2006 fifa world cup , which will take place in germany next summer . still , that the fund 's committee would give the green light for a hip-hop competition was nonetheless a surprise to organizer norbert seiler , known to hip-hop fans as " parago . " " hip hop is an integral part of german youth culture today , " seiler told dw-world .
" everyone runs around in baggy pants , you can see it in the language , in the music .
so i told the committee , if you want to encourage culture - and the point of the cultural program is to show germany as a tolerant and artistically cosmopolitan host country - then the hip-hop fest ca n't be left out . " more than just music since its beginnings in the mid-eighties , hip-hop has developed from an underground subculture to an art form with three disciplines .
for the hip-hop world challenge , participants competed in break-dance , beat box , and dj skills . bildunterschrift : hip hop world challenge 2005 " break dancing is a kind of rhythmical floor acrobatics .
these are the kids that roll on their backs and pedal the air with their feet and stand on one hand , " seiler said .
" the djs play with records , scratching them and juggling the beats .
in beat box you make sounds and rhythms with your own voice , there 's no instruments allowed . " among the competitors at the hip hop world challenge was the belgian threesome pyro-man .
in perfect rhythmic and melodic harmony , the trio beat boxed effortlessly between styles .
pyro-man member jerome said beat boxing allowed him full artistic freedom . " beat box offers you all possible stylistic options ; you are n't restricted in any way .
pop , jungle , drum and bass , funk , punk : anything goes , " said jerome . scratching and juggling the beats the french dj pfel then took center stage .
with a look of intense concentration on his face , his hands fly over the vinyl spinning in front of him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hip hop culture emerged in the ‘ 80s in new york city he is no newcomer to the hip-hop scene , having competed in the dj world championships in 2003 and 2004 .
he came to leipzig to show off his stuff , but said the competition was sure to be stiff . " the jury looks at a lot of things .
you 've got to be musical and original .
you ca n't use a sound that 's been used a thousand times , " he said .
" then there 's the technical part .
you have to avoid goofing up with your hand work .

but over the weekend , it was n't cellists and violinists at center stage , rather djs , breakdancers and beat boxers . at leipzig 's kohlrabizirkus venue , technicians were busy behind huge boards during sound check .
the bass and treble levels have to be perfectly balanced since the world 's best djs were about to go head to head during this first hop-hop championship . the hip hop world challenge , hosted by top german hip-hop star thomas d and the american mc freestyle , aimed to demonstrate germany 's openness to youth culture and artistic expression .
it was supported by the cultural fund of the german football federation , which is eager to show the country in the best possible light ahead of the 2006 fifa world cup , which will take place in germany next summer . still , that the fund 's committee would give the green light for a hip-hop competition was nonetheless a surprise to organizer norbert seiler , known to hip-hop fans as " parago . " " hip hop is an integral part of german youth culture today , " seiler told dw-world .
" everyone runs around in baggy pants , you can see it in the language , in the music .
so i told the committee , if you want to encourage culture - and the point of the cultural program is to show germany as a tolerant and artistically cosmopolitan host country - then the hip-hop fest ca n't be left out . " more than just music since its beginnings in the mid-eighties , hip-hop has developed from an underground subculture to an art form with three disciplines .
for the hip-hop world challenge , participants competed in break-dance , beat box , and dj skills . bildunterschrift : hip hop world challenge 2005 " break dancing is a kind of rhythmical floor acrobatics .
these are the kids that roll on their backs and pedal the air with their feet and stand on one hand , " seiler said .
" the djs play with records , scratching them and juggling the beats .
in beat box you make sounds and rhythms with your own voice , there 's no instruments allowed . " among the competitors at the hip hop world challenge was the belgian threesome pyro-man .
in perfect rhythmic and melodic harmony , the trio beat boxed effortlessly between styles .
pyro-man member jerome said beat boxing allowed him full artistic freedom . " beat box offers you all possible stylistic options ; you are n't restricted in any way .
pop , jungle , drum and bass , funk , punk : anything goes , " said jerome . scratching and juggling the beats the french dj pfel then took center stage .
with a look of intense concentration on his face , his hands fly over the vinyl spinning in front of him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hip hop culture emerged in the ‘ 80s in new york city he is no newcomer to the hip-hop scene , having competed in the dj world championships in 2003 and 2004 .
he came to leipzig to show off his stuff , but said the competition was sure to be stiff . " the jury looks at a lot of things .
you 've got to be musical and original .
you ca n't use a sound that 's been used a thousand times , " he said .
" then there 's the technical part .
you have to avoid goofing up with your hand work .
finally there 's the show .
that means you have to communicate with the audience .

bbc news -pipe- have your say -pipe- are gp advanced bookings a problem ?
bbc news / have your say graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- monday , 12 september 2005 , 06:03 gmt 07:03 uk are gp advanced bookings a problem ?
are you unhappy with advanced access to gp services ?
a survey by the government watchdog , the healthcare commission , suggests that nearly a third of patients are unable to make an appointment to see their gp more than two days in advance .
the poll of 117,000 patients found the majority were happy with services , but some complained that government targets to see people within two days have led to surgeries restricting advance appointments .
tony blair pledged during the election campaign to investigate the problem .
what 's your reaction to the healthcare commission 's findings ?
do you think targets help or hinder ?
have you had difficulty making an advanced booking ?
send us your comments and experiences .
this debate is now closed .
please read a selection of your comments below .
the following comments reflect the balance of opinion received so far : " i wonder if they even realise how awkward this is for anyone who has a job ? "
m. g. , manchester , uk my gp wo n't do advance appointments at all .
you have to phone between 8:30am and 9am and ask for one on the day you want to go , which means , for me , having to phone in to work saying i 'll be late as i work 20 miles from where i live and until recently was reliant on once-an-hour train service to get there usually they just bark a time at you and you have to turn up , no matter how inconvenient it is .
when it 's routine stuff it would be nice to have even 24 hours notice so i can sort it out with the office rather than having to phone in at the last minute and possibly end up having to take half a day or more off .
then , it 's lucky if the appointment actually happens on time , i 've easily waited 30-60minutes nearly every time as they always run late !
i wonder if they even realise how awkward this is for anyone who has a job ?
m. g. , manchester , uk it happens at my local gp .
you are no longer allowed to book appointments in advance at a time convenient for you , you have to call in the morning to be seen later that day .
this means i have to take a day off work for non-essential appointments where previously i would have got a booking well in advance that did n't require time off .
so in a small way uk plc suffers .
i do n't blame my gp for this , though .
this perverse outcome is a classic example of what happens when the centre over-regulates and micro-manages .
john haywood , hampshire i do n't understand the problem - you need to see a doctor when you are ill - how can you know that you are going to be ill more than 2 days in advance ?
matt munro , bristol , uk " just be grateful that you have a high quality free health service " name here i ca n't believe some of the trivial whining on this board !
some people seem to believe that gps should prioritise appointments around people 's domestic and social responsibilities !
they do and should prioritise appointments on the basis of clinical need - just be grateful that you have a high quality free health service - most of the world do not and stop whining about having to make phone calls or having to take time off work -lrb- shock horror , how traumatic for you ! -rrb-
which is more important your health or your job ?
matt munro , bristol , uk i find it infuriating whenever i ask for an appointment to see my gp because i have to go through a barrage of questions which concludes with " do you work ? "
i find it ridiculous that i have to justify my working day just so that i might be lucky enough to get an appointment in 4 days time !
it 's insulting .
melanie philpott , torquay , devon " this problem could be solved immediately if patients were to act responsibly " e , malvern uk this problem could be solved immediately if patients were to act responsibly and only ask to see a doctor if they really need one .
i have been to a gp once in the last 22 years - and i do n't think of myself as particularly healthy .
if i have a minor health problem it will usually be something i can deal with myself , or it will just get better on its own .
pharmacists and the nhs direct service can also be helpful if you are not sure what to do .
leave gps to those who really need them - one day it could be you .
e , malvern uk 48 hours ?
during my last phone call to the gp i was told no appointments available for the next week !
simon taylor-smith , swindon until recently i was a practice manager .
the problem is that pcts and some gps have -lrb- sometimes deliberately -rrb- misinterpreted the target .
there is nothing in the guidelines that states a gp can not offer advanced booking .
these decisions are taken by the individual practice .
also patients sometimes have unreasonable expectations .
one patient arrived at the surgery at 08.45 and was offered an appointment at 09.30 the same morning and then complained that we did n't have anything sooner ! !
chris , london , uk think yourselves lucky you have got a doctor .
i needed a doctor for the first time in over 10 years and i was told that i " was n't in any surgery 's catchment area " so they 'd send me some forms to fill in , i could post them back and they 'd assign me to a local surgery ... by post , obviously .
i was better before i got any forms .
seemed like the best plan ! !
andy , london " we have had the 48 hour targets imposed on us , without asking patients or gps what they need or want ! "
nic , leeds uk i 'm a gp : this does not surprise me !
we have had the 48 hour targets imposed on us , without asking patients or gps what they need or want !
we are trying to offer some pre-bookables , but we still have to meet the 48 hour targets too !
more and more work is being moved from hospitals to primary care : without more doctors and nurses -lrb- i.e. more funding for staff -rrb- we can not hope to provide a decent service for everyone !
nic , leeds uk i think that being able to book on the day you need the appointment has been a good change .
many times i have needed to see the doctor as soon as possible that even waiting a day would be too long .
if i do have a problem which can wait a week then my surgery has no problems making an advance appointment for me -lrb- usually within a week -rrb- .
i do n't know how it works in other surgeries but this system definitely works for me and i hope it stays that way .
laura , london , uk the only people to have gained from the latest gp contract are the gp 's themselves who are paid a lot more for doing less .
they are manipulating the 48 hour rule to their own advantage and yet provide less for the patients .
make the slightest moan and they will de-register you .
chris stevens , london uk " i do n't try to go to a gp any more , i just go and sit in a & e and wait " steve , uk we now spend more per head than any other country on our health services ; we have had a vast increase in the number of gps , who are the highest paid in the world -lrb- all strange but true -rrb- and what do we hear ?
more money needed , more doctors , more ... more ... more ..
i do n't try to go to a gp any more , i just go and sit in a & e and wait .
steve , uk i never have a problem getting an appointment with the doctor .
what i do have a problem with is getting a proper diagnosis !
susan , london in bolton we have an nhs drop-in centre , you can go there if you ca n't get in to see your gp .
i recently had tonsillitis , could n't get in to see my gp until the next day , so went to the drop in centre .
i was seen within 30 minutes by a well qualified nurse .
also , i tend to see my practice nurse at my doctors surgery , she can do nearly everything my gp can and with hardly any waiting time .
victoria , bolton , lancs you ca n't blame the gps for this .
if it was n't for the idiotic targets that are being set by the government then this would n't be happening .
they have to remember that doctors will try to make the figures work for them , rather like this government will try to put a positive spin on bad news stories .
mark s , manchester , uk you ca n't book ahead at my doctors only on the same day , so there 's a mad rush first thing and you 've no chance if you ring after quarter to nine -lrb- they only open at 8:30 -rrb- jenna , wales this issue was raised in the ' leaders question time special ' shortly before the general election .
i remember an extremely sweaty mr blair being dumfounded by this , and he promised to sort it out - presumably it 's still going on if we are discussing it here today .
about time the government did something about it really !
they 've had four months since that programme and still no action - what a surprise ! !
steve , warrington , uk " call up on the morning and partake of the telephone lottery " ben bell , canterbury , kent , i can only make an appointment with my gp on that morning .
call up on the morning and partake of the telephone lottery to see if i can get an appointment , if not then better luck tomorrow .
no forward bookings at all .
unfortunately this means that i have to stay at home to call to see if i can get an appointment and be late for work whatever happens .
ben bell , canterbury , kent , england when i was in leeds there was an open surgery for 2 hours in the morning and an hour in the afternoon .
the rest of the time it was pre-booked appointments which were also easy to get .
surely it 's not that complicated ?
laura , aberdeen i rang my doctor today for a non-emergency appointment for my 13 year old son and was given one for 4.30 this afternoon .
i 've never ever had a problem getting an appointment , the doctors are excellent and the receptionists charming !
no , it 's not private and i 'm not telling you where it is or you 'll all join the practice !
i guess its just a lottery really .
lynn , hampshire " i am convinced that this is just a public relations exercise to make the health authorities look good " david endsor , stockport england i have recently just reached 50 and received a letter from my local primary care trust inviting me to go for a health check -lrb- part of the heart and stroke prevention campaign -rrb- these are given every 5 years .
on phoning my doctors practice to make an appointment i was told the nurses were very busy and short staffed due to holidays , i accepted there advice to ring back in 2 weeks .
i rang the surgery a couple of weeks later and this time was told the clinic was fully booked for 4 weeks and thereafter the program was finished .
i knew i was not going to get an appointment , but what was more annoying was i was also given similar excuses 5 years ago when asked to make an appointment then .
i am convinced that this is just a public relations exercise to make the health authorities look good .
david endsor , stockport england what short memories people have !
i remember - only a few years ago - when a routine doctor 's appointment would often have to be made 10-12 days in advance .
now i can see a doctor in 2 days .
there are some silly things in the current policies , but give credit where it is due , the nhs is now much more responsive than it used to be .
piers , surrey my view , i think supported by the other comments , is that this is a practice management problem .
i have always been able to make appointments up to 1 month in advance , and if i need to see a doctor urgently , i have always been able to within a day .
this is usually not my own doctor , but if it really is an emergency , what does that matter .
john , bristol , uk i live in scotland and have to book an appointment 1 week in advance to see my gp .
so lucky those down south who only have to book 3 days in advance .
i have complained to my gp 's practice manager verbally and in writing all to no avail .
the nhs is a joke .
flora , scotland i am a gps receptionist and i feel that patients do not realise that we do not make the rules .
if we do not have appointments to offer it is not our fault .
the surgery i work in does offer pre bookable appointments up to 2 weeks in advance , i think it is a much fairer system .
please do n't blame the receptionist , they are only doing a job of work like other people , and we do not deserve the publicity that we get .
es , leeds " if they can do it why ca n't others ? "
jean , wiltshire my doctor 's surgery not only has an appointment system but they also have at least one open surgery a day when you can go and wait and you will be seen .
it is not unusual to arrive at 8.15 in the morning and be at work by 9.a.m.
i also made an appointment 6 weeks in advance without any problem .
if they can do it why ca n't others ?
jean , wiltshire being fortunate not to have had to see my gp for over nine years .
i 'm horrified to read the comments of my fellow readers .
i 'm getting on a bit now and would be more likely to know that if i required a gp appointment or visit , i would get one before i expire .
john graham , edinburgh , scotland recently we took our son to the doctors - the doctor asked us to come back in 7 days .
his receptionist refused to make the booking so we could avoid school hours .
5 days later we spent 30 minutes on the phone trying to get through and then had no option but to take a school hours appointment .
simply ludicrous .
clive , woking " being seen when you are ill is what it 's all about " sharon , london my surgery offers a 48 hour advance booking service .
this works fantastically .
my doctor 's surgery has about 8 doctors available and you are guaranteed to get seen whilst you are still symptomatic .
people who complain about this kind of service are the type of people who complain at anything .
being seen when you are ill is what it 's all about and i thank and applaud the gp services around the country who work tirelessly to help their patients , despite the constant criticism sharon , london i 'd say so .
i had an infected cyst in my ear which needed treatment but i had to book an appointment at least 7 days in advance .
by the time it actually came round to my appointment , my cyst had cleared up , rendering the appointment pointless .
bob , brighton , uk my elderly father has a long term and serious health problem needs to visit the doctor every 2 weeks or so .
his doctor sees him and says make an appointment for a week friday .
impossible - the reception staff and presumably the practice manager will simply not do it .
the tail wagging the dog ?
wayne , harpenden , uk think yourselves most fortunate that you can see a doctor within a week , as in canada 4 weeks to 12 weeks to see your doctor is not uncommon .
mostly if you are in need , one has to go to emergency were one finds a room full of people waiting for the same thing .
we have had to accept that this is the way things are for now , as it is out of our control .
neither governments or doctors have much control over doctor shortages .
heather , canada we need more gps , but gp friends tell me how difficult -lrb- and expensive -rrb- it is to get into an established general practice .
it 's easier becoming a hospital doctor .
unless you 're obliged to see the doctor at his request , for routine vaccinations , baby checkups and screenings - we should all go private and have health insurance , as in the usa , or pay in advance and reclaim the costs later , as they do in france .
that system would soon winnow out the large numbers of people who clog up surgeries with no good reason .
at present , if we want to go private , we need a referral from our gp , which comes very low in the list of priorities , even though we are forced to ' bribe ' the gp with thirty pounds -lrb- there really is no other word for it -rrb- , just to write a letter .
it 's scandalous .
henry , ilford , essex " it 's clear that the government has n't got a clue about management " john b , uk the last time i needed an appointment with my doctor i was told i would have to wait a week , or call back in the morning .
so i took the next day off work , called at 830 and was seen at 1050 .
it 's clear that the government has n't got a clue about management , as it 's common knowledge that what is measured gets improved even if that is n't the desired effect .
john b , uk my local doctor surgery in wood green is a shambles .
if i call up - the usual waiting time is 4/5 days .
if it is urgent we are directed to the nearest hospital .
the surgery is run-down , under-staffed and the doctor i see there tells everyone to just go to a & e. totally unacceptable .
the nurse there also breached my patient confidentiality .
my last doctor in brixton was spotless , spacious and i could get in within 24 hours every time .
am trying very hard not to get ill so i do n't have to be messed around and insulted again .
jay , london i have been unable to book an appointment unless it 's two years from now !
in my job i am constantly on the phone and it 's proved impossible as you are on hold for 10 minutes waiting .
then you are given an after hours appointment anyway .
all you needed was to pick up your prescription .
why do i pay my taxes again ?
becks , kent i can get an appointment at the vet any time i want .
i have great difficulty getting to see the doctor .
the only difference is that there is a charge for seeing the vet .
tony , derby my gp surgery seems to operate this system without difficulty .
when my family needs to be seen , we get an appointment the same day .
when we make an advance appointment for routine stuff that is also easily accommodated .
in my opinion the problem is n't the policy , but how come some practices are applying it ?
zoe , tyne and wear i work for the nhs and i believe that this booking issue is something which needs to be resolved because it impacts on other services .
many people ca n't get that appointment with the doctor and so take themselves to a & e instead - because you have to be seen in a & e. this then reflects on the waiting times for a & e. walk in centres are a relatively new and unknown service which should , if properly implemented and advertised , help rectify this problem .
being given a target is a very reasonable way of trying to improve performance , however this should not be to the disadvantage of the patient .
advanced bookings should still be a main option , but with penalties for not attending / failing to cancel .
simon gilbert , forest hill , london when i can find a surgery taking on patients , i 'll let you know .
ken , london , uk i am sick of people on here saying doctor 's receptionists are rude and abrupt .
my wife is a receptionist and the number of patients who are rude to her both on the phone and in the surgery is disgusting .
i find if you speak nicely and calmly to people they reciprocate .
john , huddersfield , england our practice can make urgent appointments within 24 hours and will accept longer term bookings , however when i recently tried to make a non-urgent appointment i was offered a date 22 days later !
they criticise patients for missing appointments , however it is a regular occurrence that the doctors do n't arrive until well after the time of the first appointment that has been booked .
far worse however is the total lack of nhs dentistry , i am faced with a bill of nearly £ 1000 for essential treatment that i am forced to have privately because of a lack of nhs dentists who will take on new patients .
sally marshall , uk i find my local booking arrangements highly annoying .
the only time i have needed to see a doctor over the last 3 years is for my annual appointment to check my contraception .
i have tell my boss in advance that i may be at the doctors on a certain day and cross my fingers that i 'll get an appointment on that particular day when i phone up .
the receptionists are rude , abrupt and frankly , nosey .
although my gp is lovely and once i get past the gatekeepers i have no complaints !
i just wish there was a service where you could book two weeks in advance for routine appointments .
it would make life so much easier for us workers !
anon , thornton " why are we penalised in this way ? "
pamela abbott , harlow , essex i find the system of not being able to book in advance the most frustrating system ever .
it is not user friendly and would like it changed as urgently as possible .
i understand that some people need to see their gps within 48 hours , but there are usually emergency slots held for these situations .
if you do try to book an appointment , but do n't manage to telephone first thing , then the 48 hour slots go and you have to wait another day - very unsatisfactory !
why are we penalised in this way ?
pamela abbott , harlow , essex as a gp , i have found the 48-hour target to be a ludicrously simplistic idea ; we offer a range of appointments , but find it hard to keep waiting times down and having to keep appointments free ' just in case ' does result in us having quiet days when demand is slack - then everyone rings in the next day !
the government were told at the outset that this was a poor idea .
the underlying problem is that too many appointments are wanted , and insufficient gp 's exist .
the fact that around 10 % of booked appointments are missed makes this worse .
mark williams , grays essex we do not have a problem with nhs but can not find a dentist who will treat me .
our only choice is to go private which we can not afford .
my wife has recently undergone cancer treatment which increases her risk of tooth decay !
david gilbert , rawtenstall , lancashire , uk last week i telephoned my medical centre and requested an routine appointment to see either of the two doctors i normally see and they said the first appointment would be 18 days time .
robert t dicken , stockton-on-teeside , england why does n't the government stop imposing ridiculous targets and strategies on gps and let them get on with what they trained for ?
if they did n't have quite so many bits of paper to fill in justifying every one of their actions then they 'd have time to see a lot more patients .
vicky , manchester my doctor 's surgery offers a triage system .
we can talk to a doctor on the phone within an hour who assesses whether or not we need to see someone that day .
short term appointments are not a problem and if you have a regular appointment with the same doctor about a continuing health problem then the doctor can make appointments that override the two week barrier .
the surgery is organised , efficient and has few complaints .
cecilia weightman , bristol , england i have never been able to get an appointment with my gp within 48 hours !
i usually have to wait for 2 - 3 weeks -lrb- i 'm not exaggerating -rrb- .
this means that if i have something that needs urgent attention i have to go to a walk-in centre .
the system really needs to change - it 's a nightmare !
caroline hunter , london i 'm a student and at my gps students are not allowed to make an appointment with a doctor .
we are forced to attend surgeries held by nurses a couple of times a week without an appointment and only get to see a doctor if the nurse thinks it is necessary .
this was even true when i rang up after having visited a & e after an asthma attack and thy had told me to visit the doctor the next day , as well as not being allowed to make an appointment there was no student surgery that day either .
students it sometimes seems are second class citizens not entitled to proper healthcare .
ben hartley , newcastle upon tyne , england although i can see the need for a 2 day response , there are also a significant number of people whose issue is not urgent and need to arrange time off work to see the doctor .
unless they can book an appointment a week in advance they will be unable to obtain the medical help they may need .
robert aleck , london , england when we first moved into the area you could book appointments in advance , then it all changed and you now have to phone the surgery on the day that you want to see the doctor .
this is not very helpful when you have to arrange time off work especially when you have to go for regular check ups .
ruth , widnes , cheshire i find the present gp appointments system much more agreeable than previously , when unless you went to an emergency surgery , you would have to wait at least a week to see a doctor .
now , you can call in the morning and see a doctor that very day .
there are many ailments that would not warrant " emergency status " but that ca n't wait a week to be sorted , and the 48 hour system is the most effective way to deal with these .
i appreciate , however , that the present system does restrict advanced bookings .
liz , bristol , england access to a gp is a lottery .
can not book an appointment until the day you require it .
no calls allowed before 8am then you end up in a queuing system .
standards when you finally get to see your doctor is excellent .
james wilson , irvine , scotland " the country is 10,000 gps short " nigel madagan , uk i am a gp .
i physically can not provide more appointments than i do .
the government can set as many targets as it likes and change the " rules " regarding access however the problem is lack of appointments and the only way to provide more appointments is to provide more gp 's .
the country is 10,000 gps short -lrb- a problem the government has known about for years -rrb- and it is difficult or impossible to recruit new partners or locum doctors to stand in when i can not be in the surgery .
nigel madagan , uk i can never get an appointment with my gp .
you have to phone on the day that you want an appointment .
i always phone at 8.30 -lrb- as soon as they open -rrb- and the phones lines are either engaged or ring off .
when you finally get to speak to someone they say there are no appointments for the day .
the receptionists are always rude and abrupt .
when i do actually get to see my gp the service is excellent , however , it is a frustrating process and i am seriously considering changing surgeries .
laura , oxford to see the more popular doctors you have to wait at least a week at my health centre , but you can usually see the less popular ones within 48 hours even if it does mean going through the triage nurse first -lrb- a process that really annoys me ! -rrb- .
when i asked why it took so long to get an appointment i was told we had n't enough doctors to cope with the new housing that has gone up in the last few years .
i note that my taxes and contributions have not been altered to reflect this problem !

are you unhappy with advanced access to gp services ?
a survey by the government watchdog , the healthcare commission , suggests that nearly a third of patients are unable to make an appointment to see their gp more than two days in advance .
the poll of 117,000 patients found the majority were happy with services , but some complained that government targets to see people within two days have led to surgeries restricting advance appointments .
tony blair pledged during the election campaign to investigate the problem .
what 's your reaction to the healthcare commission 's findings ?
do you think targets help or hinder ?
have you had difficulty making an advanced booking ?

this debate is now closed .
please read a selection of your comments below .
the following comments reflect the balance of opinion received so far : i wonder if they even realise how awkward this is for anyone who has a job ?
m. g. , manchester , uk my gp wo n't do advance appointments at all .
you have to phone between 8:30am and 9am and ask for one on the day you want to go , which means , for me , having to phone in to work saying i 'll be late as i work 20 miles from where i live and until recently was reliant on once-an-hour train service to get there usually they just bark a time at you and you have to turn up , no matter how inconvenient it is .
when it 's routine stuff it would be nice to have even 24 hours notice so i can sort it out with the office rather than having to phone in at the last minute and possibly end up having to take half a day or more off .
then , it 's lucky if the appointment actually happens on time , i 've easily waited 30-60minutes nearly every time as they always run late !
i wonder if they even realise how awkward this is for anyone who has a job ?
m. g. , manchester , uk it happens at my local gp .
you are no longer allowed to book appointments in advance at a time convenient for you , you have to call in the morning to be seen later that day .
this means i have to take a day off work for non-essential appointments where previously i would have got a booking well in advance that did n't require time off .
so in a small way uk plc suffers .
i do n't blame my gp for this , though .
this perverse outcome is a classic example of what happens when the centre over-regulates and micro-manages .
john haywood , hampshire i do n't understand the problem - you need to see a doctor when you are ill - how can you know that you are going to be ill more than 2 days in advance ?
matt munro , bristol , uk just be grateful that you have a high quality free health service name here i ca n't believe some of the trivial whining on this board !
some people seem to believe that gps should prioritise appointments around people 's domestic and social responsibilities !
they do and should prioritise appointments on the basis of clinical need - just be grateful that you have a high quality free health service - most of the world do not and stop whining about having to make phone calls or having to take time off work -lrb- shock horror , how traumatic for you ! -rrb-
which is more important your health or your job ?
matt munro , bristol , uk i find it infuriating whenever i ask for an appointment to see my gp because i have to go through a barrage of questions which concludes with " do you work ? "
i find it ridiculous that i have to justify my working day just so that i might be lucky enough to get an appointment in 4 days time !
it 's insulting .
melanie philpott , torquay , devon this problem could be solved immediately if patients were to act responsibly e , malvern uk this problem could be solved immediately if patients were to act responsibly and only ask to see a doctor if they really need one .
i have been to a gp once in the last 22 years - and i do n't think of myself as particularly healthy .
if i have a minor health problem it will usually be something i can deal with myself , or it will just get better on its own .
pharmacists and the nhs direct service can also be helpful if you are not sure what to do .
leave gps to those who really need them - one day it could be you .
e , malvern uk 48 hours ?
during my last phone call to the gp i was told no appointments available for the next week !
simon taylor-smith , swindon until recently i was a practice manager .
the problem is that pcts and some gps have -lrb- sometimes deliberately -rrb- misinterpreted the target .
there is nothing in the guidelines that states a gp can not offer advanced booking .
these decisions are taken by the individual practice .
also patients sometimes have unreasonable expectations .
one patient arrived at the surgery at 08.45 and was offered an appointment at 09.30 the same morning and then complained that we did n't have anything sooner ! !
chris , london , uk think yourselves lucky you have got a doctor .
i needed a doctor for the first time in over 10 years and i was told that i " was n't in any surgery 's catchment area " so they 'd send me some forms to fill in , i could post them back and they 'd assign me to a local surgery ... by post , obviously .
i was better before i got any forms .
seemed like the best plan ! !
andy , london we have had the 48 hour targets imposed on us , without asking patients or gps what they need or want !
nic , leeds uk i 'm a gp : this does not surprise me !
we have had the 48 hour targets imposed on us , without asking patients or gps what they need or want !
we are trying to offer some pre-bookables , but we still have to meet the 48 hour targets too !
more and more work is being moved from hospitals to primary care : without more doctors and nurses -lrb- i.e. more funding for staff -rrb- we can not hope to provide a decent service for everyone !
nic , leeds uk i think that being able to book on the day you need the appointment has been a good change .
many times i have needed to see the doctor as soon as possible that even waiting a day would be too long .
if i do have a problem which can wait a week then my surgery has no problems making an advance appointment for me -lrb- usually within a week -rrb- .
i do n't know how it works in other surgeries but this system definitely works for me and i hope it stays that way .
laura , london , uk the only people to have gained from the latest gp contract are the gp 's themselves who are paid a lot more for doing less .
they are manipulating the 48 hour rule to their own advantage and yet provide less for the patients .
make the slightest moan and they will de-register you .
chris stevens , london uk i do n't try to go to a gp any more , i just go and sit in a & e and wait steve , uk we now spend more per head than any other country on our health services ; we have had a vast increase in the number of gps , who are the highest paid in the world -lrb- all strange but true -rrb- and what do we hear ?
more money needed , more doctors , more ... more ... more ..
i do n't try to go to a gp any more , i just go and sit in a & e and wait .
steve , uk i never have a problem getting an appointment with the doctor .
what i do have a problem with is getting a proper diagnosis !
susan , london in bolton we have an nhs drop-in centre , you can go there if you ca n't get in to see your gp .
i recently had tonsillitis , could n't get in to see my gp until the next day , so went to the drop in centre .
i was seen within 30 minutes by a well qualified nurse .
also , i tend to see my practice nurse at my doctors surgery , she can do nearly everything my gp can and with hardly any waiting time .
victoria , bolton , lancs you ca n't blame the gps for this .
if it was n't for the idiotic targets that are being set by the government then this would n't be happening .
they have to remember that doctors will try to make the figures work for them , rather like this government will try to put a positive spin on bad news stories .
mark s , manchester , uk you ca n't book ahead at my doctors only on the same day , so there 's a mad rush first thing and you 've no chance if you ring after quarter to nine -lrb- they only open at 8:30 -rrb- jenna , wales this issue was raised in the ' leaders question time special ' shortly before the general election .
i remember an extremely sweaty mr blair being dumfounded by this , and he promised to sort it out - presumably it 's still going on if we are discussing it here today .
about time the government did something about it really !
they 've had four months since that programme and still no action - what a surprise ! !
steve , warrington , uk call up on the morning and partake of the telephone lottery ben bell , canterbury , kent , i can only make an appointment with my gp on that morning .
call up on the morning and partake of the telephone lottery to see if i can get an appointment , if not then better luck tomorrow .
no forward bookings at all .
unfortunately this means that i have to stay at home to call to see if i can get an appointment and be late for work whatever happens .
ben bell , canterbury , kent , england when i was in leeds there was an open surgery for 2 hours in the morning and an hour in the afternoon .
the rest of the time it was pre-booked appointments which were also easy to get .
surely it 's not that complicated ?
laura , aberdeen i rang my doctor today for a non-emergency appointment for my 13 year old son and was given one for 4.30 this afternoon .
i 've never ever had a problem getting an appointment , the doctors are excellent and the receptionists charming !
no , it 's not private and i 'm not telling you where it is or you 'll all join the practice !
i guess its just a lottery really .
lynn , hampshire i am convinced that this is just a public relations exercise to make the health authorities look good david endsor , stockport england i have recently just reached 50 and received a letter from my local primary care trust inviting me to go for a health check -lrb- part of the heart and stroke prevention campaign -rrb- these are given every 5 years .
on phoning my doctors practice to make an appointment i was told the nurses were very busy and short staffed due to holidays , i accepted there advice to ring back in 2 weeks .
i rang the surgery a couple of weeks later and this time was told the clinic was fully booked for 4 weeks and thereafter the program was finished .
i knew i was not going to get an appointment , but what was more annoying was i was also given similar excuses 5 years ago when asked to make an appointment then .
i am convinced that this is just a public relations exercise to make the health authorities look good .
david endsor , stockport england what short memories people have !
i remember - only a few years ago - when a routine doctor 's appointment would often have to be made 10-12 days in advance .
now i can see a doctor in 2 days .
there are some silly things in the current policies , but give credit where it is due , the nhs is now much more responsive than it used to be .
piers , surrey my view , i think supported by the other comments , is that this is a practice management problem .
i have always been able to make appointments up to 1 month in advance , and if i need to see a doctor urgently , i have always been able to within a day .
this is usually not my own doctor , but if it really is an emergency , what does that matter .
john , bristol , uk i live in scotland and have to book an appointment 1 week in advance to see my gp .
so lucky those down south who only have to book 3 days in advance .
i have complained to my gp 's practice manager verbally and in writing all to no avail .
the nhs is a joke .
flora , scotland i am a gps receptionist and i feel that patients do not realise that we do not make the rules .
if we do not have appointments to offer it is not our fault .
the surgery i work in does offer pre bookable appointments up to 2 weeks in advance , i think it is a much fairer system .
please do n't blame the receptionist , they are only doing a job of work like other people , and we do not deserve the publicity that we get .
es , leeds if they can do it why ca n't others ?
jean , wiltshire my doctor 's surgery not only has an appointment system but they also have at least one open surgery a day when you can go and wait and you will be seen .
it is not unusual to arrive at 8.15 in the morning and be at work by 9.a.m.
i also made an appointment 6 weeks in advance without any problem .
if they can do it why ca n't others ?
jean , wiltshire being fortunate not to have had to see my gp for over nine years .
i 'm horrified to read the comments of my fellow readers .
i 'm getting on a bit now and would be more likely to know that if i required a gp appointment or visit , i would get one before i expire .
john graham , edinburgh , scotland recently we took our son to the doctors - the doctor asked us to come back in 7 days .
his receptionist refused to make the booking so we could avoid school hours .
5 days later we spent 30 minutes on the phone trying to get through and then had no option but to take a school hours appointment .
simply ludicrous .
clive , woking being seen when you are ill is what it 's all about sharon , london my surgery offers a 48 hour advance booking service .
this works fantastically .
my doctor 's surgery has about 8 doctors available and you are guaranteed to get seen whilst you are still symptomatic .
people who complain about this kind of service are the type of people who complain at anything .
being seen when you are ill is what it 's all about and i thank and applaud the gp services around the country who work tirelessly to help their patients , despite the constant criticism sharon , london i 'd say so .
i had an infected cyst in my ear which needed treatment but i had to book an appointment at least 7 days in advance .
by the time it actually came round to my appointment , my cyst had cleared up , rendering the appointment pointless .
bob , brighton , uk my elderly father has a long term and serious health problem needs to visit the doctor every 2 weeks or so .
his doctor sees him and says make an appointment for a week friday .
impossible - the reception staff and presumably the practice manager will simply not do it .
the tail wagging the dog ?
wayne , harpenden , uk think yourselves most fortunate that you can see a doctor within a week , as in canada 4 weeks to 12 weeks to see your doctor is not uncommon .
mostly if you are in need , one has to go to emergency were one finds a room full of people waiting for the same thing .
we have had to accept that this is the way things are for now , as it is out of our control .
neither governments or doctors have much control over doctor shortages .
heather , canada we need more gps , but gp friends tell me how difficult -lrb- and expensive -rrb- it is to get into an established general practice .
it 's easier becoming a hospital doctor .
unless you 're obliged to see the doctor at his request , for routine vaccinations , baby checkups and screenings - we should all go private and have health insurance , as in the usa , or pay in advance and reclaim the costs later , as they do in france .
that system would soon winnow out the large numbers of people who clog up surgeries with no good reason .
at present , if we want to go private , we need a referral from our gp , which comes very low in the list of priorities , even though we are forced to ' bribe ' the gp with thirty pounds -lrb- there really is no other word for it -rrb- , just to write a letter .
it 's scandalous .
henry , ilford , essex it 's clear that the government has n't got a clue about management john b , uk the last time i needed an appointment with my doctor i was told i would have to wait a week , or call back in the morning .
so i took the next day off work , called at 830 and was seen at 1050 .
it 's clear that the government has n't got a clue about management , as it 's common knowledge that what is measured gets improved even if that is n't the desired effect .
john b , uk my local doctor surgery in wood green is a shambles .
if i call up - the usual waiting time is 4/5 days .
if it is urgent we are directed to the nearest hospital .
the surgery is run-down , under-staffed and the doctor i see there tells everyone to just go to a & e. totally unacceptable .
the nurse there also breached my patient confidentiality .
my last doctor in brixton was spotless , spacious and i could get in within 24 hours every time .
am trying very hard not to get ill so i do n't have to be messed around and insulted again .
jay , london i have been unable to book an appointment unless it 's two years from now !
in my job i am constantly on the phone and it 's proved impossible as you are on hold for 10 minutes waiting .
then you are given an after hours appointment anyway .
all you needed was to pick up your prescription .
why do i pay my taxes again ?
becks , kent i can get an appointment at the vet any time i want .
i have great difficulty getting to see the doctor .
the only difference is that there is a charge for seeing the vet .
tony , derby my gp surgery seems to operate this system without difficulty .
when my family needs to be seen , we get an appointment the same day .
when we make an advance appointment for routine stuff that is also easily accommodated .
in my opinion the problem is n't the policy , but how come some practices are applying it ?
zoe , tyne and wear i work for the nhs and i believe that this booking issue is something which needs to be resolved because it impacts on other services .
many people ca n't get that appointment with the doctor and so take themselves to a & e instead - because you have to be seen in a & e. this then reflects on the waiting times for a & e. walk in centres are a relatively new and unknown service which should , if properly implemented and advertised , help rectify this problem .
being given a target is a very reasonable way of trying to improve performance , however this should not be to the disadvantage of the patient .
advanced bookings should still be a main option , but with penalties for not attending / failing to cancel .
simon gilbert , forest hill , london when i can find a surgery taking on patients , i 'll let you know .
ken , london , uk i am sick of people on here saying doctor 's receptionists are rude and abrupt .
my wife is a receptionist and the number of patients who are rude to her both on the phone and in the surgery is disgusting .
i find if you speak nicely and calmly to people they reciprocate .
john , huddersfield , england our practice can make urgent appointments within 24 hours and will accept longer term bookings , however when i recently tried to make a non-urgent appointment i was offered a date 22 days later !
they criticise patients for missing appointments , however it is a regular occurrence that the doctors do n't arrive until well after the time of the first appointment that has been booked .
far worse however is the total lack of nhs dentistry , i am faced with a bill of nearly £ 1000 for essential treatment that i am forced to have privately because of a lack of nhs dentists who will take on new patients .
sally marshall , uk i find my local booking arrangements highly annoying .
the only time i have needed to see a doctor over the last 3 years is for my annual appointment to check my contraception .
i have tell my boss in advance that i may be at the doctors on a certain day and cross my fingers that i 'll get an appointment on that particular day when i phone up .
the receptionists are rude , abrupt and frankly , nosey .
although my gp is lovely and once i get past the gatekeepers i have no complaints !
i just wish there was a service where you could book two weeks in advance for routine appointments .
it would make life so much easier for us workers !
anon , thornton why are we penalised in this way ?
pamela abbott , harlow , essex i find the system of not being able to book in advance the most frustrating system ever .
it is not user friendly and would like it changed as urgently as possible .
i understand that some people need to see their gps within 48 hours , but there are usually emergency slots held for these situations .
if you do try to book an appointment , but do n't manage to telephone first thing , then the 48 hour slots go and you have to wait another day - very unsatisfactory !
why are we penalised in this way ?
pamela abbott , harlow , essex as a gp , i have found the 48-hour target to be a ludicrously simplistic idea ; we offer a range of appointments , but find it hard to keep waiting times down and having to keep appointments free ' just in case ' does result in us having quiet days when demand is slack - then everyone rings in the next day !
the government were told at the outset that this was a poor idea .
the underlying problem is that too many appointments are wanted , and insufficient gp 's exist .
the fact that around 10 % of booked appointments are missed makes this worse .
mark williams , grays essex we do not have a problem with nhs but can not find a dentist who will treat me .
our only choice is to go private which we can not afford .
my wife has recently undergone cancer treatment which increases her risk of tooth decay !
david gilbert , rawtenstall , lancashire , uk last week i telephoned my medical centre and requested an routine appointment to see either of the two doctors i normally see and they said the first appointment would be 18 days time .
robert t dicken , stockton-on-teeside , england why does n't the government stop imposing ridiculous targets and strategies on gps and let them get on with what they trained for ?
if they did n't have quite so many bits of paper to fill in justifying every one of their actions then they 'd have time to see a lot more patients .
vicky , manchester my doctor 's surgery offers a triage system .
we can talk to a doctor on the phone within an hour who assesses whether or not we need to see someone that day .
short term appointments are not a problem and if you have a regular appointment with the same doctor about a continuing health problem then the doctor can make appointments that override the two week barrier .
the surgery is organised , efficient and has few complaints .
cecilia weightman , bristol , england i have never been able to get an appointment with my gp within 48 hours !
i usually have to wait for 2 - 3 weeks -lrb- i 'm not exaggerating -rrb- .
this means that if i have something that needs urgent attention i have to go to a walk-in centre .
the system really needs to change - it 's a nightmare !
caroline hunter , london i 'm a student and at my gps students are not allowed to make an appointment with a doctor .
we are forced to attend surgeries held by nurses a couple of times a week without an appointment and only get to see a doctor if the nurse thinks it is necessary .
this was even true when i rang up after having visited a & e after an asthma attack and thy had told me to visit the doctor the next day , as well as not being allowed to make an appointment there was no student surgery that day either .
students it sometimes seems are second class citizens not entitled to proper healthcare .
ben hartley , newcastle upon tyne , england although i can see the need for a 2 day response , there are also a significant number of people whose issue is not urgent and need to arrange time off work to see the doctor .
unless they can book an appointment a week in advance they will be unable to obtain the medical help they may need .
robert aleck , london , england when we first moved into the area you could book appointments in advance , then it all changed and you now have to phone the surgery on the day that you want to see the doctor .
this is not very helpful when you have to arrange time off work especially when you have to go for regular check ups .
ruth , widnes , cheshire i find the present gp appointments system much more agreeable than previously , when unless you went to an emergency surgery , you would have to wait at least a week to see a doctor .
now , you can call in the morning and see a doctor that very day .
there are many ailments that would not warrant " emergency status " but that ca n't wait a week to be sorted , and the 48 hour system is the most effective way to deal with these .
i appreciate , however , that the present system does restrict advanced bookings .
liz , bristol , england access to a gp is a lottery .
can not book an appointment until the day you require it .
no calls allowed before 8am then you end up in a queuing system .
standards when you finally get to see your doctor is excellent .
james wilson , irvine , scotland the country is 10,000 gps short nigel madagan , uk i am a gp .
i physically can not provide more appointments than i do .
the government can set as many targets as it likes and change the " rules " regarding access however the problem is lack of appointments and the only way to provide more appointments is to provide more gp 's .
the country is 10,000 gps short -lrb- a problem the government has known about for years -rrb- and it is difficult or impossible to recruit new partners or locum doctors to stand in when i can not be in the surgery .
nigel madagan , uk i can never get an appointment with my gp .
you have to phone on the day that you want an appointment .
i always phone at 8.30 -lrb- as soon as they open -rrb- and the phones lines are either engaged or ring off .
when you finally get to speak to someone they say there are no appointments for the day .
the receptionists are always rude and abrupt .
when i do actually get to see my gp the service is excellent , however , it is a frustrating process and i am seriously considering changing surgeries .
laura , oxford to see the more popular doctors you have to wait at least a week at my health centre , but you can usually see the less popular ones within 48 hours even if it does mean going through the triage nurse first -lrb- a process that really annoys me ! -rrb- .
when i asked why it took so long to get an appointment i was told we had n't enough doctors to cope with the new housing that has gone up in the last few years .
i note that my taxes and contributions have not been altered to reflect this problem !

i find it ridiculous that i have to justify my working day just so that i might be lucky enough to get an appointment in 4 days time !
it 's insulting .
melanie philpott , torquay , devon this problem could be solved immediately if patients were to act responsibly e , malvern uk this problem could be solved immediately if patients were to act responsibly and only ask to see a doctor if they really need one .
i have been to a gp once in the last 22 years - and i do n't think of myself as particularly healthy .
if i have a minor health problem it will usually be something i can deal with myself , or it will just get better on its own .
pharmacists and the nhs direct service can also be helpful if you are not sure what to do .
leave gps to those who really need them - one day it could be you .
e , malvern uk 48 hours ?
during my last phone call to the gp i was told no appointments available for the next week !
simon taylor-smith , swindon until recently i was a practice manager .
the problem is that pcts and some gps have -lrb- sometimes deliberately -rrb- misinterpreted the target .
there is nothing in the guidelines that states a gp can not offer advanced booking .
these decisions are taken by the individual practice .
also patients sometimes have unreasonable expectations .
one patient arrived at the surgery at 08.45 and was offered an appointment at 09.30 the same morning and then complained that we did n't have anything sooner ! !
chris , london , uk think yourselves lucky you have got a doctor .
i needed a doctor for the first time in over 10 years and i was told that i " was n't in any surgery 's catchment area " so they 'd send me some forms to fill in , i could post them back and they 'd assign me to a local surgery ... by post , obviously .
i was better before i got any forms .
seemed like the best plan ! !
andy , london we have had the 48 hour targets imposed on us , without asking patients or gps what they need or want !
nic , leeds uk i 'm a gp : this does not surprise me !
we have had the 48 hour targets imposed on us , without asking patients or gps what they need or want !
we are trying to offer some pre-bookables , but we still have to meet the 48 hour targets too !
more and more work is being moved from hospitals to primary care : without more doctors and nurses -lrb- i.e. more funding for staff -rrb- we can not hope to provide a decent service for everyone !
nic , leeds uk i think that being able to book on the day you need the appointment has been a good change .
many times i have needed to see the doctor as soon as possible that even waiting a day would be too long .
if i do have a problem which can wait a week then my surgery has no problems making an advance appointment for me -lrb- usually within a week -rrb- .
i do n't know how it works in other surgeries but this system definitely works for me and i hope it stays that way .
laura , london , uk the only people to have gained from the latest gp contract are the gp 's themselves who are paid a lot more for doing less .
they are manipulating the 48 hour rule to their own advantage and yet provide less for the patients .
make the slightest moan and they will de-register you .
chris stevens , london uk i do n't try to go to a gp any more , i just go and sit in a & e and wait steve , uk we now spend more per head than any other country on our health services ; we have had a vast increase in the number of gps , who are the highest paid in the world -lrb- all strange but true -rrb- and what do we hear ?
more money needed , more doctors , more ... more ... more ..
i do n't try to go to a gp any more , i just go and sit in a & e and wait .
steve , uk i never have a problem getting an appointment with the doctor .
what i do have a problem with is getting a proper diagnosis !
susan , london in bolton we have an nhs drop-in centre , you can go there if you ca n't get in to see your gp .
i recently had tonsillitis , could n't get in to see my gp until the next day , so went to the drop in centre .
i was seen within 30 minutes by a well qualified nurse .
also , i tend to see my practice nurse at my doctors surgery , she can do nearly everything my gp can and with hardly any waiting time .
victoria , bolton , lancs you ca n't blame the gps for this .
if it was n't for the idiotic targets that are being set by the government then this would n't be happening .
they have to remember that doctors will try to make the figures work for them , rather like this government will try to put a positive spin on bad news stories .
mark s , manchester , uk you ca n't book ahead at my doctors only on the same day , so there 's a mad rush first thing and you 've no chance if you ring after quarter to nine -lrb- they only open at 8:30 -rrb- jenna , wales this issue was raised in the ' leaders question time special ' shortly before the general election .
i remember an extremely sweaty mr blair being dumfounded by this , and he promised to sort it out - presumably it 's still going on if we are discussing it here today .
about time the government did something about it really !
they 've had four months since that programme and still no action - what a surprise ! !
steve , warrington , uk call up on the morning and partake of the telephone lottery ben bell , canterbury , kent , i can only make an appointment with my gp on that morning .
call up on the morning and partake of the telephone lottery to see if i can get an appointment , if not then better luck tomorrow .
no forward bookings at all .
unfortunately this means that i have to stay at home to call to see if i can get an appointment and be late for work whatever happens .
ben bell , canterbury , kent , england when i was in leeds there was an open surgery for 2 hours in the morning and an hour in the afternoon .
the rest of the time it was pre-booked appointments which were also easy to get .
surely it 's not that complicated ?
laura , aberdeen i rang my doctor today for a non-emergency appointment for my 13 year old son and was given one for 4.30 this afternoon .
i 've never ever had a problem getting an appointment , the doctors are excellent and the receptionists charming !
no , it 's not private and i 'm not telling you where it is or you 'll all join the practice !
i guess its just a lottery really .
lynn , hampshire i am convinced that this is just a public relations exercise to make the health authorities look good david endsor , stockport england i have recently just reached 50 and received a letter from my local primary care trust inviting me to go for a health check -lrb- part of the heart and stroke prevention campaign -rrb- these are given every 5 years .
on phoning my doctors practice to make an appointment i was told the nurses were very busy and short staffed due to holidays , i accepted there advice to ring back in 2 weeks .
i rang the surgery a couple of weeks later and this time was told the clinic was fully booked for 4 weeks and thereafter the program was finished .
i knew i was not going to get an appointment , but what was more annoying was i was also given similar excuses 5 years ago when asked to make an appointment then .
i am convinced that this is just a public relations exercise to make the health authorities look good .
david endsor , stockport england what short memories people have !
i remember - only a few years ago - when a routine doctor 's appointment would often have to be made 10-12 days in advance .
now i can see a doctor in 2 days .
there are some silly things in the current policies , but give credit where it is due , the nhs is now much more responsive than it used to be .
piers , surrey my view , i think supported by the other comments , is that this is a practice management problem .
i have always been able to make appointments up to 1 month in advance , and if i need to see a doctor urgently , i have always been able to within a day .
this is usually not my own doctor , but if it really is an emergency , what does that matter .
john , bristol , uk i live in scotland and have to book an appointment 1 week in advance to see my gp .
so lucky those down south who only have to book 3 days in advance .
i have complained to my gp 's practice manager verbally and in writing all to no avail .
the nhs is a joke .
flora , scotland i am a gps receptionist and i feel that patients do not realise that we do not make the rules .
if we do not have appointments to offer it is not our fault .
the surgery i work in does offer pre bookable appointments up to 2 weeks in advance , i think it is a much fairer system .
please do n't blame the receptionist , they are only doing a job of work like other people , and we do not deserve the publicity that we get .
es , leeds if they can do it why ca n't others ?
jean , wiltshire my doctor 's surgery not only has an appointment system but they also have at least one open surgery a day when you can go and wait and you will be seen .
it is not unusual to arrive at 8.15 in the morning and be at work by 9.a.m.
i also made an appointment 6 weeks in advance without any problem .
if they can do it why ca n't others ?
jean , wiltshire being fortunate not to have had to see my gp for over nine years .
i 'm horrified to read the comments of my fellow readers .
i 'm getting on a bit now and would be more likely to know that if i required a gp appointment or visit , i would get one before i expire .
john graham , edinburgh , scotland recently we took our son to the doctors - the doctor asked us to come back in 7 days .
his receptionist refused to make the booking so we could avoid school hours .
5 days later we spent 30 minutes on the phone trying to get through and then had no option but to take a school hours appointment .
simply ludicrous .
clive , woking being seen when you are ill is what it 's all about sharon , london my surgery offers a 48 hour advance booking service .
this works fantastically .
my doctor 's surgery has about 8 doctors available and you are guaranteed to get seen whilst you are still symptomatic .
people who complain about this kind of service are the type of people who complain at anything .
being seen when you are ill is what it 's all about and i thank and applaud the gp services around the country who work tirelessly to help their patients , despite the constant criticism sharon , london i 'd say so .
i had an infected cyst in my ear which needed treatment but i had to book an appointment at least 7 days in advance .
by the time it actually came round to my appointment , my cyst had cleared up , rendering the appointment pointless .
bob , brighton , uk my elderly father has a long term and serious health problem needs to visit the doctor every 2 weeks or so .
his doctor sees him and says make an appointment for a week friday .
impossible - the reception staff and presumably the practice manager will simply not do it .
the tail wagging the dog ?
wayne , harpenden , uk think yourselves most fortunate that you can see a doctor within a week , as in canada 4 weeks to 12 weeks to see your doctor is not uncommon .
mostly if you are in need , one has to go to emergency were one finds a room full of people waiting for the same thing .
we have had to accept that this is the way things are for now , as it is out of our control .
neither governments or doctors have much control over doctor shortages .
heather , canada we need more gps , but gp friends tell me how difficult -lrb- and expensive -rrb- it is to get into an established general practice .
it 's easier becoming a hospital doctor .
unless you 're obliged to see the doctor at his request , for routine vaccinations , baby checkups and screenings - we should all go private and have health insurance , as in the usa , or pay in advance and reclaim the costs later , as they do in france .
that system would soon winnow out the large numbers of people who clog up surgeries with no good reason .
at present , if we want to go private , we need a referral from our gp , which comes very low in the list of priorities , even though we are forced to ' bribe ' the gp with thirty pounds -lrb- there really is no other word for it -rrb- , just to write a letter .
it 's scandalous .
henry , ilford , essex it 's clear that the government has n't got a clue about management john b , uk the last time i needed an appointment with my doctor i was told i would have to wait a week , or call back in the morning .
so i took the next day off work , called at 830 and was seen at 1050 .
it 's clear that the government has n't got a clue about management , as it 's common knowledge that what is measured gets improved even if that is n't the desired effect .
john b , uk my local doctor surgery in wood green is a shambles .
if i call up - the usual waiting time is 4/5 days .
if it is urgent we are directed to the nearest hospital .
the surgery is run-down , under-staffed and the doctor i see there tells everyone to just go to a & e. totally unacceptable .
the nurse there also breached my patient confidentiality .
my last doctor in brixton was spotless , spacious and i could get in within 24 hours every time .
am trying very hard not to get ill so i do n't have to be messed around and insulted again .
jay , london i have been unable to book an appointment unless it 's two years from now !
in my job i am constantly on the phone and it 's proved impossible as you are on hold for 10 minutes waiting .
then you are given an after hours appointment anyway .
all you needed was to pick up your prescription .
why do i pay my taxes again ?
becks , kent i can get an appointment at the vet any time i want .
i have great difficulty getting to see the doctor .
the only difference is that there is a charge for seeing the vet .
tony , derby my gp surgery seems to operate this system without difficulty .
when my family needs to be seen , we get an appointment the same day .
when we make an advance appointment for routine stuff that is also easily accommodated .
in my opinion the problem is n't the policy , but how come some practices are applying it ?
zoe , tyne and wear i work for the nhs and i believe that this booking issue is something which needs to be resolved because it impacts on other services .
many people ca n't get that appointment with the doctor and so take themselves to a & e instead - because you have to be seen in a & e. this then reflects on the waiting times for a & e. walk in centres are a relatively new and unknown service which should , if properly implemented and advertised , help rectify this problem .
being given a target is a very reasonable way of trying to improve performance , however this should not be to the disadvantage of the patient .
advanced bookings should still be a main option , but with penalties for not attending / failing to cancel .
simon gilbert , forest hill , london when i can find a surgery taking on patients , i 'll let you know .
ken , london , uk i am sick of people on here saying doctor 's receptionists are rude and abrupt .
my wife is a receptionist and the number of patients who are rude to her both on the phone and in the surgery is disgusting .
i find if you speak nicely and calmly to people they reciprocate .
john , huddersfield , england our practice can make urgent appointments within 24 hours and will accept longer term bookings , however when i recently tried to make a non-urgent appointment i was offered a date 22 days later !
they criticise patients for missing appointments , however it is a regular occurrence that the doctors do n't arrive until well after the time of the first appointment that has been booked .
far worse however is the total lack of nhs dentistry , i am faced with a bill of nearly £ 1000 for essential treatment that i am forced to have privately because of a lack of nhs dentists who will take on new patients .
sally marshall , uk i find my local booking arrangements highly annoying .
the only time i have needed to see a doctor over the last 3 years is for my annual appointment to check my contraception .
i have tell my boss in advance that i may be at the doctors on a certain day and cross my fingers that i 'll get an appointment on that particular day when i phone up .
the receptionists are rude , abrupt and frankly , nosey .
although my gp is lovely and once i get past the gatekeepers i have no complaints !
i just wish there was a service where you could book two weeks in advance for routine appointments .
it would make life so much easier for us workers !
anon , thornton why are we penalised in this way ?
pamela abbott , harlow , essex i find the system of not being able to book in advance the most frustrating system ever .
it is not user friendly and would like it changed as urgently as possible .
i understand that some people need to see their gps within 48 hours , but there are usually emergency slots held for these situations .
if you do try to book an appointment , but do n't manage to telephone first thing , then the 48 hour slots go and you have to wait another day - very unsatisfactory !
why are we penalised in this way ?
pamela abbott , harlow , essex as a gp , i have found the 48-hour target to be a ludicrously simplistic idea ; we offer a range of appointments , but find it hard to keep waiting times down and having to keep appointments free ' just in case ' does result in us having quiet days when demand is slack - then everyone rings in the next day !
the government were told at the outset that this was a poor idea .
the underlying problem is that too many appointments are wanted , and insufficient gp 's exist .
the fact that around 10 % of booked appointments are missed makes this worse .
mark williams , grays essex we do not have a problem with nhs but can not find a dentist who will treat me .
our only choice is to go private which we can not afford .
my wife has recently undergone cancer treatment which increases her risk of tooth decay !
david gilbert , rawtenstall , lancashire , uk last week i telephoned my medical centre and requested an routine appointment to see either of the two doctors i normally see and they said the first appointment would be 18 days time .
robert t dicken , stockton-on-teeside , england why does n't the government stop imposing ridiculous targets and strategies on gps and let them get on with what they trained for ?
if they did n't have quite so many bits of paper to fill in justifying every one of their actions then they 'd have time to see a lot more patients .
vicky , manchester my doctor 's surgery offers a triage system .
we can talk to a doctor on the phone within an hour who assesses whether or not we need to see someone that day .
short term appointments are not a problem and if you have a regular appointment with the same doctor about a continuing health problem then the doctor can make appointments that override the two week barrier .
the surgery is organised , efficient and has few complaints .
cecilia weightman , bristol , england i have never been able to get an appointment with my gp within 48 hours !
i usually have to wait for 2 - 3 weeks -lrb- i 'm not exaggerating -rrb- .
this means that if i have something that needs urgent attention i have to go to a walk-in centre .
the system really needs to change - it 's a nightmare !
caroline hunter , london i 'm a student and at my gps students are not allowed to make an appointment with a doctor .
we are forced to attend surgeries held by nurses a couple of times a week without an appointment and only get to see a doctor if the nurse thinks it is necessary .
this was even true when i rang up after having visited a & e after an asthma attack and thy had told me to visit the doctor the next day , as well as not being allowed to make an appointment there was no student surgery that day either .
students it sometimes seems are second class citizens not entitled to proper healthcare .
ben hartley , newcastle upon tyne , england although i can see the need for a 2 day response , there are also a significant number of people whose issue is not urgent and need to arrange time off work to see the doctor .
unless they can book an appointment a week in advance they will be unable to obtain the medical help they may need .
robert aleck , london , england when we first moved into the area you could book appointments in advance , then it all changed and you now have to phone the surgery on the day that you want to see the doctor .
this is not very helpful when you have to arrange time off work especially when you have to go for regular check ups .
ruth , widnes , cheshire i find the present gp appointments system much more agreeable than previously , when unless you went to an emergency surgery , you would have to wait at least a week to see a doctor .
now , you can call in the morning and see a doctor that very day .
there are many ailments that would not warrant " emergency status " but that ca n't wait a week to be sorted , and the 48 hour system is the most effective way to deal with these .
i appreciate , however , that the present system does restrict advanced bookings .
liz , bristol , england access to a gp is a lottery .
can not book an appointment until the day you require it .
no calls allowed before 8am then you end up in a queuing system .
standards when you finally get to see your doctor is excellent .
james wilson , irvine , scotland the country is 10,000 gps short nigel madagan , uk i am a gp .
i physically can not provide more appointments than i do .
the government can set as many targets as it likes and change the " rules " regarding access however the problem is lack of appointments and the only way to provide more appointments is to provide more gp 's .
the country is 10,000 gps short -lrb- a problem the government has known about for years -rrb- and it is difficult or impossible to recruit new partners or locum doctors to stand in when i can not be in the surgery .
nigel madagan , uk i can never get an appointment with my gp .
you have to phone on the day that you want an appointment .
i always phone at 8.30 -lrb- as soon as they open -rrb- and the phones lines are either engaged or ring off .
when you finally get to speak to someone they say there are no appointments for the day .
the receptionists are always rude and abrupt .
when i do actually get to see my gp the service is excellent , however , it is a frustrating process and i am seriously considering changing surgeries .
laura , oxford to see the more popular doctors you have to wait at least a week at my health centre , but you can usually see the less popular ones within 48 hours even if it does mean going through the triage nurse first -lrb- a process that really annoys me ! -rrb- .
when i asked why it took so long to get an appointment i was told we had n't enough doctors to cope with the new housing that has gone up in the last few years .
i note that my taxes and contributions have not been altered to reflect this problem !

are you unhappy with advanced access to gp services ?
a survey by the government watchdog , the healthcare commission , suggests that nearly a third of patients are unable to make an appointment to see their gp more than two days in advance .
the poll of 117,000 patients found the majority were happy with services , but some complained that government targets to see people within two days have led to surgeries restricting advance appointments .
tony blair pledged during the election campaign to investigate the problem .
what 's your reaction to the healthcare commission 's findings ?
do you think targets help or hinder ?
have you had difficulty making an advanced booking ?
send us your comments and experiences .
this debate is now closed .
please read a selection of your comments below .
the following comments reflect the balance of opinion received so far : i wonder if they even realise how awkward this is for anyone who has a job ?
m. g. , manchester , uk my gp wo n't do advance appointments at all .
you have to phone between 8:30am and 9am and ask for one on the day you want to go , which means , for me , having to phone in to work saying i 'll be late as i work 20 miles from where i live and until recently was reliant on once-an-hour train service to get there usually they just bark a time at you and you have to turn up , no matter how inconvenient it is .
when it 's routine stuff it would be nice to have even 24 hours notice so i can sort it out with the office rather than having to phone in at the last minute and possibly end up having to take half a day or more off .
then , it 's lucky if the appointment actually happens on time , i 've easily waited 30-60minutes nearly every time as they always run late !
i wonder if they even realise how awkward this is for anyone who has a job ?
m. g. , manchester , uk it happens at my local gp .
you are no longer allowed to book appointments in advance at a time convenient for you , you have to call in the morning to be seen later that day .
this means i have to take a day off work for non-essential appointments where previously i would have got a booking well in advance that did n't require time off .
so in a small way uk plc suffers .
i do n't blame my gp for this , though .
this perverse outcome is a classic example of what happens when the centre over-regulates and micro-manages .
john haywood , hampshire i do n't understand the problem - you need to see a doctor when you are ill - how can you know that you are going to be ill more than 2 days in advance ?
matt munro , bristol , uk just be grateful that you have a high quality free health service name here i ca n't believe some of the trivial whining on this board !
some people seem to believe that gps should prioritise appointments around people 's domestic and social responsibilities !
they do and should prioritise appointments on the basis of clinical need - just be grateful that you have a high quality free health service - most of the world do not and stop whining about having to make phone calls or having to take time off work -lrb- shock horror , how traumatic for you ! -rrb-
which is more important your health or your job ?
matt munro , bristol , uk i find it infuriating whenever i ask for an appointment to see my gp because i have to go through a barrage of questions which concludes with " do you work ? "
i find it ridiculous that i have to justify my working day just so that i might be lucky enough to get an appointment in 4 days time !
it 's insulting .

laura , aberdeen i rang my doctor today for a non-emergency appointment for my 13 year old son and was given one for 4.30 this afternoon .
i 've never ever had a problem getting an appointment , the doctors are excellent and the receptionists charming !
no , it 's not private and i 'm not telling you where it is or you 'll all join the practice !
i guess its just a lottery really .
lynn , hampshire i am convinced that this is just a public relations exercise to make the health authorities look good david endsor , stockport england i have recently just reached 50 and received a letter from my local primary care trust inviting me to go for a health check -lrb- part of the heart and stroke prevention campaign -rrb- these are given every 5 years .
on phoning my doctors practice to make an appointment i was told the nurses were very busy and short staffed due to holidays , i accepted there advice to ring back in 2 weeks .
i rang the surgery a couple of weeks later and this time was told the clinic was fully booked for 4 weeks and thereafter the program was finished .
i knew i was not going to get an appointment , but what was more annoying was i was also given similar excuses 5 years ago when asked to make an appointment then .
i am convinced that this is just a public relations exercise to make the health authorities look good .
david endsor , stockport england what short memories people have !
i remember - only a few years ago - when a routine doctor 's appointment would often have to be made 10-12 days in advance .
now i can see a doctor in 2 days .
there are some silly things in the current policies , but give credit where it is due , the nhs is now much more responsive than it used to be .
piers , surrey my view , i think supported by the other comments , is that this is a practice management problem .
i have always been able to make appointments up to 1 month in advance , and if i need to see a doctor urgently , i have always been able to within a day .
this is usually not my own doctor , but if it really is an emergency , what does that matter .
john , bristol , uk i live in scotland and have to book an appointment 1 week in advance to see my gp .
so lucky those down south who only have to book 3 days in advance .
i have complained to my gp 's practice manager verbally and in writing all to no avail .
the nhs is a joke .
flora , scotland i am a gps receptionist and i feel that patients do not realise that we do not make the rules .
if we do not have appointments to offer it is not our fault .
the surgery i work in does offer pre bookable appointments up to 2 weeks in advance , i think it is a much fairer system .
please do n't blame the receptionist , they are only doing a job of work like other people , and we do not deserve the publicity that we get .
es , leeds if they can do it why ca n't others ?
jean , wiltshire my doctor 's surgery not only has an appointment system but they also have at least one open surgery a day when you can go and wait and you will be seen .
it is not unusual to arrive at 8.15 in the morning and be at work by 9.a.m.
i also made an appointment 6 weeks in advance without any problem .
if they can do it why ca n't others ?
jean , wiltshire being fortunate not to have had to see my gp for over nine years .
i 'm horrified to read the comments of my fellow readers .
i 'm getting on a bit now and would be more likely to know that if i required a gp appointment or visit , i would get one before i expire .
john graham , edinburgh , scotland recently we took our son to the doctors - the doctor asked us to come back in 7 days .
his receptionist refused to make the booking so we could avoid school hours .
5 days later we spent 30 minutes on the phone trying to get through and then had no option but to take a school hours appointment .
simply ludicrous .
clive , woking being seen when you are ill is what it 's all about sharon , london my surgery offers a 48 hour advance booking service .
this works fantastically .
my doctor 's surgery has about 8 doctors available and you are guaranteed to get seen whilst you are still symptomatic .
people who complain about this kind of service are the type of people who complain at anything .
being seen when you are ill is what it 's all about and i thank and applaud the gp services around the country who work tirelessly to help their patients , despite the constant criticism sharon , london i 'd say so .
i had an infected cyst in my ear which needed treatment but i had to book an appointment at least 7 days in advance .
by the time it actually came round to my appointment , my cyst had cleared up , rendering the appointment pointless .
bob , brighton , uk my elderly father has a long term and serious health problem needs to visit the doctor every 2 weeks or so .
his doctor sees him and says make an appointment for a week friday .
impossible - the reception staff and presumably the practice manager will simply not do it .
the tail wagging the dog ?
wayne , harpenden , uk think yourselves most fortunate that you can see a doctor within a week , as in canada 4 weeks to 12 weeks to see your doctor is not uncommon .
mostly if you are in need , one has to go to emergency were one finds a room full of people waiting for the same thing .
we have had to accept that this is the way things are for now , as it is out of our control .
neither governments or doctors have much control over doctor shortages .
heather , canada we need more gps , but gp friends tell me how difficult -lrb- and expensive -rrb- it is to get into an established general practice .
it 's easier becoming a hospital doctor .
unless you 're obliged to see the doctor at his request , for routine vaccinations , baby checkups and screenings - we should all go private and have health insurance , as in the usa , or pay in advance and reclaim the costs later , as they do in france .
that system would soon winnow out the large numbers of people who clog up surgeries with no good reason .
at present , if we want to go private , we need a referral from our gp , which comes very low in the list of priorities , even though we are forced to ' bribe ' the gp with thirty pounds -lrb- there really is no other word for it -rrb- , just to write a letter .
it 's scandalous .
henry , ilford , essex it 's clear that the government has n't got a clue about management john b , uk the last time i needed an appointment with my doctor i was told i would have to wait a week , or call back in the morning .
so i took the next day off work , called at 830 and was seen at 1050 .
it 's clear that the government has n't got a clue about management , as it 's common knowledge that what is measured gets improved even if that is n't the desired effect .
john b , uk my local doctor surgery in wood green is a shambles .
if i call up - the usual waiting time is 4/5 days .
if it is urgent we are directed to the nearest hospital .
the surgery is run-down , under-staffed and the doctor i see there tells everyone to just go to a & e. totally unacceptable .
the nurse there also breached my patient confidentiality .
my last doctor in brixton was spotless , spacious and i could get in within 24 hours every time .
am trying very hard not to get ill so i do n't have to be messed around and insulted again .
jay , london i have been unable to book an appointment unless it 's two years from now !
in my job i am constantly on the phone and it 's proved impossible as you are on hold for 10 minutes waiting .
then you are given an after hours appointment anyway .
all you needed was to pick up your prescription .
why do i pay my taxes again ?
becks , kent i can get an appointment at the vet any time i want .
i have great difficulty getting to see the doctor .
the only difference is that there is a charge for seeing the vet .
tony , derby my gp surgery seems to operate this system without difficulty .
when my family needs to be seen , we get an appointment the same day .
when we make an advance appointment for routine stuff that is also easily accommodated .
in my opinion the problem is n't the policy , but how come some practices are applying it ?
zoe , tyne and wear i work for the nhs and i believe that this booking issue is something which needs to be resolved because it impacts on other services .
many people ca n't get that appointment with the doctor and so take themselves to a & e instead - because you have to be seen in a & e. this then reflects on the waiting times for a & e. walk in centres are a relatively new and unknown service which should , if properly implemented and advertised , help rectify this problem .
being given a target is a very reasonable way of trying to improve performance , however this should not be to the disadvantage of the patient .
advanced bookings should still be a main option , but with penalties for not attending / failing to cancel .
simon gilbert , forest hill , london when i can find a surgery taking on patients , i 'll let you know .
ken , london , uk i am sick of people on here saying doctor 's receptionists are rude and abrupt .
my wife is a receptionist and the number of patients who are rude to her both on the phone and in the surgery is disgusting .
i find if you speak nicely and calmly to people they reciprocate .
john , huddersfield , england our practice can make urgent appointments within 24 hours and will accept longer term bookings , however when i recently tried to make a non-urgent appointment i was offered a date 22 days later !
they criticise patients for missing appointments , however it is a regular occurrence that the doctors do n't arrive until well after the time of the first appointment that has been booked .
far worse however is the total lack of nhs dentistry , i am faced with a bill of nearly £ 1000 for essential treatment that i am forced to have privately because of a lack of nhs dentists who will take on new patients .
sally marshall , uk i find my local booking arrangements highly annoying .
the only time i have needed to see a doctor over the last 3 years is for my annual appointment to check my contraception .
i have tell my boss in advance that i may be at the doctors on a certain day and cross my fingers that i 'll get an appointment on that particular day when i phone up .
the receptionists are rude , abrupt and frankly , nosey .
although my gp is lovely and once i get past the gatekeepers i have no complaints !
i just wish there was a service where you could book two weeks in advance for routine appointments .
it would make life so much easier for us workers !
anon , thornton why are we penalised in this way ?
pamela abbott , harlow , essex i find the system of not being able to book in advance the most frustrating system ever .
it is not user friendly and would like it changed as urgently as possible .
i understand that some people need to see their gps within 48 hours , but there are usually emergency slots held for these situations .
if you do try to book an appointment , but do n't manage to telephone first thing , then the 48 hour slots go and you have to wait another day - very unsatisfactory !
why are we penalised in this way ?
pamela abbott , harlow , essex as a gp , i have found the 48-hour target to be a ludicrously simplistic idea ; we offer a range of appointments , but find it hard to keep waiting times down and having to keep appointments free ' just in case ' does result in us having quiet days when demand is slack - then everyone rings in the next day !
the government were told at the outset that this was a poor idea .
the underlying problem is that too many appointments are wanted , and insufficient gp 's exist .
the fact that around 10 % of booked appointments are missed makes this worse .
mark williams , grays essex we do not have a problem with nhs but can not find a dentist who will treat me .
our only choice is to go private which we can not afford .
my wife has recently undergone cancer treatment which increases her risk of tooth decay !
david gilbert , rawtenstall , lancashire , uk last week i telephoned my medical centre and requested an routine appointment to see either of the two doctors i normally see and they said the first appointment would be 18 days time .
robert t dicken , stockton-on-teeside , england why does n't the government stop imposing ridiculous targets and strategies on gps and let them get on with what they trained for ?
if they did n't have quite so many bits of paper to fill in justifying every one of their actions then they 'd have time to see a lot more patients .
vicky , manchester my doctor 's surgery offers a triage system .
we can talk to a doctor on the phone within an hour who assesses whether or not we need to see someone that day .
short term appointments are not a problem and if you have a regular appointment with the same doctor about a continuing health problem then the doctor can make appointments that override the two week barrier .
the surgery is organised , efficient and has few complaints .
cecilia weightman , bristol , england i have never been able to get an appointment with my gp within 48 hours !
i usually have to wait for 2 - 3 weeks -lrb- i 'm not exaggerating -rrb- .
this means that if i have something that needs urgent attention i have to go to a walk-in centre .
the system really needs to change - it 's a nightmare !
caroline hunter , london i 'm a student and at my gps students are not allowed to make an appointment with a doctor .
we are forced to attend surgeries held by nurses a couple of times a week without an appointment and only get to see a doctor if the nurse thinks it is necessary .
this was even true when i rang up after having visited a & e after an asthma attack and thy had told me to visit the doctor the next day , as well as not being allowed to make an appointment there was no student surgery that day either .
students it sometimes seems are second class citizens not entitled to proper healthcare .
ben hartley , newcastle upon tyne , england although i can see the need for a 2 day response , there are also a significant number of people whose issue is not urgent and need to arrange time off work to see the doctor .
unless they can book an appointment a week in advance they will be unable to obtain the medical help they may need .
robert aleck , london , england when we first moved into the area you could book appointments in advance , then it all changed and you now have to phone the surgery on the day that you want to see the doctor .
this is not very helpful when you have to arrange time off work especially when you have to go for regular check ups .
ruth , widnes , cheshire i find the present gp appointments system much more agreeable than previously , when unless you went to an emergency surgery , you would have to wait at least a week to see a doctor .
now , you can call in the morning and see a doctor that very day .
there are many ailments that would not warrant " emergency status " but that ca n't wait a week to be sorted , and the 48 hour system is the most effective way to deal with these .
i appreciate , however , that the present system does restrict advanced bookings .
liz , bristol , england access to a gp is a lottery .
can not book an appointment until the day you require it .
no calls allowed before 8am then you end up in a queuing system .
standards when you finally get to see your doctor is excellent .
james wilson , irvine , scotland the country is 10,000 gps short nigel madagan , uk i am a gp .
i physically can not provide more appointments than i do .
the government can set as many targets as it likes and change the " rules " regarding access however the problem is lack of appointments and the only way to provide more appointments is to provide more gp 's .
the country is 10,000 gps short -lrb- a problem the government has known about for years -rrb- and it is difficult or impossible to recruit new partners or locum doctors to stand in when i can not be in the surgery .
nigel madagan , uk i can never get an appointment with my gp .
you have to phone on the day that you want an appointment .
i always phone at 8.30 -lrb- as soon as they open -rrb- and the phones lines are either engaged or ring off .
when you finally get to speak to someone they say there are no appointments for the day .
the receptionists are always rude and abrupt .
when i do actually get to see my gp the service is excellent , however , it is a frustrating process and i am seriously considering changing surgeries .
laura , oxford to see the more popular doctors you have to wait at least a week at my health centre , but you can usually see the less popular ones within 48 hours even if it does mean going through the triage nurse first -lrb- a process that really annoys me ! -rrb- .
when i asked why it took so long to get an appointment i was told we had n't enough doctors to cope with the new housing that has gone up in the last few years .
i note that my taxes and contributions have not been altered to reflect this problem !

are you unhappy with advanced access to gp services ?
a survey by the government watchdog , the healthcare commission , suggests that nearly a third of patients are unable to make an appointment to see their gp more than two days in advance .
the poll of 117,000 patients found the majority were happy with services , but some complained that government targets to see people within two days have led to surgeries restricting advance appointments .
tony blair pledged during the election campaign to investigate the problem .
what 's your reaction to the healthcare commission 's findings ?
do you think targets help or hinder ?
have you had difficulty making an advanced booking ?
send us your comments and experiences .
this debate is now closed .
please read a selection of your comments below .
the following comments reflect the balance of opinion received so far : i wonder if they even realise how awkward this is for anyone who has a job ?
m. g. , manchester , uk my gp wo n't do advance appointments at all .
you have to phone between 8:30am and 9am and ask for one on the day you want to go , which means , for me , having to phone in to work saying i 'll be late as i work 20 miles from where i live and until recently was reliant on once-an-hour train service to get there usually they just bark a time at you and you have to turn up , no matter how inconvenient it is .
when it 's routine stuff it would be nice to have even 24 hours notice so i can sort it out with the office rather than having to phone in at the last minute and possibly end up having to take half a day or more off .
then , it 's lucky if the appointment actually happens on time , i 've easily waited 30-60minutes nearly every time as they always run late !
i wonder if they even realise how awkward this is for anyone who has a job ?
m. g. , manchester , uk it happens at my local gp .
you are no longer allowed to book appointments in advance at a time convenient for you , you have to call in the morning to be seen later that day .
this means i have to take a day off work for non-essential appointments where previously i would have got a booking well in advance that did n't require time off .
so in a small way uk plc suffers .
i do n't blame my gp for this , though .
this perverse outcome is a classic example of what happens when the centre over-regulates and micro-manages .
john haywood , hampshire i do n't understand the problem - you need to see a doctor when you are ill - how can you know that you are going to be ill more than 2 days in advance ?
matt munro , bristol , uk just be grateful that you have a high quality free health service name here i ca n't believe some of the trivial whining on this board !
some people seem to believe that gps should prioritise appointments around people 's domestic and social responsibilities !
they do and should prioritise appointments on the basis of clinical need - just be grateful that you have a high quality free health service - most of the world do not and stop whining about having to make phone calls or having to take time off work -lrb- shock horror , how traumatic for you ! -rrb-
which is more important your health or your job ?
matt munro , bristol , uk i find it infuriating whenever i ask for an appointment to see my gp because i have to go through a barrage of questions which concludes with " do you work ? "
i find it ridiculous that i have to justify my working day just so that i might be lucky enough to get an appointment in 4 days time !
it 's insulting .
melanie philpott , torquay , devon this problem could be solved immediately if patients were to act responsibly e , malvern uk this problem could be solved immediately if patients were to act responsibly and only ask to see a doctor if they really need one .
i have been to a gp once in the last 22 years - and i do n't think of myself as particularly healthy .
if i have a minor health problem it will usually be something i can deal with myself , or it will just get better on its own .
pharmacists and the nhs direct service can also be helpful if you are not sure what to do .
leave gps to those who really need them - one day it could be you .
e , malvern uk 48 hours ?
during my last phone call to the gp i was told no appointments available for the next week !
simon taylor-smith , swindon until recently i was a practice manager .
the problem is that pcts and some gps have -lrb- sometimes deliberately -rrb- misinterpreted the target .
there is nothing in the guidelines that states a gp can not offer advanced booking .
these decisions are taken by the individual practice .
also patients sometimes have unreasonable expectations .
one patient arrived at the surgery at 08.45 and was offered an appointment at 09.30 the same morning and then complained that we did n't have anything sooner ! !
chris , london , uk think yourselves lucky you have got a doctor .
i needed a doctor for the first time in over 10 years and i was told that i " was n't in any surgery 's catchment area " so they 'd send me some forms to fill in , i could post them back and they 'd assign me to a local surgery ... by post , obviously .
i was better before i got any forms .
seemed like the best plan ! !
andy , london we have had the 48 hour targets imposed on us , without asking patients or gps what they need or want !
nic , leeds uk i 'm a gp : this does not surprise me !
we have had the 48 hour targets imposed on us , without asking patients or gps what they need or want !
we are trying to offer some pre-bookables , but we still have to meet the 48 hour targets too !
more and more work is being moved from hospitals to primary care : without more doctors and nurses -lrb- i.e. more funding for staff -rrb- we can not hope to provide a decent service for everyone !
nic , leeds uk i think that being able to book on the day you need the appointment has been a good change .
many times i have needed to see the doctor as soon as possible that even waiting a day would be too long .
if i do have a problem which can wait a week then my surgery has no problems making an advance appointment for me -lrb- usually within a week -rrb- .
i do n't know how it works in other surgeries but this system definitely works for me and i hope it stays that way .
laura , london , uk the only people to have gained from the latest gp contract are the gp 's themselves who are paid a lot more for doing less .
they are manipulating the 48 hour rule to their own advantage and yet provide less for the patients .
make the slightest moan and they will de-register you .
chris stevens , london uk i do n't try to go to a gp any more , i just go and sit in a & e and wait steve , uk we now spend more per head than any other country on our health services ; we have had a vast increase in the number of gps , who are the highest paid in the world -lrb- all strange but true -rrb- and what do we hear ?
more money needed , more doctors , more ... more ... more ..
i do n't try to go to a gp any more , i just go and sit in a & e and wait .
steve , uk i never have a problem getting an appointment with the doctor .
what i do have a problem with is getting a proper diagnosis !
susan , london in bolton we have an nhs drop-in centre , you can go there if you ca n't get in to see your gp .
i recently had tonsillitis , could n't get in to see my gp until the next day , so went to the drop in centre .
i was seen within 30 minutes by a well qualified nurse .
also , i tend to see my practice nurse at my doctors surgery , she can do nearly everything my gp can and with hardly any waiting time .
victoria , bolton , lancs you ca n't blame the gps for this .
if it was n't for the idiotic targets that are being set by the government then this would n't be happening .
they have to remember that doctors will try to make the figures work for them , rather like this government will try to put a positive spin on bad news stories .
mark s , manchester , uk you ca n't book ahead at my doctors only on the same day , so there 's a mad rush first thing and you 've no chance if you ring after quarter to nine -lrb- they only open at 8:30 -rrb- jenna , wales this issue was raised in the ' leaders question time special ' shortly before the general election .
i remember an extremely sweaty mr blair being dumfounded by this , and he promised to sort it out - presumably it 's still going on if we are discussing it here today .
about time the government did something about it really !
they 've had four months since that programme and still no action - what a surprise ! !
steve , warrington , uk call up on the morning and partake of the telephone lottery ben bell , canterbury , kent , i can only make an appointment with my gp on that morning .
call up on the morning and partake of the telephone lottery to see if i can get an appointment , if not then better luck tomorrow .
no forward bookings at all .
unfortunately this means that i have to stay at home to call to see if i can get an appointment and be late for work whatever happens .
ben bell , canterbury , kent , england when i was in leeds there was an open surgery for 2 hours in the morning and an hour in the afternoon .
the rest of the time it was pre-booked appointments which were also easy to get .
surely it 's not that complicated ?
laura , aberdeen i rang my doctor today for a non-emergency appointment for my 13 year old son and was given one for 4.30 this afternoon .
i 've never ever had a problem getting an appointment , the doctors are excellent and the receptionists charming !
no , it 's not private and i 'm not telling you where it is or you 'll all join the practice !
i guess its just a lottery really .
lynn , hampshire i am convinced that this is just a public relations exercise to make the health authorities look good david endsor , stockport england i have recently just reached 50 and received a letter from my local primary care trust inviting me to go for a health check -lrb- part of the heart and stroke prevention campaign -rrb- these are given every 5 years .

i remember - only a few years ago - when a routine doctor 's appointment would often have to be made 10-12 days in advance .
now i can see a doctor in 2 days .
there are some silly things in the current policies , but give credit where it is due , the nhs is now much more responsive than it used to be .

the tail wagging the dog ?
wayne , harpenden , uk think yourselves most fortunate that you can see a doctor within a week , as in canada 4 weeks to 12 weeks to see your doctor is not uncommon .

heather , canada we need more gps , but gp friends tell me how difficult -lrb- and expensive -rrb- it is to get into an established general practice .
it 's easier becoming a hospital doctor .
unless you 're obliged to see the doctor at his request , for routine vaccinations , baby checkups and screenings - we should all go private and have health insurance , as in the usa , or pay in advance and reclaim the costs later , as they do in france .

at present , if we want to go private , we need a referral from our gp , which comes very low in the list of priorities , even though we are forced to ' bribe ' the gp with thirty pounds -lrb- there really is no other word for it -rrb- , just to write a letter .
it 's scandalous .
henry , ilford , essex it 's clear that the government has n't got a clue about management john b , uk the last time i needed an appointment with my doctor i was told i would have to wait a week , or call back in the morning .
so i took the next day off work , called at 830 and was seen at 1050 .
it 's clear that the government has n't got a clue about management , as it 's common knowledge that what is measured gets improved even if that is n't the desired effect .
john b , uk my local doctor surgery in wood green is a shambles .
if i call up - the usual waiting time is 4/5 days .
if it is urgent we are directed to the nearest hospital .
the surgery is run-down , under-staffed and the doctor i see there tells everyone to just go to a & e. totally unacceptable .
the nurse there also breached my patient confidentiality .
my last doctor in brixton was spotless , spacious and i could get in within 24 hours every time .
am trying very hard not to get ill so i do n't have to be messed around and insulted again .
jay , london i have been unable to book an appointment unless it 's two years from now !
in my job i am constantly on the phone and it 's proved impossible as you are on hold for 10 minutes waiting .
then you are given an after hours appointment anyway .
all you needed was to pick up your prescription .
why do i pay my taxes again ?
becks , kent i can get an appointment at the vet any time i want .
i have great difficulty getting to see the doctor .
the only difference is that there is a charge for seeing the vet .
tony , derby my gp surgery seems to operate this system without difficulty .
when my family needs to be seen , we get an appointment the same day .
when we make an advance appointment for routine stuff that is also easily accommodated .
in my opinion the problem is n't the policy , but how come some practices are applying it ?
zoe , tyne and wear i work for the nhs and i believe that this booking issue is something which needs to be resolved because it impacts on other services .
many people ca n't get that appointment with the doctor and so take themselves to a & e instead - because you have to be seen in a & e. this then reflects on the waiting times for a & e. walk in centres are a relatively new and unknown service which should , if properly implemented and advertised , help rectify this problem .
being given a target is a very reasonable way of trying to improve performance , however this should not be to the disadvantage of the patient .
advanced bookings should still be a main option , but with penalties for not attending / failing to cancel .
simon gilbert , forest hill , london when i can find a surgery taking on patients , i 'll let you know .
ken , london , uk i am sick of people on here saying doctor 's receptionists are rude and abrupt .
my wife is a receptionist and the number of patients who are rude to her both on the phone and in the surgery is disgusting .
i find if you speak nicely and calmly to people they reciprocate .
john , huddersfield , england our practice can make urgent appointments within 24 hours and will accept longer term bookings , however when i recently tried to make a non-urgent appointment i was offered a date 22 days later !
they criticise patients for missing appointments , however it is a regular occurrence that the doctors do n't arrive until well after the time of the first appointment that has been booked .
far worse however is the total lack of nhs dentistry , i am faced with a bill of nearly £ 1000 for essential treatment that i am forced to have privately because of a lack of nhs dentists who will take on new patients .
sally marshall , uk i find my local booking arrangements highly annoying .
the only time i have needed to see a doctor over the last 3 years is for my annual appointment to check my contraception .
i have tell my boss in advance that i may be at the doctors on a certain day and cross my fingers that i 'll get an appointment on that particular day when i phone up .
the receptionists are rude , abrupt and frankly , nosey .
although my gp is lovely and once i get past the gatekeepers i have no complaints !
i just wish there was a service where you could book two weeks in advance for routine appointments .
it would make life so much easier for us workers !
anon , thornton why are we penalised in this way ?
pamela abbott , harlow , essex i find the system of not being able to book in advance the most frustrating system ever .
it is not user friendly and would like it changed as urgently as possible .
i understand that some people need to see their gps within 48 hours , but there are usually emergency slots held for these situations .
if you do try to book an appointment , but do n't manage to telephone first thing , then the 48 hour slots go and you have to wait another day - very unsatisfactory !
why are we penalised in this way ?
pamela abbott , harlow , essex as a gp , i have found the 48-hour target to be a ludicrously simplistic idea ; we offer a range of appointments , but find it hard to keep waiting times down and having to keep appointments free ' just in case ' does result in us having quiet days when demand is slack - then everyone rings in the next day !
the government were told at the outset that this was a poor idea .
the underlying problem is that too many appointments are wanted , and insufficient gp 's exist .
the fact that around 10 % of booked appointments are missed makes this worse .
mark williams , grays essex we do not have a problem with nhs but can not find a dentist who will treat me .
our only choice is to go private which we can not afford .
my wife has recently undergone cancer treatment which increases her risk of tooth decay !
david gilbert , rawtenstall , lancashire , uk last week i telephoned my medical centre and requested an routine appointment to see either of the two doctors i normally see and they said the first appointment would be 18 days time .
robert t dicken , stockton-on-teeside , england why does n't the government stop imposing ridiculous targets and strategies on gps and let them get on with what they trained for ?
if they did n't have quite so many bits of paper to fill in justifying every one of their actions then they 'd have time to see a lot more patients .
vicky , manchester my doctor 's surgery offers a triage system .
we can talk to a doctor on the phone within an hour who assesses whether or not we need to see someone that day .
short term appointments are not a problem and if you have a regular appointment with the same doctor about a continuing health problem then the doctor can make appointments that override the two week barrier .
the surgery is organised , efficient and has few complaints .
cecilia weightman , bristol , england i have never been able to get an appointment with my gp within 48 hours !
i usually have to wait for 2 - 3 weeks -lrb- i 'm not exaggerating -rrb- .
this means that if i have something that needs urgent attention i have to go to a walk-in centre .
the system really needs to change - it 's a nightmare !
caroline hunter , london i 'm a student and at my gps students are not allowed to make an appointment with a doctor .
we are forced to attend surgeries held by nurses a couple of times a week without an appointment and only get to see a doctor if the nurse thinks it is necessary .
this was even true when i rang up after having visited a & e after an asthma attack and thy had told me to visit the doctor the next day , as well as not being allowed to make an appointment there was no student surgery that day either .
students it sometimes seems are second class citizens not entitled to proper healthcare .
ben hartley , newcastle upon tyne , england although i can see the need for a 2 day response , there are also a significant number of people whose issue is not urgent and need to arrange time off work to see the doctor .
unless they can book an appointment a week in advance they will be unable to obtain the medical help they may need .
robert aleck , london , england when we first moved into the area you could book appointments in advance , then it all changed and you now have to phone the surgery on the day that you want to see the doctor .
this is not very helpful when you have to arrange time off work especially when you have to go for regular check ups .
ruth , widnes , cheshire i find the present gp appointments system much more agreeable than previously , when unless you went to an emergency surgery , you would have to wait at least a week to see a doctor .
now , you can call in the morning and see a doctor that very day .
there are many ailments that would not warrant " emergency status " but that ca n't wait a week to be sorted , and the 48 hour system is the most effective way to deal with these .
i appreciate , however , that the present system does restrict advanced bookings .
liz , bristol , england access to a gp is a lottery .
can not book an appointment until the day you require it .
no calls allowed before 8am then you end up in a queuing system .
standards when you finally get to see your doctor is excellent .
james wilson , irvine , scotland the country is 10,000 gps short nigel madagan , uk i am a gp .
i physically can not provide more appointments than i do .
the government can set as many targets as it likes and change the " rules " regarding access however the problem is lack of appointments and the only way to provide more appointments is to provide more gp 's .
the country is 10,000 gps short -lrb- a problem the government has known about for years -rrb- and it is difficult or impossible to recruit new partners or locum doctors to stand in when i can not be in the surgery .
nigel madagan , uk i can never get an appointment with my gp .
you have to phone on the day that you want an appointment .
i always phone at 8.30 -lrb- as soon as they open -rrb- and the phones lines are either engaged or ring off .
when you finally get to speak to someone they say there are no appointments for the day .
the receptionists are always rude and abrupt .
when i do actually get to see my gp the service is excellent , however , it is a frustrating process and i am seriously considering changing surgeries .
laura , oxford to see the more popular doctors you have to wait at least a week at my health centre , but you can usually see the less popular ones within 48 hours even if it does mean going through the triage nurse first -lrb- a process that really annoys me ! -rrb- .
when i asked why it took so long to get an appointment i was told we had n't enough doctors to cope with the new housing that has gone up in the last few years .
i note that my taxes and contributions have not been altered to reflect this problem !

are you unhappy with advanced access to gp services ?
a survey by the government watchdog , the healthcare commission , suggests that nearly a third of patients are unable to make an appointment to see their gp more than two days in advance .
the poll of 117,000 patients found the majority were happy with services , but some complained that government targets to see people within two days have led to surgeries restricting advance appointments .
tony blair pledged during the election campaign to investigate the problem .
what 's your reaction to the healthcare commission 's findings ?
do you think targets help or hinder ?
have you had difficulty making an advanced booking ?
send us your comments and experiences .
this debate is now closed .
please read a selection of your comments below .
the following comments reflect the balance of opinion received so far : i wonder if they even realise how awkward this is for anyone who has a job ?
m. g. , manchester , uk my gp wo n't do advance appointments at all .
you have to phone between 8:30am and 9am and ask for one on the day you want to go , which means , for me , having to phone in to work saying i 'll be late as i work 20 miles from where i live and until recently was reliant on once-an-hour train service to get there usually they just bark a time at you and you have to turn up , no matter how inconvenient it is .
when it 's routine stuff it would be nice to have even 24 hours notice so i can sort it out with the office rather than having to phone in at the last minute and possibly end up having to take half a day or more off .
then , it 's lucky if the appointment actually happens on time , i 've easily waited 30-60minutes nearly every time as they always run late !
i wonder if they even realise how awkward this is for anyone who has a job ?
m. g. , manchester , uk it happens at my local gp .
you are no longer allowed to book appointments in advance at a time convenient for you , you have to call in the morning to be seen later that day .
this means i have to take a day off work for non-essential appointments where previously i would have got a booking well in advance that did n't require time off .
so in a small way uk plc suffers .
i do n't blame my gp for this , though .
this perverse outcome is a classic example of what happens when the centre over-regulates and micro-manages .
john haywood , hampshire i do n't understand the problem - you need to see a doctor when you are ill - how can you know that you are going to be ill more than 2 days in advance ?
matt munro , bristol , uk just be grateful that you have a high quality free health service name here i ca n't believe some of the trivial whining on this board !
some people seem to believe that gps should prioritise appointments around people 's domestic and social responsibilities !
they do and should prioritise appointments on the basis of clinical need - just be grateful that you have a high quality free health service - most of the world do not and stop whining about having to make phone calls or having to take time off work -lrb- shock horror , how traumatic for you ! -rrb-
which is more important your health or your job ?
matt munro , bristol , uk i find it infuriating whenever i ask for an appointment to see my gp because i have to go through a barrage of questions which concludes with " do you work ? "
i find it ridiculous that i have to justify my working day just so that i might be lucky enough to get an appointment in 4 days time !
it 's insulting .
melanie philpott , torquay , devon this problem could be solved immediately if patients were to act responsibly e , malvern uk this problem could be solved immediately if patients were to act responsibly and only ask to see a doctor if they really need one .
i have been to a gp once in the last 22 years - and i do n't think of myself as particularly healthy .
if i have a minor health problem it will usually be something i can deal with myself , or it will just get better on its own .
pharmacists and the nhs direct service can also be helpful if you are not sure what to do .
leave gps to those who really need them - one day it could be you .
e , malvern uk 48 hours ?
during my last phone call to the gp i was told no appointments available for the next week !
simon taylor-smith , swindon until recently i was a practice manager .
the problem is that pcts and some gps have -lrb- sometimes deliberately -rrb- misinterpreted the target .
there is nothing in the guidelines that states a gp can not offer advanced booking .
these decisions are taken by the individual practice .
also patients sometimes have unreasonable expectations .
one patient arrived at the surgery at 08.45 and was offered an appointment at 09.30 the same morning and then complained that we did n't have anything sooner ! !
chris , london , uk think yourselves lucky you have got a doctor .
i needed a doctor for the first time in over 10 years and i was told that i " was n't in any surgery 's catchment area " so they 'd send me some forms to fill in , i could post them back and they 'd assign me to a local surgery ... by post , obviously .
i was better before i got any forms .
seemed like the best plan ! !
andy , london we have had the 48 hour targets imposed on us , without asking patients or gps what they need or want !
nic , leeds uk i 'm a gp : this does not surprise me !
we have had the 48 hour targets imposed on us , without asking patients or gps what they need or want !
we are trying to offer some pre-bookables , but we still have to meet the 48 hour targets too !
more and more work is being moved from hospitals to primary care : without more doctors and nurses -lrb- i.e. more funding for staff -rrb- we can not hope to provide a decent service for everyone !
nic , leeds uk i think that being able to book on the day you need the appointment has been a good change .
many times i have needed to see the doctor as soon as possible that even waiting a day would be too long .
if i do have a problem which can wait a week then my surgery has no problems making an advance appointment for me -lrb- usually within a week -rrb- .
i do n't know how it works in other surgeries but this system definitely works for me and i hope it stays that way .
laura , london , uk the only people to have gained from the latest gp contract are the gp 's themselves who are paid a lot more for doing less .
they are manipulating the 48 hour rule to their own advantage and yet provide less for the patients .
make the slightest moan and they will de-register you .
chris stevens , london uk i do n't try to go to a gp any more , i just go and sit in a & e and wait steve , uk we now spend more per head than any other country on our health services ; we have had a vast increase in the number of gps , who are the highest paid in the world -lrb- all strange but true -rrb- and what do we hear ?
more money needed , more doctors , more ... more ... more ..
i do n't try to go to a gp any more , i just go and sit in a & e and wait .
steve , uk i never have a problem getting an appointment with the doctor .
what i do have a problem with is getting a proper diagnosis !
susan , london in bolton we have an nhs drop-in centre , you can go there if you ca n't get in to see your gp .
i recently had tonsillitis , could n't get in to see my gp until the next day , so went to the drop in centre .
i was seen within 30 minutes by a well qualified nurse .
also , i tend to see my practice nurse at my doctors surgery , she can do nearly everything my gp can and with hardly any waiting time .
victoria , bolton , lancs you ca n't blame the gps for this .
if it was n't for the idiotic targets that are being set by the government then this would n't be happening .
they have to remember that doctors will try to make the figures work for them , rather like this government will try to put a positive spin on bad news stories .
mark s , manchester , uk you ca n't book ahead at my doctors only on the same day , so there 's a mad rush first thing and you 've no chance if you ring after quarter to nine -lrb- they only open at 8:30 -rrb- jenna , wales this issue was raised in the ' leaders question time special ' shortly before the general election .
i remember an extremely sweaty mr blair being dumfounded by this , and he promised to sort it out - presumably it 's still going on if we are discussing it here today .
about time the government did something about it really !
they 've had four months since that programme and still no action - what a surprise ! !
steve , warrington , uk call up on the morning and partake of the telephone lottery ben bell , canterbury , kent , i can only make an appointment with my gp on that morning .
call up on the morning and partake of the telephone lottery to see if i can get an appointment , if not then better luck tomorrow .
no forward bookings at all .
unfortunately this means that i have to stay at home to call to see if i can get an appointment and be late for work whatever happens .
ben bell , canterbury , kent , england when i was in leeds there was an open surgery for 2 hours in the morning and an hour in the afternoon .
the rest of the time it was pre-booked appointments which were also easy to get .
surely it 's not that complicated ?
laura , aberdeen i rang my doctor today for a non-emergency appointment for my 13 year old son and was given one for 4.30 this afternoon .
i 've never ever had a problem getting an appointment , the doctors are excellent and the receptionists charming !
no , it 's not private and i 'm not telling you where it is or you 'll all join the practice !
i guess its just a lottery really .
lynn , hampshire i am convinced that this is just a public relations exercise to make the health authorities look good david endsor , stockport england i have recently just reached 50 and received a letter from my local primary care trust inviting me to go for a health check -lrb- part of the heart and stroke prevention campaign -rrb- these are given every 5 years .
on phoning my doctors practice to make an appointment i was told the nurses were very busy and short staffed due to holidays , i accepted there advice to ring back in 2 weeks .
i rang the surgery a couple of weeks later and this time was told the clinic was fully booked for 4 weeks and thereafter the program was finished .
i knew i was not going to get an appointment , but what was more annoying was i was also given similar excuses 5 years ago when asked to make an appointment then .
i am convinced that this is just a public relations exercise to make the health authorities look good .
david endsor , stockport england what short memories people have !
i remember - only a few years ago - when a routine doctor 's appointment would often have to be made 10-12 days in advance .
now i can see a doctor in 2 days .
there are some silly things in the current policies , but give credit where it is due , the nhs is now much more responsive than it used to be .
piers , surrey my view , i think supported by the other comments , is that this is a practice management problem .
i have always been able to make appointments up to 1 month in advance , and if i need to see a doctor urgently , i have always been able to within a day .
this is usually not my own doctor , but if it really is an emergency , what does that matter .
john , bristol , uk i live in scotland and have to book an appointment 1 week in advance to see my gp .
so lucky those down south who only have to book 3 days in advance .
i have complained to my gp 's practice manager verbally and in writing all to no avail .
the nhs is a joke .
flora , scotland i am a gps receptionist and i feel that patients do not realise that we do not make the rules .
if we do not have appointments to offer it is not our fault .
the surgery i work in does offer pre bookable appointments up to 2 weeks in advance , i think it is a much fairer system .
please do n't blame the receptionist , they are only doing a job of work like other people , and we do not deserve the publicity that we get .
es , leeds if they can do it why ca n't others ?
jean , wiltshire my doctor 's surgery not only has an appointment system but they also have at least one open surgery a day when you can go and wait and you will be seen .
it is not unusual to arrive at 8.15 in the morning and be at work by 9.a.m.
i also made an appointment 6 weeks in advance without any problem .
if they can do it why ca n't others ?
jean , wiltshire being fortunate not to have had to see my gp for over nine years .
i 'm horrified to read the comments of my fellow readers .
i 'm getting on a bit now and would be more likely to know that if i required a gp appointment or visit , i would get one before i expire .
john graham , edinburgh , scotland recently we took our son to the doctors - the doctor asked us to come back in 7 days .
his receptionist refused to make the booking so we could avoid school hours .
5 days later we spent 30 minutes on the phone trying to get through and then had no option but to take a school hours appointment .
simply ludicrous .
clive , woking being seen when you are ill is what it 's all about sharon , london my surgery offers a 48 hour advance booking service .
this works fantastically .
my doctor 's surgery has about 8 doctors available and you are guaranteed to get seen whilst you are still symptomatic .
people who complain about this kind of service are the type of people who complain at anything .
being seen when you are ill is what it 's all about and i thank and applaud the gp services around the country who work tirelessly to help their patients , despite the constant criticism sharon , london i 'd say so .
i had an infected cyst in my ear which needed treatment but i had to book an appointment at least 7 days in advance .
by the time it actually came round to my appointment , my cyst had cleared up , rendering the appointment pointless .
bob , brighton , uk my elderly father has a long term and serious health problem needs to visit the doctor every 2 weeks or so .
his doctor sees him and says make an appointment for a week friday .
impossible - the reception staff and presumably the practice manager will simply not do it .
the tail wagging the dog ?
wayne , harpenden , uk think yourselves most fortunate that you can see a doctor within a week , as in canada 4 weeks to 12 weeks to see your doctor is not uncommon .
mostly if you are in need , one has to go to emergency were one finds a room full of people waiting for the same thing .
we have had to accept that this is the way things are for now , as it is out of our control .
neither governments or doctors have much control over doctor shortages .
heather , canada we need more gps , but gp friends tell me how difficult -lrb- and expensive -rrb- it is to get into an established general practice .
it 's easier becoming a hospital doctor .
unless you 're obliged to see the doctor at his request , for routine vaccinations , baby checkups and screenings - we should all go private and have health insurance , as in the usa , or pay in advance and reclaim the costs later , as they do in france .
that system would soon winnow out the large numbers of people who clog up surgeries with no good reason .
at present , if we want to go private , we need a referral from our gp , which comes very low in the list of priorities , even though we are forced to ' bribe ' the gp with thirty pounds -lrb- there really is no other word for it -rrb- , just to write a letter .
it 's scandalous .
henry , ilford , essex it 's clear that the government has n't got a clue about management john b , uk the last time i needed an appointment with my doctor i was told i would have to wait a week , or call back in the morning .
so i took the next day off work , called at 830 and was seen at 1050 .
it 's clear that the government has n't got a clue about management , as it 's common knowledge that what is measured gets improved even if that is n't the desired effect .
john b , uk my local doctor surgery in wood green is a shambles .
if i call up - the usual waiting time is 4/5 days .
if it is urgent we are directed to the nearest hospital .
the surgery is run-down , under-staffed and the doctor i see there tells everyone to just go to a & e. totally unacceptable .
the nurse there also breached my patient confidentiality .
my last doctor in brixton was spotless , spacious and i could get in within 24 hours every time .
am trying very hard not to get ill so i do n't have to be messed around and insulted again .
jay , london i have been unable to book an appointment unless it 's two years from now !
in my job i am constantly on the phone and it 's proved impossible as you are on hold for 10 minutes waiting .
then you are given an after hours appointment anyway .
all you needed was to pick up your prescription .
why do i pay my taxes again ?
becks , kent i can get an appointment at the vet any time i want .

being given a target is a very reasonable way of trying to improve performance , however this should not be to the disadvantage of the patient .
advanced bookings should still be a main option , but with penalties for not attending / failing to cancel .
simon gilbert , forest hill , london when i can find a surgery taking on patients , i 'll let you know .
ken , london , uk i am sick of people on here saying doctor 's receptionists are rude and abrupt .

vicky , manchester my doctor 's surgery offers a triage system .
we can talk to a doctor on the phone within an hour who assesses whether or not we need to see someone that day .
short term appointments are not a problem and if you have a regular appointment with the same doctor about a continuing health problem then the doctor can make appointments that override the two week barrier .
the surgery is organised , efficient and has few complaints .
cecilia weightman , bristol , england i have never been able to get an appointment with my gp within 48 hours !
i usually have to wait for 2 - 3 weeks -lrb- i 'm not exaggerating -rrb- .
this means that if i have something that needs urgent attention i have to go to a walk-in centre .
the system really needs to change - it 's a nightmare !
caroline hunter , london i 'm a student and at my gps students are not allowed to make an appointment with a doctor .
we are forced to attend surgeries held by nurses a couple of times a week without an appointment and only get to see a doctor if the nurse thinks it is necessary .
this was even true when i rang up after having visited a & e after an asthma attack and thy had told me to visit the doctor the next day , as well as not being allowed to make an appointment there was no student surgery that day either .
students it sometimes seems are second class citizens not entitled to proper healthcare .
ben hartley , newcastle upon tyne , england although i can see the need for a 2 day response , there are also a significant number of people whose issue is not urgent and need to arrange time off work to see the doctor .
unless they can book an appointment a week in advance they will be unable to obtain the medical help they may need .
robert aleck , london , england when we first moved into the area you could book appointments in advance , then it all changed and you now have to phone the surgery on the day that you want to see the doctor .
this is not very helpful when you have to arrange time off work especially when you have to go for regular check ups .
ruth , widnes , cheshire i find the present gp appointments system much more agreeable than previously , when unless you went to an emergency surgery , you would have to wait at least a week to see a doctor .
now , you can call in the morning and see a doctor that very day .
there are many ailments that would not warrant " emergency status " but that ca n't wait a week to be sorted , and the 48 hour system is the most effective way to deal with these .
i appreciate , however , that the present system does restrict advanced bookings .
liz , bristol , england access to a gp is a lottery .
can not book an appointment until the day you require it .
no calls allowed before 8am then you end up in a queuing system .
standards when you finally get to see your doctor is excellent .
james wilson , irvine , scotland the country is 10,000 gps short nigel madagan , uk i am a gp .
i physically can not provide more appointments than i do .
the government can set as many targets as it likes and change the " rules " regarding access however the problem is lack of appointments and the only way to provide more appointments is to provide more gp 's .
the country is 10,000 gps short -lrb- a problem the government has known about for years -rrb- and it is difficult or impossible to recruit new partners or locum doctors to stand in when i can not be in the surgery .
nigel madagan , uk i can never get an appointment with my gp .
you have to phone on the day that you want an appointment .
i always phone at 8.30 -lrb- as soon as they open -rrb- and the phones lines are either engaged or ring off .
when you finally get to speak to someone they say there are no appointments for the day .
the receptionists are always rude and abrupt .
when i do actually get to see my gp the service is excellent , however , it is a frustrating process and i am seriously considering changing surgeries .
laura , oxford to see the more popular doctors you have to wait at least a week at my health centre , but you can usually see the less popular ones within 48 hours even if it does mean going through the triage nurse first -lrb- a process that really annoys me ! -rrb- .
when i asked why it took so long to get an appointment i was told we had n't enough doctors to cope with the new housing that has gone up in the last few years .
i note that my taxes and contributions have not been altered to reflect this problem !

are you unhappy with advanced access to gp services ?
a survey by the government watchdog , the healthcare commission , suggests that nearly a third of patients are unable to make an appointment to see their gp more than two days in advance .
the poll of 117,000 patients found the majority were happy with services , but some complained that government targets to see people within two days have led to surgeries restricting advance appointments .
tony blair pledged during the election campaign to investigate the problem .
what 's your reaction to the healthcare commission 's findings ?
do you think targets help or hinder ?
have you had difficulty making an advanced booking ?
send us your comments and experiences .
this debate is now closed .
please read a selection of your comments below .
the following comments reflect the balance of opinion received so far : i wonder if they even realise how awkward this is for anyone who has a job ?
m. g. , manchester , uk my gp wo n't do advance appointments at all .
you have to phone between 8:30am and 9am and ask for one on the day you want to go , which means , for me , having to phone in to work saying i 'll be late as i work 20 miles from where i live and until recently was reliant on once-an-hour train service to get there usually they just bark a time at you and you have to turn up , no matter how inconvenient it is .
when it 's routine stuff it would be nice to have even 24 hours notice so i can sort it out with the office rather than having to phone in at the last minute and possibly end up having to take half a day or more off .
then , it 's lucky if the appointment actually happens on time , i 've easily waited 30-60minutes nearly every time as they always run late !
i wonder if they even realise how awkward this is for anyone who has a job ?
m. g. , manchester , uk it happens at my local gp .
you are no longer allowed to book appointments in advance at a time convenient for you , you have to call in the morning to be seen later that day .
this means i have to take a day off work for non-essential appointments where previously i would have got a booking well in advance that did n't require time off .
so in a small way uk plc suffers .
i do n't blame my gp for this , though .
this perverse outcome is a classic example of what happens when the centre over-regulates and micro-manages .
john haywood , hampshire i do n't understand the problem - you need to see a doctor when you are ill - how can you know that you are going to be ill more than 2 days in advance ?
matt munro , bristol , uk just be grateful that you have a high quality free health service name here i ca n't believe some of the trivial whining on this board !
some people seem to believe that gps should prioritise appointments around people 's domestic and social responsibilities !
they do and should prioritise appointments on the basis of clinical need - just be grateful that you have a high quality free health service - most of the world do not and stop whining about having to make phone calls or having to take time off work -lrb- shock horror , how traumatic for you ! -rrb-
which is more important your health or your job ?
matt munro , bristol , uk i find it infuriating whenever i ask for an appointment to see my gp because i have to go through a barrage of questions which concludes with " do you work ? "
i find it ridiculous that i have to justify my working day just so that i might be lucky enough to get an appointment in 4 days time !
it 's insulting .
melanie philpott , torquay , devon this problem could be solved immediately if patients were to act responsibly e , malvern uk this problem could be solved immediately if patients were to act responsibly and only ask to see a doctor if they really need one .
i have been to a gp once in the last 22 years - and i do n't think of myself as particularly healthy .
if i have a minor health problem it will usually be something i can deal with myself , or it will just get better on its own .
pharmacists and the nhs direct service can also be helpful if you are not sure what to do .
leave gps to those who really need them - one day it could be you .
e , malvern uk 48 hours ?
during my last phone call to the gp i was told no appointments available for the next week !
simon taylor-smith , swindon until recently i was a practice manager .
the problem is that pcts and some gps have -lrb- sometimes deliberately -rrb- misinterpreted the target .
there is nothing in the guidelines that states a gp can not offer advanced booking .
these decisions are taken by the individual practice .
also patients sometimes have unreasonable expectations .
one patient arrived at the surgery at 08.45 and was offered an appointment at 09.30 the same morning and then complained that we did n't have anything sooner ! !
chris , london , uk think yourselves lucky you have got a doctor .
i needed a doctor for the first time in over 10 years and i was told that i " was n't in any surgery 's catchment area " so they 'd send me some forms to fill in , i could post them back and they 'd assign me to a local surgery ... by post , obviously .
i was better before i got any forms .
seemed like the best plan ! !
andy , london we have had the 48 hour targets imposed on us , without asking patients or gps what they need or want !
nic , leeds uk i 'm a gp : this does not surprise me !
we have had the 48 hour targets imposed on us , without asking patients or gps what they need or want !
we are trying to offer some pre-bookables , but we still have to meet the 48 hour targets too !
more and more work is being moved from hospitals to primary care : without more doctors and nurses -lrb- i.e. more funding for staff -rrb- we can not hope to provide a decent service for everyone !
nic , leeds uk i think that being able to book on the day you need the appointment has been a good change .
many times i have needed to see the doctor as soon as possible that even waiting a day would be too long .
if i do have a problem which can wait a week then my surgery has no problems making an advance appointment for me -lrb- usually within a week -rrb- .
i do n't know how it works in other surgeries but this system definitely works for me and i hope it stays that way .
laura , london , uk the only people to have gained from the latest gp contract are the gp 's themselves who are paid a lot more for doing less .
they are manipulating the 48 hour rule to their own advantage and yet provide less for the patients .
make the slightest moan and they will de-register you .
chris stevens , london uk i do n't try to go to a gp any more , i just go and sit in a & e and wait steve , uk we now spend more per head than any other country on our health services ; we have had a vast increase in the number of gps , who are the highest paid in the world -lrb- all strange but true -rrb- and what do we hear ?
more money needed , more doctors , more ... more ... more ..
i do n't try to go to a gp any more , i just go and sit in a & e and wait .
steve , uk i never have a problem getting an appointment with the doctor .
what i do have a problem with is getting a proper diagnosis !
susan , london in bolton we have an nhs drop-in centre , you can go there if you ca n't get in to see your gp .
i recently had tonsillitis , could n't get in to see my gp until the next day , so went to the drop in centre .
i was seen within 30 minutes by a well qualified nurse .
also , i tend to see my practice nurse at my doctors surgery , she can do nearly everything my gp can and with hardly any waiting time .
victoria , bolton , lancs you ca n't blame the gps for this .
if it was n't for the idiotic targets that are being set by the government then this would n't be happening .
they have to remember that doctors will try to make the figures work for them , rather like this government will try to put a positive spin on bad news stories .
mark s , manchester , uk you ca n't book ahead at my doctors only on the same day , so there 's a mad rush first thing and you 've no chance if you ring after quarter to nine -lrb- they only open at 8:30 -rrb- jenna , wales this issue was raised in the ' leaders question time special ' shortly before the general election .
i remember an extremely sweaty mr blair being dumfounded by this , and he promised to sort it out - presumably it 's still going on if we are discussing it here today .
about time the government did something about it really !
they 've had four months since that programme and still no action - what a surprise ! !
steve , warrington , uk call up on the morning and partake of the telephone lottery ben bell , canterbury , kent , i can only make an appointment with my gp on that morning .
call up on the morning and partake of the telephone lottery to see if i can get an appointment , if not then better luck tomorrow .
no forward bookings at all .
unfortunately this means that i have to stay at home to call to see if i can get an appointment and be late for work whatever happens .
ben bell , canterbury , kent , england when i was in leeds there was an open surgery for 2 hours in the morning and an hour in the afternoon .
the rest of the time it was pre-booked appointments which were also easy to get .
surely it 's not that complicated ?
laura , aberdeen i rang my doctor today for a non-emergency appointment for my 13 year old son and was given one for 4.30 this afternoon .
i 've never ever had a problem getting an appointment , the doctors are excellent and the receptionists charming !
no , it 's not private and i 'm not telling you where it is or you 'll all join the practice !
i guess its just a lottery really .
lynn , hampshire i am convinced that this is just a public relations exercise to make the health authorities look good david endsor , stockport england i have recently just reached 50 and received a letter from my local primary care trust inviting me to go for a health check -lrb- part of the heart and stroke prevention campaign -rrb- these are given every 5 years .
on phoning my doctors practice to make an appointment i was told the nurses were very busy and short staffed due to holidays , i accepted there advice to ring back in 2 weeks .
i rang the surgery a couple of weeks later and this time was told the clinic was fully booked for 4 weeks and thereafter the program was finished .
i knew i was not going to get an appointment , but what was more annoying was i was also given similar excuses 5 years ago when asked to make an appointment then .
i am convinced that this is just a public relations exercise to make the health authorities look good .
david endsor , stockport england what short memories people have !
i remember - only a few years ago - when a routine doctor 's appointment would often have to be made 10-12 days in advance .
now i can see a doctor in 2 days .
there are some silly things in the current policies , but give credit where it is due , the nhs is now much more responsive than it used to be .
piers , surrey my view , i think supported by the other comments , is that this is a practice management problem .
i have always been able to make appointments up to 1 month in advance , and if i need to see a doctor urgently , i have always been able to within a day .
this is usually not my own doctor , but if it really is an emergency , what does that matter .
john , bristol , uk i live in scotland and have to book an appointment 1 week in advance to see my gp .
so lucky those down south who only have to book 3 days in advance .
i have complained to my gp 's practice manager verbally and in writing all to no avail .
the nhs is a joke .
flora , scotland i am a gps receptionist and i feel that patients do not realise that we do not make the rules .
if we do not have appointments to offer it is not our fault .
the surgery i work in does offer pre bookable appointments up to 2 weeks in advance , i think it is a much fairer system .
please do n't blame the receptionist , they are only doing a job of work like other people , and we do not deserve the publicity that we get .
es , leeds if they can do it why ca n't others ?
jean , wiltshire my doctor 's surgery not only has an appointment system but they also have at least one open surgery a day when you can go and wait and you will be seen .
it is not unusual to arrive at 8.15 in the morning and be at work by 9.a.m.
i also made an appointment 6 weeks in advance without any problem .
if they can do it why ca n't others ?
jean , wiltshire being fortunate not to have had to see my gp for over nine years .
i 'm horrified to read the comments of my fellow readers .
i 'm getting on a bit now and would be more likely to know that if i required a gp appointment or visit , i would get one before i expire .
john graham , edinburgh , scotland recently we took our son to the doctors - the doctor asked us to come back in 7 days .
his receptionist refused to make the booking so we could avoid school hours .
5 days later we spent 30 minutes on the phone trying to get through and then had no option but to take a school hours appointment .
simply ludicrous .
clive , woking being seen when you are ill is what it 's all about sharon , london my surgery offers a 48 hour advance booking service .
this works fantastically .
my doctor 's surgery has about 8 doctors available and you are guaranteed to get seen whilst you are still symptomatic .
people who complain about this kind of service are the type of people who complain at anything .
being seen when you are ill is what it 's all about and i thank and applaud the gp services around the country who work tirelessly to help their patients , despite the constant criticism sharon , london i 'd say so .
i had an infected cyst in my ear which needed treatment but i had to book an appointment at least 7 days in advance .
by the time it actually came round to my appointment , my cyst had cleared up , rendering the appointment pointless .
bob , brighton , uk my elderly father has a long term and serious health problem needs to visit the doctor every 2 weeks or so .
his doctor sees him and says make an appointment for a week friday .
impossible - the reception staff and presumably the practice manager will simply not do it .
the tail wagging the dog ?
wayne , harpenden , uk think yourselves most fortunate that you can see a doctor within a week , as in canada 4 weeks to 12 weeks to see your doctor is not uncommon .
mostly if you are in need , one has to go to emergency were one finds a room full of people waiting for the same thing .
we have had to accept that this is the way things are for now , as it is out of our control .
neither governments or doctors have much control over doctor shortages .
heather , canada we need more gps , but gp friends tell me how difficult -lrb- and expensive -rrb- it is to get into an established general practice .
it 's easier becoming a hospital doctor .
unless you 're obliged to see the doctor at his request , for routine vaccinations , baby checkups and screenings - we should all go private and have health insurance , as in the usa , or pay in advance and reclaim the costs later , as they do in france .
that system would soon winnow out the large numbers of people who clog up surgeries with no good reason .
at present , if we want to go private , we need a referral from our gp , which comes very low in the list of priorities , even though we are forced to ' bribe ' the gp with thirty pounds -lrb- there really is no other word for it -rrb- , just to write a letter .
it 's scandalous .
henry , ilford , essex it 's clear that the government has n't got a clue about management john b , uk the last time i needed an appointment with my doctor i was told i would have to wait a week , or call back in the morning .
so i took the next day off work , called at 830 and was seen at 1050 .
it 's clear that the government has n't got a clue about management , as it 's common knowledge that what is measured gets improved even if that is n't the desired effect .
john b , uk my local doctor surgery in wood green is a shambles .
if i call up - the usual waiting time is 4/5 days .
if it is urgent we are directed to the nearest hospital .
the surgery is run-down , under-staffed and the doctor i see there tells everyone to just go to a & e. totally unacceptable .
the nurse there also breached my patient confidentiality .
my last doctor in brixton was spotless , spacious and i could get in within 24 hours every time .
am trying very hard not to get ill so i do n't have to be messed around and insulted again .
jay , london i have been unable to book an appointment unless it 's two years from now !
in my job i am constantly on the phone and it 's proved impossible as you are on hold for 10 minutes waiting .
then you are given an after hours appointment anyway .
all you needed was to pick up your prescription .
why do i pay my taxes again ?
becks , kent i can get an appointment at the vet any time i want .
i have great difficulty getting to see the doctor .
the only difference is that there is a charge for seeing the vet .
tony , derby my gp surgery seems to operate this system without difficulty .
when my family needs to be seen , we get an appointment the same day .
when we make an advance appointment for routine stuff that is also easily accommodated .
in my opinion the problem is n't the policy , but how come some practices are applying it ?
zoe , tyne and wear i work for the nhs and i believe that this booking issue is something which needs to be resolved because it impacts on other services .
many people ca n't get that appointment with the doctor and so take themselves to a & e instead - because you have to be seen in a & e. this then reflects on the waiting times for a & e. walk in centres are a relatively new and unknown service which should , if properly implemented and advertised , help rectify this problem .
being given a target is a very reasonable way of trying to improve performance , however this should not be to the disadvantage of the patient .
advanced bookings should still be a main option , but with penalties for not attending / failing to cancel .
simon gilbert , forest hill , london when i can find a surgery taking on patients , i 'll let you know .
ken , london , uk i am sick of people on here saying doctor 's receptionists are rude and abrupt .
my wife is a receptionist and the number of patients who are rude to her both on the phone and in the surgery is disgusting .
i find if you speak nicely and calmly to people they reciprocate .
john , huddersfield , england our practice can make urgent appointments within 24 hours and will accept longer term bookings , however when i recently tried to make a non-urgent appointment i was offered a date 22 days later !
they criticise patients for missing appointments , however it is a regular occurrence that the doctors do n't arrive until well after the time of the first appointment that has been booked .
far worse however is the total lack of nhs dentistry , i am faced with a bill of nearly £ 1000 for essential treatment that i am forced to have privately because of a lack of nhs dentists who will take on new patients .
sally marshall , uk i find my local booking arrangements highly annoying .
the only time i have needed to see a doctor over the last 3 years is for my annual appointment to check my contraception .
i have tell my boss in advance that i may be at the doctors on a certain day and cross my fingers that i 'll get an appointment on that particular day when i phone up .
the receptionists are rude , abrupt and frankly , nosey .
although my gp is lovely and once i get past the gatekeepers i have no complaints !
i just wish there was a service where you could book two weeks in advance for routine appointments .
it would make life so much easier for us workers !
anon , thornton why are we penalised in this way ?
pamela abbott , harlow , essex i find the system of not being able to book in advance the most frustrating system ever .
it is not user friendly and would like it changed as urgently as possible .
i understand that some people need to see their gps within 48 hours , but there are usually emergency slots held for these situations .
if you do try to book an appointment , but do n't manage to telephone first thing , then the 48 hour slots go and you have to wait another day - very unsatisfactory !
why are we penalised in this way ?
pamela abbott , harlow , essex as a gp , i have found the 48-hour target to be a ludicrously simplistic idea ; we offer a range of appointments , but find it hard to keep waiting times down and having to keep appointments free ' just in case ' does result in us having quiet days when demand is slack - then everyone rings in the next day !
the government were told at the outset that this was a poor idea .
the underlying problem is that too many appointments are wanted , and insufficient gp 's exist .
the fact that around 10 % of booked appointments are missed makes this worse .
mark williams , grays essex we do not have a problem with nhs but can not find a dentist who will treat me .
our only choice is to go private which we can not afford .
my wife has recently undergone cancer treatment which increases her risk of tooth decay !
david gilbert , rawtenstall , lancashire , uk last week i telephoned my medical centre and requested an routine appointment to see either of the two doctors i normally see and they said the first appointment would be 18 days time .
robert t dicken , stockton-on-teeside , england why does n't the government stop imposing ridiculous targets and strategies on gps and let them get on with what they trained for ?
if they did n't have quite so many bits of paper to fill in justifying every one of their actions then they 'd have time to see a lot more patients .
vicky , manchester my doctor 's surgery offers a triage system .

the following comments reflect the balance of opinion received so far : i wonder if they even realise how awkward this is for anyone who has a job ?
m. g. , manchester , uk my gp wo n't do advance appointments at all .
you have to phone between 8:30am and 9am and ask for one on the day you want to go , which means , for me , having to phone in to work saying i 'll be late as i work 20 miles from where i live and until recently was reliant on once-an-hour train service to get there usually they just bark a time at you and you have to turn up , no matter how inconvenient it is .
when it 's routine stuff it would be nice to have even 24 hours notice so i can sort it out with the office rather than having to phone in at the last minute and possibly end up having to take half a day or more off .
then , it 's lucky if the appointment actually happens on time , i 've easily waited 30-60minutes nearly every time as they always run late !
i wonder if they even realise how awkward this is for anyone who has a job ?
m. g. , manchester , uk it happens at my local gp .
you are no longer allowed to book appointments in advance at a time convenient for you , you have to call in the morning to be seen later that day .
this means i have to take a day off work for non-essential appointments where previously i would have got a booking well in advance that did n't require time off .
so in a small way uk plc suffers .
i do n't blame my gp for this , though .
this perverse outcome is a classic example of what happens when the centre over-regulates and micro-manages .
john haywood , hampshire i do n't understand the problem - you need to see a doctor when you are ill - how can you know that you are going to be ill more than 2 days in advance ?
matt munro , bristol , uk just be grateful that you have a high quality free health service name here i ca n't believe some of the trivial whining on this board !
some people seem to believe that gps should prioritise appointments around people 's domestic and social responsibilities !
they do and should prioritise appointments on the basis of clinical need - just be grateful that you have a high quality free health service - most of the world do not and stop whining about having to make phone calls or having to take time off work -lrb- shock horror , how traumatic for you ! -rrb-
which is more important your health or your job ?
matt munro , bristol , uk i find it infuriating whenever i ask for an appointment to see my gp because i have to go through a barrage of questions which concludes with " do you work ? "
i find it ridiculous that i have to justify my working day just so that i might be lucky enough to get an appointment in 4 days time !
it 's insulting .
melanie philpott , torquay , devon this problem could be solved immediately if patients were to act responsibly e , malvern uk this problem could be solved immediately if patients were to act responsibly and only ask to see a doctor if they really need one .
i have been to a gp once in the last 22 years - and i do n't think of myself as particularly healthy .
if i have a minor health problem it will usually be something i can deal with myself , or it will just get better on its own .
pharmacists and the nhs direct service can also be helpful if you are not sure what to do .
leave gps to those who really need them - one day it could be you .
e , malvern uk 48 hours ?
during my last phone call to the gp i was told no appointments available for the next week !
simon taylor-smith , swindon until recently i was a practice manager .
the problem is that pcts and some gps have -lrb- sometimes deliberately -rrb- misinterpreted the target .
there is nothing in the guidelines that states a gp can not offer advanced booking .
these decisions are taken by the individual practice .
also patients sometimes have unreasonable expectations .
one patient arrived at the surgery at 08.45 and was offered an appointment at 09.30 the same morning and then complained that we did n't have anything sooner ! !
chris , london , uk think yourselves lucky you have got a doctor .
i needed a doctor for the first time in over 10 years and i was told that i " was n't in any surgery 's catchment area " so they 'd send me some forms to fill in , i could post them back and they 'd assign me to a local surgery ... by post , obviously .
i was better before i got any forms .
seemed like the best plan ! !
andy , london we have had the 48 hour targets imposed on us , without asking patients or gps what they need or want !
nic , leeds uk i 'm a gp : this does not surprise me !
we have had the 48 hour targets imposed on us , without asking patients or gps what they need or want !
we are trying to offer some pre-bookables , but we still have to meet the 48 hour targets too !
more and more work is being moved from hospitals to primary care : without more doctors and nurses -lrb- i.e. more funding for staff -rrb- we can not hope to provide a decent service for everyone !
nic , leeds uk i think that being able to book on the day you need the appointment has been a good change .
many times i have needed to see the doctor as soon as possible that even waiting a day would be too long .
if i do have a problem which can wait a week then my surgery has no problems making an advance appointment for me -lrb- usually within a week -rrb- .
i do n't know how it works in other surgeries but this system definitely works for me and i hope it stays that way .
laura , london , uk the only people to have gained from the latest gp contract are the gp 's themselves who are paid a lot more for doing less .
they are manipulating the 48 hour rule to their own advantage and yet provide less for the patients .
make the slightest moan and they will de-register you .
chris stevens , london uk i do n't try to go to a gp any more , i just go and sit in a & e and wait steve , uk we now spend more per head than any other country on our health services ; we have had a vast increase in the number of gps , who are the highest paid in the world -lrb- all strange but true -rrb- and what do we hear ?
more money needed , more doctors , more ... more ... more ..
i do n't try to go to a gp any more , i just go and sit in a & e and wait .
steve , uk i never have a problem getting an appointment with the doctor .
what i do have a problem with is getting a proper diagnosis !
susan , london in bolton we have an nhs drop-in centre , you can go there if you ca n't get in to see your gp .
i recently had tonsillitis , could n't get in to see my gp until the next day , so went to the drop in centre .
i was seen within 30 minutes by a well qualified nurse .
also , i tend to see my practice nurse at my doctors surgery , she can do nearly everything my gp can and with hardly any waiting time .
victoria , bolton , lancs you ca n't blame the gps for this .
if it was n't for the idiotic targets that are being set by the government then this would n't be happening .
they have to remember that doctors will try to make the figures work for them , rather like this government will try to put a positive spin on bad news stories .
mark s , manchester , uk you ca n't book ahead at my doctors only on the same day , so there 's a mad rush first thing and you 've no chance if you ring after quarter to nine -lrb- they only open at 8:30 -rrb- jenna , wales this issue was raised in the ' leaders question time special ' shortly before the general election .
i remember an extremely sweaty mr blair being dumfounded by this , and he promised to sort it out - presumably it 's still going on if we are discussing it here today .
about time the government did something about it really !
they 've had four months since that programme and still no action - what a surprise ! !
steve , warrington , uk call up on the morning and partake of the telephone lottery ben bell , canterbury , kent , i can only make an appointment with my gp on that morning .
call up on the morning and partake of the telephone lottery to see if i can get an appointment , if not then better luck tomorrow .
no forward bookings at all .
unfortunately this means that i have to stay at home to call to see if i can get an appointment and be late for work whatever happens .
ben bell , canterbury , kent , england when i was in leeds there was an open surgery for 2 hours in the morning and an hour in the afternoon .
the rest of the time it was pre-booked appointments which were also easy to get .
surely it 's not that complicated ?
laura , aberdeen i rang my doctor today for a non-emergency appointment for my 13 year old son and was given one for 4.30 this afternoon .
i 've never ever had a problem getting an appointment , the doctors are excellent and the receptionists charming !
no , it 's not private and i 'm not telling you where it is or you 'll all join the practice !
i guess its just a lottery really .
lynn , hampshire i am convinced that this is just a public relations exercise to make the health authorities look good david endsor , stockport england i have recently just reached 50 and received a letter from my local primary care trust inviting me to go for a health check -lrb- part of the heart and stroke prevention campaign -rrb- these are given every 5 years .
on phoning my doctors practice to make an appointment i was told the nurses were very busy and short staffed due to holidays , i accepted there advice to ring back in 2 weeks .
i rang the surgery a couple of weeks later and this time was told the clinic was fully booked for 4 weeks and thereafter the program was finished .
i knew i was not going to get an appointment , but what was more annoying was i was also given similar excuses 5 years ago when asked to make an appointment then .
i am convinced that this is just a public relations exercise to make the health authorities look good .
david endsor , stockport england what short memories people have !
i remember - only a few years ago - when a routine doctor 's appointment would often have to be made 10-12 days in advance .
now i can see a doctor in 2 days .
there are some silly things in the current policies , but give credit where it is due , the nhs is now much more responsive than it used to be .
piers , surrey my view , i think supported by the other comments , is that this is a practice management problem .
i have always been able to make appointments up to 1 month in advance , and if i need to see a doctor urgently , i have always been able to within a day .
this is usually not my own doctor , but if it really is an emergency , what does that matter .
john , bristol , uk i live in scotland and have to book an appointment 1 week in advance to see my gp .
so lucky those down south who only have to book 3 days in advance .
i have complained to my gp 's practice manager verbally and in writing all to no avail .
the nhs is a joke .
flora , scotland i am a gps receptionist and i feel that patients do not realise that we do not make the rules .
if we do not have appointments to offer it is not our fault .
the surgery i work in does offer pre bookable appointments up to 2 weeks in advance , i think it is a much fairer system .
please do n't blame the receptionist , they are only doing a job of work like other people , and we do not deserve the publicity that we get .
es , leeds if they can do it why ca n't others ?
jean , wiltshire my doctor 's surgery not only has an appointment system but they also have at least one open surgery a day when you can go and wait and you will be seen .
it is not unusual to arrive at 8.15 in the morning and be at work by 9.a.m.
i also made an appointment 6 weeks in advance without any problem .
if they can do it why ca n't others ?
jean , wiltshire being fortunate not to have had to see my gp for over nine years .
i 'm horrified to read the comments of my fellow readers .
i 'm getting on a bit now and would be more likely to know that if i required a gp appointment or visit , i would get one before i expire .
john graham , edinburgh , scotland recently we took our son to the doctors - the doctor asked us to come back in 7 days .
his receptionist refused to make the booking so we could avoid school hours .
5 days later we spent 30 minutes on the phone trying to get through and then had no option but to take a school hours appointment .
simply ludicrous .
clive , woking being seen when you are ill is what it 's all about sharon , london my surgery offers a 48 hour advance booking service .
this works fantastically .
my doctor 's surgery has about 8 doctors available and you are guaranteed to get seen whilst you are still symptomatic .
people who complain about this kind of service are the type of people who complain at anything .
being seen when you are ill is what it 's all about and i thank and applaud the gp services around the country who work tirelessly to help their patients , despite the constant criticism sharon , london i 'd say so .
i had an infected cyst in my ear which needed treatment but i had to book an appointment at least 7 days in advance .
by the time it actually came round to my appointment , my cyst had cleared up , rendering the appointment pointless .
bob , brighton , uk my elderly father has a long term and serious health problem needs to visit the doctor every 2 weeks or so .
his doctor sees him and says make an appointment for a week friday .
impossible - the reception staff and presumably the practice manager will simply not do it .
the tail wagging the dog ?
wayne , harpenden , uk think yourselves most fortunate that you can see a doctor within a week , as in canada 4 weeks to 12 weeks to see your doctor is not uncommon .
mostly if you are in need , one has to go to emergency were one finds a room full of people waiting for the same thing .
we have had to accept that this is the way things are for now , as it is out of our control .
neither governments or doctors have much control over doctor shortages .
heather , canada we need more gps , but gp friends tell me how difficult -lrb- and expensive -rrb- it is to get into an established general practice .
it 's easier becoming a hospital doctor .
unless you 're obliged to see the doctor at his request , for routine vaccinations , baby checkups and screenings - we should all go private and have health insurance , as in the usa , or pay in advance and reclaim the costs later , as they do in france .
that system would soon winnow out the large numbers of people who clog up surgeries with no good reason .
at present , if we want to go private , we need a referral from our gp , which comes very low in the list of priorities , even though we are forced to ' bribe ' the gp with thirty pounds -lrb- there really is no other word for it -rrb- , just to write a letter .
it 's scandalous .
henry , ilford , essex it 's clear that the government has n't got a clue about management john b , uk the last time i needed an appointment with my doctor i was told i would have to wait a week , or call back in the morning .
so i took the next day off work , called at 830 and was seen at 1050 .
it 's clear that the government has n't got a clue about management , as it 's common knowledge that what is measured gets improved even if that is n't the desired effect .
john b , uk my local doctor surgery in wood green is a shambles .
if i call up - the usual waiting time is 4/5 days .
if it is urgent we are directed to the nearest hospital .
the surgery is run-down , under-staffed and the doctor i see there tells everyone to just go to a & e. totally unacceptable .
the nurse there also breached my patient confidentiality .
my last doctor in brixton was spotless , spacious and i could get in within 24 hours every time .
am trying very hard not to get ill so i do n't have to be messed around and insulted again .
jay , london i have been unable to book an appointment unless it 's two years from now !
in my job i am constantly on the phone and it 's proved impossible as you are on hold for 10 minutes waiting .
then you are given an after hours appointment anyway .
all you needed was to pick up your prescription .
why do i pay my taxes again ?
becks , kent i can get an appointment at the vet any time i want .
i have great difficulty getting to see the doctor .
the only difference is that there is a charge for seeing the vet .
tony , derby my gp surgery seems to operate this system without difficulty .
when my family needs to be seen , we get an appointment the same day .
when we make an advance appointment for routine stuff that is also easily accommodated .
in my opinion the problem is n't the policy , but how come some practices are applying it ?
zoe , tyne and wear i work for the nhs and i believe that this booking issue is something which needs to be resolved because it impacts on other services .
many people ca n't get that appointment with the doctor and so take themselves to a & e instead - because you have to be seen in a & e. this then reflects on the waiting times for a & e. walk in centres are a relatively new and unknown service which should , if properly implemented and advertised , help rectify this problem .
being given a target is a very reasonable way of trying to improve performance , however this should not be to the disadvantage of the patient .
advanced bookings should still be a main option , but with penalties for not attending / failing to cancel .
simon gilbert , forest hill , london when i can find a surgery taking on patients , i 'll let you know .
ken , london , uk i am sick of people on here saying doctor 's receptionists are rude and abrupt .
my wife is a receptionist and the number of patients who are rude to her both on the phone and in the surgery is disgusting .
i find if you speak nicely and calmly to people they reciprocate .
john , huddersfield , england our practice can make urgent appointments within 24 hours and will accept longer term bookings , however when i recently tried to make a non-urgent appointment i was offered a date 22 days later !
they criticise patients for missing appointments , however it is a regular occurrence that the doctors do n't arrive until well after the time of the first appointment that has been booked .
far worse however is the total lack of nhs dentistry , i am faced with a bill of nearly £ 1000 for essential treatment that i am forced to have privately because of a lack of nhs dentists who will take on new patients .
sally marshall , uk i find my local booking arrangements highly annoying .
the only time i have needed to see a doctor over the last 3 years is for my annual appointment to check my contraception .
i have tell my boss in advance that i may be at the doctors on a certain day and cross my fingers that i 'll get an appointment on that particular day when i phone up .
the receptionists are rude , abrupt and frankly , nosey .
although my gp is lovely and once i get past the gatekeepers i have no complaints !
i just wish there was a service where you could book two weeks in advance for routine appointments .
it would make life so much easier for us workers !
anon , thornton why are we penalised in this way ?
pamela abbott , harlow , essex i find the system of not being able to book in advance the most frustrating system ever .
it is not user friendly and would like it changed as urgently as possible .
i understand that some people need to see their gps within 48 hours , but there are usually emergency slots held for these situations .
if you do try to book an appointment , but do n't manage to telephone first thing , then the 48 hour slots go and you have to wait another day - very unsatisfactory !
why are we penalised in this way ?
pamela abbott , harlow , essex as a gp , i have found the 48-hour target to be a ludicrously simplistic idea ; we offer a range of appointments , but find it hard to keep waiting times down and having to keep appointments free ' just in case ' does result in us having quiet days when demand is slack - then everyone rings in the next day !
the government were told at the outset that this was a poor idea .
the underlying problem is that too many appointments are wanted , and insufficient gp 's exist .
the fact that around 10 % of booked appointments are missed makes this worse .
mark williams , grays essex we do not have a problem with nhs but can not find a dentist who will treat me .
our only choice is to go private which we can not afford .
my wife has recently undergone cancer treatment which increases her risk of tooth decay !
david gilbert , rawtenstall , lancashire , uk last week i telephoned my medical centre and requested an routine appointment to see either of the two doctors i normally see and they said the first appointment would be 18 days time .
robert t dicken , stockton-on-teeside , england why does n't the government stop imposing ridiculous targets and strategies on gps and let them get on with what they trained for ?
if they did n't have quite so many bits of paper to fill in justifying every one of their actions then they 'd have time to see a lot more patients .
vicky , manchester my doctor 's surgery offers a triage system .
we can talk to a doctor on the phone within an hour who assesses whether or not we need to see someone that day .
short term appointments are not a problem and if you have a regular appointment with the same doctor about a continuing health problem then the doctor can make appointments that override the two week barrier .
the surgery is organised , efficient and has few complaints .
cecilia weightman , bristol , england i have never been able to get an appointment with my gp within 48 hours !
i usually have to wait for 2 - 3 weeks -lrb- i 'm not exaggerating -rrb- .
this means that if i have something that needs urgent attention i have to go to a walk-in centre .
the system really needs to change - it 's a nightmare !
caroline hunter , london i 'm a student and at my gps students are not allowed to make an appointment with a doctor .
we are forced to attend surgeries held by nurses a couple of times a week without an appointment and only get to see a doctor if the nurse thinks it is necessary .
this was even true when i rang up after having visited a & e after an asthma attack and thy had told me to visit the doctor the next day , as well as not being allowed to make an appointment there was no student surgery that day either .
students it sometimes seems are second class citizens not entitled to proper healthcare .
ben hartley , newcastle upon tyne , england although i can see the need for a 2 day response , there are also a significant number of people whose issue is not urgent and need to arrange time off work to see the doctor .
unless they can book an appointment a week in advance they will be unable to obtain the medical help they may need .
robert aleck , london , england when we first moved into the area you could book appointments in advance , then it all changed and you now have to phone the surgery on the day that you want to see the doctor .
this is not very helpful when you have to arrange time off work especially when you have to go for regular check ups .
ruth , widnes , cheshire i find the present gp appointments system much more agreeable than previously , when unless you went to an emergency surgery , you would have to wait at least a week to see a doctor .
now , you can call in the morning and see a doctor that very day .
there are many ailments that would not warrant " emergency status " but that ca n't wait a week to be sorted , and the 48 hour system is the most effective way to deal with these .
i appreciate , however , that the present system does restrict advanced bookings .
liz , bristol , england access to a gp is a lottery .
can not book an appointment until the day you require it .
no calls allowed before 8am then you end up in a queuing system .
standards when you finally get to see your doctor is excellent .
james wilson , irvine , scotland the country is 10,000 gps short nigel madagan , uk i am a gp .
i physically can not provide more appointments than i do .
the government can set as many targets as it likes and change the " rules " regarding access however the problem is lack of appointments and the only way to provide more appointments is to provide more gp 's .
the country is 10,000 gps short -lrb- a problem the government has known about for years -rrb- and it is difficult or impossible to recruit new partners or locum doctors to stand in when i can not be in the surgery .
nigel madagan , uk i can never get an appointment with my gp .
you have to phone on the day that you want an appointment .
i always phone at 8.30 -lrb- as soon as they open -rrb- and the phones lines are either engaged or ring off .
when you finally get to speak to someone they say there are no appointments for the day .
the receptionists are always rude and abrupt .
when i do actually get to see my gp the service is excellent , however , it is a frustrating process and i am seriously considering changing surgeries .
laura , oxford to see the more popular doctors you have to wait at least a week at my health centre , but you can usually see the less popular ones within 48 hours even if it does mean going through the triage nurse first -lrb- a process that really annoys me ! -rrb- .
when i asked why it took so long to get an appointment i was told we had n't enough doctors to cope with the new housing that has gone up in the last few years .
i note that my taxes and contributions have not been altered to reflect this problem !

are you unhappy with advanced access to gp services ?
a survey by the government watchdog , the healthcare commission , suggests that nearly a third of patients are unable to make an appointment to see their gp more than two days in advance .
the poll of 117,000 patients found the majority were happy with services , but some complained that government targets to see people within two days have led to surgeries restricting advance appointments .
tony blair pledged during the election campaign to investigate the problem .
what 's your reaction to the healthcare commission 's findings ?
do you think targets help or hinder ?
have you had difficulty making an advanced booking ?

m. g. , manchester , uk my gp wo n't do advance appointments at all .
you have to phone between 8:30am and 9am and ask for one on the day you want to go , which means , for me , having to phone in to work saying i 'll be late as i work 20 miles from where i live and until recently was reliant on once-an-hour train service to get there usually they just bark a time at you and you have to turn up , no matter how inconvenient it is .
when it 's routine stuff it would be nice to have even 24 hours notice so i can sort it out with the office rather than having to phone in at the last minute and possibly end up having to take half a day or more off .
then , it 's lucky if the appointment actually happens on time , i 've easily waited 30-60minutes nearly every time as they always run late !

i do n't try to go to a gp any more , i just go and sit in a & e and wait .
steve , uk i never have a problem getting an appointment with the doctor .
what i do have a problem with is getting a proper diagnosis !
susan , london in bolton we have an nhs drop-in centre , you can go there if you ca n't get in to see your gp .
i recently had tonsillitis , could n't get in to see my gp until the next day , so went to the drop in centre .
i was seen within 30 minutes by a well qualified nurse .
also , i tend to see my practice nurse at my doctors surgery , she can do nearly everything my gp can and with hardly any waiting time .
victoria , bolton , lancs you ca n't blame the gps for this .
if it was n't for the idiotic targets that are being set by the government then this would n't be happening .
they have to remember that doctors will try to make the figures work for them , rather like this government will try to put a positive spin on bad news stories .
mark s , manchester , uk you ca n't book ahead at my doctors only on the same day , so there 's a mad rush first thing and you 've no chance if you ring after quarter to nine -lrb- they only open at 8:30 -rrb- jenna , wales this issue was raised in the ' leaders question time special ' shortly before the general election .
i remember an extremely sweaty mr blair being dumfounded by this , and he promised to sort it out - presumably it 's still going on if we are discussing it here today .
about time the government did something about it really !
they 've had four months since that programme and still no action - what a surprise ! !
steve , warrington , uk call up on the morning and partake of the telephone lottery ben bell , canterbury , kent , i can only make an appointment with my gp on that morning .
call up on the morning and partake of the telephone lottery to see if i can get an appointment , if not then better luck tomorrow .
no forward bookings at all .
unfortunately this means that i have to stay at home to call to see if i can get an appointment and be late for work whatever happens .
ben bell , canterbury , kent , england when i was in leeds there was an open surgery for 2 hours in the morning and an hour in the afternoon .
the rest of the time it was pre-booked appointments which were also easy to get .
surely it 's not that complicated ?
laura , aberdeen i rang my doctor today for a non-emergency appointment for my 13 year old son and was given one for 4.30 this afternoon .
i 've never ever had a problem getting an appointment , the doctors are excellent and the receptionists charming !
no , it 's not private and i 'm not telling you where it is or you 'll all join the practice !
i guess its just a lottery really .
lynn , hampshire i am convinced that this is just a public relations exercise to make the health authorities look good david endsor , stockport england i have recently just reached 50 and received a letter from my local primary care trust inviting me to go for a health check -lrb- part of the heart and stroke prevention campaign -rrb- these are given every 5 years .
on phoning my doctors practice to make an appointment i was told the nurses were very busy and short staffed due to holidays , i accepted there advice to ring back in 2 weeks .
i rang the surgery a couple of weeks later and this time was told the clinic was fully booked for 4 weeks and thereafter the program was finished .
i knew i was not going to get an appointment , but what was more annoying was i was also given similar excuses 5 years ago when asked to make an appointment then .
i am convinced that this is just a public relations exercise to make the health authorities look good .
david endsor , stockport england what short memories people have !
i remember - only a few years ago - when a routine doctor 's appointment would often have to be made 10-12 days in advance .
now i can see a doctor in 2 days .
there are some silly things in the current policies , but give credit where it is due , the nhs is now much more responsive than it used to be .
piers , surrey my view , i think supported by the other comments , is that this is a practice management problem .
i have always been able to make appointments up to 1 month in advance , and if i need to see a doctor urgently , i have always been able to within a day .
this is usually not my own doctor , but if it really is an emergency , what does that matter .
john , bristol , uk i live in scotland and have to book an appointment 1 week in advance to see my gp .
so lucky those down south who only have to book 3 days in advance .
i have complained to my gp 's practice manager verbally and in writing all to no avail .
the nhs is a joke .
flora , scotland i am a gps receptionist and i feel that patients do not realise that we do not make the rules .
if we do not have appointments to offer it is not our fault .
the surgery i work in does offer pre bookable appointments up to 2 weeks in advance , i think it is a much fairer system .
please do n't blame the receptionist , they are only doing a job of work like other people , and we do not deserve the publicity that we get .
es , leeds if they can do it why ca n't others ?
jean , wiltshire my doctor 's surgery not only has an appointment system but they also have at least one open surgery a day when you can go and wait and you will be seen .
it is not unusual to arrive at 8.15 in the morning and be at work by 9.a.m.
i also made an appointment 6 weeks in advance without any problem .
if they can do it why ca n't others ?
jean , wiltshire being fortunate not to have had to see my gp for over nine years .
i 'm horrified to read the comments of my fellow readers .
i 'm getting on a bit now and would be more likely to know that if i required a gp appointment or visit , i would get one before i expire .
john graham , edinburgh , scotland recently we took our son to the doctors - the doctor asked us to come back in 7 days .
his receptionist refused to make the booking so we could avoid school hours .
5 days later we spent 30 minutes on the phone trying to get through and then had no option but to take a school hours appointment .
simply ludicrous .
clive , woking being seen when you are ill is what it 's all about sharon , london my surgery offers a 48 hour advance booking service .
this works fantastically .
my doctor 's surgery has about 8 doctors available and you are guaranteed to get seen whilst you are still symptomatic .
people who complain about this kind of service are the type of people who complain at anything .
being seen when you are ill is what it 's all about and i thank and applaud the gp services around the country who work tirelessly to help their patients , despite the constant criticism sharon , london i 'd say so .
i had an infected cyst in my ear which needed treatment but i had to book an appointment at least 7 days in advance .
by the time it actually came round to my appointment , my cyst had cleared up , rendering the appointment pointless .
bob , brighton , uk my elderly father has a long term and serious health problem needs to visit the doctor every 2 weeks or so .
his doctor sees him and says make an appointment for a week friday .
impossible - the reception staff and presumably the practice manager will simply not do it .
the tail wagging the dog ?
wayne , harpenden , uk think yourselves most fortunate that you can see a doctor within a week , as in canada 4 weeks to 12 weeks to see your doctor is not uncommon .
mostly if you are in need , one has to go to emergency were one finds a room full of people waiting for the same thing .
we have had to accept that this is the way things are for now , as it is out of our control .
neither governments or doctors have much control over doctor shortages .
heather , canada we need more gps , but gp friends tell me how difficult -lrb- and expensive -rrb- it is to get into an established general practice .
it 's easier becoming a hospital doctor .
unless you 're obliged to see the doctor at his request , for routine vaccinations , baby checkups and screenings - we should all go private and have health insurance , as in the usa , or pay in advance and reclaim the costs later , as they do in france .
that system would soon winnow out the large numbers of people who clog up surgeries with no good reason .
at present , if we want to go private , we need a referral from our gp , which comes very low in the list of priorities , even though we are forced to ' bribe ' the gp with thirty pounds -lrb- there really is no other word for it -rrb- , just to write a letter .
it 's scandalous .
henry , ilford , essex it 's clear that the government has n't got a clue about management john b , uk the last time i needed an appointment with my doctor i was told i would have to wait a week , or call back in the morning .
so i took the next day off work , called at 830 and was seen at 1050 .
it 's clear that the government has n't got a clue about management , as it 's common knowledge that what is measured gets improved even if that is n't the desired effect .
john b , uk my local doctor surgery in wood green is a shambles .
if i call up - the usual waiting time is 4/5 days .
if it is urgent we are directed to the nearest hospital .
the surgery is run-down , under-staffed and the doctor i see there tells everyone to just go to a & e. totally unacceptable .
the nurse there also breached my patient confidentiality .
my last doctor in brixton was spotless , spacious and i could get in within 24 hours every time .
am trying very hard not to get ill so i do n't have to be messed around and insulted again .
jay , london i have been unable to book an appointment unless it 's two years from now !
in my job i am constantly on the phone and it 's proved impossible as you are on hold for 10 minutes waiting .
then you are given an after hours appointment anyway .
all you needed was to pick up your prescription .
why do i pay my taxes again ?
becks , kent i can get an appointment at the vet any time i want .
i have great difficulty getting to see the doctor .
the only difference is that there is a charge for seeing the vet .
tony , derby my gp surgery seems to operate this system without difficulty .
when my family needs to be seen , we get an appointment the same day .
when we make an advance appointment for routine stuff that is also easily accommodated .
in my opinion the problem is n't the policy , but how come some practices are applying it ?
zoe , tyne and wear i work for the nhs and i believe that this booking issue is something which needs to be resolved because it impacts on other services .
many people ca n't get that appointment with the doctor and so take themselves to a & e instead - because you have to be seen in a & e. this then reflects on the waiting times for a & e. walk in centres are a relatively new and unknown service which should , if properly implemented and advertised , help rectify this problem .
being given a target is a very reasonable way of trying to improve performance , however this should not be to the disadvantage of the patient .
advanced bookings should still be a main option , but with penalties for not attending / failing to cancel .
simon gilbert , forest hill , london when i can find a surgery taking on patients , i 'll let you know .
ken , london , uk i am sick of people on here saying doctor 's receptionists are rude and abrupt .
my wife is a receptionist and the number of patients who are rude to her both on the phone and in the surgery is disgusting .
i find if you speak nicely and calmly to people they reciprocate .
john , huddersfield , england our practice can make urgent appointments within 24 hours and will accept longer term bookings , however when i recently tried to make a non-urgent appointment i was offered a date 22 days later !
they criticise patients for missing appointments , however it is a regular occurrence that the doctors do n't arrive until well after the time of the first appointment that has been booked .
far worse however is the total lack of nhs dentistry , i am faced with a bill of nearly £ 1000 for essential treatment that i am forced to have privately because of a lack of nhs dentists who will take on new patients .
sally marshall , uk i find my local booking arrangements highly annoying .
the only time i have needed to see a doctor over the last 3 years is for my annual appointment to check my contraception .
i have tell my boss in advance that i may be at the doctors on a certain day and cross my fingers that i 'll get an appointment on that particular day when i phone up .
the receptionists are rude , abrupt and frankly , nosey .
although my gp is lovely and once i get past the gatekeepers i have no complaints !
i just wish there was a service where you could book two weeks in advance for routine appointments .
it would make life so much easier for us workers !
anon , thornton why are we penalised in this way ?
pamela abbott , harlow , essex i find the system of not being able to book in advance the most frustrating system ever .
it is not user friendly and would like it changed as urgently as possible .
i understand that some people need to see their gps within 48 hours , but there are usually emergency slots held for these situations .
if you do try to book an appointment , but do n't manage to telephone first thing , then the 48 hour slots go and you have to wait another day - very unsatisfactory !
why are we penalised in this way ?
pamela abbott , harlow , essex as a gp , i have found the 48-hour target to be a ludicrously simplistic idea ; we offer a range of appointments , but find it hard to keep waiting times down and having to keep appointments free ' just in case ' does result in us having quiet days when demand is slack - then everyone rings in the next day !
the government were told at the outset that this was a poor idea .
the underlying problem is that too many appointments are wanted , and insufficient gp 's exist .
the fact that around 10 % of booked appointments are missed makes this worse .
mark williams , grays essex we do not have a problem with nhs but can not find a dentist who will treat me .
our only choice is to go private which we can not afford .
my wife has recently undergone cancer treatment which increases her risk of tooth decay !
david gilbert , rawtenstall , lancashire , uk last week i telephoned my medical centre and requested an routine appointment to see either of the two doctors i normally see and they said the first appointment would be 18 days time .
robert t dicken , stockton-on-teeside , england why does n't the government stop imposing ridiculous targets and strategies on gps and let them get on with what they trained for ?
if they did n't have quite so many bits of paper to fill in justifying every one of their actions then they 'd have time to see a lot more patients .
vicky , manchester my doctor 's surgery offers a triage system .
we can talk to a doctor on the phone within an hour who assesses whether or not we need to see someone that day .
short term appointments are not a problem and if you have a regular appointment with the same doctor about a continuing health problem then the doctor can make appointments that override the two week barrier .
the surgery is organised , efficient and has few complaints .
cecilia weightman , bristol , england i have never been able to get an appointment with my gp within 48 hours !
i usually have to wait for 2 - 3 weeks -lrb- i 'm not exaggerating -rrb- .
this means that if i have something that needs urgent attention i have to go to a walk-in centre .
the system really needs to change - it 's a nightmare !
caroline hunter , london i 'm a student and at my gps students are not allowed to make an appointment with a doctor .
we are forced to attend surgeries held by nurses a couple of times a week without an appointment and only get to see a doctor if the nurse thinks it is necessary .
this was even true when i rang up after having visited a & e after an asthma attack and thy had told me to visit the doctor the next day , as well as not being allowed to make an appointment there was no student surgery that day either .
students it sometimes seems are second class citizens not entitled to proper healthcare .
ben hartley , newcastle upon tyne , england although i can see the need for a 2 day response , there are also a significant number of people whose issue is not urgent and need to arrange time off work to see the doctor .
unless they can book an appointment a week in advance they will be unable to obtain the medical help they may need .
robert aleck , london , england when we first moved into the area you could book appointments in advance , then it all changed and you now have to phone the surgery on the day that you want to see the doctor .
this is not very helpful when you have to arrange time off work especially when you have to go for regular check ups .
ruth , widnes , cheshire i find the present gp appointments system much more agreeable than previously , when unless you went to an emergency surgery , you would have to wait at least a week to see a doctor .
now , you can call in the morning and see a doctor that very day .
there are many ailments that would not warrant " emergency status " but that ca n't wait a week to be sorted , and the 48 hour system is the most effective way to deal with these .
i appreciate , however , that the present system does restrict advanced bookings .
liz , bristol , england access to a gp is a lottery .
can not book an appointment until the day you require it .
no calls allowed before 8am then you end up in a queuing system .
standards when you finally get to see your doctor is excellent .
james wilson , irvine , scotland the country is 10,000 gps short nigel madagan , uk i am a gp .
i physically can not provide more appointments than i do .
the government can set as many targets as it likes and change the " rules " regarding access however the problem is lack of appointments and the only way to provide more appointments is to provide more gp 's .
the country is 10,000 gps short -lrb- a problem the government has known about for years -rrb- and it is difficult or impossible to recruit new partners or locum doctors to stand in when i can not be in the surgery .
nigel madagan , uk i can never get an appointment with my gp .
you have to phone on the day that you want an appointment .
i always phone at 8.30 -lrb- as soon as they open -rrb- and the phones lines are either engaged or ring off .
when you finally get to speak to someone they say there are no appointments for the day .
the receptionists are always rude and abrupt .
when i do actually get to see my gp the service is excellent , however , it is a frustrating process and i am seriously considering changing surgeries .
laura , oxford to see the more popular doctors you have to wait at least a week at my health centre , but you can usually see the less popular ones within 48 hours even if it does mean going through the triage nurse first -lrb- a process that really annoys me ! -rrb- .
when i asked why it took so long to get an appointment i was told we had n't enough doctors to cope with the new housing that has gone up in the last few years .
i note that my taxes and contributions have not been altered to reflect this problem !

are you unhappy with advanced access to gp services ?
a survey by the government watchdog , the healthcare commission , suggests that nearly a third of patients are unable to make an appointment to see their gp more than two days in advance .
the poll of 117,000 patients found the majority were happy with services , but some complained that government targets to see people within two days have led to surgeries restricting advance appointments .
tony blair pledged during the election campaign to investigate the problem .
what 's your reaction to the healthcare commission 's findings ?
do you think targets help or hinder ?
have you had difficulty making an advanced booking ?
send us your comments and experiences .
this debate is now closed .
please read a selection of your comments below .
the following comments reflect the balance of opinion received so far : i wonder if they even realise how awkward this is for anyone who has a job ?
m. g. , manchester , uk my gp wo n't do advance appointments at all .
you have to phone between 8:30am and 9am and ask for one on the day you want to go , which means , for me , having to phone in to work saying i 'll be late as i work 20 miles from where i live and until recently was reliant on once-an-hour train service to get there usually they just bark a time at you and you have to turn up , no matter how inconvenient it is .
when it 's routine stuff it would be nice to have even 24 hours notice so i can sort it out with the office rather than having to phone in at the last minute and possibly end up having to take half a day or more off .
then , it 's lucky if the appointment actually happens on time , i 've easily waited 30-60minutes nearly every time as they always run late !
i wonder if they even realise how awkward this is for anyone who has a job ?
m. g. , manchester , uk it happens at my local gp .
you are no longer allowed to book appointments in advance at a time convenient for you , you have to call in the morning to be seen later that day .
this means i have to take a day off work for non-essential appointments where previously i would have got a booking well in advance that did n't require time off .
so in a small way uk plc suffers .
i do n't blame my gp for this , though .
this perverse outcome is a classic example of what happens when the centre over-regulates and micro-manages .
john haywood , hampshire i do n't understand the problem - you need to see a doctor when you are ill - how can you know that you are going to be ill more than 2 days in advance ?
matt munro , bristol , uk just be grateful that you have a high quality free health service name here i ca n't believe some of the trivial whining on this board !
some people seem to believe that gps should prioritise appointments around people 's domestic and social responsibilities !
they do and should prioritise appointments on the basis of clinical need - just be grateful that you have a high quality free health service - most of the world do not and stop whining about having to make phone calls or having to take time off work -lrb- shock horror , how traumatic for you ! -rrb-
which is more important your health or your job ?
matt munro , bristol , uk i find it infuriating whenever i ask for an appointment to see my gp because i have to go through a barrage of questions which concludes with " do you work ? "
i find it ridiculous that i have to justify my working day just so that i might be lucky enough to get an appointment in 4 days time !
it 's insulting .
melanie philpott , torquay , devon this problem could be solved immediately if patients were to act responsibly e , malvern uk this problem could be solved immediately if patients were to act responsibly and only ask to see a doctor if they really need one .
i have been to a gp once in the last 22 years - and i do n't think of myself as particularly healthy .
if i have a minor health problem it will usually be something i can deal with myself , or it will just get better on its own .
pharmacists and the nhs direct service can also be helpful if you are not sure what to do .
leave gps to those who really need them - one day it could be you .
e , malvern uk 48 hours ?
during my last phone call to the gp i was told no appointments available for the next week !
simon taylor-smith , swindon until recently i was a practice manager .
the problem is that pcts and some gps have -lrb- sometimes deliberately -rrb- misinterpreted the target .
there is nothing in the guidelines that states a gp can not offer advanced booking .
these decisions are taken by the individual practice .
also patients sometimes have unreasonable expectations .
one patient arrived at the surgery at 08.45 and was offered an appointment at 09.30 the same morning and then complained that we did n't have anything sooner ! !
chris , london , uk think yourselves lucky you have got a doctor .
i needed a doctor for the first time in over 10 years and i was told that i " was n't in any surgery 's catchment area " so they 'd send me some forms to fill in , i could post them back and they 'd assign me to a local surgery ... by post , obviously .
i was better before i got any forms .
seemed like the best plan ! !
andy , london we have had the 48 hour targets imposed on us , without asking patients or gps what they need or want !
nic , leeds uk i 'm a gp : this does not surprise me !
we have had the 48 hour targets imposed on us , without asking patients or gps what they need or want !
we are trying to offer some pre-bookables , but we still have to meet the 48 hour targets too !
more and more work is being moved from hospitals to primary care : without more doctors and nurses -lrb- i.e. more funding for staff -rrb- we can not hope to provide a decent service for everyone !
nic , leeds uk i think that being able to book on the day you need the appointment has been a good change .
many times i have needed to see the doctor as soon as possible that even waiting a day would be too long .
if i do have a problem which can wait a week then my surgery has no problems making an advance appointment for me -lrb- usually within a week -rrb- .
i do n't know how it works in other surgeries but this system definitely works for me and i hope it stays that way .
laura , london , uk the only people to have gained from the latest gp contract are the gp 's themselves who are paid a lot more for doing less .
they are manipulating the 48 hour rule to their own advantage and yet provide less for the patients .
make the slightest moan and they will de-register you .
chris stevens , london uk i do n't try to go to a gp any more , i just go and sit in a & e and wait steve , uk we now spend more per head than any other country on our health services ; we have had a vast increase in the number of gps , who are the highest paid in the world -lrb- all strange but true -rrb- and what do we hear ?
more money needed , more doctors , more ... more ... more ..
i do n't try to go to a gp any more , i just go and sit in a & e and wait .
steve , uk i never have a problem getting an appointment with the doctor .
what i do have a problem with is getting a proper diagnosis !
susan , london in bolton we have an nhs drop-in centre , you can go there if you ca n't get in to see your gp .

i was seen within 30 minutes by a well qualified nurse .

john graham , edinburgh , scotland recently we took our son to the doctors - the doctor asked us to come back in 7 days .
his receptionist refused to make the booking so we could avoid school hours .
5 days later we spent 30 minutes on the phone trying to get through and then had no option but to take a school hours appointment .
simply ludicrous .
clive , woking being seen when you are ill is what it 's all about sharon , london my surgery offers a 48 hour advance booking service .
this works fantastically .
my doctor 's surgery has about 8 doctors available and you are guaranteed to get seen whilst you are still symptomatic .
people who complain about this kind of service are the type of people who complain at anything .
being seen when you are ill is what it 's all about and i thank and applaud the gp services around the country who work tirelessly to help their patients , despite the constant criticism sharon , london i 'd say so .
i had an infected cyst in my ear which needed treatment but i had to book an appointment at least 7 days in advance .
by the time it actually came round to my appointment , my cyst had cleared up , rendering the appointment pointless .
bob , brighton , uk my elderly father has a long term and serious health problem needs to visit the doctor every 2 weeks or so .
his doctor sees him and says make an appointment for a week friday .
impossible - the reception staff and presumably the practice manager will simply not do it .
the tail wagging the dog ?
wayne , harpenden , uk think yourselves most fortunate that you can see a doctor within a week , as in canada 4 weeks to 12 weeks to see your doctor is not uncommon .
mostly if you are in need , one has to go to emergency were one finds a room full of people waiting for the same thing .
we have had to accept that this is the way things are for now , as it is out of our control .
neither governments or doctors have much control over doctor shortages .
heather , canada we need more gps , but gp friends tell me how difficult -lrb- and expensive -rrb- it is to get into an established general practice .
it 's easier becoming a hospital doctor .
unless you 're obliged to see the doctor at his request , for routine vaccinations , baby checkups and screenings - we should all go private and have health insurance , as in the usa , or pay in advance and reclaim the costs later , as they do in france .
that system would soon winnow out the large numbers of people who clog up surgeries with no good reason .
at present , if we want to go private , we need a referral from our gp , which comes very low in the list of priorities , even though we are forced to ' bribe ' the gp with thirty pounds -lrb- there really is no other word for it -rrb- , just to write a letter .
it 's scandalous .
henry , ilford , essex it 's clear that the government has n't got a clue about management john b , uk the last time i needed an appointment with my doctor i was told i would have to wait a week , or call back in the morning .
so i took the next day off work , called at 830 and was seen at 1050 .
it 's clear that the government has n't got a clue about management , as it 's common knowledge that what is measured gets improved even if that is n't the desired effect .
john b , uk my local doctor surgery in wood green is a shambles .
if i call up - the usual waiting time is 4/5 days .
if it is urgent we are directed to the nearest hospital .
the surgery is run-down , under-staffed and the doctor i see there tells everyone to just go to a & e. totally unacceptable .
the nurse there also breached my patient confidentiality .
my last doctor in brixton was spotless , spacious and i could get in within 24 hours every time .
am trying very hard not to get ill so i do n't have to be messed around and insulted again .
jay , london i have been unable to book an appointment unless it 's two years from now !
in my job i am constantly on the phone and it 's proved impossible as you are on hold for 10 minutes waiting .
then you are given an after hours appointment anyway .
all you needed was to pick up your prescription .
why do i pay my taxes again ?
becks , kent i can get an appointment at the vet any time i want .
i have great difficulty getting to see the doctor .
the only difference is that there is a charge for seeing the vet .
tony , derby my gp surgery seems to operate this system without difficulty .
when my family needs to be seen , we get an appointment the same day .
when we make an advance appointment for routine stuff that is also easily accommodated .
in my opinion the problem is n't the policy , but how come some practices are applying it ?
zoe , tyne and wear i work for the nhs and i believe that this booking issue is something which needs to be resolved because it impacts on other services .
many people ca n't get that appointment with the doctor and so take themselves to a & e instead - because you have to be seen in a & e. this then reflects on the waiting times for a & e. walk in centres are a relatively new and unknown service which should , if properly implemented and advertised , help rectify this problem .
being given a target is a very reasonable way of trying to improve performance , however this should not be to the disadvantage of the patient .
advanced bookings should still be a main option , but with penalties for not attending / failing to cancel .
simon gilbert , forest hill , london when i can find a surgery taking on patients , i 'll let you know .
ken , london , uk i am sick of people on here saying doctor 's receptionists are rude and abrupt .
my wife is a receptionist and the number of patients who are rude to her both on the phone and in the surgery is disgusting .
i find if you speak nicely and calmly to people they reciprocate .
john , huddersfield , england our practice can make urgent appointments within 24 hours and will accept longer term bookings , however when i recently tried to make a non-urgent appointment i was offered a date 22 days later !
they criticise patients for missing appointments , however it is a regular occurrence that the doctors do n't arrive until well after the time of the first appointment that has been booked .
far worse however is the total lack of nhs dentistry , i am faced with a bill of nearly £ 1000 for essential treatment that i am forced to have privately because of a lack of nhs dentists who will take on new patients .
sally marshall , uk i find my local booking arrangements highly annoying .
the only time i have needed to see a doctor over the last 3 years is for my annual appointment to check my contraception .
i have tell my boss in advance that i may be at the doctors on a certain day and cross my fingers that i 'll get an appointment on that particular day when i phone up .
the receptionists are rude , abrupt and frankly , nosey .
although my gp is lovely and once i get past the gatekeepers i have no complaints !
i just wish there was a service where you could book two weeks in advance for routine appointments .
it would make life so much easier for us workers !
anon , thornton why are we penalised in this way ?
pamela abbott , harlow , essex i find the system of not being able to book in advance the most frustrating system ever .
it is not user friendly and would like it changed as urgently as possible .
i understand that some people need to see their gps within 48 hours , but there are usually emergency slots held for these situations .
if you do try to book an appointment , but do n't manage to telephone first thing , then the 48 hour slots go and you have to wait another day - very unsatisfactory !
why are we penalised in this way ?
pamela abbott , harlow , essex as a gp , i have found the 48-hour target to be a ludicrously simplistic idea ; we offer a range of appointments , but find it hard to keep waiting times down and having to keep appointments free ' just in case ' does result in us having quiet days when demand is slack - then everyone rings in the next day !
the government were told at the outset that this was a poor idea .
the underlying problem is that too many appointments are wanted , and insufficient gp 's exist .
the fact that around 10 % of booked appointments are missed makes this worse .
mark williams , grays essex we do not have a problem with nhs but can not find a dentist who will treat me .
our only choice is to go private which we can not afford .
my wife has recently undergone cancer treatment which increases her risk of tooth decay !
david gilbert , rawtenstall , lancashire , uk last week i telephoned my medical centre and requested an routine appointment to see either of the two doctors i normally see and they said the first appointment would be 18 days time .
robert t dicken , stockton-on-teeside , england why does n't the government stop imposing ridiculous targets and strategies on gps and let them get on with what they trained for ?
if they did n't have quite so many bits of paper to fill in justifying every one of their actions then they 'd have time to see a lot more patients .
vicky , manchester my doctor 's surgery offers a triage system .
we can talk to a doctor on the phone within an hour who assesses whether or not we need to see someone that day .
short term appointments are not a problem and if you have a regular appointment with the same doctor about a continuing health problem then the doctor can make appointments that override the two week barrier .
the surgery is organised , efficient and has few complaints .
cecilia weightman , bristol , england i have never been able to get an appointment with my gp within 48 hours !
i usually have to wait for 2 - 3 weeks -lrb- i 'm not exaggerating -rrb- .
this means that if i have something that needs urgent attention i have to go to a walk-in centre .
the system really needs to change - it 's a nightmare !
caroline hunter , london i 'm a student and at my gps students are not allowed to make an appointment with a doctor .
we are forced to attend surgeries held by nurses a couple of times a week without an appointment and only get to see a doctor if the nurse thinks it is necessary .
this was even true when i rang up after having visited a & e after an asthma attack and thy had told me to visit the doctor the next day , as well as not being allowed to make an appointment there was no student surgery that day either .
students it sometimes seems are second class citizens not entitled to proper healthcare .
ben hartley , newcastle upon tyne , england although i can see the need for a 2 day response , there are also a significant number of people whose issue is not urgent and need to arrange time off work to see the doctor .
unless they can book an appointment a week in advance they will be unable to obtain the medical help they may need .
robert aleck , london , england when we first moved into the area you could book appointments in advance , then it all changed and you now have to phone the surgery on the day that you want to see the doctor .
this is not very helpful when you have to arrange time off work especially when you have to go for regular check ups .
ruth , widnes , cheshire i find the present gp appointments system much more agreeable than previously , when unless you went to an emergency surgery , you would have to wait at least a week to see a doctor .
now , you can call in the morning and see a doctor that very day .
there are many ailments that would not warrant " emergency status " but that ca n't wait a week to be sorted , and the 48 hour system is the most effective way to deal with these .
i appreciate , however , that the present system does restrict advanced bookings .
liz , bristol , england access to a gp is a lottery .
can not book an appointment until the day you require it .
no calls allowed before 8am then you end up in a queuing system .
standards when you finally get to see your doctor is excellent .
james wilson , irvine , scotland the country is 10,000 gps short nigel madagan , uk i am a gp .
i physically can not provide more appointments than i do .
the government can set as many targets as it likes and change the " rules " regarding access however the problem is lack of appointments and the only way to provide more appointments is to provide more gp 's .
the country is 10,000 gps short -lrb- a problem the government has known about for years -rrb- and it is difficult or impossible to recruit new partners or locum doctors to stand in when i can not be in the surgery .
nigel madagan , uk i can never get an appointment with my gp .
you have to phone on the day that you want an appointment .
i always phone at 8.30 -lrb- as soon as they open -rrb- and the phones lines are either engaged or ring off .
when you finally get to speak to someone they say there are no appointments for the day .
the receptionists are always rude and abrupt .
when i do actually get to see my gp the service is excellent , however , it is a frustrating process and i am seriously considering changing surgeries .
laura , oxford to see the more popular doctors you have to wait at least a week at my health centre , but you can usually see the less popular ones within 48 hours even if it does mean going through the triage nurse first -lrb- a process that really annoys me ! -rrb- .
when i asked why it took so long to get an appointment i was told we had n't enough doctors to cope with the new housing that has gone up in the last few years .
i note that my taxes and contributions have not been altered to reflect this problem !

are you unhappy with advanced access to gp services ?
a survey by the government watchdog , the healthcare commission , suggests that nearly a third of patients are unable to make an appointment to see their gp more than two days in advance .
the poll of 117,000 patients found the majority were happy with services , but some complained that government targets to see people within two days have led to surgeries restricting advance appointments .
tony blair pledged during the election campaign to investigate the problem .
what 's your reaction to the healthcare commission 's findings ?
do you think targets help or hinder ?
have you had difficulty making an advanced booking ?
send us your comments and experiences .
this debate is now closed .
please read a selection of your comments below .
the following comments reflect the balance of opinion received so far : i wonder if they even realise how awkward this is for anyone who has a job ?
m. g. , manchester , uk my gp wo n't do advance appointments at all .
you have to phone between 8:30am and 9am and ask for one on the day you want to go , which means , for me , having to phone in to work saying i 'll be late as i work 20 miles from where i live and until recently was reliant on once-an-hour train service to get there usually they just bark a time at you and you have to turn up , no matter how inconvenient it is .
when it 's routine stuff it would be nice to have even 24 hours notice so i can sort it out with the office rather than having to phone in at the last minute and possibly end up having to take half a day or more off .
then , it 's lucky if the appointment actually happens on time , i 've easily waited 30-60minutes nearly every time as they always run late !
i wonder if they even realise how awkward this is for anyone who has a job ?
m. g. , manchester , uk it happens at my local gp .
you are no longer allowed to book appointments in advance at a time convenient for you , you have to call in the morning to be seen later that day .
this means i have to take a day off work for non-essential appointments where previously i would have got a booking well in advance that did n't require time off .
so in a small way uk plc suffers .
i do n't blame my gp for this , though .
this perverse outcome is a classic example of what happens when the centre over-regulates and micro-manages .
john haywood , hampshire i do n't understand the problem - you need to see a doctor when you are ill - how can you know that you are going to be ill more than 2 days in advance ?
matt munro , bristol , uk just be grateful that you have a high quality free health service name here i ca n't believe some of the trivial whining on this board !
some people seem to believe that gps should prioritise appointments around people 's domestic and social responsibilities !
they do and should prioritise appointments on the basis of clinical need - just be grateful that you have a high quality free health service - most of the world do not and stop whining about having to make phone calls or having to take time off work -lrb- shock horror , how traumatic for you ! -rrb-
which is more important your health or your job ?
matt munro , bristol , uk i find it infuriating whenever i ask for an appointment to see my gp because i have to go through a barrage of questions which concludes with " do you work ? "
i find it ridiculous that i have to justify my working day just so that i might be lucky enough to get an appointment in 4 days time !
it 's insulting .
melanie philpott , torquay , devon this problem could be solved immediately if patients were to act responsibly e , malvern uk this problem could be solved immediately if patients were to act responsibly and only ask to see a doctor if they really need one .
i have been to a gp once in the last 22 years - and i do n't think of myself as particularly healthy .
if i have a minor health problem it will usually be something i can deal with myself , or it will just get better on its own .
pharmacists and the nhs direct service can also be helpful if you are not sure what to do .
leave gps to those who really need them - one day it could be you .
e , malvern uk 48 hours ?
during my last phone call to the gp i was told no appointments available for the next week !
simon taylor-smith , swindon until recently i was a practice manager .
the problem is that pcts and some gps have -lrb- sometimes deliberately -rrb- misinterpreted the target .
there is nothing in the guidelines that states a gp can not offer advanced booking .
these decisions are taken by the individual practice .
also patients sometimes have unreasonable expectations .
one patient arrived at the surgery at 08.45 and was offered an appointment at 09.30 the same morning and then complained that we did n't have anything sooner ! !
chris , london , uk think yourselves lucky you have got a doctor .
i needed a doctor for the first time in over 10 years and i was told that i " was n't in any surgery 's catchment area " so they 'd send me some forms to fill in , i could post them back and they 'd assign me to a local surgery ... by post , obviously .
i was better before i got any forms .
seemed like the best plan ! !
andy , london we have had the 48 hour targets imposed on us , without asking patients or gps what they need or want !
nic , leeds uk i 'm a gp : this does not surprise me !
we have had the 48 hour targets imposed on us , without asking patients or gps what they need or want !
we are trying to offer some pre-bookables , but we still have to meet the 48 hour targets too !
more and more work is being moved from hospitals to primary care : without more doctors and nurses -lrb- i.e. more funding for staff -rrb- we can not hope to provide a decent service for everyone !
nic , leeds uk i think that being able to book on the day you need the appointment has been a good change .
many times i have needed to see the doctor as soon as possible that even waiting a day would be too long .
if i do have a problem which can wait a week then my surgery has no problems making an advance appointment for me -lrb- usually within a week -rrb- .
i do n't know how it works in other surgeries but this system definitely works for me and i hope it stays that way .
laura , london , uk the only people to have gained from the latest gp contract are the gp 's themselves who are paid a lot more for doing less .
they are manipulating the 48 hour rule to their own advantage and yet provide less for the patients .
make the slightest moan and they will de-register you .
chris stevens , london uk i do n't try to go to a gp any more , i just go and sit in a & e and wait steve , uk we now spend more per head than any other country on our health services ; we have had a vast increase in the number of gps , who are the highest paid in the world -lrb- all strange but true -rrb- and what do we hear ?
more money needed , more doctors , more ... more ... more ..
i do n't try to go to a gp any more , i just go and sit in a & e and wait .
steve , uk i never have a problem getting an appointment with the doctor .
what i do have a problem with is getting a proper diagnosis !
susan , london in bolton we have an nhs drop-in centre , you can go there if you ca n't get in to see your gp .
i recently had tonsillitis , could n't get in to see my gp until the next day , so went to the drop in centre .
i was seen within 30 minutes by a well qualified nurse .
also , i tend to see my practice nurse at my doctors surgery , she can do nearly everything my gp can and with hardly any waiting time .
victoria , bolton , lancs you ca n't blame the gps for this .
if it was n't for the idiotic targets that are being set by the government then this would n't be happening .
they have to remember that doctors will try to make the figures work for them , rather like this government will try to put a positive spin on bad news stories .
mark s , manchester , uk you ca n't book ahead at my doctors only on the same day , so there 's a mad rush first thing and you 've no chance if you ring after quarter to nine -lrb- they only open at 8:30 -rrb- jenna , wales this issue was raised in the ' leaders question time special ' shortly before the general election .
i remember an extremely sweaty mr blair being dumfounded by this , and he promised to sort it out - presumably it 's still going on if we are discussing it here today .
about time the government did something about it really !
they 've had four months since that programme and still no action - what a surprise ! !
steve , warrington , uk call up on the morning and partake of the telephone lottery ben bell , canterbury , kent , i can only make an appointment with my gp on that morning .
call up on the morning and partake of the telephone lottery to see if i can get an appointment , if not then better luck tomorrow .
no forward bookings at all .
unfortunately this means that i have to stay at home to call to see if i can get an appointment and be late for work whatever happens .
ben bell , canterbury , kent , england when i was in leeds there was an open surgery for 2 hours in the morning and an hour in the afternoon .
the rest of the time it was pre-booked appointments which were also easy to get .
surely it 's not that complicated ?
laura , aberdeen i rang my doctor today for a non-emergency appointment for my 13 year old son and was given one for 4.30 this afternoon .
i 've never ever had a problem getting an appointment , the doctors are excellent and the receptionists charming !
no , it 's not private and i 'm not telling you where it is or you 'll all join the practice !
i guess its just a lottery really .
lynn , hampshire i am convinced that this is just a public relations exercise to make the health authorities look good david endsor , stockport england i have recently just reached 50 and received a letter from my local primary care trust inviting me to go for a health check -lrb- part of the heart and stroke prevention campaign -rrb- these are given every 5 years .
on phoning my doctors practice to make an appointment i was told the nurses were very busy and short staffed due to holidays , i accepted there advice to ring back in 2 weeks .
i rang the surgery a couple of weeks later and this time was told the clinic was fully booked for 4 weeks and thereafter the program was finished .
i knew i was not going to get an appointment , but what was more annoying was i was also given similar excuses 5 years ago when asked to make an appointment then .
i am convinced that this is just a public relations exercise to make the health authorities look good .
david endsor , stockport england what short memories people have !
i remember - only a few years ago - when a routine doctor 's appointment would often have to be made 10-12 days in advance .
now i can see a doctor in 2 days .
there are some silly things in the current policies , but give credit where it is due , the nhs is now much more responsive than it used to be .
piers , surrey my view , i think supported by the other comments , is that this is a practice management problem .
i have always been able to make appointments up to 1 month in advance , and if i need to see a doctor urgently , i have always been able to within a day .
this is usually not my own doctor , but if it really is an emergency , what does that matter .
john , bristol , uk i live in scotland and have to book an appointment 1 week in advance to see my gp .
so lucky those down south who only have to book 3 days in advance .
i have complained to my gp 's practice manager verbally and in writing all to no avail .
the nhs is a joke .
flora , scotland i am a gps receptionist and i feel that patients do not realise that we do not make the rules .
if we do not have appointments to offer it is not our fault .
the surgery i work in does offer pre bookable appointments up to 2 weeks in advance , i think it is a much fairer system .
please do n't blame the receptionist , they are only doing a job of work like other people , and we do not deserve the publicity that we get .
es , leeds if they can do it why ca n't others ?
jean , wiltshire my doctor 's surgery not only has an appointment system but they also have at least one open surgery a day when you can go and wait and you will be seen .
it is not unusual to arrive at 8.15 in the morning and be at work by 9.a.m.
i also made an appointment 6 weeks in advance without any problem .
if they can do it why ca n't others ?
jean , wiltshire being fortunate not to have had to see my gp for over nine years .
i 'm horrified to read the comments of my fellow readers .
i 'm getting on a bit now and would be more likely to know that if i required a gp appointment or visit , i would get one before i expire .
john graham , edinburgh , scotland recently we took our son to the doctors - the doctor asked us to come back in 7 days .
his receptionist refused to make the booking so we could avoid school hours .
5 days later we spent 30 minutes on the phone trying to get through and then had no option but to take a school hours appointment .

my doctor 's surgery has about 8 doctors available and you are guaranteed to get seen whilst you are still symptomatic .

i had an infected cyst in my ear which needed treatment but i had to book an appointment at least 7 days in advance .
by the time it actually came round to my appointment , my cyst had cleared up , rendering the appointment pointless .
bob , brighton , uk my elderly father has a long term and serious health problem needs to visit the doctor every 2 weeks or so .

impossible - the reception staff and presumably the practice manager will simply not do it .
the tail wagging the dog ?

that system would soon winnow out the large numbers of people who clog up surgeries with no good reason .
at present , if we want to go private , we need a referral from our gp , which comes very low in the list of priorities , even though we are forced to ' bribe ' the gp with thirty pounds -lrb- there really is no other word for it -rrb- , just to write a letter .
it 's scandalous .
henry , ilford , essex it 's clear that the government has n't got a clue about management john b , uk the last time i needed an appointment with my doctor i was told i would have to wait a week , or call back in the morning .
so i took the next day off work , called at 830 and was seen at 1050 .

far worse however is the total lack of nhs dentistry , i am faced with a bill of nearly £ 1000 for essential treatment that i am forced to have privately because of a lack of nhs dentists who will take on new patients .
sally marshall , uk i find my local booking arrangements highly annoying .
the only time i have needed to see a doctor over the last 3 years is for my annual appointment to check my contraception .
i have tell my boss in advance that i may be at the doctors on a certain day and cross my fingers that i 'll get an appointment on that particular day when i phone up .
the receptionists are rude , abrupt and frankly , nosey .
although my gp is lovely and once i get past the gatekeepers i have no complaints !
i just wish there was a service where you could book two weeks in advance for routine appointments .
it would make life so much easier for us workers !
anon , thornton why are we penalised in this way ?
pamela abbott , harlow , essex i find the system of not being able to book in advance the most frustrating system ever .
it is not user friendly and would like it changed as urgently as possible .
i understand that some people need to see their gps within 48 hours , but there are usually emergency slots held for these situations .
if you do try to book an appointment , but do n't manage to telephone first thing , then the 48 hour slots go and you have to wait another day - very unsatisfactory !
why are we penalised in this way ?
pamela abbott , harlow , essex as a gp , i have found the 48-hour target to be a ludicrously simplistic idea ; we offer a range of appointments , but find it hard to keep waiting times down and having to keep appointments free ' just in case ' does result in us having quiet days when demand is slack - then everyone rings in the next day !
the government were told at the outset that this was a poor idea .
the underlying problem is that too many appointments are wanted , and insufficient gp 's exist .
the fact that around 10 % of booked appointments are missed makes this worse .
mark williams , grays essex we do not have a problem with nhs but can not find a dentist who will treat me .
our only choice is to go private which we can not afford .
my wife has recently undergone cancer treatment which increases her risk of tooth decay !
david gilbert , rawtenstall , lancashire , uk last week i telephoned my medical centre and requested an routine appointment to see either of the two doctors i normally see and they said the first appointment would be 18 days time .
robert t dicken , stockton-on-teeside , england why does n't the government stop imposing ridiculous targets and strategies on gps and let them get on with what they trained for ?
if they did n't have quite so many bits of paper to fill in justifying every one of their actions then they 'd have time to see a lot more patients .
vicky , manchester my doctor 's surgery offers a triage system .
we can talk to a doctor on the phone within an hour who assesses whether or not we need to see someone that day .
short term appointments are not a problem and if you have a regular appointment with the same doctor about a continuing health problem then the doctor can make appointments that override the two week barrier .
the surgery is organised , efficient and has few complaints .
cecilia weightman , bristol , england i have never been able to get an appointment with my gp within 48 hours !
i usually have to wait for 2 - 3 weeks -lrb- i 'm not exaggerating -rrb- .
this means that if i have something that needs urgent attention i have to go to a walk-in centre .
the system really needs to change - it 's a nightmare !
caroline hunter , london i 'm a student and at my gps students are not allowed to make an appointment with a doctor .
we are forced to attend surgeries held by nurses a couple of times a week without an appointment and only get to see a doctor if the nurse thinks it is necessary .
this was even true when i rang up after having visited a & e after an asthma attack and thy had told me to visit the doctor the next day , as well as not being allowed to make an appointment there was no student surgery that day either .
students it sometimes seems are second class citizens not entitled to proper healthcare .
ben hartley , newcastle upon tyne , england although i can see the need for a 2 day response , there are also a significant number of people whose issue is not urgent and need to arrange time off work to see the doctor .
unless they can book an appointment a week in advance they will be unable to obtain the medical help they may need .
robert aleck , london , england when we first moved into the area you could book appointments in advance , then it all changed and you now have to phone the surgery on the day that you want to see the doctor .
this is not very helpful when you have to arrange time off work especially when you have to go for regular check ups .
ruth , widnes , cheshire i find the present gp appointments system much more agreeable than previously , when unless you went to an emergency surgery , you would have to wait at least a week to see a doctor .
now , you can call in the morning and see a doctor that very day .
there are many ailments that would not warrant " emergency status " but that ca n't wait a week to be sorted , and the 48 hour system is the most effective way to deal with these .
i appreciate , however , that the present system does restrict advanced bookings .
liz , bristol , england access to a gp is a lottery .
can not book an appointment until the day you require it .
no calls allowed before 8am then you end up in a queuing system .
standards when you finally get to see your doctor is excellent .
james wilson , irvine , scotland the country is 10,000 gps short nigel madagan , uk i am a gp .
i physically can not provide more appointments than i do .
the government can set as many targets as it likes and change the " rules " regarding access however the problem is lack of appointments and the only way to provide more appointments is to provide more gp 's .
the country is 10,000 gps short -lrb- a problem the government has known about for years -rrb- and it is difficult or impossible to recruit new partners or locum doctors to stand in when i can not be in the surgery .
nigel madagan , uk i can never get an appointment with my gp .
you have to phone on the day that you want an appointment .
i always phone at 8.30 -lrb- as soon as they open -rrb- and the phones lines are either engaged or ring off .
when you finally get to speak to someone they say there are no appointments for the day .
the receptionists are always rude and abrupt .
when i do actually get to see my gp the service is excellent , however , it is a frustrating process and i am seriously considering changing surgeries .
laura , oxford to see the more popular doctors you have to wait at least a week at my health centre , but you can usually see the less popular ones within 48 hours even if it does mean going through the triage nurse first -lrb- a process that really annoys me ! -rrb- .
when i asked why it took so long to get an appointment i was told we had n't enough doctors to cope with the new housing that has gone up in the last few years .
i note that my taxes and contributions have not been altered to reflect this problem !

are you unhappy with advanced access to gp services ?
a survey by the government watchdog , the healthcare commission , suggests that nearly a third of patients are unable to make an appointment to see their gp more than two days in advance .
the poll of 117,000 patients found the majority were happy with services , but some complained that government targets to see people within two days have led to surgeries restricting advance appointments .
tony blair pledged during the election campaign to investigate the problem .
what 's your reaction to the healthcare commission 's findings ?
do you think targets help or hinder ?
have you had difficulty making an advanced booking ?
send us your comments and experiences .
this debate is now closed .
please read a selection of your comments below .
the following comments reflect the balance of opinion received so far : i wonder if they even realise how awkward this is for anyone who has a job ?
m. g. , manchester , uk my gp wo n't do advance appointments at all .
you have to phone between 8:30am and 9am and ask for one on the day you want to go , which means , for me , having to phone in to work saying i 'll be late as i work 20 miles from where i live and until recently was reliant on once-an-hour train service to get there usually they just bark a time at you and you have to turn up , no matter how inconvenient it is .
when it 's routine stuff it would be nice to have even 24 hours notice so i can sort it out with the office rather than having to phone in at the last minute and possibly end up having to take half a day or more off .
then , it 's lucky if the appointment actually happens on time , i 've easily waited 30-60minutes nearly every time as they always run late !
i wonder if they even realise how awkward this is for anyone who has a job ?
m. g. , manchester , uk it happens at my local gp .
you are no longer allowed to book appointments in advance at a time convenient for you , you have to call in the morning to be seen later that day .
this means i have to take a day off work for non-essential appointments where previously i would have got a booking well in advance that did n't require time off .
so in a small way uk plc suffers .
i do n't blame my gp for this , though .
this perverse outcome is a classic example of what happens when the centre over-regulates and micro-manages .
john haywood , hampshire i do n't understand the problem - you need to see a doctor when you are ill - how can you know that you are going to be ill more than 2 days in advance ?
matt munro , bristol , uk just be grateful that you have a high quality free health service name here i ca n't believe some of the trivial whining on this board !
some people seem to believe that gps should prioritise appointments around people 's domestic and social responsibilities !
they do and should prioritise appointments on the basis of clinical need - just be grateful that you have a high quality free health service - most of the world do not and stop whining about having to make phone calls or having to take time off work -lrb- shock horror , how traumatic for you ! -rrb-
which is more important your health or your job ?
matt munro , bristol , uk i find it infuriating whenever i ask for an appointment to see my gp because i have to go through a barrage of questions which concludes with " do you work ? "
i find it ridiculous that i have to justify my working day just so that i might be lucky enough to get an appointment in 4 days time !
it 's insulting .
melanie philpott , torquay , devon this problem could be solved immediately if patients were to act responsibly e , malvern uk this problem could be solved immediately if patients were to act responsibly and only ask to see a doctor if they really need one .
i have been to a gp once in the last 22 years - and i do n't think of myself as particularly healthy .
if i have a minor health problem it will usually be something i can deal with myself , or it will just get better on its own .
pharmacists and the nhs direct service can also be helpful if you are not sure what to do .
leave gps to those who really need them - one day it could be you .
e , malvern uk 48 hours ?
during my last phone call to the gp i was told no appointments available for the next week !
simon taylor-smith , swindon until recently i was a practice manager .
the problem is that pcts and some gps have -lrb- sometimes deliberately -rrb- misinterpreted the target .
there is nothing in the guidelines that states a gp can not offer advanced booking .
these decisions are taken by the individual practice .
also patients sometimes have unreasonable expectations .
one patient arrived at the surgery at 08.45 and was offered an appointment at 09.30 the same morning and then complained that we did n't have anything sooner ! !
chris , london , uk think yourselves lucky you have got a doctor .
i needed a doctor for the first time in over 10 years and i was told that i " was n't in any surgery 's catchment area " so they 'd send me some forms to fill in , i could post them back and they 'd assign me to a local surgery ... by post , obviously .
i was better before i got any forms .
seemed like the best plan ! !
andy , london we have had the 48 hour targets imposed on us , without asking patients or gps what they need or want !
nic , leeds uk i 'm a gp : this does not surprise me !
we have had the 48 hour targets imposed on us , without asking patients or gps what they need or want !
we are trying to offer some pre-bookables , but we still have to meet the 48 hour targets too !
more and more work is being moved from hospitals to primary care : without more doctors and nurses -lrb- i.e. more funding for staff -rrb- we can not hope to provide a decent service for everyone !
nic , leeds uk i think that being able to book on the day you need the appointment has been a good change .
many times i have needed to see the doctor as soon as possible that even waiting a day would be too long .
if i do have a problem which can wait a week then my surgery has no problems making an advance appointment for me -lrb- usually within a week -rrb- .
i do n't know how it works in other surgeries but this system definitely works for me and i hope it stays that way .
laura , london , uk the only people to have gained from the latest gp contract are the gp 's themselves who are paid a lot more for doing less .
they are manipulating the 48 hour rule to their own advantage and yet provide less for the patients .
make the slightest moan and they will de-register you .
chris stevens , london uk i do n't try to go to a gp any more , i just go and sit in a & e and wait steve , uk we now spend more per head than any other country on our health services ; we have had a vast increase in the number of gps , who are the highest paid in the world -lrb- all strange but true -rrb- and what do we hear ?
more money needed , more doctors , more ... more ... more ..
i do n't try to go to a gp any more , i just go and sit in a & e and wait .
steve , uk i never have a problem getting an appointment with the doctor .
what i do have a problem with is getting a proper diagnosis !
susan , london in bolton we have an nhs drop-in centre , you can go there if you ca n't get in to see your gp .
i recently had tonsillitis , could n't get in to see my gp until the next day , so went to the drop in centre .
i was seen within 30 minutes by a well qualified nurse .
also , i tend to see my practice nurse at my doctors surgery , she can do nearly everything my gp can and with hardly any waiting time .
victoria , bolton , lancs you ca n't blame the gps for this .
if it was n't for the idiotic targets that are being set by the government then this would n't be happening .
they have to remember that doctors will try to make the figures work for them , rather like this government will try to put a positive spin on bad news stories .
mark s , manchester , uk you ca n't book ahead at my doctors only on the same day , so there 's a mad rush first thing and you 've no chance if you ring after quarter to nine -lrb- they only open at 8:30 -rrb- jenna , wales this issue was raised in the ' leaders question time special ' shortly before the general election .
i remember an extremely sweaty mr blair being dumfounded by this , and he promised to sort it out - presumably it 's still going on if we are discussing it here today .
about time the government did something about it really !
they 've had four months since that programme and still no action - what a surprise ! !
steve , warrington , uk call up on the morning and partake of the telephone lottery ben bell , canterbury , kent , i can only make an appointment with my gp on that morning .
call up on the morning and partake of the telephone lottery to see if i can get an appointment , if not then better luck tomorrow .
no forward bookings at all .
unfortunately this means that i have to stay at home to call to see if i can get an appointment and be late for work whatever happens .
ben bell , canterbury , kent , england when i was in leeds there was an open surgery for 2 hours in the morning and an hour in the afternoon .
the rest of the time it was pre-booked appointments which were also easy to get .
surely it 's not that complicated ?
laura , aberdeen i rang my doctor today for a non-emergency appointment for my 13 year old son and was given one for 4.30 this afternoon .
i 've never ever had a problem getting an appointment , the doctors are excellent and the receptionists charming !
no , it 's not private and i 'm not telling you where it is or you 'll all join the practice !
i guess its just a lottery really .
lynn , hampshire i am convinced that this is just a public relations exercise to make the health authorities look good david endsor , stockport england i have recently just reached 50 and received a letter from my local primary care trust inviting me to go for a health check -lrb- part of the heart and stroke prevention campaign -rrb- these are given every 5 years .
on phoning my doctors practice to make an appointment i was told the nurses were very busy and short staffed due to holidays , i accepted there advice to ring back in 2 weeks .
i rang the surgery a couple of weeks later and this time was told the clinic was fully booked for 4 weeks and thereafter the program was finished .
i knew i was not going to get an appointment , but what was more annoying was i was also given similar excuses 5 years ago when asked to make an appointment then .
i am convinced that this is just a public relations exercise to make the health authorities look good .
david endsor , stockport england what short memories people have !
i remember - only a few years ago - when a routine doctor 's appointment would often have to be made 10-12 days in advance .
now i can see a doctor in 2 days .
there are some silly things in the current policies , but give credit where it is due , the nhs is now much more responsive than it used to be .
piers , surrey my view , i think supported by the other comments , is that this is a practice management problem .
i have always been able to make appointments up to 1 month in advance , and if i need to see a doctor urgently , i have always been able to within a day .
this is usually not my own doctor , but if it really is an emergency , what does that matter .
john , bristol , uk i live in scotland and have to book an appointment 1 week in advance to see my gp .
so lucky those down south who only have to book 3 days in advance .
i have complained to my gp 's practice manager verbally and in writing all to no avail .
the nhs is a joke .
flora , scotland i am a gps receptionist and i feel that patients do not realise that we do not make the rules .
if we do not have appointments to offer it is not our fault .
the surgery i work in does offer pre bookable appointments up to 2 weeks in advance , i think it is a much fairer system .
please do n't blame the receptionist , they are only doing a job of work like other people , and we do not deserve the publicity that we get .
es , leeds if they can do it why ca n't others ?
jean , wiltshire my doctor 's surgery not only has an appointment system but they also have at least one open surgery a day when you can go and wait and you will be seen .
it is not unusual to arrive at 8.15 in the morning and be at work by 9.a.m.
i also made an appointment 6 weeks in advance without any problem .
if they can do it why ca n't others ?
jean , wiltshire being fortunate not to have had to see my gp for over nine years .
i 'm horrified to read the comments of my fellow readers .
i 'm getting on a bit now and would be more likely to know that if i required a gp appointment or visit , i would get one before i expire .
john graham , edinburgh , scotland recently we took our son to the doctors - the doctor asked us to come back in 7 days .
his receptionist refused to make the booking so we could avoid school hours .
5 days later we spent 30 minutes on the phone trying to get through and then had no option but to take a school hours appointment .
simply ludicrous .
clive , woking being seen when you are ill is what it 's all about sharon , london my surgery offers a 48 hour advance booking service .
this works fantastically .
my doctor 's surgery has about 8 doctors available and you are guaranteed to get seen whilst you are still symptomatic .
people who complain about this kind of service are the type of people who complain at anything .
being seen when you are ill is what it 's all about and i thank and applaud the gp services around the country who work tirelessly to help their patients , despite the constant criticism sharon , london i 'd say so .
i had an infected cyst in my ear which needed treatment but i had to book an appointment at least 7 days in advance .
by the time it actually came round to my appointment , my cyst had cleared up , rendering the appointment pointless .
bob , brighton , uk my elderly father has a long term and serious health problem needs to visit the doctor every 2 weeks or so .
his doctor sees him and says make an appointment for a week friday .
impossible - the reception staff and presumably the practice manager will simply not do it .
the tail wagging the dog ?
wayne , harpenden , uk think yourselves most fortunate that you can see a doctor within a week , as in canada 4 weeks to 12 weeks to see your doctor is not uncommon .
mostly if you are in need , one has to go to emergency were one finds a room full of people waiting for the same thing .
we have had to accept that this is the way things are for now , as it is out of our control .
neither governments or doctors have much control over doctor shortages .
heather , canada we need more gps , but gp friends tell me how difficult -lrb- and expensive -rrb- it is to get into an established general practice .
it 's easier becoming a hospital doctor .
unless you 're obliged to see the doctor at his request , for routine vaccinations , baby checkups and screenings - we should all go private and have health insurance , as in the usa , or pay in advance and reclaim the costs later , as they do in france .
that system would soon winnow out the large numbers of people who clog up surgeries with no good reason .
at present , if we want to go private , we need a referral from our gp , which comes very low in the list of priorities , even though we are forced to ' bribe ' the gp with thirty pounds -lrb- there really is no other word for it -rrb- , just to write a letter .
it 's scandalous .
henry , ilford , essex it 's clear that the government has n't got a clue about management john b , uk the last time i needed an appointment with my doctor i was told i would have to wait a week , or call back in the morning .
so i took the next day off work , called at 830 and was seen at 1050 .
it 's clear that the government has n't got a clue about management , as it 's common knowledge that what is measured gets improved even if that is n't the desired effect .
john b , uk my local doctor surgery in wood green is a shambles .
if i call up - the usual waiting time is 4/5 days .
if it is urgent we are directed to the nearest hospital .
the surgery is run-down , under-staffed and the doctor i see there tells everyone to just go to a & e. totally unacceptable .
the nurse there also breached my patient confidentiality .
my last doctor in brixton was spotless , spacious and i could get in within 24 hours every time .
am trying very hard not to get ill so i do n't have to be messed around and insulted again .
jay , london i have been unable to book an appointment unless it 's two years from now !
in my job i am constantly on the phone and it 's proved impossible as you are on hold for 10 minutes waiting .
then you are given an after hours appointment anyway .
all you needed was to pick up your prescription .
why do i pay my taxes again ?
becks , kent i can get an appointment at the vet any time i want .
i have great difficulty getting to see the doctor .
the only difference is that there is a charge for seeing the vet .
tony , derby my gp surgery seems to operate this system without difficulty .
when my family needs to be seen , we get an appointment the same day .
when we make an advance appointment for routine stuff that is also easily accommodated .
in my opinion the problem is n't the policy , but how come some practices are applying it ?
zoe , tyne and wear i work for the nhs and i believe that this booking issue is something which needs to be resolved because it impacts on other services .
many people ca n't get that appointment with the doctor and so take themselves to a & e instead - because you have to be seen in a & e. this then reflects on the waiting times for a & e. walk in centres are a relatively new and unknown service which should , if properly implemented and advertised , help rectify this problem .
being given a target is a very reasonable way of trying to improve performance , however this should not be to the disadvantage of the patient .
advanced bookings should still be a main option , but with penalties for not attending / failing to cancel .
simon gilbert , forest hill , london when i can find a surgery taking on patients , i 'll let you know .
ken , london , uk i am sick of people on here saying doctor 's receptionists are rude and abrupt .
my wife is a receptionist and the number of patients who are rude to her both on the phone and in the surgery is disgusting .
i find if you speak nicely and calmly to people they reciprocate .
john , huddersfield , england our practice can make urgent appointments within 24 hours and will accept longer term bookings , however when i recently tried to make a non-urgent appointment i was offered a date 22 days later !
they criticise patients for missing appointments , however it is a regular occurrence that the doctors do n't arrive until well after the time of the first appointment that has been booked .
far worse however is the total lack of nhs dentistry , i am faced with a bill of nearly £ 1000 for essential treatment that i am forced to have privately because of a lack of nhs dentists who will take on new patients .
sally marshall , uk i find my local booking arrangements highly annoying .

i just wish there was a service where you could book two weeks in advance for routine appointments .
it would make life so much easier for us workers !

pamela abbott , harlow , essex i find the system of not being able to book in advance the most frustrating system ever .

nigel madagan , uk i can never get an appointment with my gp .
you have to phone on the day that you want an appointment .
i always phone at 8.30 -lrb- as soon as they open -rrb- and the phones lines are either engaged or ring off .
when you finally get to speak to someone they say there are no appointments for the day .
the receptionists are always rude and abrupt .
when i do actually get to see my gp the service is excellent , however , it is a frustrating process and i am seriously considering changing surgeries .
laura , oxford to see the more popular doctors you have to wait at least a week at my health centre , but you can usually see the less popular ones within 48 hours even if it does mean going through the triage nurse first -lrb- a process that really annoys me ! -rrb- .
when i asked why it took so long to get an appointment i was told we had n't enough doctors to cope with the new housing that has gone up in the last few years .
i note that my taxes and contributions have not been altered to reflect this problem !

his party and its coalition ally will have a key two-thirds majority in the new parliament , kyodo news agency said .
mr koizumi said the voice of the people had been heard and promised to push on with post office reform , which he had put at the heart of his campaign .
he said he still intended to step down in september 2006 .
that is when his term as president of the ruling liberal democratic party -lrb- ldp -rrb- ends , and resigning that post would see him giving up as prime minister as well .
mr koizumi called the snap ballot after his plans to privatise japan 's post office were blocked by ldp rebels in parliament 's upper house .
-lrb- koizumi 's -rrb- magic was so successful that it 's a little scary hiroaki toya voters ' verdict override the prime minister 's gamble has paid off handsomely , says the bbc 's chris hogg in tokyo .
and the scale of his achievement should not be underestimated , weeks after many people were writing him off as prime minister , our correspondent says .
winning a two-thirds majority in the lower house means mr koizumi can now override any objection from the upper house and push through reforms .
speaking at a press conference , mr koizumi said his cabinet would remain as it is until after a special session of parliament is convened , probably later this month .
public broadcaster nhk and kyodo news agency said mr koizumi 's liberal democratic party -lrb- ldp -rrb- had 296 seats in the 480-seat lower house .
the ldp and its coalition partner , the new komeito party , took 327 seats , they said .
key numbers 480 lower house seats 241 needed for a majority ldp wins 296 for the new term coalition partner new komeito has 31 seats the coalition will control 327 seats , or 68.1 % gamble pays off the democratic party of japan -lrb- dpj -rrb- , the main opposition party , which had 177 seats before the election saw its share reduced to 113 .
" i had hoped we would win a majority with our party alone , but we did even better than that , " mr koizumi said .
katsuya okada , head of the dpj , admitted defeat and said he would take responsibility by resigning .
the prime minister - in office since 2001 - had viewed the election as a referendum on his reform programme , which was blocked by rebels within his own party .
he took the unprecedented step of hand-picking candidates in key seats - dubbed the " assassins " by the media - to try to unseat those rebels .
our tokyo correspondent says mr koizumi 's focus on post office privatisation during the campaign frustrated the democrats .
they tried to tackle him on issues such as pension reform , his close ties to us president george w bush and the presence of japanese troops in iraq .
before the election was called , the ldp had 249 seats in the 480-seat lower house and its coalition partner the new komeito had 34 .
the dpj had 175 .
turnout is expected to surpass the 60 % recorded at the last general election in 2003 .

with his flowing hair and striking looks , he was a far more colourful politician that the grey suits japan 's electorate was used to .
at first the public appeared to love mr koizumi 's dashing maverick image .
and the prime minister made the most of it , releasing a cd of his favourite elvis songs and crooning with us movie idol tom cruise .
four years after he was first elected , he is now the longest-serving japanese prime minister in two decades .
but the public 's love affair with him has fluctuated .
his approval ratings were knocked amid disappointment with his progress on economic reform , and his decision , as a major us ally , to send japanese troops to iraq .
but his popularity rebounded after he called a snap election in september 2005 , and his liberal democratic party was returned to office with its biggest majority in decades .
the poll - called after the upper house voted out a bill to privatise the country 's sprawling postal system - became a de facto referendum on mr koizumi 's reform programme , especially on the post office .
the reforms had been seen as a potential spur for japan 's still fragile economic recovery , as the postal service sits on 350 trillion yen -lrb- $ 3.2 trillion -rrb- in savings and insurance funds .
controversial change but the reform idea was not popular with many people .
the country 's 260,000 postal employees fear for their jobs , and it had been staunchly opposed by conservatives within the ldp , who have traditionally benefited from ties to the state sector .
for some analysts , mr koizumi appeared to have little to lose .
he had already said he would stand down as the head of the ldp when his term ends in september 2006 .
the japanese prime minister 's popularity has not only fluctuated domestically .
his annual visits to the yasukuni shrine , which honours japan 's war dead , including a number of convicted war criminals , has enraged neighbours south korea and china .
tensions have also risen recently in connection with a dispute between japan and china over gas fields and strategic islands .

with his flowing hair and striking looks , he was a far more colourful politician that the grey suits japan 's electorate was used to .
at first the public appeared to love mr koizumi 's dashing maverick image .
and the prime minister made the most of it , releasing a cd of his favourite elvis songs and crooning with us movie idol tom cruise .
four years after he was first elected , he is now the longest-serving japanese prime minister in two decades .
but the public 's love affair with him has fluctuated .
his approval ratings were knocked amid disappointment with his progress on economic reform , and his decision , as a major us ally , to send japanese troops to iraq .
but his popularity rebounded after he called a snap election in september 2005 , and his liberal democratic party was returned to office with its biggest majority in decades .
the poll - called after the upper house voted out a bill to privatise the country 's sprawling postal system - became a de facto referendum on mr koizumi 's reform programme , especially on the post office .
the reforms had been seen as a potential spur for japan 's still fragile economic recovery , as the postal service sits on 350 trillion yen -lrb- $ 3.2 trillion -rrb- in savings and insurance funds .
controversial change but the reform idea was not popular with many people .
the country 's 260,000 postal employees fear for their jobs , and it had been staunchly opposed by conservatives within the ldp , who have traditionally benefited from ties to the state sector .
for some analysts , mr koizumi appeared to have little to lose .
he had already said he would stand down as the head of the ldp when his term ends in september 2006 .
the japanese prime minister 's popularity has not only fluctuated domestically .
his annual visits to the yasukuni shrine , which honours japan 's war dead , including a number of convicted war criminals , has enraged neighbours south korea and china .
tensions have also risen recently in connection with a dispute between japan and china over gas fields and strategic islands .

the weekend earnings for the exorcism of emily rose , which is out in the uk on 4 november , amounted to more than the next five films combined .
samuel l jackson and eugene levy star in comedy the man last week 's top film , action movie transporter 2 , starring british actor jason statham , fell to third place with weekend sales of $ 7.2m -lrb- £ 3.9m -rrb- .

in london 's speakers ' corner , the right to freedom of expression has been practised by anyone who cares to turn up for centuries .
but in countries where free speech is not protected by the authorities , hiding your true identity is becoming big business .
just as remailers act as a go-between for e-mail , so there are services through which you can surf the web anonymously .
after 10 years in the business , anonymizer has two million active users .
the us government pays it to promote the service in china and iran in order to help promote free speech .
but these programs are becoming popular in the west too .
the software encrypts all your requests for webpages .
anonymizer 's servers then automatically gather the content on your behalf and send it back to you .
no humans are involved and the company does not keep records of who requests what .
however , there is some censorship .
anonymizer does not support anonymous uploading to the web , and it blocks access to material that would be illegal under us law .
no to censorship for the last five years , ian clarke has been working on a project to offer complete anonymity .
founder and co-ordinator of freenet , ian clarke says : " our goal was to provide a system whereby people could share information over the internet without revealing their identity and without permitting any form of government censorship . "
the system is called the free network project , or freenet .
a chinese version has been set up to help dissidents speak out there . "
we believe that the benefits of freenet , for example for dissidents in countries such as china , saudi arabia , iran , far outweigh the dangers of paedophilia or terrorist information being distributed over the system " ian clarke , freenet challenges of anonymous surfing freenet encourages anonymous uploading of any material .
some users of the english version believe it is so secure they have used it to confess to crimes they have committed , or to their interest in paedophilia .
each user 's computer becomes a node in a decentralised file-storing network .
as such they give up a small portion of their hard disk to help the system hold all the information and as with anonymous surfing , everything is encrypted , with a military grade 128-bit algorithm .
the storage is dynamic , with files automatically moved between computers on the network or duplicated .
this adds to the difficulty of determining who might be storing what .
even if a user 's computer is seized , it can be impossible for experts to determine what the owner was doing on freenet .
but such strenuous efforts to protect identity have two side effects .
firstly , pages can take 10 minutes or more to download , even on a 2mbbps broadband connection .
secondly , the information is so well encrypted it is not searchable at the moment .
forget google , your only option is to scroll through the indexes provided .
it is hoped usability of the service will improve when it is re-launched later this year .
ethical issues but those are the least of our problems , according to some experts , who think freenet is a dangerous free-for-all .
digital evidence expert at the london school of economics , peter sommer says : " a few years ago i was very much in favour of libertarian computing .
" what changed my mind was the experience of acting in the english courts as a computer expert and examining large numbers of computers from really nasty people , who were using precisely the same sort of technology in order to conceal their activities .
" i think that creates an ethical dilemma for everyone who wants to participate in freenet .
" you are giving over part of your computer , it will be in encrypted form , you will not know what you are carrying , but some of it is going to be seriously unpleasant .
are you happy with that ? "
what worries many , is that freenet is a lawless area .
it can be used for many good things , like giving the oppressed a voice , but users can also preach race-hatred or share child pornography with complete impunity .
peter sommer says : " ian -lsb- clarke -rsb- is placing a powerful tool in the hands of other people .
he 's like an armaments manufacturer .
" guns can be used for all sorts of good purposes but you know perfectly well that they are used to oppress and kill .
" most armaments manufacturers walk off and say ' it 's not my responsibility ' .
is that ian 's position , i wonder ? "
ian clarke response is to explain that any tool is capable of misuse .
" we believe that the benefits of freenet , for example for dissidents in countries such as china , saudi arabia , iran far outweigh the dangers of paedophilia or terrorist information being distributed over the system , " he says .
commercial programs for the web help you maintain a high degree of anonymity while surfing or mailing , but the realm of publishing anonymously , without fear of any comeback , challenges each society to ask just how free we want ourselves and others to be .

anonymous e-mail systems have been around for 10 years in london 's speakers ' corner , the right to freedom of expression has been practised by anyone who cares to turn up for centuries .
but in countries where free speech is not protected by the authorities , hiding your true identity is becoming big business .
just as remailers act as a go-between for e-mail , so there are services through which you can surf the web anonymously .
after 10 years in the business , anonymizer has two million active users .
the us government pays it to promote the service in china and iran in order to help promote free speech .
but these programs are becoming popular in the west too .
the software encrypts all your requests for webpages .
anonymizer 's servers then automatically gather the content on your behalf and send it back to you .
no humans are involved and the company does not keep records of who requests what .
however , there is some censorship .
anonymizer does not support anonymous uploading to the web , and it blocks access to material that would be illegal under us law .
no to censorship for the last five years , ian clarke has been working on a project to offer complete anonymity .
founder and co-ordinator of freenet , ian clarke says : " our goal was to provide a system whereby people could share information over the internet without revealing their identity and without permitting any form of government censorship . "
the system is called the free network project , or freenet .
a chinese version has been set up to help dissidents speak out there .
we believe that the benefits of freenet , for example for dissidents in countries such as china , saudi arabia , iran , far outweigh the dangers of paedophilia or terrorist information being distributed over the system ian clarke , freenet challenges of anonymous surfing freenet encourages anonymous uploading of any material .
some users of the english version believe it is so secure they have used it to confess to crimes they have committed , or to their interest in paedophilia .
each user 's computer becomes a node in a decentralised file-storing network .
as such they give up a small portion of their hard disk to help the system hold all the information and as with anonymous surfing , everything is encrypted , with a military grade 128-bit algorithm .
the storage is dynamic , with files automatically moved between computers on the network or duplicated .
this adds to the difficulty of determining who might be storing what .
even if a user 's computer is seized , it can be impossible for experts to determine what the owner was doing on freenet .
but such strenuous efforts to protect identity have two side effects .
firstly , pages can take 10 minutes or more to download , even on a 2mbbps broadband connection .
secondly , the information is so well encrypted it is not searchable at the moment .
forget google , your only option is to scroll through the indexes provided .
it is hoped usability of the service will improve when it is re-launched later this year .
ethical issues but those are the least of our problems , according to some experts , who think freenet is a dangerous free-for-all .
millions go online in china in internet cafes digital evidence expert at the london school of economics , peter sommer says : " a few years ago i was very much in favour of libertarian computing .
" what changed my mind was the experience of acting in the english courts as a computer expert and examining large numbers of computers from really nasty people , who were using precisely the same sort of technology in order to conceal their activities .
" i think that creates an ethical dilemma for everyone who wants to participate in freenet .
" you are giving over part of your computer , it will be in encrypted form , you will not know what you are carrying , but some of it is going to be seriously unpleasant .
are you happy with that ? "
what worries many , is that freenet is a lawless area .
it can be used for many good things , like giving the oppressed a voice , but users can also preach race-hatred or share child pornography with complete impunity .
peter sommer says : " ian -lsb- clarke -rsb- is placing a powerful tool in the hands of other people .
he 's like an armaments manufacturer .
" guns can be used for all sorts of good purposes but you know perfectly well that they are used to oppress and kill .
" most armaments manufacturers walk off and say ' it 's not my responsibility ' .
is that ian 's position , i wonder ? "
ian clarke response is to explain that any tool is capable of misuse .
" we believe that the benefits of freenet , for example for dissidents in countries such as china , saudi arabia , iran far outweigh the dangers of paedophilia or terrorist information being distributed over the system , " he says .
commercial programs for the web help you maintain a high degree of anonymity while surfing or mailing , but the realm of publishing anonymously , without fear of any comeback , challenges each society to ask just how free we want ourselves and others to be .
click online is broadcast on bbc news 24 : saturday at 2030 , sunday at 0430 and 1630 , and on monday at 0030 .
a short version is also shown on bbc two : saturday at 0645 and bbc one : sunday at 0745 .
