the result is a blow for the struggling party which suffered a string of similar defeats last year . germany 's opposition conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- declared it had the won the election in the northern state of schleswig holstein on sunday after exit polls by german public broadcasters ard and zdf showed the party taking a solid 40.2 percent of the vote . the victory will provide a boost for the cdu ahead of another crucial state poll in the state of north rhine-westphalia on may 22 and should ease pressure on embattled cdu leader angela merkel . " red-green has been voted out .
they do n't have a majority of their own , " merkel said .
" this is a good omen for the election in north rhine-westphalia . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd national party leader franz muentefering with heide simonis as against that , chancellor gerhard schröder 's ruling social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- lost substantial ground , winning just 38.5 percent compared with 43.1 percent in the last election in 2000 .
the spd had ruled the state for 17 years .
" we did not achieve our primary goal in schleswig-holstein of a red-green majority , " spd national party leader franz müntefering said after the vote . the result , though yet to be officially confirmed until all the votes are counted , is a severe setback for the chancellor whose party has only recently started to recover in the polls after losing a series of state elections last year . setback for spd bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder schröder himself enjoys wide popularity amongst germans .
he has enjoyed a remarkable comeback since the summer , standing firm in the face of mass protests against his tough welfare reforms and profiting from bitter divisions in the conservative opposition ranks .
however , his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- is slumping nationwide . traditional social democratic strongholds such as hamburg or saarland are now firmly in the hands of the opposition conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
most recently , the spd plummeted to 9.8 percent of the vote in saxon state elections in eastern germany , just a fraction ahead of the right-wing national democratic party . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer in the run-up to the vote in schleswig-holstein , the spd and their green coalition partners came under increasing pressure amid concern over soaring unemployment and a scandal over a visa policy that let thousands of illegal immigrants into germany sunday 's result is expected to further demoralize the ailing spd , which is in sore need of a boost of confidence in the run-up to the 2006 general elections . heide simonis , the popular and quick-witted spd premier of schleswig holstein and a loyal schröder ally , was widely expected to edge out the cdu candidate peter harry carstensen .
personal opinion polls prior to the election consistently placed her ahead of carstensen .
however , she has been criticized for hardly mentioning unemployment on the campaign trail , despite the fact that schleswig-holstein suffers the worst jobless rate in western germany . on sunday , simonis said she was disappointed by the result , but insisted that the spd had led a good and committed political campaign and had tackled the right issues . far-right party not in the extreme-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- meanwhile will fail to gain a seat in the state parliament after only scoring around two percent of the votes , the exit polls showed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a demonstration of neo-nazis last september , the npd won seats in a regional parliament for the first time since 1968 when it surged to 9.2 percent in the eastern state of saxony . the party caused controversy in the saxony parliament last month when its representatives refused to take part in a minute 's silence for the victims of auschwitz . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cdu battles image problem germany 's conservatives are fighting an image problem with state elections looming .

on sunday , spain becomes the first country to put the matter directly to the people .
here 's a look at the remaining hurdles for the constitution . amid fears of an embarrassingly low turnout spaniards began voting sunday in a referendum on the proposed eu constitution which most of the 35-million electorate profess to back .
" today we are taking a decision of great importance for the future of a united europe , and also for spain , for its future and its well-being , " spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero said as he cast his vote sunday . spain is the first of 10 eu member states holding a popular vote on the text which is designed to streamline decision-making in the 25-member bloc which last year took in 10 new , mainly eastern european , members .
opinion polls have consistently shown the " yes " camp well ahead of those opposed , with some 45 percent of voters asked saying they back the constitution to only seven or eight percent defiantly against .
the spaniards have kicked off a long ratification process . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the eu summit in brussels last june , the uk independence party poster placed a poster in brussels asking the united kingdom 's prime minister , tony blair , not to sign the european constitution so far , lithuania , hungary and slovenia have already given the constitution the green light via their parliaments , but spain 's referendum is the first of 10 polls .
with voters from euroskeptical countries like denmark , britain , ireland and france still in line , the eu constitution 's fathers and mothers will be waiting uneasily in the months to come .
only one country needs to reject the document for it to fail .
spain 's approval looks certain but is by no means guaranteed .
the latest survey showed 51.2 percent of spaniards in favor but the poll had a margin of error of 2 percent , so everything is still open in the country on the iberian peninsula .
french go to polls in the summer french president jacques chirac is an advocate of the eu constitution .
but he has some work ahead to convince his countrymen and women who could go to the polls in june .
an early february poll by the ifop polling company put the proponents ahead of the opponents 25 to 20 percent with a large 46 percent undecided .
in 1992 , the french made the eu nervous when they narrowly approved the treaty of maastricht , which among other things created the foundation for the eu 's common currency , the euro .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all eyes on europe london will be taking its time , waiting until early 2006 before letting brits go to the polls to decide .
the danes have already rejected two eu treaties in 1992 and 2000 .
the political leaders in both the government and the opposition do n't want to see that happen in this vote and are asking their supporters to vote " yes . "
the irish , another nay-sayer to an eu treaty , are leaning towards approval .
finally , the outcome of the referendum in poland is unclear because of a lack of interest .
in order to ensure the 50 percent voter participation required to make a referendum valid , the government will combine it with national elections .
not all eu citizens get to vote on their constitution the eu 's most populous country , germany , is not putting the matter to the people .
both houses of parliament must ratify the treaty with a two-thirds majority .
this friday , the upper house , the bundesrat , began the ratification debate .
in less than one week , the lower house , the bundestag will have the topic on the agenda .
the country 's two largest parties , the ruling social democrats and the conservative christian democrats , both favor the constitution .
foreign minister joschka fischer has said he wants the ratification process over before parliament 's summer break .

if one bad apple spoils the bunch and a country rejects the constitution , the document would have to be reworked .
or the country would have to renegotiate its status with the eu .
if all countries approve the document , it will become binding in 2007 , introducing new eu posts such as an eu foreign minister and an eu president , who would sit at the head of the board of european leaders . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de putting the constitution to the test this friday in spain , the eu constitution faces the first of ten national referendums .

now , the european commission is using a new program called pro-invest to try and get private industry aboard the development train .
just last week , the president of tanzania was in berlin , trying to convince german businesses to set up shop in his country .
tanzania has a lot to offer : natural resources , cheap labor , and a bureaucracy that is easy to navigate - or so the pitch went . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the odidi delta is the economic lifeblood of nigeria , but despite its natural wealth , it remains mired in poverty but subsidiaries of european firms in developing countries often go under due to problems in basic infrastructure : water failures , electricity blackouts , crumbling streets and a lack of railways to transport goods - things that are usually provided by the government . seeking partners but eckhard hinzen , the representative of the eu program pro-invest , sees a different way out of this catch-22 situation . " we want to institute a change , and we are inviting private companies to be our partners , " he said .
" it is new , in that until now private firms have mostly kept to the role of delivering goods and services .
now , we want them to be our -lrb- development -rrb- partners . " to help his cause , hinzen has a lot of money to distribute : € 110 million -lrb- $ 144 million -rrb- of european development funds are available to support partnership programs between europe and some 70 developing countries in africa , the caribbean and the pacific . his simple message to the companies : developing african nations are a huge , untapped market .
better supplies of electricity , gas and water , more streets , etc , mean more growth .
in many countries , these areas are currently being privatized .
and on top of that , there is financing available for companies that want to take part . shaaban said kayungilo , an economics student from tanzania , agreed with hinzen . " we come from a system where the government had a monopoly on the economy , and that led to many problems , " he said .
" now we need to look to the private sector to develop our country . " combining private and public more investment by private firms would lead to a new way of thinking in the wealthier nations , hinzen added . " there should n't be a strict separation of financing for public investment and for the private sector , " he said .
" we want to combine these things , use public monies to create a sensible leverage for the private sector . " those are already active in these developing countries also said they agree with the plan . peter teschemacher , who works with the german construction firm bauer spezialtiefbau , has invested in africa for the last 10 years . " this kind of support would be really helpful , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 20.02.2005 a rough road to ratification großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanish premier zapatero has it easier than most eu leaders three countries have already said " yes " to the eu constitution .
on sunday , spain becomes the first country to put the matter directly to the people .
here 's a look at the remaining hurdles for the constitution . amid fears of an embarrassingly low turnout spaniards began voting sunday in a referendum on the proposed eu constitution which most of the 35-million electorate profess to back .
" today we are taking a decision of great importance for the future of a united europe , and also for spain , for its future and its well-being , " spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero said as he cast his vote sunday . spain is the first of 10 eu member states holding a popular vote on the text which is designed to streamline decision-making in the 25-member bloc which last year took in 10 new , mainly eastern european , members .
opinion polls have consistently shown the " yes " camp well ahead of those opposed , with some 45 percent of voters asked saying they back the constitution to only seven or eight percent defiantly against .
the spaniards have kicked off a long ratification process . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the eu summit in brussels last june , the uk independence party poster placed a poster in brussels asking the united kingdom 's prime minister , tony blair , not to sign the european constitution so far , lithuania , hungary and slovenia have already given the constitution the green light via their parliaments , but spain 's referendum is the first of 10 polls .
with voters from euroskeptical countries like denmark , britain , ireland and france still in line , the eu constitution 's fathers and mothers will be waiting uneasily in the months to come .
only one country needs to reject the document for it to fail .
spain 's approval looks certain but is by no means guaranteed .
the latest survey showed 51.2 percent of spaniards in favor but the poll had a margin of error of 2 percent , so everything is still open in the country on the iberian peninsula .
french go to polls in the summer french president jacques chirac is an advocate of the eu constitution .
but he has some work ahead to convince his countrymen and women who could go to the polls in june .
an early february poll by the ifop polling company put the proponents ahead of the opponents 25 to 20 percent with a large 46 percent undecided .
in 1992 , the french made the eu nervous when they narrowly approved the treaty of maastricht , which among other things created the foundation for the eu 's common currency , the euro .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all eyes on europe london will be taking its time , waiting until early 2006 before letting brits go to the polls to decide .
the danes have already rejected two eu treaties in 1992 and 2000 .
the political leaders in both the government and the opposition do n't want to see that happen in this vote and are asking their supporters to vote " yes . "
the irish , another nay-sayer to an eu treaty , are leaning towards approval .
finally , the outcome of the referendum in poland is unclear because of a lack of interest .
in order to ensure the 50 percent voter participation required to make a referendum valid , the government will combine it with national elections .
not all eu citizens get to vote on their constitution the eu 's most populous country , germany , is not putting the matter to the people .
both houses of parliament must ratify the treaty with a two-thirds majority .
this friday , the upper house , the bundesrat , began the ratification debate .
in less than one week , the lower house , the bundestag will have the topic on the agenda .
the country 's two largest parties , the ruling social democrats and the conservative christian democrats , both favor the constitution .

now , the european commission is using a new program called pro-invest to try and get private industry aboard the development train .
just last week , the president of tanzania was in berlin , trying to convince german businesses to set up shop in his country .
tanzania has a lot to offer : natural resources , cheap labor , and a bureaucracy that is easy to navigate - or so the pitch went . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the odidi delta is the economic lifeblood of nigeria , but despite its natural wealth , it remains mired in poverty but subsidiaries of european firms in developing countries often go under due to problems in basic infrastructure : water failures , electricity blackouts , crumbling streets and a lack of railways to transport goods - things that are usually provided by the government . seeking partners but eckhard hinzen , the representative of the eu program pro-invest , sees a different way out of this catch-22 situation . " we want to institute a change , and we are inviting private companies to be our partners , " he said .
" it is new , in that until now private firms have mostly kept to the role of delivering goods and services .
now , we want them to be our -lrb- development -rrb- partners . " to help his cause , hinzen has a lot of money to distribute : € 110 million -lrb- $ 144 million -rrb- of european development funds are available to support partnership programs between europe and some 70 developing countries in africa , the caribbean and the pacific . his simple message to the companies : developing african nations are a huge , untapped market .
better supplies of electricity , gas and water , more streets , etc , mean more growth .
in many countries , these areas are currently being privatized .
and on top of that , there is financing available for companies that want to take part . shaaban said kayungilo , an economics student from tanzania , agreed with hinzen . " we come from a system where the government had a monopoly on the economy , and that led to many problems , " he said .
" now we need to look to the private sector to develop our country . " combining private and public more investment by private firms would lead to a new way of thinking in the wealthier nations , hinzen added . " there should n't be a strict separation of financing for public investment and for the private sector , " he said .
" we want to combine these things , use public monies to create a sensible leverage for the private sector . " those are already active in these developing countries also said they agree with the plan . peter teschemacher , who works with the german construction firm bauer spezialtiefbau , has invested in africa for the last 10 years . " this kind of support would be really helpful , " he said .
" even a positive attitude would be the first step in a good direction .

turkish cypriots will sunday elect a government for their breakaway state , but the political deadlock gripping their community amid failures to reunite the island is unlikely to cease before presidential polls in april . the self-proclaimed turkish republic of northern cyprus -lrb- trnc -rrb- was forced to call early elections after the ruling coalition lost its slim majority in may and subsequent efforts to stitch together a stable government failed . but opinion polls predict sunday 's elections will produce as fragmented a political picture as at the last general elections in december 2003 , fanning concerns of continuing uncertainty in the isolated statelet .
with no immediate hope of a breakthrough on the political scene , campaigning has been lackluster and excitement among the electorate marginal in the build-up to the polls . " i do not think much will change and i do not understand why we are holding elections when there will be no change , " aydin hikmet , a 64-year-old musician from the turkish sector of europe 's last divided capital , said .
" it is a waste of money . " political stability in the trnc is crucial for any revival of peace efforts to reunify cyprus , which have stalled since a un blueprint was voted down by greek cypriots despite overwhelming backing by the turkish cypriots last april .
the outcome of the referendum ensured that only the internationally recognized greek cypriot side enjoys the benefits of eu membership since the island joined the bloc on may 1 , leaving brussels with a diplomatic hot potato . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a turkish cypriot man sits in front of the flags of turkey , left , and breakaway turkish cypriot state , with an election poster of the national unity party in the center , in the turkish part of nicosia , northern cyprus , saturday , dec .
13 , 2003 .
" turkish cypriots eagerly cast votes both in the 2003 elections and the referendum with hopes for a settlement .
" but their expectations were in vain and now they have next to no excitement for the upcoming elections , " said 39-year-old engineer levent ozverel . denktash to go settlement of the cyprus conflict has become even more important for the european union with turkey readying to begin accession talks with the bloc on oct 3 .
but observers say any fresh initiative to draw the island 's communities back to the negotiating table would have to wait until after the april presidential election , when veteran trnc leader rauf denktash is set to stand down . outgoing prime minister mehmet ali talat 's center-left republican turkish party -lrb- ctp -rrb- looks set to garner 35.9 percent of the vote , according to a recent poll conducted by the kadem research center and published in the kibris newspaper .
that would give the ctp 20 of parliament 's 50 seats , well short of an outright majority and forcing it to craft yet another coalition . in december 2003 , bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish cypriot supporters of the cyprus reunification plan celebrate in the turkish part of nicosia , cyprus , saturday night , april 24 , 2004 after the results .
referendum results show that 64.91 percent of turkish cypriots voted in favor of the u.n. reunification plan , and 76 percent of the greek cypriots rejected it. the pro-settlement talat won 35.2 percent of the vote and formed a fragile coalition with the small center-right democrat party -lrb- dp -rrb- .
but he was forced to resign last october after his government lost its parliamentary majority shortly after the referendum on the un plan . " the turkish cypriots are not separatists .
they want unification on the island , " talat told dw-radio . the same kadem poll predicted that talat 's main rival , the nationalist national unity party -lrb- ubp -rrb- would win 32 percent of the vote and retain its 18 seats in parliament .
the dp is also likely to keep its seven seats , while the peace and democracy movement - close to talat - may lose one of its current six seats , according to the survey .
the three other parties running in the elections would fail to pass the five-percent parliamentary threshold , the poll showed . cyprus has been divided along ethnic lines since 1974 when turkey occupied its northern third in response to an athens-engineered coup aimed at uniting the island with greece .

the dp is also likely to keep its seven seats , while the peace and democracy movement - close to talat - may lose one of its current six seats , according to the survey .
the three other parties running in the elections would fail to pass the five-percent parliamentary threshold , the poll showed . cyprus has been divided along ethnic lines since 1974 when turkey occupied its northern third in response to an athens-engineered coup aimed at uniting the island with greece .

the result is a blow for the struggling party which suffered a string of similar defeats last year . germany 's opposition conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- declared it had the won the election in the northern state of schleswig holstein on sunday after exit polls by german public broadcasters ard and zdf showed the party taking a solid 40.2 percent of the vote . the victory will provide a boost for the cdu ahead of another crucial state poll in the state of north rhine-westphalia on may 22 and should ease pressure on embattled cdu leader angela merkel . " red-green has been voted out .
they do n't have a majority of their own , " merkel said .
" this is a good omen for the election in north rhine-westphalia . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd national party leader franz muentefering with heide simonis as against that , chancellor gerhard schröder 's ruling social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- lost substantial ground , winning just 38.5 percent compared with 43.1 percent in the last election in 2000 .
the spd had ruled the state for 17 years .
" we did not achieve our primary goal in schleswig-holstein of a red-green majority , " spd national party leader franz müntefering said after the vote . the result , though yet to be officially confirmed until all the votes are counted , is a severe setback for the chancellor whose party has only recently started to recover in the polls after losing a series of state elections last year . setback for spd bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder schröder himself enjoys wide popularity amongst germans .
he has enjoyed a remarkable comeback since the summer , standing firm in the face of mass protests against his tough welfare reforms and profiting from bitter divisions in the conservative opposition ranks .
however , his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- is slumping nationwide . traditional social democratic strongholds such as hamburg or saarland are now firmly in the hands of the opposition conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
most recently , the spd plummeted to 9.8 percent of the vote in saxon state elections in eastern germany , just a fraction ahead of the right-wing national democratic party . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer in the run-up to the vote in schleswig-holstein , the spd and their green coalition partners came under increasing pressure amid concern over soaring unemployment and a scandal over a visa policy that let thousands of illegal immigrants into germany sunday 's result is expected to further demoralize the ailing spd , which is in sore need of a boost of confidence in the run-up to the 2006 general elections . heide simonis , the popular and quick-witted spd premier of schleswig holstein and a loyal schröder ally , was widely expected to edge out the cdu candidate peter harry carstensen .
personal opinion polls prior to the election consistently placed her ahead of carstensen .
however , she has been criticized for hardly mentioning unemployment on the campaign trail , despite the fact that schleswig-holstein suffers the worst jobless rate in western germany . on sunday , simonis said she was disappointed by the result , but insisted that the spd had led a good and committed political campaign and had tackled the right issues . far-right party not in the extreme-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- meanwhile will fail to gain a seat in the state parliament after only scoring around two percent of the votes , the exit polls showed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a demonstration of neo-nazis last september , the npd won seats in a regional parliament for the first time since 1968 when it surged to 9.2 percent in the eastern state of saxony . the party caused controversy in the saxony parliament last month when its representatives refused to take part in a minute 's silence for the victims of auschwitz . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cdu battles image problem germany 's conservatives are fighting an image problem with state elections looming .

now , the european commission is using a new program called pro-invest to try and get private industry aboard the development train .
just last week , the president of tanzania was in berlin , trying to convince german businesses to set up shop in his country .
tanzania has a lot to offer : natural resources , cheap labor , and a bureaucracy that is easy to navigate - or so the pitch went . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the odidi delta is the economic lifeblood of nigeria , but despite its natural wealth , it remains mired in poverty but subsidiaries of european firms in developing countries often go under due to problems in basic infrastructure : water failures , electricity blackouts , crumbling streets and a lack of railways to transport goods - things that are usually provided by the government . seeking partners but eckhard hinzen , the representative of the eu program pro-invest , sees a different way out of this catch-22 situation . " we want to institute a change , and we are inviting private companies to be our partners , " he said .
" it is new , in that until now private firms have mostly kept to the role of delivering goods and services .
now , we want them to be our -lrb- development -rrb- partners . " to help his cause , hinzen has a lot of money to distribute : € 110 million -lrb- $ 144 million -rrb- of european development funds are available to support partnership programs between europe and some 70 developing countries in africa , the caribbean and the pacific . his simple message to the companies : developing african nations are a huge , untapped market .
better supplies of electricity , gas and water , more streets , etc , mean more growth .
in many countries , these areas are currently being privatized .
and on top of that , there is financing available for companies that want to take part . shaaban said kayungilo , an economics student from tanzania , agreed with hinzen . " we come from a system where the government had a monopoly on the economy , and that led to many problems , " he said .
" now we need to look to the private sector to develop our country . " combining private and public more investment by private firms would lead to a new way of thinking in the wealthier nations , hinzen added . " there should n't be a strict separation of financing for public investment and for the private sector , " he said .
" we want to combine these things , use public monies to create a sensible leverage for the private sector . " those are already active in these developing countries also said they agree with the plan . peter teschemacher , who works with the german construction firm bauer spezialtiefbau , has invested in africa for the last 10 years .

turkish cypriots will sunday elect a government for their breakaway state , but the political deadlock gripping their community amid failures to reunite the island is unlikely to cease before presidential polls in april . the self-proclaimed turkish republic of northern cyprus -lrb- trnc -rrb- was forced to call early elections after the ruling coalition lost its slim majority in may and subsequent efforts to stitch together a stable government failed . but opinion polls predict sunday 's elections will produce as fragmented a political picture as at the last general elections in december 2003 , fanning concerns of continuing uncertainty in the isolated statelet .
with no immediate hope of a breakthrough on the political scene , campaigning has been lackluster and excitement among the electorate marginal in the build-up to the polls . " i do not think much will change and i do not understand why we are holding elections when there will be no change , " aydin hikmet , a 64-year-old musician from the turkish sector of europe 's last divided capital , said .
" it is a waste of money . " political stability in the trnc is crucial for any revival of peace efforts to reunify cyprus , which have stalled since a un blueprint was voted down by greek cypriots despite overwhelming backing by the turkish cypriots last april .
the outcome of the referendum ensured that only the internationally recognized greek cypriot side enjoys the benefits of eu membership since the island joined the bloc on may 1 , leaving brussels with a diplomatic hot potato . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a turkish cypriot man sits in front of the flags of turkey , left , and breakaway turkish cypriot state , with an election poster of the national unity party in the center , in the turkish part of nicosia , northern cyprus , saturday , dec .

" we want to institute a change , and we are inviting private companies to be our partners , " he said .
" it is new , in that until now private firms have mostly kept to the role of delivering goods and services .
now , we want them to be our -lrb- development -rrb- partners . " to help his cause , hinzen has a lot of money to distribute : € 110 million -lrb- $ 144 million -rrb- of european development funds are available to support partnership programs between europe and some 70 developing countries in africa , the caribbean and the pacific . his simple message to the companies : developing african nations are a huge , untapped market .
better supplies of electricity , gas and water , more streets , etc , mean more growth .
in many countries , these areas are currently being privatized .
and on top of that , there is financing available for companies that want to take part . shaaban said kayungilo , an economics student from tanzania , agreed with hinzen . " we come from a system where the government had a monopoly on the economy , and that led to many problems , " he said .
" now we need to look to the private sector to develop our country . " combining private and public more investment by private firms would lead to a new way of thinking in the wealthier nations , hinzen added . " there should n't be a strict separation of financing for public investment and for the private sector , " he said .
" we want to combine these things , use public monies to create a sensible leverage for the private sector . " those are already active in these developing countries also said they agree with the plan . peter teschemacher , who works with the german construction firm bauer spezialtiefbau , has invested in africa for the last 10 years . " this kind of support would be really helpful , " he said .
" even a positive attitude would be the first step in a good direction .

" this vote , in my opinion , means opening the door to a more united and a stronger europe so i urge all citizens to participate , " he said . purely consultative the vote is purely consultative , and parliament will ultimately have to ratify the decision . in previous referendums - for political reform in 1976 , for a democratic constitution in 1978 and to stay in nato in 1986 - turnout ranged from 60 to 78 percent . bildunterschrift : two basque men speak in the northern spanish town of pamplona , thursday , feb .

the result is a blow for the struggling party which suffered a string of similar defeats last year . germany 's opposition conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- declared it had the won the election in the northern state of schleswig holstein on sunday after exit polls by german public broadcasters ard and zdf showed the party taking a solid 40.2 percent of the vote . the victory will provide a boost for the cdu ahead of another crucial state poll in the state of north rhine-westphalia on may 22 and should ease pressure on embattled cdu leader angela merkel . " red-green has been voted out .
they do n't have a majority of their own , " merkel said .
" this is a good omen for the election in north rhine-westphalia . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd national party leader franz muentefering with heide simonis as against that , chancellor gerhard schröder 's ruling social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- lost substantial ground , winning just 38.5 percent compared with 43.1 percent in the last election in 2000 .
the spd had ruled the state for 17 years .
" we did not achieve our primary goal in schleswig-holstein of a red-green majority , " spd national party leader franz müntefering said after the vote . the result , though yet to be officially confirmed until all the votes are counted , is a severe setback for the chancellor whose party has only recently started to recover in the polls after losing a series of state elections last year . setback for spd bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder schröder himself enjoys wide popularity amongst germans .
he has enjoyed a remarkable comeback since the summer , standing firm in the face of mass protests against his tough welfare reforms and profiting from bitter divisions in the conservative opposition ranks .
however , his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- is slumping nationwide . traditional social democratic strongholds such as hamburg or saarland are now firmly in the hands of the opposition conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
most recently , the spd plummeted to 9.8 percent of the vote in saxon state elections in eastern germany , just a fraction ahead of the right-wing national democratic party . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer in the run-up to the vote in schleswig-holstein , the spd and their green coalition partners came under increasing pressure amid concern over soaring unemployment and a scandal over a visa policy that let thousands of illegal immigrants into germany sunday 's result is expected to further demoralize the ailing spd , which is in sore need of a boost of confidence in the run-up to the 2006 general elections . heide simonis , the popular and quick-witted spd premier of schleswig holstein and a loyal schröder ally , was widely expected to edge out the cdu candidate peter harry carstensen .
personal opinion polls prior to the election consistently placed her ahead of carstensen .
however , she has been criticized for hardly mentioning unemployment on the campaign trail , despite the fact that schleswig-holstein suffers the worst jobless rate in western germany . on sunday , simonis said she was disappointed by the result , but insisted that the spd had led a good and committed political campaign and had tackled the right issues . far-right party not in the extreme-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- meanwhile will fail to gain a seat in the state parliament after only scoring around two percent of the votes , the exit polls showed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a demonstration of neo-nazis last september , the npd won seats in a regional parliament for the first time since 1968 when it surged to 9.2 percent in the eastern state of saxony . the party caused controversy in the saxony parliament last month when its representatives refused to take part in a minute 's silence for the victims of auschwitz . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cdu battles image problem germany 's conservatives are fighting an image problem with state elections looming .

turkish cypriots will sunday elect a government for their breakaway state , but the political deadlock gripping their community amid failures to reunite the island is unlikely to cease before presidential polls in april . the self-proclaimed turkish republic of northern cyprus -lrb- trnc -rrb- was forced to call early elections after the ruling coalition lost its slim majority in may and subsequent efforts to stitch together a stable government failed . but opinion polls predict sunday 's elections will produce as fragmented a political picture as at the last general elections in december 2003 , fanning concerns of continuing uncertainty in the isolated statelet .
with no immediate hope of a breakthrough on the political scene , campaigning has been lackluster and excitement among the electorate marginal in the build-up to the polls . " i do not think much will change and i do not understand why we are holding elections when there will be no change , " aydin hikmet , a 64-year-old musician from the turkish sector of europe 's last divided capital , said .
" it is a waste of money . " political stability in the trnc is crucial for any revival of peace efforts to reunify cyprus , which have stalled since a un blueprint was voted down by greek cypriots despite overwhelming backing by the turkish cypriots last april .
the outcome of the referendum ensured that only the internationally recognized greek cypriot side enjoys the benefits of eu membership since the island joined the bloc on may 1 , leaving brussels with a diplomatic hot potato . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a turkish cypriot man sits in front of the flags of turkey , left , and breakaway turkish cypriot state , with an election poster of the national unity party in the center , in the turkish part of nicosia , northern cyprus , saturday , dec .

but observers say any fresh initiative to draw the island 's communities back to the negotiating table would have to wait until after the april presidential election , when veteran trnc leader rauf denktash is set to stand down . outgoing prime minister mehmet ali talat 's center-left republican turkish party -lrb- ctp -rrb- looks set to garner 35.9 percent of the vote , according to a recent poll conducted by the kadem research center and published in the kibris newspaper .
that would give the ctp 20 of parliament 's 50 seats , well short of an outright majority and forcing it to craft yet another coalition . in december 2003 , bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish cypriot supporters of the cyprus reunification plan celebrate in the turkish part of nicosia , cyprus , saturday night , april 24 , 2004 after the results .
referendum results show that 64.91 percent of turkish cypriots voted in favor of the u.n. reunification plan , and 76 percent of the greek cypriots rejected it. the pro-settlement talat won 35.2 percent of the vote and formed a fragile coalition with the small center-right democrat party -lrb- dp -rrb- .
but he was forced to resign last october after his government lost its parliamentary majority shortly after the referendum on the un plan . " the turkish cypriots are not separatists .
they want unification on the island , " talat told dw-radio . the same kadem poll predicted that talat 's main rival , the nationalist national unity party -lrb- ubp -rrb- would win 32 percent of the vote and retain its 18 seats in parliament .
the dp is also likely to keep its seven seats , while the peace and democracy movement - close to talat - may lose one of its current six seats , according to the survey .
the three other parties running in the elections would fail to pass the five-percent parliamentary threshold , the poll showed . cyprus has been divided along ethnic lines since 1974 when turkey occupied its northern third in response to an athens-engineered coup aimed at uniting the island with greece .

on sunday , spain becomes the first country to put the matter directly to the people .
here 's a look at the remaining hurdles for the constitution . amid fears of an embarrassingly low turnout spaniards began voting sunday in a referendum on the proposed eu constitution which most of the 35-million electorate profess to back .
" today we are taking a decision of great importance for the future of a united europe , and also for spain , for its future and its well-being , " spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero said as he cast his vote sunday . spain is the first of 10 eu member states holding a popular vote on the text which is designed to streamline decision-making in the 25-member bloc which last year took in 10 new , mainly eastern european , members .
opinion polls have consistently shown the " yes " camp well ahead of those opposed , with some 45 percent of voters asked saying they back the constitution to only seven or eight percent defiantly against .
the spaniards have kicked off a long ratification process . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the eu summit in brussels last june , the uk independence party poster placed a poster in brussels asking the united kingdom 's prime minister , tony blair , not to sign the european constitution so far , lithuania , hungary and slovenia have already given the constitution the green light via their parliaments , but spain 's referendum is the first of 10 polls .
with voters from euroskeptical countries like denmark , britain , ireland and france still in line , the eu constitution 's fathers and mothers will be waiting uneasily in the months to come .
only one country needs to reject the document for it to fail .
spain 's approval looks certain but is by no means guaranteed .
the latest survey showed 51.2 percent of spaniards in favor but the poll had a margin of error of 2 percent , so everything is still open in the country on the iberian peninsula .
french go to polls in the summer french president jacques chirac is an advocate of the eu constitution .
but he has some work ahead to convince his countrymen and women who could go to the polls in june .
an early february poll by the ifop polling company put the proponents ahead of the opponents 25 to 20 percent with a large 46 percent undecided .
in 1992 , the french made the eu nervous when they narrowly approved the treaty of maastricht , which among other things created the foundation for the eu 's common currency , the euro .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all eyes on europe london will be taking its time , waiting until early 2006 before letting brits go to the polls to decide .
the danes have already rejected two eu treaties in 1992 and 2000 .
the political leaders in both the government and the opposition do n't want to see that happen in this vote and are asking their supporters to vote " yes . "
the irish , another nay-sayer to an eu treaty , are leaning towards approval .
finally , the outcome of the referendum in poland is unclear because of a lack of interest .
in order to ensure the 50 percent voter participation required to make a referendum valid , the government will combine it with national elections .
not all eu citizens get to vote on their constitution the eu 's most populous country , germany , is not putting the matter to the people .
both houses of parliament must ratify the treaty with a two-thirds majority .
this friday , the upper house , the bundesrat , began the ratification debate .
in less than one week , the lower house , the bundestag will have the topic on the agenda .
the country 's two largest parties , the ruling social democrats and the conservative christian democrats , both favor the constitution .
foreign minister joschka fischer has said he wants the ratification process over before parliament 's summer break .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : current european union foreign policy chief javier solana - future eu foreign minister ?
by october 2006 , all 25 countries , in whichever way they feel is appropriate , must have approved the constitution .
if one bad apple spoils the bunch and a country rejects the constitution , the document would have to be reworked .
or the country would have to renegotiate its status with the eu .
if all countries approve the document , it will become binding in 2007 , introducing new eu posts such as an eu foreign minister and an eu president , who would sit at the head of the board of european leaders . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de putting the constitution to the test this friday in spain , the eu constitution faces the first of ten national referendums .

the european commission is examining german visas issued to eastern europeans , which are at the heart of a political scandal in the country , to determine whether they violated european law . a spokesman for the eu 's justice commissioner franco frattini confirmed sunday that the eu was looking into the matter .
" the commission has launched an investigation to find out if germany 's actions concerning the visas were in breach of european law , " said spokesman friso roscam abbing , in an interview to the german mass-selling daily bild . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the visa scandal involves joschka fischer , germany 's foreign minister and most popular politician , and the decision by his ministry in 1999 to ease conditions for citizens of the former soviet bloc to acquire german visas . germany 's conservative opposition has charged that " hundreds of thousands " of illegal immigrants from eastern europe - ukraine in particular - were able to enter the country on tourist visas between 2000 and 2003 , many of them with the help of organized crime networks .
the incoming numbers apparently included hundreds of illegal immigrants , prostitutes and human traffickers . the german parliament has started an investigation into the alleged mass smuggling of eastern europeans into germany . the inquiry by the commission in brussels , the european union 's executive arm , will verify whether german directives were in accordance with eu regulations .
in 1990 , the schengen accord established a european zone for the free movement of people and required member countries to maintain control of their borders at the zone 's common exterior . flood of visa-holders in march 2000 , the so-called volmer directive , named after germany 's former secretary of state ludger volmer , encouraged embassies to cut through the red tape for visas following complaints to the ministry that it was too strict in dispensing visas in decisions concerning family reunions and sickness . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people wait at the german embassy in the ukrainian capital of kiew to apply for a visa .
volmer then reportedly issued a decree that , when in doubt , embassy workers should decide in favor of issuing a visa to an applicant . the consequence of this directive was a drastic increase in the number of visas authorized by german embassies around the world .
a flood of applicants followed .
in 2001 , the number of visas approved by the embassy in kiev , ukraine alone reached 400,000 .
it was a large number , considering the 190 german embassies worldwide issue only 3 million visas each year on average . the directive was cancelled in march 2003 . afp / dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de when will fischer take the hot seat ?

tanzania has a lot to offer : natural resources , cheap labor , and a bureaucracy that is easy to navigate - or so the pitch went . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the odidi delta is the economic lifeblood of nigeria , but despite its natural wealth , it remains mired in poverty but subsidiaries of european firms in developing countries often go under due to problems in basic infrastructure : water failures , electricity blackouts , crumbling streets and a lack of railways to transport goods - things that are usually provided by the government . seeking partners but eckhard hinzen , the representative of the eu program pro-invest , sees a different way out of this catch-22 situation . " we want to institute a change , and we are inviting private companies to be our partners , " he said .
" it is new , in that until now private firms have mostly kept to the role of delivering goods and services .
now , we want them to be our -lrb- development -rrb- partners . " to help his cause , hinzen has a lot of money to distribute : € 110 million -lrb- $ 144 million -rrb- of european development funds are available to support partnership programs between europe and some 70 developing countries in africa , the caribbean and the pacific . his simple message to the companies : developing african nations are a huge , untapped market .
better supplies of electricity , gas and water , more streets , etc , mean more growth .
in many countries , these areas are currently being privatized .
and on top of that , there is financing available for companies that want to take part . shaaban said kayungilo , an economics student from tanzania , agreed with hinzen . " we come from a system where the government had a monopoly on the economy , and that led to many problems , " he said .
" now we need to look to the private sector to develop our country . " combining private and public more investment by private firms would lead to a new way of thinking in the wealthier nations , hinzen added . " there should n't be a strict separation of financing for public investment and for the private sector , " he said .
" we want to combine these things , use public monies to create a sensible leverage for the private sector . " those are already active in these developing countries also said they agree with the plan . peter teschemacher , who works with the german construction firm bauer spezialtiefbau , has invested in africa for the last 10 years . " this kind of support would be really helpful , " he said .
" even a positive attitude would be the first step in a good direction .

the european commission is examining german visas issued to eastern europeans , which are at the heart of a political scandal in the country , to determine whether they violated european law . a spokesman for the eu 's justice commissioner franco frattini confirmed sunday that the eu was looking into the matter .
" the commission has launched an investigation to find out if germany 's actions concerning the visas were in breach of european law , " said spokesman friso roscam abbing , in an interview to the german mass-selling daily bild . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the visa scandal involves joschka fischer , germany 's foreign minister and most popular politician , and the decision by his ministry in 1999 to ease conditions for citizens of the former soviet bloc to acquire german visas . germany 's conservative opposition has charged that " hundreds of thousands " of illegal immigrants from eastern europe - ukraine in particular - were able to enter the country on tourist visas between 2000 and 2003 , many of them with the help of organized crime networks .
the incoming numbers apparently included hundreds of illegal immigrants , prostitutes and human traffickers . the german parliament has started an investigation into the alleged mass smuggling of eastern europeans into germany . the inquiry by the commission in brussels , the european union 's executive arm , will verify whether german directives were in accordance with eu regulations .
in 1990 , the schengen accord established a european zone for the free movement of people and required member countries to maintain control of their borders at the zone 's common exterior . flood of visa-holders in march 2000 , the so-called volmer directive , named after germany 's former secretary of state ludger volmer , encouraged embassies to cut through the red tape for visas following complaints to the ministry that it was too strict in dispensing visas in decisions concerning family reunions and sickness . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people wait at the german embassy in the ukrainian capital of kiew to apply for a visa .
volmer then reportedly issued a decree that , when in doubt , embassy workers should decide in favor of issuing a visa to an applicant . the consequence of this directive was a drastic increase in the number of visas authorized by german embassies around the world .
a flood of applicants followed .
in 2001 , the number of visas approved by the embassy in kiev , ukraine alone reached 400,000 .
it was a large number , considering the 190 german embassies worldwide issue only 3 million visas each year on average . the directive was cancelled in march 2003 . afp / dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de when will fischer take the hot seat ?

the european commission is examining german visas issued to eastern europeans , which are at the heart of a political scandal in the country , to determine whether they violated european law . a spokesman for the eu 's justice commissioner franco frattini confirmed sunday that the eu was looking into the matter .
" the commission has launched an investigation to find out if germany 's actions concerning the visas were in breach of european law , " said spokesman friso roscam abbing , in an interview to the german mass-selling daily bild . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the visa scandal involves joschka fischer , germany 's foreign minister and most popular politician , and the decision by his ministry in 1999 to ease conditions for citizens of the former soviet bloc to acquire german visas . germany 's conservative opposition has charged that " hundreds of thousands " of illegal immigrants from eastern europe - ukraine in particular - were able to enter the country on tourist visas between 2000 and 2003 , many of them with the help of organized crime networks .
the incoming numbers apparently included hundreds of illegal immigrants , prostitutes and human traffickers . the german parliament has started an investigation into the alleged mass smuggling of eastern europeans into germany . the inquiry by the commission in brussels , the european union 's executive arm , will verify whether german directives were in accordance with eu regulations .

volmer then reportedly issued a decree that , when in doubt , embassy workers should decide in favor of issuing a visa to an applicant . the consequence of this directive was a drastic increase in the number of visas authorized by german embassies around the world .
a flood of applicants followed .
in 2001 , the number of visas approved by the embassy in kiev , ukraine alone reached 400,000 .

the european commission is examining german visas issued to eastern europeans , which are at the heart of a political scandal in the country , to determine whether they violated european law . a spokesman for the eu 's justice commissioner franco frattini confirmed sunday that the eu was looking into the matter .
" the commission has launched an investigation to find out if germany 's actions concerning the visas were in breach of european law , " said spokesman friso roscam abbing , in an interview to the german mass-selling daily bild . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the visa scandal involves joschka fischer , germany 's foreign minister and most popular politician , and the decision by his ministry in 1999 to ease conditions for citizens of the former soviet bloc to acquire german visas . germany 's conservative opposition has charged that " hundreds of thousands " of illegal immigrants from eastern europe - ukraine in particular - were able to enter the country on tourist visas between 2000 and 2003 , many of them with the help of organized crime networks .
the incoming numbers apparently included hundreds of illegal immigrants , prostitutes and human traffickers . the german parliament has started an investigation into the alleged mass smuggling of eastern europeans into germany . the inquiry by the commission in brussels , the european union 's executive arm , will verify whether german directives were in accordance with eu regulations .
in 1990 , the schengen accord established a european zone for the free movement of people and required member countries to maintain control of their borders at the zone 's common exterior . flood of visa-holders in march 2000 , the so-called volmer directive , named after germany 's former secretary of state ludger volmer , encouraged embassies to cut through the red tape for visas following complaints to the ministry that it was too strict in dispensing visas in decisions concerning family reunions and sickness . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people wait at the german embassy in the ukrainian capital of kiew to apply for a visa .
volmer then reportedly issued a decree that , when in doubt , embassy workers should decide in favor of issuing a visa to an applicant . the consequence of this directive was a drastic increase in the number of visas authorized by german embassies around the world .
a flood of applicants followed .
in 2001 , the number of visas approved by the embassy in kiev , ukraine alone reached 400,000 .
it was a large number , considering the 190 german embassies worldwide issue only 3 million visas each year on average . the directive was cancelled in march 2003 . afp / dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de when will fischer take the hot seat ?

now , the european commission is using a new program called pro-invest to try and get private industry aboard the development train .
just last week , the president of tanzania was in berlin , trying to convince german businesses to set up shop in his country .
tanzania has a lot to offer : natural resources , cheap labor , and a bureaucracy that is easy to navigate - or so the pitch went . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the odidi delta is the economic lifeblood of nigeria , but despite its natural wealth , it remains mired in poverty but subsidiaries of european firms in developing countries often go under due to problems in basic infrastructure : water failures , electricity blackouts , crumbling streets and a lack of railways to transport goods - things that are usually provided by the government . seeking partners but eckhard hinzen , the representative of the eu program pro-invest , sees a different way out of this catch-22 situation . " we want to institute a change , and we are inviting private companies to be our partners , " he said .
" it is new , in that until now private firms have mostly kept to the role of delivering goods and services .
now , we want them to be our -lrb- development -rrb- partners . " to help his cause , hinzen has a lot of money to distribute : € 110 million -lrb- $ 144 million -rrb- of european development funds are available to support partnership programs between europe and some 70 developing countries in africa , the caribbean and the pacific . his simple message to the companies : developing african nations are a huge , untapped market .
better supplies of electricity , gas and water , more streets , etc , mean more growth .
in many countries , these areas are currently being privatized .
and on top of that , there is financing available for companies that want to take part . shaaban said kayungilo , an economics student from tanzania , agreed with hinzen . " we come from a system where the government had a monopoly on the economy , and that led to many problems , " he said .
" now we need to look to the private sector to develop our country . " combining private and public more investment by private firms would lead to a new way of thinking in the wealthier nations , hinzen added . " there should n't be a strict separation of financing for public investment and for the private sector , " he said .
" we want to combine these things , use public monies to create a sensible leverage for the private sector . " those are already active in these developing countries also said they agree with the plan . peter teschemacher , who works with the german construction firm bauer spezialtiefbau , has invested in africa for the last 10 years . " this kind of support would be really helpful , " he said .
" even a positive attitude would be the first step in a good direction .

the result is a blow for the struggling party which suffered a string of similar defeats last year . germany 's opposition conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- declared it had the won the election in the northern state of schleswig holstein on sunday after exit polls by german public broadcasters ard and zdf showed the party taking a solid 40.2 percent of the vote . the victory will provide a boost for the cdu ahead of another crucial state poll in the state of north rhine-westphalia on may 22 and should ease pressure on embattled cdu leader angela merkel .

the spd had ruled the state for 17 years .
" we did not achieve our primary goal in schleswig-holstein of a red-green majority , " spd national party leader franz müntefering said after the vote . the result , though yet to be officially confirmed until all the votes are counted , is a severe setback for the chancellor whose party has only recently started to recover in the polls after losing a series of state elections last year . setback for spd bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder schröder himself enjoys wide popularity amongst germans .

most recently , the spd plummeted to 9.8 percent of the vote in saxon state elections in eastern germany , just a fraction ahead of the right-wing national democratic party . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer in the run-up to the vote in schleswig-holstein , the spd and their green coalition partners came under increasing pressure amid concern over soaring unemployment and a scandal over a visa policy that let thousands of illegal immigrants into germany sunday 's result is expected to further demoralize the ailing spd , which is in sore need of a boost of confidence in the run-up to the 2006 general elections . heide simonis , the popular and quick-witted spd premier of schleswig holstein and a loyal schröder ally , was widely expected to edge out the cdu candidate peter harry carstensen .
personal opinion polls prior to the election consistently placed her ahead of carstensen .
however , she has been criticized for hardly mentioning unemployment on the campaign trail , despite the fact that schleswig-holstein suffers the worst jobless rate in western germany . on sunday , simonis said she was disappointed by the result , but insisted that the spd had led a good and committed political campaign and had tackled the right issues . far-right party not in the extreme-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- meanwhile will fail to gain a seat in the state parliament after only scoring around two percent of the votes , the exit polls showed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a demonstration of neo-nazis last september , the npd won seats in a regional parliament for the first time since 1968 when it surged to 9.2 percent in the eastern state of saxony . the party caused controversy in the saxony parliament last month when its representatives refused to take part in a minute 's silence for the victims of auschwitz . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cdu battles image problem germany 's conservatives are fighting an image problem with state elections looming .

however , she has been criticized for hardly mentioning unemployment on the campaign trail , despite the fact that schleswig-holstein suffers the worst jobless rate in western germany . on sunday , simonis said she was disappointed by the result , but insisted that the spd had led a good and committed political campaign and had tackled the right issues . far-right party not in the extreme-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- meanwhile will fail to gain a seat in the state parliament after only scoring around two percent of the votes , the exit polls showed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a demonstration of neo-nazis last september , the npd won seats in a regional parliament for the first time since 1968 when it surged to 9.2 percent in the eastern state of saxony . the party caused controversy in the saxony parliament last month when its representatives refused to take part in a minute 's silence for the victims of auschwitz . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cdu battles image problem germany 's conservatives are fighting an image problem with state elections looming .

turkish cypriots will sunday elect a government for their breakaway state , but the political deadlock gripping their community amid failures to reunite the island is unlikely to cease before presidential polls in april . the self-proclaimed turkish republic of northern cyprus -lrb- trnc -rrb- was forced to call early elections after the ruling coalition lost its slim majority in may and subsequent efforts to stitch together a stable government failed . but opinion polls predict sunday 's elections will produce as fragmented a political picture as at the last general elections in december 2003 , fanning concerns of continuing uncertainty in the isolated statelet .
with no immediate hope of a breakthrough on the political scene , campaigning has been lackluster and excitement among the electorate marginal in the build-up to the polls . " i do not think much will change and i do not understand why we are holding elections when there will be no change , " aydin hikmet , a 64-year-old musician from the turkish sector of europe 's last divided capital , said .
" it is a waste of money . " political stability in the trnc is crucial for any revival of peace efforts to reunify cyprus , which have stalled since a un blueprint was voted down by greek cypriots despite overwhelming backing by the turkish cypriots last april .
the outcome of the referendum ensured that only the internationally recognized greek cypriot side enjoys the benefits of eu membership since the island joined the bloc on may 1 , leaving brussels with a diplomatic hot potato . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a turkish cypriot man sits in front of the flags of turkey , left , and breakaway turkish cypriot state , with an election poster of the national unity party in the center , in the turkish part of nicosia , northern cyprus , saturday , dec .

but observers say any fresh initiative to draw the island 's communities back to the negotiating table would have to wait until after the april presidential election , when veteran trnc leader rauf denktash is set to stand down . outgoing prime minister mehmet ali talat 's center-left republican turkish party -lrb- ctp -rrb- looks set to garner 35.9 percent of the vote , according to a recent poll conducted by the kadem research center and published in the kibris newspaper .

referendum results show that 64.91 percent of turkish cypriots voted in favor of the u.n. reunification plan , and 76 percent of the greek cypriots rejected it. the pro-settlement talat won 35.2 percent of the vote and formed a fragile coalition with the small center-right democrat party -lrb- dp -rrb- .
but he was forced to resign last october after his government lost its parliamentary majority shortly after the referendum on the un plan . " the turkish cypriots are not separatists .
they want unification on the island , " talat told dw-radio . the same kadem poll predicted that talat 's main rival , the nationalist national unity party -lrb- ubp -rrb- would win 32 percent of the vote and retain its 18 seats in parliament .
the dp is also likely to keep its seven seats , while the peace and democracy movement - close to talat - may lose one of its current six seats , according to the survey .
the three other parties running in the elections would fail to pass the five-percent parliamentary threshold , the poll showed . cyprus has been divided along ethnic lines since 1974 when turkey occupied its northern third in response to an athens-engineered coup aimed at uniting the island with greece .

turkish cypriots will sunday elect a government for their breakaway state , but the political deadlock gripping their community amid failures to reunite the island is unlikely to cease before presidential polls in april . the self-proclaimed turkish republic of northern cyprus -lrb- trnc -rrb- was forced to call early elections after the ruling coalition lost its slim majority in may and subsequent efforts to stitch together a stable government failed . but opinion polls predict sunday 's elections will produce as fragmented a political picture as at the last general elections in december 2003 , fanning concerns of continuing uncertainty in the isolated statelet .
with no immediate hope of a breakthrough on the political scene , campaigning has been lackluster and excitement among the electorate marginal in the build-up to the polls . " i do not think much will change and i do not understand why we are holding elections when there will be no change , " aydin hikmet , a 64-year-old musician from the turkish sector of europe 's last divided capital , said .
" it is a waste of money . " political stability in the trnc is crucial for any revival of peace efforts to reunify cyprus , which have stalled since a un blueprint was voted down by greek cypriots despite overwhelming backing by the turkish cypriots last april .
the outcome of the referendum ensured that only the internationally recognized greek cypriot side enjoys the benefits of eu membership since the island joined the bloc on may 1 , leaving brussels with a diplomatic hot potato . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a turkish cypriot man sits in front of the flags of turkey , left , and breakaway turkish cypriot state , with an election poster of the national unity party in the center , in the turkish part of nicosia , northern cyprus , saturday , dec .

" turkish cypriots eagerly cast votes both in the 2003 elections and the referendum with hopes for a settlement .
" but their expectations were in vain and now they have next to no excitement for the upcoming elections , " said 39-year-old engineer levent ozverel . denktash to go settlement of the cyprus conflict has become even more important for the european union with turkey readying to begin accession talks with the bloc on oct 3 .
but observers say any fresh initiative to draw the island 's communities back to the negotiating table would have to wait until after the april presidential election , when veteran trnc leader rauf denktash is set to stand down . outgoing prime minister mehmet ali talat 's center-left republican turkish party -lrb- ctp -rrb- looks set to garner 35.9 percent of the vote , according to a recent poll conducted by the kadem research center and published in the kibris newspaper .
that would give the ctp 20 of parliament 's 50 seats , well short of an outright majority and forcing it to craft yet another coalition . in december 2003 , bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish cypriot supporters of the cyprus reunification plan celebrate in the turkish part of nicosia , cyprus , saturday night , april 24 , 2004 after the results .
referendum results show that 64.91 percent of turkish cypriots voted in favor of the u.n. reunification plan , and 76 percent of the greek cypriots rejected it. the pro-settlement talat won 35.2 percent of the vote and formed a fragile coalition with the small center-right democrat party -lrb- dp -rrb- .
but he was forced to resign last october after his government lost its parliamentary majority shortly after the referendum on the un plan . " the turkish cypriots are not separatists .
they want unification on the island , " talat told dw-radio . the same kadem poll predicted that talat 's main rival , the nationalist national unity party -lrb- ubp -rrb- would win 32 percent of the vote and retain its 18 seats in parliament .
the dp is also likely to keep its seven seats , while the peace and democracy movement - close to talat - may lose one of its current six seats , according to the survey .
the three other parties running in the elections would fail to pass the five-percent parliamentary threshold , the poll showed . cyprus has been divided along ethnic lines since 1974 when turkey occupied its northern third in response to an athens-engineered coup aimed at uniting the island with greece .

he has enjoyed a remarkable comeback since the summer , standing firm in the face of mass protests against his tough welfare reforms and profiting from bitter divisions in the conservative opposition ranks .
however , his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- is slumping nationwide . traditional social democratic strongholds such as hamburg or saarland are now firmly in the hands of the opposition conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
most recently , the spd plummeted to 9.8 percent of the vote in saxon state elections in eastern germany , just a fraction ahead of the right-wing national democratic party . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer in the run-up to the vote in schleswig-holstein , the spd and their green coalition partners came under increasing pressure amid concern over soaring unemployment and a scandal over a visa policy that let thousands of illegal immigrants into germany sunday 's result is expected to further demoralize the ailing spd , which is in sore need of a boost of confidence in the run-up to the 2006 general elections . heide simonis , the popular and quick-witted spd premier of schleswig holstein and a loyal schröder ally , was widely expected to edge out the cdu candidate peter harry carstensen .
personal opinion polls prior to the election consistently placed her ahead of carstensen .
however , she has been criticized for hardly mentioning unemployment on the campaign trail , despite the fact that schleswig-holstein suffers the worst jobless rate in western germany . on sunday , simonis said she was disappointed by the result , but insisted that the spd had led a good and committed political campaign and had tackled the right issues . far-right party not in the extreme-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- meanwhile will fail to gain a seat in the state parliament after only scoring around two percent of the votes , the exit polls showed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a demonstration of neo-nazis last september , the npd won seats in a regional parliament for the first time since 1968 when it surged to 9.2 percent in the eastern state of saxony . the party caused controversy in the saxony parliament last month when its representatives refused to take part in a minute 's silence for the victims of auschwitz . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cdu battles image problem germany 's conservatives are fighting an image problem with state elections looming .

the european commission is examining german visas issued to eastern europeans , which are at the heart of a political scandal in the country , to determine whether they violated european law . a spokesman for the eu 's justice commissioner franco frattini confirmed sunday that the eu was looking into the matter .
" the commission has launched an investigation to find out if germany 's actions concerning the visas were in breach of european law , " said spokesman friso roscam abbing , in an interview to the german mass-selling daily bild . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the visa scandal involves joschka fischer , germany 's foreign minister and most popular politician , and the decision by his ministry in 1999 to ease conditions for citizens of the former soviet bloc to acquire german visas . germany 's conservative opposition has charged that " hundreds of thousands " of illegal immigrants from eastern europe - ukraine in particular - were able to enter the country on tourist visas between 2000 and 2003 , many of them with the help of organized crime networks .
the incoming numbers apparently included hundreds of illegal immigrants , prostitutes and human traffickers . the german parliament has started an investigation into the alleged mass smuggling of eastern europeans into germany . the inquiry by the commission in brussels , the european union 's executive arm , will verify whether german directives were in accordance with eu regulations .
in 1990 , the schengen accord established a european zone for the free movement of people and required member countries to maintain control of their borders at the zone 's common exterior . flood of visa-holders in march 2000 , the so-called volmer directive , named after germany 's former secretary of state ludger volmer , encouraged embassies to cut through the red tape for visas following complaints to the ministry that it was too strict in dispensing visas in decisions concerning family reunions and sickness . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people wait at the german embassy in the ukrainian capital of kiew to apply for a visa .
volmer then reportedly issued a decree that , when in doubt , embassy workers should decide in favor of issuing a visa to an applicant . the consequence of this directive was a drastic increase in the number of visas authorized by german embassies around the world .
a flood of applicants followed .
in 2001 , the number of visas approved by the embassy in kiev , ukraine alone reached 400,000 .
it was a large number , considering the 190 german embassies worldwide issue only 3 million visas each year on average . the directive was cancelled in march 2003 . afp / dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de when will fischer take the hot seat ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 20.02.2005 turkish cypriots face fractured vote großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the vote spell an end to political uncertainty ?
turkish cypriots will sunday elect a government for their breakaway state , but the political deadlock gripping their community amid failures to reunite the island is unlikely to cease before presidential polls in april . the self-proclaimed turkish republic of northern cyprus -lrb- trnc -rrb- was forced to call early elections after the ruling coalition lost its slim majority in may and subsequent efforts to stitch together a stable government failed . but opinion polls predict sunday 's elections will produce as fragmented a political picture as at the last general elections in december 2003 , fanning concerns of continuing uncertainty in the isolated statelet .
with no immediate hope of a breakthrough on the political scene , campaigning has been lackluster and excitement among the electorate marginal in the build-up to the polls . " i do not think much will change and i do not understand why we are holding elections when there will be no change , " aydin hikmet , a 64-year-old musician from the turkish sector of europe 's last divided capital , said .
" it is a waste of money . " political stability in the trnc is crucial for any revival of peace efforts to reunify cyprus , which have stalled since a un blueprint was voted down by greek cypriots despite overwhelming backing by the turkish cypriots last april .
the outcome of the referendum ensured that only the internationally recognized greek cypriot side enjoys the benefits of eu membership since the island joined the bloc on may 1 , leaving brussels with a diplomatic hot potato . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a turkish cypriot man sits in front of the flags of turkey , left , and breakaway turkish cypriot state , with an election poster of the national unity party in the center , in the turkish part of nicosia , northern cyprus , saturday , dec .
13 , 2003 .
" turkish cypriots eagerly cast votes both in the 2003 elections and the referendum with hopes for a settlement .
" but their expectations were in vain and now they have next to no excitement for the upcoming elections , " said 39-year-old engineer levent ozverel . denktash to go settlement of the cyprus conflict has become even more important for the european union with turkey readying to begin accession talks with the bloc on oct 3 .
but observers say any fresh initiative to draw the island 's communities back to the negotiating table would have to wait until after the april presidential election , when veteran trnc leader rauf denktash is set to stand down . outgoing prime minister mehmet ali talat 's center-left republican turkish party -lrb- ctp -rrb- looks set to garner 35.9 percent of the vote , according to a recent poll conducted by the kadem research center and published in the kibris newspaper .
that would give the ctp 20 of parliament 's 50 seats , well short of an outright majority and forcing it to craft yet another coalition . in december 2003 , bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish cypriot supporters of the cyprus reunification plan celebrate in the turkish part of nicosia , cyprus , saturday night , april 24 , 2004 after the results .
referendum results show that 64.91 percent of turkish cypriots voted in favor of the u.n. reunification plan , and 76 percent of the greek cypriots rejected it. the pro-settlement talat won 35.2 percent of the vote and formed a fragile coalition with the small center-right democrat party -lrb- dp -rrb- .
but he was forced to resign last october after his government lost its parliamentary majority shortly after the referendum on the un plan . " the turkish cypriots are not separatists .
they want unification on the island , " talat told dw-radio . the same kadem poll predicted that talat 's main rival , the nationalist national unity party -lrb- ubp -rrb- would win 32 percent of the vote and retain its 18 seats in parliament .
the dp is also likely to keep its seven seats , while the peace and democracy movement - close to talat - may lose one of its current six seats , according to the survey .

the result is a blow for the struggling party which suffered a string of similar defeats last year . germany 's opposition conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- declared it had the won the election in the northern state of schleswig holstein on sunday after exit polls by german public broadcasters ard and zdf showed the party taking a solid 40.2 percent of the vote . the victory will provide a boost for the cdu ahead of another crucial state poll in the state of north rhine-westphalia on may 22 and should ease pressure on embattled cdu leader angela merkel .

the spd had ruled the state for 17 years .
" we did not achieve our primary goal in schleswig-holstein of a red-green majority , " spd national party leader franz müntefering said after the vote . the result , though yet to be officially confirmed until all the votes are counted , is a severe setback for the chancellor whose party has only recently started to recover in the polls after losing a series of state elections last year . setback for spd bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder schröder himself enjoys wide popularity amongst germans .

however , she has been criticized for hardly mentioning unemployment on the campaign trail , despite the fact that schleswig-holstein suffers the worst jobless rate in western germany . on sunday , simonis said she was disappointed by the result , but insisted that the spd had led a good and committed political campaign and had tackled the right issues . far-right party not in the extreme-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- meanwhile will fail to gain a seat in the state parliament after only scoring around two percent of the votes , the exit polls showed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a demonstration of neo-nazis last september , the npd won seats in a regional parliament for the first time since 1968 when it surged to 9.2 percent in the eastern state of saxony . the party caused controversy in the saxony parliament last month when its representatives refused to take part in a minute 's silence for the victims of auschwitz . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cdu battles image problem germany 's conservatives are fighting an image problem with state elections looming .

on sunday , spain becomes the first country to put the matter directly to the people .
here 's a look at the remaining hurdles for the constitution . amid fears of an embarrassingly low turnout spaniards began voting sunday in a referendum on the proposed eu constitution which most of the 35-million electorate profess to back .
" today we are taking a decision of great importance for the future of a united europe , and also for spain , for its future and its well-being , " spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero said as he cast his vote sunday . spain is the first of 10 eu member states holding a popular vote on the text which is designed to streamline decision-making in the 25-member bloc which last year took in 10 new , mainly eastern european , members .
opinion polls have consistently shown the " yes " camp well ahead of those opposed , with some 45 percent of voters asked saying they back the constitution to only seven or eight percent defiantly against .
the spaniards have kicked off a long ratification process . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the eu summit in brussels last june , the uk independence party poster placed a poster in brussels asking the united kingdom 's prime minister , tony blair , not to sign the european constitution so far , lithuania , hungary and slovenia have already given the constitution the green light via their parliaments , but spain 's referendum is the first of 10 polls .
with voters from euroskeptical countries like denmark , britain , ireland and france still in line , the eu constitution 's fathers and mothers will be waiting uneasily in the months to come .
only one country needs to reject the document for it to fail .
spain 's approval looks certain but is by no means guaranteed .
the latest survey showed 51.2 percent of spaniards in favor but the poll had a margin of error of 2 percent , so everything is still open in the country on the iberian peninsula .
french go to polls in the summer french president jacques chirac is an advocate of the eu constitution .
but he has some work ahead to convince his countrymen and women who could go to the polls in june .
an early february poll by the ifop polling company put the proponents ahead of the opponents 25 to 20 percent with a large 46 percent undecided .
in 1992 , the french made the eu nervous when they narrowly approved the treaty of maastricht , which among other things created the foundation for the eu 's common currency , the euro .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all eyes on europe london will be taking its time , waiting until early 2006 before letting brits go to the polls to decide .
the danes have already rejected two eu treaties in 1992 and 2000 .
the political leaders in both the government and the opposition do n't want to see that happen in this vote and are asking their supporters to vote " yes . "
the irish , another nay-sayer to an eu treaty , are leaning towards approval .
finally , the outcome of the referendum in poland is unclear because of a lack of interest .
in order to ensure the 50 percent voter participation required to make a referendum valid , the government will combine it with national elections .
not all eu citizens get to vote on their constitution the eu 's most populous country , germany , is not putting the matter to the people .
both houses of parliament must ratify the treaty with a two-thirds majority .
this friday , the upper house , the bundesrat , began the ratification debate .
in less than one week , the lower house , the bundestag will have the topic on the agenda .
the country 's two largest parties , the ruling social democrats and the conservative christian democrats , both favor the constitution .
foreign minister joschka fischer has said he wants the ratification process over before parliament 's summer break .

now , the european commission is using a new program called pro-invest to try and get private industry aboard the development train .
just last week , the president of tanzania was in berlin , trying to convince german businesses to set up shop in his country .
tanzania has a lot to offer : natural resources , cheap labor , and a bureaucracy that is easy to navigate - or so the pitch went . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the odidi delta is the economic lifeblood of nigeria , but despite its natural wealth , it remains mired in poverty but subsidiaries of european firms in developing countries often go under due to problems in basic infrastructure : water failures , electricity blackouts , crumbling streets and a lack of railways to transport goods - things that are usually provided by the government . seeking partners but eckhard hinzen , the representative of the eu program pro-invest , sees a different way out of this catch-22 situation . " we want to institute a change , and we are inviting private companies to be our partners , " he said .
" it is new , in that until now private firms have mostly kept to the role of delivering goods and services .
now , we want them to be our -lrb- development -rrb- partners .

better supplies of electricity , gas and water , more streets , etc , mean more growth .
in many countries , these areas are currently being privatized .
and on top of that , there is financing available for companies that want to take part . shaaban said kayungilo , an economics student from tanzania , agreed with hinzen . " we come from a system where the government had a monopoly on the economy , and that led to many problems , " he said .
" now we need to look to the private sector to develop our country . " combining private and public more investment by private firms would lead to a new way of thinking in the wealthier nations , hinzen added . " there should n't be a strict separation of financing for public investment and for the private sector , " he said .
" we want to combine these things , use public monies to create a sensible leverage for the private sector . " those are already active in these developing countries also said they agree with the plan . peter teschemacher , who works with the german construction firm bauer spezialtiefbau , has invested in africa for the last 10 years .

on sunday , spain becomes the first country to put the matter directly to the people .
here 's a look at the remaining hurdles for the constitution . amid fears of an embarrassingly low turnout spaniards began voting sunday in a referendum on the proposed eu constitution which most of the 35-million electorate profess to back .
" today we are taking a decision of great importance for the future of a united europe , and also for spain , for its future and its well-being , " spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero said as he cast his vote sunday . spain is the first of 10 eu member states holding a popular vote on the text which is designed to streamline decision-making in the 25-member bloc which last year took in 10 new , mainly eastern european , members .

on sunday , spain becomes the first country to put the matter directly to the people .
here 's a look at the remaining hurdles for the constitution . amid fears of an embarrassingly low turnout spaniards began voting sunday in a referendum on the proposed eu constitution which most of the 35-million electorate profess to back .
" today we are taking a decision of great importance for the future of a united europe , and also for spain , for its future and its well-being , " spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero said as he cast his vote sunday . spain is the first of 10 eu member states holding a popular vote on the text which is designed to streamline decision-making in the 25-member bloc which last year took in 10 new , mainly eastern european , members .
opinion polls have consistently shown the " yes " camp well ahead of those opposed , with some 45 percent of voters asked saying they back the constitution to only seven or eight percent defiantly against .
the spaniards have kicked off a long ratification process . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the eu summit in brussels last june , the uk independence party poster placed a poster in brussels asking the united kingdom 's prime minister , tony blair , not to sign the european constitution so far , lithuania , hungary and slovenia have already given the constitution the green light via their parliaments , but spain 's referendum is the first of 10 polls .
with voters from euroskeptical countries like denmark , britain , ireland and france still in line , the eu constitution 's fathers and mothers will be waiting uneasily in the months to come .
only one country needs to reject the document for it to fail .
spain 's approval looks certain but is by no means guaranteed .

the political leaders in both the government and the opposition do n't want to see that happen in this vote and are asking their supporters to vote " yes . "
the irish , another nay-sayer to an eu treaty , are leaning towards approval .
finally , the outcome of the referendum in poland is unclear because of a lack of interest .
in order to ensure the 50 percent voter participation required to make a referendum valid , the government will combine it with national elections .
not all eu citizens get to vote on their constitution the eu 's most populous country , germany , is not putting the matter to the people .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 20.02.2005 schröder party loses key state poll großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : premier simonis was unable to stop the spd 's losing streak chancellor schröder 's social democrats have unexpectedly lost power in schleswig-holstein according to exit polls .
the result is a blow for the struggling party which suffered a string of similar defeats last year . germany 's opposition conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- declared it had the won the election in the northern state of schleswig holstein on sunday after exit polls by german public broadcasters ard and zdf showed the party taking a solid 40.2 percent of the vote . the victory will provide a boost for the cdu ahead of another crucial state poll in the state of north rhine-westphalia on may 22 and should ease pressure on embattled cdu leader angela merkel . " red-green has been voted out .
they do n't have a majority of their own , " merkel said .
" this is a good omen for the election in north rhine-westphalia . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd national party leader franz muentefering with heide simonis as against that , chancellor gerhard schröder 's ruling social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- lost substantial ground , winning just 38.5 percent compared with 43.1 percent in the last election in 2000 .
the spd had ruled the state for 17 years .
" we did not achieve our primary goal in schleswig-holstein of a red-green majority , " spd national party leader franz müntefering said after the vote . the result , though yet to be officially confirmed until all the votes are counted , is a severe setback for the chancellor whose party has only recently started to recover in the polls after losing a series of state elections last year . setback for spd bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder schröder himself enjoys wide popularity amongst germans .
he has enjoyed a remarkable comeback since the summer , standing firm in the face of mass protests against his tough welfare reforms and profiting from bitter divisions in the conservative opposition ranks .
however , his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- is slumping nationwide . traditional social democratic strongholds such as hamburg or saarland are now firmly in the hands of the opposition conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .

on sunday , spain becomes the first country to put the matter directly to the people .
here 's a look at the remaining hurdles for the constitution . amid fears of an embarrassingly low turnout spaniards began voting sunday in a referendum on the proposed eu constitution which most of the 35-million electorate profess to back .
" today we are taking a decision of great importance for the future of a united europe , and also for spain , for its future and its well-being , " spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero said as he cast his vote sunday . spain is the first of 10 eu member states holding a popular vote on the text which is designed to streamline decision-making in the 25-member bloc which last year took in 10 new , mainly eastern european , members .
opinion polls have consistently shown the " yes " camp well ahead of those opposed , with some 45 percent of voters asked saying they back the constitution to only seven or eight percent defiantly against .
the spaniards have kicked off a long ratification process . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the eu summit in brussels last june , the uk independence party poster placed a poster in brussels asking the united kingdom 's prime minister , tony blair , not to sign the european constitution so far , lithuania , hungary and slovenia have already given the constitution the green light via their parliaments , but spain 's referendum is the first of 10 polls .
with voters from euroskeptical countries like denmark , britain , ireland and france still in line , the eu constitution 's fathers and mothers will be waiting uneasily in the months to come .
only one country needs to reject the document for it to fail .
spain 's approval looks certain but is by no means guaranteed .
the latest survey showed 51.2 percent of spaniards in favor but the poll had a margin of error of 2 percent , so everything is still open in the country on the iberian peninsula .
french go to polls in the summer french president jacques chirac is an advocate of the eu constitution .
but he has some work ahead to convince his countrymen and women who could go to the polls in june .
an early february poll by the ifop polling company put the proponents ahead of the opponents 25 to 20 percent with a large 46 percent undecided .
in 1992 , the french made the eu nervous when they narrowly approved the treaty of maastricht , which among other things created the foundation for the eu 's common currency , the euro .

the political leaders in both the government and the opposition do n't want to see that happen in this vote and are asking their supporters to vote " yes . "
the irish , another nay-sayer to an eu treaty , are leaning towards approval .
finally , the outcome of the referendum in poland is unclear because of a lack of interest .
in order to ensure the 50 percent voter participation required to make a referendum valid , the government will combine it with national elections .
not all eu citizens get to vote on their constitution the eu 's most populous country , germany , is not putting the matter to the people .

the result is a blow for the struggling party which suffered a string of similar defeats last year . germany 's opposition conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- declared it had the won the election in the northern state of schleswig holstein on sunday after exit polls by german public broadcasters ard and zdf showed the party taking a solid 40.2 percent of the vote . the victory will provide a boost for the cdu ahead of another crucial state poll in the state of north rhine-westphalia on may 22 and should ease pressure on embattled cdu leader angela merkel . " red-green has been voted out .
they do n't have a majority of their own , " merkel said .
" this is a good omen for the election in north rhine-westphalia . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd national party leader franz muentefering with heide simonis as against that , chancellor gerhard schröder 's ruling social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- lost substantial ground , winning just 38.5 percent compared with 43.1 percent in the last election in 2000 .
the spd had ruled the state for 17 years .
" we did not achieve our primary goal in schleswig-holstein of a red-green majority , " spd national party leader franz müntefering said after the vote . the result , though yet to be officially confirmed until all the votes are counted , is a severe setback for the chancellor whose party has only recently started to recover in the polls after losing a series of state elections last year . setback for spd bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder schröder himself enjoys wide popularity amongst germans .
he has enjoyed a remarkable comeback since the summer , standing firm in the face of mass protests against his tough welfare reforms and profiting from bitter divisions in the conservative opposition ranks .
however , his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- is slumping nationwide . traditional social democratic strongholds such as hamburg or saarland are now firmly in the hands of the opposition conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
most recently , the spd plummeted to 9.8 percent of the vote in saxon state elections in eastern germany , just a fraction ahead of the right-wing national democratic party . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer in the run-up to the vote in schleswig-holstein , the spd and their green coalition partners came under increasing pressure amid concern over soaring unemployment and a scandal over a visa policy that let thousands of illegal immigrants into germany sunday 's result is expected to further demoralize the ailing spd , which is in sore need of a boost of confidence in the run-up to the 2006 general elections . heide simonis , the popular and quick-witted spd premier of schleswig holstein and a loyal schröder ally , was widely expected to edge out the cdu candidate peter harry carstensen .
personal opinion polls prior to the election consistently placed her ahead of carstensen .
however , she has been criticized for hardly mentioning unemployment on the campaign trail , despite the fact that schleswig-holstein suffers the worst jobless rate in western germany . on sunday , simonis said she was disappointed by the result , but insisted that the spd had led a good and committed political campaign and had tackled the right issues . far-right party not in the extreme-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- meanwhile will fail to gain a seat in the state parliament after only scoring around two percent of the votes , the exit polls showed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a demonstration of neo-nazis last september , the npd won seats in a regional parliament for the first time since 1968 when it surged to 9.2 percent in the eastern state of saxony . the party caused controversy in the saxony parliament last month when its representatives refused to take part in a minute 's silence for the victims of auschwitz . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cdu battles image problem germany 's conservatives are fighting an image problem with state elections looming .

turkish cypriots will sunday elect a government for their breakaway state , but the political deadlock gripping their community amid failures to reunite the island is unlikely to cease before presidential polls in april . the self-proclaimed turkish republic of northern cyprus -lrb- trnc -rrb- was forced to call early elections after the ruling coalition lost its slim majority in may and subsequent efforts to stitch together a stable government failed . but opinion polls predict sunday 's elections will produce as fragmented a political picture as at the last general elections in december 2003 , fanning concerns of continuing uncertainty in the isolated statelet .
with no immediate hope of a breakthrough on the political scene , campaigning has been lackluster and excitement among the electorate marginal in the build-up to the polls . " i do not think much will change and i do not understand why we are holding elections when there will be no change , " aydin hikmet , a 64-year-old musician from the turkish sector of europe 's last divided capital , said .
" it is a waste of money . " political stability in the trnc is crucial for any revival of peace efforts to reunify cyprus , which have stalled since a un blueprint was voted down by greek cypriots despite overwhelming backing by the turkish cypriots last april .
the outcome of the referendum ensured that only the internationally recognized greek cypriot side enjoys the benefits of eu membership since the island joined the bloc on may 1 , leaving brussels with a diplomatic hot potato . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a turkish cypriot man sits in front of the flags of turkey , left , and breakaway turkish cypriot state , with an election poster of the national unity party in the center , in the turkish part of nicosia , northern cyprus , saturday , dec .

" turkish cypriots eagerly cast votes both in the 2003 elections and the referendum with hopes for a settlement .
" but their expectations were in vain and now they have next to no excitement for the upcoming elections , " said 39-year-old engineer levent ozverel . denktash to go settlement of the cyprus conflict has become even more important for the european union with turkey readying to begin accession talks with the bloc on oct 3 .
but observers say any fresh initiative to draw the island 's communities back to the negotiating table would have to wait until after the april presidential election , when veteran trnc leader rauf denktash is set to stand down . outgoing prime minister mehmet ali talat 's center-left republican turkish party -lrb- ctp -rrb- looks set to garner 35.9 percent of the vote , according to a recent poll conducted by the kadem research center and published in the kibris newspaper .
that would give the ctp 20 of parliament 's 50 seats , well short of an outright majority and forcing it to craft yet another coalition . in december 2003 , bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish cypriot supporters of the cyprus reunification plan celebrate in the turkish part of nicosia , cyprus , saturday night , april 24 , 2004 after the results .
referendum results show that 64.91 percent of turkish cypriots voted in favor of the u.n. reunification plan , and 76 percent of the greek cypriots rejected it. the pro-settlement talat won 35.2 percent of the vote and formed a fragile coalition with the small center-right democrat party -lrb- dp -rrb- .
but he was forced to resign last october after his government lost its parliamentary majority shortly after the referendum on the un plan . " the turkish cypriots are not separatists .
they want unification on the island , " talat told dw-radio . the same kadem poll predicted that talat 's main rival , the nationalist national unity party -lrb- ubp -rrb- would win 32 percent of the vote and retain its 18 seats in parliament .
the dp is also likely to keep its seven seats , while the peace and democracy movement - close to talat - may lose one of its current six seats , according to the survey .
the three other parties running in the elections would fail to pass the five-percent parliamentary threshold , the poll showed . cyprus has been divided along ethnic lines since 1974 when turkey occupied its northern third in response to an athens-engineered coup aimed at uniting the island with greece .
turkey , which still keeps some 30,000 troops in the north of the island , is the only state to recognize the trnc , which was founded in 1983 . dw staff / afp -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de breakthrough at eu-turkey talks turkey and the eu 's presidency struck an agreement friday to end an impasse blocking the launch of eu membership talks with ankara , a turkish diplomat said .

turkish cypriots will sunday elect a government for their breakaway state , but the political deadlock gripping their community amid failures to reunite the island is unlikely to cease before presidential polls in april . the self-proclaimed turkish republic of northern cyprus -lrb- trnc -rrb- was forced to call early elections after the ruling coalition lost its slim majority in may and subsequent efforts to stitch together a stable government failed . but opinion polls predict sunday 's elections will produce as fragmented a political picture as at the last general elections in december 2003 , fanning concerns of continuing uncertainty in the isolated statelet .
with no immediate hope of a breakthrough on the political scene , campaigning has been lackluster and excitement among the electorate marginal in the build-up to the polls . " i do not think much will change and i do not understand why we are holding elections when there will be no change , " aydin hikmet , a 64-year-old musician from the turkish sector of europe 's last divided capital , said .
" it is a waste of money . " political stability in the trnc is crucial for any revival of peace efforts to reunify cyprus , which have stalled since a un blueprint was voted down by greek cypriots despite overwhelming backing by the turkish cypriots last april .
the outcome of the referendum ensured that only the internationally recognized greek cypriot side enjoys the benefits of eu membership since the island joined the bloc on may 1 , leaving brussels with a diplomatic hot potato . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a turkish cypriot man sits in front of the flags of turkey , left , and breakaway turkish cypriot state , with an election poster of the national unity party in the center , in the turkish part of nicosia , northern cyprus , saturday , dec .

the european commission is examining german visas issued to eastern europeans , which are at the heart of a political scandal in the country , to determine whether they violated european law . a spokesman for the eu 's justice commissioner franco frattini confirmed sunday that the eu was looking into the matter .
" the commission has launched an investigation to find out if germany 's actions concerning the visas were in breach of european law , " said spokesman friso roscam abbing , in an interview to the german mass-selling daily bild . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the visa scandal involves joschka fischer , germany 's foreign minister and most popular politician , and the decision by his ministry in 1999 to ease conditions for citizens of the former soviet bloc to acquire german visas . germany 's conservative opposition has charged that " hundreds of thousands " of illegal immigrants from eastern europe - ukraine in particular - were able to enter the country on tourist visas between 2000 and 2003 , many of them with the help of organized crime networks .
the incoming numbers apparently included hundreds of illegal immigrants , prostitutes and human traffickers . the german parliament has started an investigation into the alleged mass smuggling of eastern europeans into germany . the inquiry by the commission in brussels , the european union 's executive arm , will verify whether german directives were in accordance with eu regulations .
in 1990 , the schengen accord established a european zone for the free movement of people and required member countries to maintain control of their borders at the zone 's common exterior . flood of visa-holders in march 2000 , the so-called volmer directive , named after germany 's former secretary of state ludger volmer , encouraged embassies to cut through the red tape for visas following complaints to the ministry that it was too strict in dispensing visas in decisions concerning family reunions and sickness . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people wait at the german embassy in the ukrainian capital of kiew to apply for a visa .
volmer then reportedly issued a decree that , when in doubt , embassy workers should decide in favor of issuing a visa to an applicant . the consequence of this directive was a drastic increase in the number of visas authorized by german embassies around the world .
a flood of applicants followed .
in 2001 , the number of visas approved by the embassy in kiev , ukraine alone reached 400,000 .
it was a large number , considering the 190 german embassies worldwide issue only 3 million visas each year on average . the directive was cancelled in march 2003 . afp / dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de when will fischer take the hot seat ?

the european commission is examining german visas issued to eastern europeans , which are at the heart of a political scandal in the country , to determine whether they violated european law . a spokesman for the eu 's justice commissioner franco frattini confirmed sunday that the eu was looking into the matter .
" the commission has launched an investigation to find out if germany 's actions concerning the visas were in breach of european law , " said spokesman friso roscam abbing , in an interview to the german mass-selling daily bild . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the visa scandal involves joschka fischer , germany 's foreign minister and most popular politician , and the decision by his ministry in 1999 to ease conditions for citizens of the former soviet bloc to acquire german visas . germany 's conservative opposition has charged that " hundreds of thousands " of illegal immigrants from eastern europe - ukraine in particular - were able to enter the country on tourist visas between 2000 and 2003 , many of them with the help of organized crime networks .
the incoming numbers apparently included hundreds of illegal immigrants , prostitutes and human traffickers . the german parliament has started an investigation into the alleged mass smuggling of eastern europeans into germany . the inquiry by the commission in brussels , the european union 's executive arm , will verify whether german directives were in accordance with eu regulations .
in 1990 , the schengen accord established a european zone for the free movement of people and required member countries to maintain control of their borders at the zone 's common exterior . flood of visa-holders in march 2000 , the so-called volmer directive , named after germany 's former secretary of state ludger volmer , encouraged embassies to cut through the red tape for visas following complaints to the ministry that it was too strict in dispensing visas in decisions concerning family reunions and sickness . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people wait at the german embassy in the ukrainian capital of kiew to apply for a visa .
volmer then reportedly issued a decree that , when in doubt , embassy workers should decide in favor of issuing a visa to an applicant . the consequence of this directive was a drastic increase in the number of visas authorized by german embassies around the world .
a flood of applicants followed .
in 2001 , the number of visas approved by the embassy in kiev , ukraine alone reached 400,000 .
it was a large number , considering the 190 german embassies worldwide issue only 3 million visas each year on average . the directive was cancelled in march 2003 . afp / dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de when will fischer take the hot seat ?

in theory at least , all 25 member states must back the constitution for it to take effect . an ipsos poll for spanish tve television released when polls closed at 8pm -lrb- 1900 gmt -rrb- , showed between 77 and 80 percent of those who cast ballots were in favor , while 15 to 17 percent were opposed .
spoiled ballots accounted for between five and six percent . " a united europe " " if the result is confirmed we can say it is very positive for spain and for europe , " said ruling socialist party spokesman jose blanco .

" today we are taking a decision of great significance for the future of a united europe and which is very important for spain also , " zapatero said after casting his own ballot in madrid .

the european commission is examining german visas issued to eastern europeans , which are at the heart of a political scandal in the country , to determine whether they violated european law . a spokesman for the eu 's justice commissioner franco frattini confirmed sunday that the eu was looking into the matter .
" the commission has launched an investigation to find out if germany 's actions concerning the visas were in breach of european law , " said spokesman friso roscam abbing , in an interview to the german mass-selling daily bild . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the visa scandal involves joschka fischer , germany 's foreign minister and most popular politician , and the decision by his ministry in 1999 to ease conditions for citizens of the former soviet bloc to acquire german visas . germany 's conservative opposition has charged that " hundreds of thousands " of illegal immigrants from eastern europe - ukraine in particular - were able to enter the country on tourist visas between 2000 and 2003 , many of them with the help of organized crime networks .
the incoming numbers apparently included hundreds of illegal immigrants , prostitutes and human traffickers . the german parliament has started an investigation into the alleged mass smuggling of eastern europeans into germany . the inquiry by the commission in brussels , the european union 's executive arm , will verify whether german directives were in accordance with eu regulations .
in 1990 , the schengen accord established a european zone for the free movement of people and required member countries to maintain control of their borders at the zone 's common exterior . flood of visa-holders in march 2000 , the so-called volmer directive , named after germany 's former secretary of state ludger volmer , encouraged embassies to cut through the red tape for visas following complaints to the ministry that it was too strict in dispensing visas in decisions concerning family reunions and sickness . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people wait at the german embassy in the ukrainian capital of kiew to apply for a visa .
volmer then reportedly issued a decree that , when in doubt , embassy workers should decide in favor of issuing a visa to an applicant . the consequence of this directive was a drastic increase in the number of visas authorized by german embassies around the world .
a flood of applicants followed .
in 2001 , the number of visas approved by the embassy in kiev , ukraine alone reached 400,000 .
it was a large number , considering the 190 german embassies worldwide issue only 3 million visas each year on average . the directive was cancelled in march 2003 . afp / dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de when will fischer take the hot seat ?

the european commission is examining german visas issued to eastern europeans , which are at the heart of a political scandal in the country , to determine whether they violated european law . a spokesman for the eu 's justice commissioner franco frattini confirmed sunday that the eu was looking into the matter .
" the commission has launched an investigation to find out if germany 's actions concerning the visas were in breach of european law , " said spokesman friso roscam abbing , in an interview to the german mass-selling daily bild . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the visa scandal involves joschka fischer , germany 's foreign minister and most popular politician , and the decision by his ministry in 1999 to ease conditions for citizens of the former soviet bloc to acquire german visas . germany 's conservative opposition has charged that " hundreds of thousands " of illegal immigrants from eastern europe - ukraine in particular - were able to enter the country on tourist visas between 2000 and 2003 , many of them with the help of organized crime networks .
the incoming numbers apparently included hundreds of illegal immigrants , prostitutes and human traffickers . the german parliament has started an investigation into the alleged mass smuggling of eastern europeans into germany . the inquiry by the commission in brussels , the european union 's executive arm , will verify whether german directives were in accordance with eu regulations .
in 1990 , the schengen accord established a european zone for the free movement of people and required member countries to maintain control of their borders at the zone 's common exterior . flood of visa-holders in march 2000 , the so-called volmer directive , named after germany 's former secretary of state ludger volmer , encouraged embassies to cut through the red tape for visas following complaints to the ministry that it was too strict in dispensing visas in decisions concerning family reunions and sickness . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people wait at the german embassy in the ukrainian capital of kiew to apply for a visa .
volmer then reportedly issued a decree that , when in doubt , embassy workers should decide in favor of issuing a visa to an applicant . the consequence of this directive was a drastic increase in the number of visas authorized by german embassies around the world .
a flood of applicants followed .
in 2001 , the number of visas approved by the embassy in kiev , ukraine alone reached 400,000 .
it was a large number , considering the 190 german embassies worldwide issue only 3 million visas each year on average . the directive was cancelled in march 2003 . afp / dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de when will fischer take the hot seat ?

the european commission is examining german visas issued to eastern europeans , which are at the heart of a political scandal in the country , to determine whether they violated european law . a spokesman for the eu 's justice commissioner franco frattini confirmed sunday that the eu was looking into the matter .
" the commission has launched an investigation to find out if germany 's actions concerning the visas were in breach of european law , " said spokesman friso roscam abbing , in an interview to the german mass-selling daily bild . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the visa scandal involves joschka fischer , germany 's foreign minister and most popular politician , and the decision by his ministry in 1999 to ease conditions for citizens of the former soviet bloc to acquire german visas . germany 's conservative opposition has charged that " hundreds of thousands " of illegal immigrants from eastern europe - ukraine in particular - were able to enter the country on tourist visas between 2000 and 2003 , many of them with the help of organized crime networks .
the incoming numbers apparently included hundreds of illegal immigrants , prostitutes and human traffickers . the german parliament has started an investigation into the alleged mass smuggling of eastern europeans into germany . the inquiry by the commission in brussels , the european union 's executive arm , will verify whether german directives were in accordance with eu regulations .
in 1990 , the schengen accord established a european zone for the free movement of people and required member countries to maintain control of their borders at the zone 's common exterior . flood of visa-holders in march 2000 , the so-called volmer directive , named after germany 's former secretary of state ludger volmer , encouraged embassies to cut through the red tape for visas following complaints to the ministry that it was too strict in dispensing visas in decisions concerning family reunions and sickness . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people wait at the german embassy in the ukrainian capital of kiew to apply for a visa .
volmer then reportedly issued a decree that , when in doubt , embassy workers should decide in favor of issuing a visa to an applicant . the consequence of this directive was a drastic increase in the number of visas authorized by german embassies around the world .
a flood of applicants followed .
in 2001 , the number of visas approved by the embassy in kiev , ukraine alone reached 400,000 .
it was a large number , considering the 190 german embassies worldwide issue only 3 million visas each year on average . the directive was cancelled in march 2003 . afp / dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de when will fischer take the hot seat ?
these are tough times for joschka fischer .
germany 's most popular politician is facing stiff criticism for his responsibility in an illegal immigration affair .
his fate depends on the outcome of a raging political war .

turkish cypriots will sunday elect a government for their breakaway state , but the political deadlock gripping their community amid failures to reunite the island is unlikely to cease before presidential polls in april . the self-proclaimed turkish republic of northern cyprus -lrb- trnc -rrb- was forced to call early elections after the ruling coalition lost its slim majority in may and subsequent efforts to stitch together a stable government failed . but opinion polls predict sunday 's elections will produce as fragmented a political picture as at the last general elections in december 2003 , fanning concerns of continuing uncertainty in the isolated statelet .
with no immediate hope of a breakthrough on the political scene , campaigning has been lackluster and excitement among the electorate marginal in the build-up to the polls . " i do not think much will change and i do not understand why we are holding elections when there will be no change , " aydin hikmet , a 64-year-old musician from the turkish sector of europe 's last divided capital , said .
" it is a waste of money . " political stability in the trnc is crucial for any revival of peace efforts to reunify cyprus , which have stalled since a un blueprint was voted down by greek cypriots despite overwhelming backing by the turkish cypriots last april .
the outcome of the referendum ensured that only the internationally recognized greek cypriot side enjoys the benefits of eu membership since the island joined the bloc on may 1 , leaving brussels with a diplomatic hot potato . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a turkish cypriot man sits in front of the flags of turkey , left , and breakaway turkish cypriot state , with an election poster of the national unity party in the center , in the turkish part of nicosia , northern cyprus , saturday , dec .
13 , 2003 .
" turkish cypriots eagerly cast votes both in the 2003 elections and the referendum with hopes for a settlement .
" but their expectations were in vain and now they have next to no excitement for the upcoming elections , " said 39-year-old engineer levent ozverel . denktash to go settlement of the cyprus conflict has become even more important for the european union with turkey readying to begin accession talks with the bloc on oct 3 .
but observers say any fresh initiative to draw the island 's communities back to the negotiating table would have to wait until after the april presidential election , when veteran trnc leader rauf denktash is set to stand down . outgoing prime minister mehmet ali talat 's center-left republican turkish party -lrb- ctp -rrb- looks set to garner 35.9 percent of the vote , according to a recent poll conducted by the kadem research center and published in the kibris newspaper .
that would give the ctp 20 of parliament 's 50 seats , well short of an outright majority and forcing it to craft yet another coalition . in december 2003 , bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish cypriot supporters of the cyprus reunification plan celebrate in the turkish part of nicosia , cyprus , saturday night , april 24 , 2004 after the results .
referendum results show that 64.91 percent of turkish cypriots voted in favor of the u.n. reunification plan , and 76 percent of the greek cypriots rejected it. the pro-settlement talat won 35.2 percent of the vote and formed a fragile coalition with the small center-right democrat party -lrb- dp -rrb- .
but he was forced to resign last october after his government lost its parliamentary majority shortly after the referendum on the un plan . " the turkish cypriots are not separatists .
they want unification on the island , " talat told dw-radio . the same kadem poll predicted that talat 's main rival , the nationalist national unity party -lrb- ubp -rrb- would win 32 percent of the vote and retain its 18 seats in parliament .
the dp is also likely to keep its seven seats , while the peace and democracy movement - close to talat - may lose one of its current six seats , according to the survey .
the three other parties running in the elections would fail to pass the five-percent parliamentary threshold , the poll showed . cyprus has been divided along ethnic lines since 1974 when turkey occupied its northern third in response to an athens-engineered coup aimed at uniting the island with greece .
turkey , which still keeps some 30,000 troops in the north of the island , is the only state to recognize the trnc , which was founded in 1983 . dw staff / afp -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de breakthrough at eu-turkey talks turkey and the eu 's presidency struck an agreement friday to end an impasse blocking the launch of eu membership talks with ankara , a turkish diplomat said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 20.02.2005 turkish cypriots face fractured vote großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the vote spell an end to political uncertainty ?
turkish cypriots will sunday elect a government for their breakaway state , but the political deadlock gripping their community amid failures to reunite the island is unlikely to cease before presidential polls in april . the self-proclaimed turkish republic of northern cyprus -lrb- trnc -rrb- was forced to call early elections after the ruling coalition lost its slim majority in may and subsequent efforts to stitch together a stable government failed . but opinion polls predict sunday 's elections will produce as fragmented a political picture as at the last general elections in december 2003 , fanning concerns of continuing uncertainty in the isolated statelet .
with no immediate hope of a breakthrough on the political scene , campaigning has been lackluster and excitement among the electorate marginal in the build-up to the polls . " i do not think much will change and i do not understand why we are holding elections when there will be no change , " aydin hikmet , a 64-year-old musician from the turkish sector of europe 's last divided capital , said .
" it is a waste of money . " political stability in the trnc is crucial for any revival of peace efforts to reunify cyprus , which have stalled since a un blueprint was voted down by greek cypriots despite overwhelming backing by the turkish cypriots last april .
the outcome of the referendum ensured that only the internationally recognized greek cypriot side enjoys the benefits of eu membership since the island joined the bloc on may 1 , leaving brussels with a diplomatic hot potato . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a turkish cypriot man sits in front of the flags of turkey , left , and breakaway turkish cypriot state , with an election poster of the national unity party in the center , in the turkish part of nicosia , northern cyprus , saturday , dec .
13 , 2003 .
" turkish cypriots eagerly cast votes both in the 2003 elections and the referendum with hopes for a settlement .
" but their expectations were in vain and now they have next to no excitement for the upcoming elections , " said 39-year-old engineer levent ozverel . denktash to go settlement of the cyprus conflict has become even more important for the european union with turkey readying to begin accession talks with the bloc on oct 3 .
but observers say any fresh initiative to draw the island 's communities back to the negotiating table would have to wait until after the april presidential election , when veteran trnc leader rauf denktash is set to stand down . outgoing prime minister mehmet ali talat 's center-left republican turkish party -lrb- ctp -rrb- looks set to garner 35.9 percent of the vote , according to a recent poll conducted by the kadem research center and published in the kibris newspaper .
that would give the ctp 20 of parliament 's 50 seats , well short of an outright majority and forcing it to craft yet another coalition . in december 2003 , bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish cypriot supporters of the cyprus reunification plan celebrate in the turkish part of nicosia , cyprus , saturday night , april 24 , 2004 after the results .
referendum results show that 64.91 percent of turkish cypriots voted in favor of the u.n. reunification plan , and 76 percent of the greek cypriots rejected it. the pro-settlement talat won 35.2 percent of the vote and formed a fragile coalition with the small center-right democrat party -lrb- dp -rrb- .
but he was forced to resign last october after his government lost its parliamentary majority shortly after the referendum on the un plan . " the turkish cypriots are not separatists .
they want unification on the island , " talat told dw-radio . the same kadem poll predicted that talat 's main rival , the nationalist national unity party -lrb- ubp -rrb- would win 32 percent of the vote and retain its 18 seats in parliament .
the dp is also likely to keep its seven seats , while the peace and democracy movement - close to talat - may lose one of its current six seats , according to the survey .
the three other parties running in the elections would fail to pass the five-percent parliamentary threshold , the poll showed . cyprus has been divided along ethnic lines since 1974 when turkey occupied its northern third in response to an athens-engineered coup aimed at uniting the island with greece .
turkey , which still keeps some 30,000 troops in the north of the island , is the only state to recognize the trnc , which was founded in 1983 . dw staff / afp -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de breakthrough at eu-turkey talks turkey and the eu 's presidency struck an agreement friday to end an impasse blocking the launch of eu membership talks with ankara , a turkish diplomat said .

on sunday , spain becomes the first country to put the matter directly to the people .
here 's a look at the remaining hurdles for the constitution . amid fears of an embarrassingly low turnout spaniards began voting sunday in a referendum on the proposed eu constitution which most of the 35-million electorate profess to back .
" today we are taking a decision of great importance for the future of a united europe , and also for spain , for its future and its well-being , " spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero said as he cast his vote sunday . spain is the first of 10 eu member states holding a popular vote on the text which is designed to streamline decision-making in the 25-member bloc which last year took in 10 new , mainly eastern european , members .
opinion polls have consistently shown the " yes " camp well ahead of those opposed , with some 45 percent of voters asked saying they back the constitution to only seven or eight percent defiantly against .
the spaniards have kicked off a long ratification process . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the eu summit in brussels last june , the uk independence party poster placed a poster in brussels asking the united kingdom 's prime minister , tony blair , not to sign the european constitution so far , lithuania , hungary and slovenia have already given the constitution the green light via their parliaments , but spain 's referendum is the first of 10 polls .
with voters from euroskeptical countries like denmark , britain , ireland and france still in line , the eu constitution 's fathers and mothers will be waiting uneasily in the months to come .
only one country needs to reject the document for it to fail .
spain 's approval looks certain but is by no means guaranteed .
the latest survey showed 51.2 percent of spaniards in favor but the poll had a margin of error of 2 percent , so everything is still open in the country on the iberian peninsula .

but he has some work ahead to convince his countrymen and women who could go to the polls in june .
an early february poll by the ifop polling company put the proponents ahead of the opponents 25 to 20 percent with a large 46 percent undecided .

the political leaders in both the government and the opposition do n't want to see that happen in this vote and are asking their supporters to vote " yes . "

finally , the outcome of the referendum in poland is unclear because of a lack of interest .
in order to ensure the 50 percent voter participation required to make a referendum valid , the government will combine it with national elections .
not all eu citizens get to vote on their constitution the eu 's most populous country , germany , is not putting the matter to the people .

on sunday , spain becomes the first country to put the matter directly to the people .
here 's a look at the remaining hurdles for the constitution . amid fears of an embarrassingly low turnout spaniards began voting sunday in a referendum on the proposed eu constitution which most of the 35-million electorate profess to back .
" today we are taking a decision of great importance for the future of a united europe , and also for spain , for its future and its well-being , " spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero said as he cast his vote sunday . spain is the first of 10 eu member states holding a popular vote on the text which is designed to streamline decision-making in the 25-member bloc which last year took in 10 new , mainly eastern european , members .
opinion polls have consistently shown the " yes " camp well ahead of those opposed , with some 45 percent of voters asked saying they back the constitution to only seven or eight percent defiantly against .
the spaniards have kicked off a long ratification process . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the eu summit in brussels last june , the uk independence party poster placed a poster in brussels asking the united kingdom 's prime minister , tony blair , not to sign the european constitution so far , lithuania , hungary and slovenia have already given the constitution the green light via their parliaments , but spain 's referendum is the first of 10 polls .
with voters from euroskeptical countries like denmark , britain , ireland and france still in line , the eu constitution 's fathers and mothers will be waiting uneasily in the months to come .
only one country needs to reject the document for it to fail .
spain 's approval looks certain but is by no means guaranteed .
the latest survey showed 51.2 percent of spaniards in favor but the poll had a margin of error of 2 percent , so everything is still open in the country on the iberian peninsula .
french go to polls in the summer french president jacques chirac is an advocate of the eu constitution .
but he has some work ahead to convince his countrymen and women who could go to the polls in june .
an early february poll by the ifop polling company put the proponents ahead of the opponents 25 to 20 percent with a large 46 percent undecided .

the political leaders in both the government and the opposition do n't want to see that happen in this vote and are asking their supporters to vote " yes . "

finally , the outcome of the referendum in poland is unclear because of a lack of interest .
in order to ensure the 50 percent voter participation required to make a referendum valid , the government will combine it with national elections .

on sunday , spain becomes the first country to put the matter directly to the people .
here 's a look at the remaining hurdles for the constitution . amid fears of an embarrassingly low turnout spaniards began voting sunday in a referendum on the proposed eu constitution which most of the 35-million electorate profess to back .
" today we are taking a decision of great importance for the future of a united europe , and also for spain , for its future and its well-being , " spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero said as he cast his vote sunday . spain is the first of 10 eu member states holding a popular vote on the text which is designed to streamline decision-making in the 25-member bloc which last year took in 10 new , mainly eastern european , members .
opinion polls have consistently shown the " yes " camp well ahead of those opposed , with some 45 percent of voters asked saying they back the constitution to only seven or eight percent defiantly against .
the spaniards have kicked off a long ratification process . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the eu summit in brussels last june , the uk independence party poster placed a poster in brussels asking the united kingdom 's prime minister , tony blair , not to sign the european constitution so far , lithuania , hungary and slovenia have already given the constitution the green light via their parliaments , but spain 's referendum is the first of 10 polls .
with voters from euroskeptical countries like denmark , britain , ireland and france still in line , the eu constitution 's fathers and mothers will be waiting uneasily in the months to come .
only one country needs to reject the document for it to fail .
spain 's approval looks certain but is by no means guaranteed .
the latest survey showed 51.2 percent of spaniards in favor but the poll had a margin of error of 2 percent , so everything is still open in the country on the iberian peninsula .
french go to polls in the summer french president jacques chirac is an advocate of the eu constitution .
but he has some work ahead to convince his countrymen and women who could go to the polls in june .
an early february poll by the ifop polling company put the proponents ahead of the opponents 25 to 20 percent with a large 46 percent undecided .

the political leaders in both the government and the opposition do n't want to see that happen in this vote and are asking their supporters to vote " yes . "
the irish , another nay-sayer to an eu treaty , are leaning towards approval .
finally , the outcome of the referendum in poland is unclear because of a lack of interest .
in order to ensure the 50 percent voter participation required to make a referendum valid , the government will combine it with national elections .
not all eu citizens get to vote on their constitution the eu 's most populous country , germany , is not putting the matter to the people .
both houses of parliament must ratify the treaty with a two-thirds majority .
this friday , the upper house , the bundesrat , began the ratification debate .
in less than one week , the lower house , the bundestag will have the topic on the agenda .
the country 's two largest parties , the ruling social democrats and the conservative christian democrats , both favor the constitution .

if one bad apple spoils the bunch and a country rejects the constitution , the document would have to be reworked .
or the country would have to renegotiate its status with the eu .
if all countries approve the document , it will become binding in 2007 , introducing new eu posts such as an eu foreign minister and an eu president , who would sit at the head of the board of european leaders . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de putting the constitution to the test this friday in spain , the eu constitution faces the first of ten national referendums .

here 's a look at the remaining hurdles for the constitution . amid fears of an embarrassingly low turnout spaniards began voting sunday in a referendum on the proposed eu constitution which most of the 35-million electorate profess to back .
" today we are taking a decision of great importance for the future of a united europe , and also for spain , for its future and its well-being , " spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero said as he cast his vote sunday . spain is the first of 10 eu member states holding a popular vote on the text which is designed to streamline decision-making in the 25-member bloc which last year took in 10 new , mainly eastern european , members .
opinion polls have consistently shown the " yes " camp well ahead of those opposed , with some 45 percent of voters asked saying they back the constitution to only seven or eight percent defiantly against .
the spaniards have kicked off a long ratification process . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the eu summit in brussels last june , the uk independence party poster placed a poster in brussels asking the united kingdom 's prime minister , tony blair , not to sign the european constitution so far , lithuania , hungary and slovenia have already given the constitution the green light via their parliaments , but spain 's referendum is the first of 10 polls .
with voters from euroskeptical countries like denmark , britain , ireland and france still in line , the eu constitution 's fathers and mothers will be waiting uneasily in the months to come .
only one country needs to reject the document for it to fail .
spain 's approval looks certain but is by no means guaranteed .
the latest survey showed 51.2 percent of spaniards in favor but the poll had a margin of error of 2 percent , so everything is still open in the country on the iberian peninsula .

now , the european commission is using a new program called pro-invest to try and get private industry aboard the development train .
just last week , the president of tanzania was in berlin , trying to convince german businesses to set up shop in his country .
tanzania has a lot to offer : natural resources , cheap labor , and a bureaucracy that is easy to navigate - or so the pitch went . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the odidi delta is the economic lifeblood of nigeria , but despite its natural wealth , it remains mired in poverty but subsidiaries of european firms in developing countries often go under due to problems in basic infrastructure : water failures , electricity blackouts , crumbling streets and a lack of railways to transport goods - things that are usually provided by the government . seeking partners but eckhard hinzen , the representative of the eu program pro-invest , sees a different way out of this catch-22 situation . " we want to institute a change , and we are inviting private companies to be our partners , " he said .
" it is new , in that until now private firms have mostly kept to the role of delivering goods and services .
now , we want them to be our -lrb- development -rrb- partners . " to help his cause , hinzen has a lot of money to distribute : € 110 million -lrb- $ 144 million -rrb- of european development funds are available to support partnership programs between europe and some 70 developing countries in africa , the caribbean and the pacific . his simple message to the companies : developing african nations are a huge , untapped market .
better supplies of electricity , gas and water , more streets , etc , mean more growth .
in many countries , these areas are currently being privatized .
and on top of that , there is financing available for companies that want to take part . shaaban said kayungilo , an economics student from tanzania , agreed with hinzen . " we come from a system where the government had a monopoly on the economy , and that led to many problems , " he said .
" now we need to look to the private sector to develop our country . " combining private and public more investment by private firms would lead to a new way of thinking in the wealthier nations , hinzen added . " there should n't be a strict separation of financing for public investment and for the private sector , " he said .
" we want to combine these things , use public monies to create a sensible leverage for the private sector . " those are already active in these developing countries also said they agree with the plan . peter teschemacher , who works with the german construction firm bauer spezialtiefbau , has invested in africa for the last 10 years . " this kind of support would be really helpful , " he said .

" it is new , in that until now private firms have mostly kept to the role of delivering goods and services .

" to help his cause , hinzen has a lot of money to distribute : € 110 million -lrb- $ 144 million -rrb- of european development funds are available to support partnership programs between europe and some 70 developing countries in africa , the caribbean and the pacific . his simple message to the companies : developing african nations are a huge , untapped market .
better supplies of electricity , gas and water , more streets , etc , mean more growth .
in many countries , these areas are currently being privatized .
and on top of that , there is financing available for companies that want to take part . shaaban said kayungilo , an economics student from tanzania , agreed with hinzen . " we come from a system where the government had a monopoly on the economy , and that led to many problems , " he said .
" now we need to look to the private sector to develop our country . " combining private and public more investment by private firms would lead to a new way of thinking in the wealthier nations , hinzen added . " there should n't be a strict separation of financing for public investment and for the private sector , " he said .
" we want to combine these things , use public monies to create a sensible leverage for the private sector . " those are already active in these developing countries also said they agree with the plan . peter teschemacher , who works with the german construction firm bauer spezialtiefbau , has invested in africa for the last 10 years .

" now we need to look to the private sector to develop our country . " combining private and public more investment by private firms would lead to a new way of thinking in the wealthier nations , hinzen added . " there should n't be a strict separation of financing for public investment and for the private sector , " he said .

the result is a blow for the struggling party which suffered a string of similar defeats last year . germany 's opposition conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- declared it had the won the election in the northern state of schleswig holstein on sunday after exit polls by german public broadcasters ard and zdf showed the party taking a solid 40.2 percent of the vote . the victory will provide a boost for the cdu ahead of another crucial state poll in the state of north rhine-westphalia on may 22 and should ease pressure on embattled cdu leader angela merkel . " red-green has been voted out .
they do n't have a majority of their own , " merkel said .

the spd had ruled the state for 17 years .
" we did not achieve our primary goal in schleswig-holstein of a red-green majority , " spd national party leader franz müntefering said after the vote . the result , though yet to be officially confirmed until all the votes are counted , is a severe setback for the chancellor whose party has only recently started to recover in the polls after losing a series of state elections last year . setback for spd bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder schröder himself enjoys wide popularity amongst germans .
he has enjoyed a remarkable comeback since the summer , standing firm in the face of mass protests against his tough welfare reforms and profiting from bitter divisions in the conservative opposition ranks .
however , his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- is slumping nationwide . traditional social democratic strongholds such as hamburg or saarland are now firmly in the hands of the opposition conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .

personal opinion polls prior to the election consistently placed her ahead of carstensen .
however , she has been criticized for hardly mentioning unemployment on the campaign trail , despite the fact that schleswig-holstein suffers the worst jobless rate in western germany . on sunday , simonis said she was disappointed by the result , but insisted that the spd had led a good and committed political campaign and had tackled the right issues . far-right party not in the extreme-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- meanwhile will fail to gain a seat in the state parliament after only scoring around two percent of the votes , the exit polls showed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a demonstration of neo-nazis last september , the npd won seats in a regional parliament for the first time since 1968 when it surged to 9.2 percent in the eastern state of saxony . the party caused controversy in the saxony parliament last month when its representatives refused to take part in a minute 's silence for the victims of auschwitz . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cdu battles image problem germany 's conservatives are fighting an image problem with state elections looming .

turkish cypriots will sunday elect a government for their breakaway state , but the political deadlock gripping their community amid failures to reunite the island is unlikely to cease before presidential polls in april . the self-proclaimed turkish republic of northern cyprus -lrb- trnc -rrb- was forced to call early elections after the ruling coalition lost its slim majority in may and subsequent efforts to stitch together a stable government failed . but opinion polls predict sunday 's elections will produce as fragmented a political picture as at the last general elections in december 2003 , fanning concerns of continuing uncertainty in the isolated statelet .
with no immediate hope of a breakthrough on the political scene , campaigning has been lackluster and excitement among the electorate marginal in the build-up to the polls . " i do not think much will change and i do not understand why we are holding elections when there will be no change , " aydin hikmet , a 64-year-old musician from the turkish sector of europe 's last divided capital , said .
" it is a waste of money . " political stability in the trnc is crucial for any revival of peace efforts to reunify cyprus , which have stalled since a un blueprint was voted down by greek cypriots despite overwhelming backing by the turkish cypriots last april .
the outcome of the referendum ensured that only the internationally recognized greek cypriot side enjoys the benefits of eu membership since the island joined the bloc on may 1 , leaving brussels with a diplomatic hot potato . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a turkish cypriot man sits in front of the flags of turkey , left , and breakaway turkish cypriot state , with an election poster of the national unity party in the center , in the turkish part of nicosia , northern cyprus , saturday , dec .

" turkish cypriots eagerly cast votes both in the 2003 elections and the referendum with hopes for a settlement .

but observers say any fresh initiative to draw the island 's communities back to the negotiating table would have to wait until after the april presidential election , when veteran trnc leader rauf denktash is set to stand down . outgoing prime minister mehmet ali talat 's center-left republican turkish party -lrb- ctp -rrb- looks set to garner 35.9 percent of the vote , according to a recent poll conducted by the kadem research center and published in the kibris newspaper .

referendum results show that 64.91 percent of turkish cypriots voted in favor of the u.n. reunification plan , and 76 percent of the greek cypriots rejected it. the pro-settlement talat won 35.2 percent of the vote and formed a fragile coalition with the small center-right democrat party -lrb- dp -rrb- .
but he was forced to resign last october after his government lost its parliamentary majority shortly after the referendum on the un plan . " the turkish cypriots are not separatists .
they want unification on the island , " talat told dw-radio . the same kadem poll predicted that talat 's main rival , the nationalist national unity party -lrb- ubp -rrb- would win 32 percent of the vote and retain its 18 seats in parliament .
the dp is also likely to keep its seven seats , while the peace and democracy movement - close to talat - may lose one of its current six seats , according to the survey .
the three other parties running in the elections would fail to pass the five-percent parliamentary threshold , the poll showed . cyprus has been divided along ethnic lines since 1974 when turkey occupied its northern third in response to an athens-engineered coup aimed at uniting the island with greece .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 20.02.2005 can euro firms do well by doing good ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : africa has cheap labor , natural resources - and huge problems the european union wants german industry to get into a new line of business : development aid . despite millions of dollars in development aid , africa is still economically far behind the international standard .
now , the european commission is using a new program called pro-invest to try and get private industry aboard the development train .
just last week , the president of tanzania was in berlin , trying to convince german businesses to set up shop in his country .
tanzania has a lot to offer : natural resources , cheap labor , and a bureaucracy that is easy to navigate - or so the pitch went . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the odidi delta is the economic lifeblood of nigeria , but despite its natural wealth , it remains mired in poverty but subsidiaries of european firms in developing countries often go under due to problems in basic infrastructure : water failures , electricity blackouts , crumbling streets and a lack of railways to transport goods - things that are usually provided by the government . seeking partners but eckhard hinzen , the representative of the eu program pro-invest , sees a different way out of this catch-22 situation . " we want to institute a change , and we are inviting private companies to be our partners , " he said .
" it is new , in that until now private firms have mostly kept to the role of delivering goods and services .
now , we want them to be our -lrb- development -rrb- partners . " to help his cause , hinzen has a lot of money to distribute : € 110 million -lrb- $ 144 million -rrb- of european development funds are available to support partnership programs between europe and some 70 developing countries in africa , the caribbean and the pacific . his simple message to the companies : developing african nations are a huge , untapped market .
better supplies of electricity , gas and water , more streets , etc , mean more growth .
in many countries , these areas are currently being privatized .
and on top of that , there is financing available for companies that want to take part . shaaban said kayungilo , an economics student from tanzania , agreed with hinzen . " we come from a system where the government had a monopoly on the economy , and that led to many problems , " he said .
" now we need to look to the private sector to develop our country . " combining private and public more investment by private firms would lead to a new way of thinking in the wealthier nations , hinzen added . " there should n't be a strict separation of financing for public investment and for the private sector , " he said .
" we want to combine these things , use public monies to create a sensible leverage for the private sector . " those are already active in these developing countries also said they agree with the plan . peter teschemacher , who works with the german construction firm bauer spezialtiefbau , has invested in africa for the last 10 years .

the european commission is examining german visas issued to eastern europeans , which are at the heart of a political scandal in the country , to determine whether they violated european law . a spokesman for the eu 's justice commissioner franco frattini confirmed sunday that the eu was looking into the matter .
" the commission has launched an investigation to find out if germany 's actions concerning the visas were in breach of european law , " said spokesman friso roscam abbing , in an interview to the german mass-selling daily bild . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the visa scandal involves joschka fischer , germany 's foreign minister and most popular politician , and the decision by his ministry in 1999 to ease conditions for citizens of the former soviet bloc to acquire german visas . germany 's conservative opposition has charged that " hundreds of thousands " of illegal immigrants from eastern europe - ukraine in particular - were able to enter the country on tourist visas between 2000 and 2003 , many of them with the help of organized crime networks .
the incoming numbers apparently included hundreds of illegal immigrants , prostitutes and human traffickers . the german parliament has started an investigation into the alleged mass smuggling of eastern europeans into germany . the inquiry by the commission in brussels , the european union 's executive arm , will verify whether german directives were in accordance with eu regulations .
in 1990 , the schengen accord established a european zone for the free movement of people and required member countries to maintain control of their borders at the zone 's common exterior . flood of visa-holders in march 2000 , the so-called volmer directive , named after germany 's former secretary of state ludger volmer , encouraged embassies to cut through the red tape for visas following complaints to the ministry that it was too strict in dispensing visas in decisions concerning family reunions and sickness . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people wait at the german embassy in the ukrainian capital of kiew to apply for a visa .
volmer then reportedly issued a decree that , when in doubt , embassy workers should decide in favor of issuing a visa to an applicant . the consequence of this directive was a drastic increase in the number of visas authorized by german embassies around the world .
a flood of applicants followed .
in 2001 , the number of visas approved by the embassy in kiev , ukraine alone reached 400,000 .
it was a large number , considering the 190 german embassies worldwide issue only 3 million visas each year on average . the directive was cancelled in march 2003 . afp / dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de when will fischer take the hot seat ?

turkish cypriots will sunday elect a government for their breakaway state , but the political deadlock gripping their community amid failures to reunite the island is unlikely to cease before presidential polls in april . the self-proclaimed turkish republic of northern cyprus -lrb- trnc -rrb- was forced to call early elections after the ruling coalition lost its slim majority in may and subsequent efforts to stitch together a stable government failed . but opinion polls predict sunday 's elections will produce as fragmented a political picture as at the last general elections in december 2003 , fanning concerns of continuing uncertainty in the isolated statelet .
with no immediate hope of a breakthrough on the political scene , campaigning has been lackluster and excitement among the electorate marginal in the build-up to the polls . " i do not think much will change and i do not understand why we are holding elections when there will be no change , " aydin hikmet , a 64-year-old musician from the turkish sector of europe 's last divided capital , said .
" it is a waste of money . " political stability in the trnc is crucial for any revival of peace efforts to reunify cyprus , which have stalled since a un blueprint was voted down by greek cypriots despite overwhelming backing by the turkish cypriots last april .
the outcome of the referendum ensured that only the internationally recognized greek cypriot side enjoys the benefits of eu membership since the island joined the bloc on may 1 , leaving brussels with a diplomatic hot potato . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a turkish cypriot man sits in front of the flags of turkey , left , and breakaway turkish cypriot state , with an election poster of the national unity party in the center , in the turkish part of nicosia , northern cyprus , saturday , dec .
13 , 2003 .
" turkish cypriots eagerly cast votes both in the 2003 elections and the referendum with hopes for a settlement .
" but their expectations were in vain and now they have next to no excitement for the upcoming elections , " said 39-year-old engineer levent ozverel . denktash to go settlement of the cyprus conflict has become even more important for the european union with turkey readying to begin accession talks with the bloc on oct 3 .
but observers say any fresh initiative to draw the island 's communities back to the negotiating table would have to wait until after the april presidential election , when veteran trnc leader rauf denktash is set to stand down . outgoing prime minister mehmet ali talat 's center-left republican turkish party -lrb- ctp -rrb- looks set to garner 35.9 percent of the vote , according to a recent poll conducted by the kadem research center and published in the kibris newspaper .
that would give the ctp 20 of parliament 's 50 seats , well short of an outright majority and forcing it to craft yet another coalition . in december 2003 , bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish cypriot supporters of the cyprus reunification plan celebrate in the turkish part of nicosia , cyprus , saturday night , april 24 , 2004 after the results .
referendum results show that 64.91 percent of turkish cypriots voted in favor of the u.n. reunification plan , and 76 percent of the greek cypriots rejected it. the pro-settlement talat won 35.2 percent of the vote and formed a fragile coalition with the small center-right democrat party -lrb- dp -rrb- .
but he was forced to resign last october after his government lost its parliamentary majority shortly after the referendum on the un plan . " the turkish cypriots are not separatists .
they want unification on the island , " talat told dw-radio . the same kadem poll predicted that talat 's main rival , the nationalist national unity party -lrb- ubp -rrb- would win 32 percent of the vote and retain its 18 seats in parliament .
the dp is also likely to keep its seven seats , while the peace and democracy movement - close to talat - may lose one of its current six seats , according to the survey .
the three other parties running in the elections would fail to pass the five-percent parliamentary threshold , the poll showed . cyprus has been divided along ethnic lines since 1974 when turkey occupied its northern third in response to an athens-engineered coup aimed at uniting the island with greece .
turkey , which still keeps some 30,000 troops in the north of the island , is the only state to recognize the trnc , which was founded in 1983 . dw staff / afp -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de breakthrough at eu-turkey talks turkey and the eu 's presidency struck an agreement friday to end an impasse blocking the launch of eu membership talks with ankara , a turkish diplomat said .

the european commission is examining german visas issued to eastern europeans , which are at the heart of a political scandal in the country , to determine whether they violated european law . a spokesman for the eu 's justice commissioner franco frattini confirmed sunday that the eu was looking into the matter .
" the commission has launched an investigation to find out if germany 's actions concerning the visas were in breach of european law , " said spokesman friso roscam abbing , in an interview to the german mass-selling daily bild . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the visa scandal involves joschka fischer , germany 's foreign minister and most popular politician , and the decision by his ministry in 1999 to ease conditions for citizens of the former soviet bloc to acquire german visas . germany 's conservative opposition has charged that " hundreds of thousands " of illegal immigrants from eastern europe - ukraine in particular - were able to enter the country on tourist visas between 2000 and 2003 , many of them with the help of organized crime networks .
the incoming numbers apparently included hundreds of illegal immigrants , prostitutes and human traffickers . the german parliament has started an investigation into the alleged mass smuggling of eastern europeans into germany . the inquiry by the commission in brussels , the european union 's executive arm , will verify whether german directives were in accordance with eu regulations .
in 1990 , the schengen accord established a european zone for the free movement of people and required member countries to maintain control of their borders at the zone 's common exterior . flood of visa-holders in march 2000 , the so-called volmer directive , named after germany 's former secretary of state ludger volmer , encouraged embassies to cut through the red tape for visas following complaints to the ministry that it was too strict in dispensing visas in decisions concerning family reunions and sickness . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people wait at the german embassy in the ukrainian capital of kiew to apply for a visa .
volmer then reportedly issued a decree that , when in doubt , embassy workers should decide in favor of issuing a visa to an applicant . the consequence of this directive was a drastic increase in the number of visas authorized by german embassies around the world .
a flood of applicants followed .
in 2001 , the number of visas approved by the embassy in kiev , ukraine alone reached 400,000 .
it was a large number , considering the 190 german embassies worldwide issue only 3 million visas each year on average . the directive was cancelled in march 2003 . afp / dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de when will fischer take the hot seat ?

on sunday , spain becomes the first country to put the matter directly to the people .
here 's a look at the remaining hurdles for the constitution . amid fears of an embarrassingly low turnout spaniards began voting sunday in a referendum on the proposed eu constitution which most of the 35-million electorate profess to back .
" today we are taking a decision of great importance for the future of a united europe , and also for spain , for its future and its well-being , " spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero said as he cast his vote sunday . spain is the first of 10 eu member states holding a popular vote on the text which is designed to streamline decision-making in the 25-member bloc which last year took in 10 new , mainly eastern european , members .
opinion polls have consistently shown the " yes " camp well ahead of those opposed , with some 45 percent of voters asked saying they back the constitution to only seven or eight percent defiantly against .
the spaniards have kicked off a long ratification process . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the eu summit in brussels last june , the uk independence party poster placed a poster in brussels asking the united kingdom 's prime minister , tony blair , not to sign the european constitution so far , lithuania , hungary and slovenia have already given the constitution the green light via their parliaments , but spain 's referendum is the first of 10 polls .
with voters from euroskeptical countries like denmark , britain , ireland and france still in line , the eu constitution 's fathers and mothers will be waiting uneasily in the months to come .
only one country needs to reject the document for it to fail .
spain 's approval looks certain but is by no means guaranteed .
the latest survey showed 51.2 percent of spaniards in favor but the poll had a margin of error of 2 percent , so everything is still open in the country on the iberian peninsula .
french go to polls in the summer french president jacques chirac is an advocate of the eu constitution .
but he has some work ahead to convince his countrymen and women who could go to the polls in june .
an early february poll by the ifop polling company put the proponents ahead of the opponents 25 to 20 percent with a large 46 percent undecided .
in 1992 , the french made the eu nervous when they narrowly approved the treaty of maastricht , which among other things created the foundation for the eu 's common currency , the euro .

the danes have already rejected two eu treaties in 1992 and 2000 .
the political leaders in both the government and the opposition do n't want to see that happen in this vote and are asking their supporters to vote " yes . "
the irish , another nay-sayer to an eu treaty , are leaning towards approval .
finally , the outcome of the referendum in poland is unclear because of a lack of interest .
in order to ensure the 50 percent voter participation required to make a referendum valid , the government will combine it with national elections .
not all eu citizens get to vote on their constitution the eu 's most populous country , germany , is not putting the matter to the people .
both houses of parliament must ratify the treaty with a two-thirds majority .
this friday , the upper house , the bundesrat , began the ratification debate .
in less than one week , the lower house , the bundestag will have the topic on the agenda .

now , the european commission is using a new program called pro-invest to try and get private industry aboard the development train .
just last week , the president of tanzania was in berlin , trying to convince german businesses to set up shop in his country .

" we want to institute a change , and we are inviting private companies to be our partners , " he said .
" it is new , in that until now private firms have mostly kept to the role of delivering goods and services .
now , we want them to be our -lrb- development -rrb- partners . " to help his cause , hinzen has a lot of money to distribute : € 110 million -lrb- $ 144 million -rrb- of european development funds are available to support partnership programs between europe and some 70 developing countries in africa , the caribbean and the pacific . his simple message to the companies : developing african nations are a huge , untapped market .
better supplies of electricity , gas and water , more streets , etc , mean more growth .
in many countries , these areas are currently being privatized .
and on top of that , there is financing available for companies that want to take part . shaaban said kayungilo , an economics student from tanzania , agreed with hinzen . " we come from a system where the government had a monopoly on the economy , and that led to many problems , " he said .
" now we need to look to the private sector to develop our country . " combining private and public more investment by private firms would lead to a new way of thinking in the wealthier nations , hinzen added . " there should n't be a strict separation of financing for public investment and for the private sector , " he said .
" we want to combine these things , use public monies to create a sensible leverage for the private sector . " those are already active in these developing countries also said they agree with the plan . peter teschemacher , who works with the german construction firm bauer spezialtiefbau , has invested in africa for the last 10 years .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 20.02.2005 turkish cypriots face fractured vote großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the vote spell an end to political uncertainty ?
turkish cypriots will sunday elect a government for their breakaway state , but the political deadlock gripping their community amid failures to reunite the island is unlikely to cease before presidential polls in april . the self-proclaimed turkish republic of northern cyprus -lrb- trnc -rrb- was forced to call early elections after the ruling coalition lost its slim majority in may and subsequent efforts to stitch together a stable government failed . but opinion polls predict sunday 's elections will produce as fragmented a political picture as at the last general elections in december 2003 , fanning concerns of continuing uncertainty in the isolated statelet .
with no immediate hope of a breakthrough on the political scene , campaigning has been lackluster and excitement among the electorate marginal in the build-up to the polls . " i do not think much will change and i do not understand why we are holding elections when there will be no change , " aydin hikmet , a 64-year-old musician from the turkish sector of europe 's last divided capital , said .
" it is a waste of money . " political stability in the trnc is crucial for any revival of peace efforts to reunify cyprus , which have stalled since a un blueprint was voted down by greek cypriots despite overwhelming backing by the turkish cypriots last april .
the outcome of the referendum ensured that only the internationally recognized greek cypriot side enjoys the benefits of eu membership since the island joined the bloc on may 1 , leaving brussels with a diplomatic hot potato . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a turkish cypriot man sits in front of the flags of turkey , left , and breakaway turkish cypriot state , with an election poster of the national unity party in the center , in the turkish part of nicosia , northern cyprus , saturday , dec .
13 , 2003 .
" turkish cypriots eagerly cast votes both in the 2003 elections and the referendum with hopes for a settlement .
" but their expectations were in vain and now they have next to no excitement for the upcoming elections , " said 39-year-old engineer levent ozverel . denktash to go settlement of the cyprus conflict has become even more important for the european union with turkey readying to begin accession talks with the bloc on oct 3 .
but observers say any fresh initiative to draw the island 's communities back to the negotiating table would have to wait until after the april presidential election , when veteran trnc leader rauf denktash is set to stand down . outgoing prime minister mehmet ali talat 's center-left republican turkish party -lrb- ctp -rrb- looks set to garner 35.9 percent of the vote , according to a recent poll conducted by the kadem research center and published in the kibris newspaper .
that would give the ctp 20 of parliament 's 50 seats , well short of an outright majority and forcing it to craft yet another coalition . in december 2003 , bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish cypriot supporters of the cyprus reunification plan celebrate in the turkish part of nicosia , cyprus , saturday night , april 24 , 2004 after the results .
referendum results show that 64.91 percent of turkish cypriots voted in favor of the u.n. reunification plan , and 76 percent of the greek cypriots rejected it. the pro-settlement talat won 35.2 percent of the vote and formed a fragile coalition with the small center-right democrat party -lrb- dp -rrb- .
but he was forced to resign last october after his government lost its parliamentary majority shortly after the referendum on the un plan . " the turkish cypriots are not separatists .
they want unification on the island , " talat told dw-radio . the same kadem poll predicted that talat 's main rival , the nationalist national unity party -lrb- ubp -rrb- would win 32 percent of the vote and retain its 18 seats in parliament .

turkish cypriots will sunday elect a government for their breakaway state , but the political deadlock gripping their community amid failures to reunite the island is unlikely to cease before presidential polls in april . the self-proclaimed turkish republic of northern cyprus -lrb- trnc -rrb- was forced to call early elections after the ruling coalition lost its slim majority in may and subsequent efforts to stitch together a stable government failed . but opinion polls predict sunday 's elections will produce as fragmented a political picture as at the last general elections in december 2003 , fanning concerns of continuing uncertainty in the isolated statelet .
with no immediate hope of a breakthrough on the political scene , campaigning has been lackluster and excitement among the electorate marginal in the build-up to the polls . " i do not think much will change and i do not understand why we are holding elections when there will be no change , " aydin hikmet , a 64-year-old musician from the turkish sector of europe 's last divided capital , said .
" it is a waste of money . " political stability in the trnc is crucial for any revival of peace efforts to reunify cyprus , which have stalled since a un blueprint was voted down by greek cypriots despite overwhelming backing by the turkish cypriots last april .

but observers say any fresh initiative to draw the island 's communities back to the negotiating table would have to wait until after the april presidential election , when veteran trnc leader rauf denktash is set to stand down . outgoing prime minister mehmet ali talat 's center-left republican turkish party -lrb- ctp -rrb- looks set to garner 35.9 percent of the vote , according to a recent poll conducted by the kadem research center and published in the kibris newspaper .

referendum results show that 64.91 percent of turkish cypriots voted in favor of the u.n. reunification plan , and 76 percent of the greek cypriots rejected it. the pro-settlement talat won 35.2 percent of the vote and formed a fragile coalition with the small center-right democrat party -lrb- dp -rrb- .

turkish cypriots will sunday elect a government for their breakaway state , but the political deadlock gripping their community amid failures to reunite the island is unlikely to cease before presidential polls in april . the self-proclaimed turkish republic of northern cyprus -lrb- trnc -rrb- was forced to call early elections after the ruling coalition lost its slim majority in may and subsequent efforts to stitch together a stable government failed . but opinion polls predict sunday 's elections will produce as fragmented a political picture as at the last general elections in december 2003 , fanning concerns of continuing uncertainty in the isolated statelet .
with no immediate hope of a breakthrough on the political scene , campaigning has been lackluster and excitement among the electorate marginal in the build-up to the polls . " i do not think much will change and i do not understand why we are holding elections when there will be no change , " aydin hikmet , a 64-year-old musician from the turkish sector of europe 's last divided capital , said .
" it is a waste of money . " political stability in the trnc is crucial for any revival of peace efforts to reunify cyprus , which have stalled since a un blueprint was voted down by greek cypriots despite overwhelming backing by the turkish cypriots last april .
the outcome of the referendum ensured that only the internationally recognized greek cypriot side enjoys the benefits of eu membership since the island joined the bloc on may 1 , leaving brussels with a diplomatic hot potato . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a turkish cypriot man sits in front of the flags of turkey , left , and breakaway turkish cypriot state , with an election poster of the national unity party in the center , in the turkish part of nicosia , northern cyprus , saturday , dec .

" turkish cypriots eagerly cast votes both in the 2003 elections and the referendum with hopes for a settlement .
" but their expectations were in vain and now they have next to no excitement for the upcoming elections , " said 39-year-old engineer levent ozverel . denktash to go settlement of the cyprus conflict has become even more important for the european union with turkey readying to begin accession talks with the bloc on oct 3 .
but observers say any fresh initiative to draw the island 's communities back to the negotiating table would have to wait until after the april presidential election , when veteran trnc leader rauf denktash is set to stand down . outgoing prime minister mehmet ali talat 's center-left republican turkish party -lrb- ctp -rrb- looks set to garner 35.9 percent of the vote , according to a recent poll conducted by the kadem research center and published in the kibris newspaper .
that would give the ctp 20 of parliament 's 50 seats , well short of an outright majority and forcing it to craft yet another coalition . in december 2003 , bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish cypriot supporters of the cyprus reunification plan celebrate in the turkish part of nicosia , cyprus , saturday night , april 24 , 2004 after the results .
referendum results show that 64.91 percent of turkish cypriots voted in favor of the u.n. reunification plan , and 76 percent of the greek cypriots rejected it. the pro-settlement talat won 35.2 percent of the vote and formed a fragile coalition with the small center-right democrat party -lrb- dp -rrb- .
but he was forced to resign last october after his government lost its parliamentary majority shortly after the referendum on the un plan . " the turkish cypriots are not separatists .
they want unification on the island , " talat told dw-radio . the same kadem poll predicted that talat 's main rival , the nationalist national unity party -lrb- ubp -rrb- would win 32 percent of the vote and retain its 18 seats in parliament .
the dp is also likely to keep its seven seats , while the peace and democracy movement - close to talat - may lose one of its current six seats , according to the survey .
the three other parties running in the elections would fail to pass the five-percent parliamentary threshold , the poll showed . cyprus has been divided along ethnic lines since 1974 when turkey occupied its northern third in response to an athens-engineered coup aimed at uniting the island with greece .

that would give the ctp 20 of parliament 's 50 seats , well short of an outright majority and forcing it to craft yet another coalition . in december 2003 , bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish cypriot supporters of the cyprus reunification plan celebrate in the turkish part of nicosia , cyprus , saturday night , april 24 , 2004 after the results .
referendum results show that 64.91 percent of turkish cypriots voted in favor of the u.n. reunification plan , and 76 percent of the greek cypriots rejected it. the pro-settlement talat won 35.2 percent of the vote and formed a fragile coalition with the small center-right democrat party -lrb- dp -rrb- .
but he was forced to resign last october after his government lost its parliamentary majority shortly after the referendum on the un plan . " the turkish cypriots are not separatists .
they want unification on the island , " talat told dw-radio . the same kadem poll predicted that talat 's main rival , the nationalist national unity party -lrb- ubp -rrb- would win 32 percent of the vote and retain its 18 seats in parliament .
the dp is also likely to keep its seven seats , while the peace and democracy movement - close to talat - may lose one of its current six seats , according to the survey .

on sunday , spain becomes the first country to put the matter directly to the people .
here 's a look at the remaining hurdles for the constitution . amid fears of an embarrassingly low turnout spaniards began voting sunday in a referendum on the proposed eu constitution which most of the 35-million electorate profess to back .
" today we are taking a decision of great importance for the future of a united europe , and also for spain , for its future and its well-being , " spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero said as he cast his vote sunday . spain is the first of 10 eu member states holding a popular vote on the text which is designed to streamline decision-making in the 25-member bloc which last year took in 10 new , mainly eastern european , members .
opinion polls have consistently shown the " yes " camp well ahead of those opposed , with some 45 percent of voters asked saying they back the constitution to only seven or eight percent defiantly against .
the spaniards have kicked off a long ratification process . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the eu summit in brussels last june , the uk independence party poster placed a poster in brussels asking the united kingdom 's prime minister , tony blair , not to sign the european constitution so far , lithuania , hungary and slovenia have already given the constitution the green light via their parliaments , but spain 's referendum is the first of 10 polls .
with voters from euroskeptical countries like denmark , britain , ireland and france still in line , the eu constitution 's fathers and mothers will be waiting uneasily in the months to come .
only one country needs to reject the document for it to fail .
spain 's approval looks certain but is by no means guaranteed .
the latest survey showed 51.2 percent of spaniards in favor but the poll had a margin of error of 2 percent , so everything is still open in the country on the iberian peninsula .
french go to polls in the summer french president jacques chirac is an advocate of the eu constitution .
but he has some work ahead to convince his countrymen and women who could go to the polls in june .
an early february poll by the ifop polling company put the proponents ahead of the opponents 25 to 20 percent with a large 46 percent undecided .
in 1992 , the french made the eu nervous when they narrowly approved the treaty of maastricht , which among other things created the foundation for the eu 's common currency , the euro .

the political leaders in both the government and the opposition do n't want to see that happen in this vote and are asking their supporters to vote " yes . "
the irish , another nay-sayer to an eu treaty , are leaning towards approval .
finally , the outcome of the referendum in poland is unclear because of a lack of interest .
in order to ensure the 50 percent voter participation required to make a referendum valid , the government will combine it with national elections .
not all eu citizens get to vote on their constitution the eu 's most populous country , germany , is not putting the matter to the people .
both houses of parliament must ratify the treaty with a two-thirds majority .
this friday , the upper house , the bundesrat , began the ratification debate .
in less than one week , the lower house , the bundestag will have the topic on the agenda .
the country 's two largest parties , the ruling social democrats and the conservative christian democrats , both favor the constitution .
foreign minister joschka fischer has said he wants the ratification process over before parliament 's summer break .

if one bad apple spoils the bunch and a country rejects the constitution , the document would have to be reworked .
or the country would have to renegotiate its status with the eu .
if all countries approve the document , it will become binding in 2007 , introducing new eu posts such as an eu foreign minister and an eu president , who would sit at the head of the board of european leaders . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de putting the constitution to the test this friday in spain , the eu constitution faces the first of ten national referendums .

on sunday , spain becomes the first country to put the matter directly to the people .
here 's a look at the remaining hurdles for the constitution . amid fears of an embarrassingly low turnout spaniards began voting sunday in a referendum on the proposed eu constitution which most of the 35-million electorate profess to back .
" today we are taking a decision of great importance for the future of a united europe , and also for spain , for its future and its well-being , " spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero said as he cast his vote sunday . spain is the first of 10 eu member states holding a popular vote on the text which is designed to streamline decision-making in the 25-member bloc which last year took in 10 new , mainly eastern european , members .
opinion polls have consistently shown the " yes " camp well ahead of those opposed , with some 45 percent of voters asked saying they back the constitution to only seven or eight percent defiantly against .
the spaniards have kicked off a long ratification process . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the eu summit in brussels last june , the uk independence party poster placed a poster in brussels asking the united kingdom 's prime minister , tony blair , not to sign the european constitution so far , lithuania , hungary and slovenia have already given the constitution the green light via their parliaments , but spain 's referendum is the first of 10 polls .
with voters from euroskeptical countries like denmark , britain , ireland and france still in line , the eu constitution 's fathers and mothers will be waiting uneasily in the months to come .
only one country needs to reject the document for it to fail .
spain 's approval looks certain but is by no means guaranteed .
the latest survey showed 51.2 percent of spaniards in favor but the poll had a margin of error of 2 percent , so everything is still open in the country on the iberian peninsula .
french go to polls in the summer french president jacques chirac is an advocate of the eu constitution .
but he has some work ahead to convince his countrymen and women who could go to the polls in june .
an early february poll by the ifop polling company put the proponents ahead of the opponents 25 to 20 percent with a large 46 percent undecided .
in 1992 , the french made the eu nervous when they narrowly approved the treaty of maastricht , which among other things created the foundation for the eu 's common currency , the euro .

the european commission is examining german visas issued to eastern europeans , which are at the heart of a political scandal in the country , to determine whether they violated european law . a spokesman for the eu 's justice commissioner franco frattini confirmed sunday that the eu was looking into the matter .
" the commission has launched an investigation to find out if germany 's actions concerning the visas were in breach of european law , " said spokesman friso roscam abbing , in an interview to the german mass-selling daily bild . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the visa scandal involves joschka fischer , germany 's foreign minister and most popular politician , and the decision by his ministry in 1999 to ease conditions for citizens of the former soviet bloc to acquire german visas . germany 's conservative opposition has charged that " hundreds of thousands " of illegal immigrants from eastern europe - ukraine in particular - were able to enter the country on tourist visas between 2000 and 2003 , many of them with the help of organized crime networks .
the incoming numbers apparently included hundreds of illegal immigrants , prostitutes and human traffickers . the german parliament has started an investigation into the alleged mass smuggling of eastern europeans into germany . the inquiry by the commission in brussels , the european union 's executive arm , will verify whether german directives were in accordance with eu regulations .
in 1990 , the schengen accord established a european zone for the free movement of people and required member countries to maintain control of their borders at the zone 's common exterior . flood of visa-holders in march 2000 , the so-called volmer directive , named after germany 's former secretary of state ludger volmer , encouraged embassies to cut through the red tape for visas following complaints to the ministry that it was too strict in dispensing visas in decisions concerning family reunions and sickness . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people wait at the german embassy in the ukrainian capital of kiew to apply for a visa .
volmer then reportedly issued a decree that , when in doubt , embassy workers should decide in favor of issuing a visa to an applicant . the consequence of this directive was a drastic increase in the number of visas authorized by german embassies around the world .
a flood of applicants followed .
in 2001 , the number of visas approved by the embassy in kiev , ukraine alone reached 400,000 .
it was a large number , considering the 190 german embassies worldwide issue only 3 million visas each year on average . the directive was cancelled in march 2003 . afp / dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de when will fischer take the hot seat ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 20.02.2005 a rough road to ratification großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanish premier zapatero has it easier than most eu leaders three countries have already said " yes " to the eu constitution .
on sunday , spain becomes the first country to put the matter directly to the people .
here 's a look at the remaining hurdles for the constitution . amid fears of an embarrassingly low turnout spaniards began voting sunday in a referendum on the proposed eu constitution which most of the 35-million electorate profess to back .
" today we are taking a decision of great importance for the future of a united europe , and also for spain , for its future and its well-being , " spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero said as he cast his vote sunday . spain is the first of 10 eu member states holding a popular vote on the text which is designed to streamline decision-making in the 25-member bloc which last year took in 10 new , mainly eastern european , members .
opinion polls have consistently shown the " yes " camp well ahead of those opposed , with some 45 percent of voters asked saying they back the constitution to only seven or eight percent defiantly against .
the spaniards have kicked off a long ratification process . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the eu summit in brussels last june , the uk independence party poster placed a poster in brussels asking the united kingdom 's prime minister , tony blair , not to sign the european constitution so far , lithuania , hungary and slovenia have already given the constitution the green light via their parliaments , but spain 's referendum is the first of 10 polls .
with voters from euroskeptical countries like denmark , britain , ireland and france still in line , the eu constitution 's fathers and mothers will be waiting uneasily in the months to come .
only one country needs to reject the document for it to fail .
spain 's approval looks certain but is by no means guaranteed .
the latest survey showed 51.2 percent of spaniards in favor but the poll had a margin of error of 2 percent , so everything is still open in the country on the iberian peninsula .
french go to polls in the summer french president jacques chirac is an advocate of the eu constitution .
but he has some work ahead to convince his countrymen and women who could go to the polls in june .
an early february poll by the ifop polling company put the proponents ahead of the opponents 25 to 20 percent with a large 46 percent undecided .
in 1992 , the french made the eu nervous when they narrowly approved the treaty of maastricht , which among other things created the foundation for the eu 's common currency , the euro .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all eyes on europe london will be taking its time , waiting until early 2006 before letting brits go to the polls to decide .
the danes have already rejected two eu treaties in 1992 and 2000 .
the political leaders in both the government and the opposition do n't want to see that happen in this vote and are asking their supporters to vote " yes . "
the irish , another nay-sayer to an eu treaty , are leaning towards approval .
finally , the outcome of the referendum in poland is unclear because of a lack of interest .
in order to ensure the 50 percent voter participation required to make a referendum valid , the government will combine it with national elections .
not all eu citizens get to vote on their constitution the eu 's most populous country , germany , is not putting the matter to the people .
both houses of parliament must ratify the treaty with a two-thirds majority .
this friday , the upper house , the bundesrat , began the ratification debate .
in less than one week , the lower house , the bundestag will have the topic on the agenda .
the country 's two largest parties , the ruling social democrats and the conservative christian democrats , both favor the constitution .
foreign minister joschka fischer has said he wants the ratification process over before parliament 's summer break .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : current european union foreign policy chief javier solana - future eu foreign minister ?
by october 2006 , all 25 countries , in whichever way they feel is appropriate , must have approved the constitution .
if one bad apple spoils the bunch and a country rejects the constitution , the document would have to be reworked .
or the country would have to renegotiate its status with the eu .
if all countries approve the document , it will become binding in 2007 , introducing new eu posts such as an eu foreign minister and an eu president , who would sit at the head of the board of european leaders . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de putting the constitution to the test this friday in spain , the eu constitution faces the first of ten national referendums .

while the verdict is still out on whether berlin will call for a referendum on the eu constitution , some politicians are calling for legislation that will allow for plebiscites on citizen 's initiatives .

the european commission is examining german visas issued to eastern europeans , which are at the heart of a political scandal in the country , to determine whether they violated european law . a spokesman for the eu 's justice commissioner franco frattini confirmed sunday that the eu was looking into the matter .
" the commission has launched an investigation to find out if germany 's actions concerning the visas were in breach of european law , " said spokesman friso roscam abbing , in an interview to the german mass-selling daily bild . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the visa scandal involves joschka fischer , germany 's foreign minister and most popular politician , and the decision by his ministry in 1999 to ease conditions for citizens of the former soviet bloc to acquire german visas . germany 's conservative opposition has charged that " hundreds of thousands " of illegal immigrants from eastern europe - ukraine in particular - were able to enter the country on tourist visas between 2000 and 2003 , many of them with the help of organized crime networks .
the incoming numbers apparently included hundreds of illegal immigrants , prostitutes and human traffickers . the german parliament has started an investigation into the alleged mass smuggling of eastern europeans into germany . the inquiry by the commission in brussels , the european union 's executive arm , will verify whether german directives were in accordance with eu regulations .
in 1990 , the schengen accord established a european zone for the free movement of people and required member countries to maintain control of their borders at the zone 's common exterior . flood of visa-holders in march 2000 , the so-called volmer directive , named after germany 's former secretary of state ludger volmer , encouraged embassies to cut through the red tape for visas following complaints to the ministry that it was too strict in dispensing visas in decisions concerning family reunions and sickness . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people wait at the german embassy in the ukrainian capital of kiew to apply for a visa .
volmer then reportedly issued a decree that , when in doubt , embassy workers should decide in favor of issuing a visa to an applicant . the consequence of this directive was a drastic increase in the number of visas authorized by german embassies around the world .
a flood of applicants followed .
in 2001 , the number of visas approved by the embassy in kiev , ukraine alone reached 400,000 .
it was a large number , considering the 190 german embassies worldwide issue only 3 million visas each year on average . the directive was cancelled in march 2003 . afp / dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de when will fischer take the hot seat ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 20.02.2005 a rough road to ratification großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanish premier zapatero has it easier than most eu leaders three countries have already said " yes " to the eu constitution .
on sunday , spain becomes the first country to put the matter directly to the people .
here 's a look at the remaining hurdles for the constitution . amid fears of an embarrassingly low turnout spaniards began voting sunday in a referendum on the proposed eu constitution which most of the 35-million electorate profess to back .
" today we are taking a decision of great importance for the future of a united europe , and also for spain , for its future and its well-being , " spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero said as he cast his vote sunday . spain is the first of 10 eu member states holding a popular vote on the text which is designed to streamline decision-making in the 25-member bloc which last year took in 10 new , mainly eastern european , members .
opinion polls have consistently shown the " yes " camp well ahead of those opposed , with some 45 percent of voters asked saying they back the constitution to only seven or eight percent defiantly against .
the spaniards have kicked off a long ratification process . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the eu summit in brussels last june , the uk independence party poster placed a poster in brussels asking the united kingdom 's prime minister , tony blair , not to sign the european constitution so far , lithuania , hungary and slovenia have already given the constitution the green light via their parliaments , but spain 's referendum is the first of 10 polls .
with voters from euroskeptical countries like denmark , britain , ireland and france still in line , the eu constitution 's fathers and mothers will be waiting uneasily in the months to come .
only one country needs to reject the document for it to fail .
spain 's approval looks certain but is by no means guaranteed .
the latest survey showed 51.2 percent of spaniards in favor but the poll had a margin of error of 2 percent , so everything is still open in the country on the iberian peninsula .
french go to polls in the summer french president jacques chirac is an advocate of the eu constitution .
but he has some work ahead to convince his countrymen and women who could go to the polls in june .
an early february poll by the ifop polling company put the proponents ahead of the opponents 25 to 20 percent with a large 46 percent undecided .
in 1992 , the french made the eu nervous when they narrowly approved the treaty of maastricht , which among other things created the foundation for the eu 's common currency , the euro .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all eyes on europe london will be taking its time , waiting until early 2006 before letting brits go to the polls to decide .
the danes have already rejected two eu treaties in 1992 and 2000 .
the political leaders in both the government and the opposition do n't want to see that happen in this vote and are asking their supporters to vote " yes . "
the irish , another nay-sayer to an eu treaty , are leaning towards approval .
finally , the outcome of the referendum in poland is unclear because of a lack of interest .
in order to ensure the 50 percent voter participation required to make a referendum valid , the government will combine it with national elections .
not all eu citizens get to vote on their constitution the eu 's most populous country , germany , is not putting the matter to the people .
both houses of parliament must ratify the treaty with a two-thirds majority .

on sunday , spain becomes the first country to put the matter directly to the people .
here 's a look at the remaining hurdles for the constitution . amid fears of an embarrassingly low turnout spaniards began voting sunday in a referendum on the proposed eu constitution which most of the 35-million electorate profess to back .
" today we are taking a decision of great importance for the future of a united europe , and also for spain , for its future and its well-being , " spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero said as he cast his vote sunday . spain is the first of 10 eu member states holding a popular vote on the text which is designed to streamline decision-making in the 25-member bloc which last year took in 10 new , mainly eastern european , members .
opinion polls have consistently shown the " yes " camp well ahead of those opposed , with some 45 percent of voters asked saying they back the constitution to only seven or eight percent defiantly against .
the spaniards have kicked off a long ratification process . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the eu summit in brussels last june , the uk independence party poster placed a poster in brussels asking the united kingdom 's prime minister , tony blair , not to sign the european constitution so far , lithuania , hungary and slovenia have already given the constitution the green light via their parliaments , but spain 's referendum is the first of 10 polls .
with voters from euroskeptical countries like denmark , britain , ireland and france still in line , the eu constitution 's fathers and mothers will be waiting uneasily in the months to come .
only one country needs to reject the document for it to fail .
spain 's approval looks certain but is by no means guaranteed .
the latest survey showed 51.2 percent of spaniards in favor but the poll had a margin of error of 2 percent , so everything is still open in the country on the iberian peninsula .
french go to polls in the summer french president jacques chirac is an advocate of the eu constitution .
but he has some work ahead to convince his countrymen and women who could go to the polls in june .
an early february poll by the ifop polling company put the proponents ahead of the opponents 25 to 20 percent with a large 46 percent undecided .
in 1992 , the french made the eu nervous when they narrowly approved the treaty of maastricht , which among other things created the foundation for the eu 's common currency , the euro .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all eyes on europe london will be taking its time , waiting until early 2006 before letting brits go to the polls to decide .
the danes have already rejected two eu treaties in 1992 and 2000 .
the political leaders in both the government and the opposition do n't want to see that happen in this vote and are asking their supporters to vote " yes . "
the irish , another nay-sayer to an eu treaty , are leaning towards approval .
finally , the outcome of the referendum in poland is unclear because of a lack of interest .
in order to ensure the 50 percent voter participation required to make a referendum valid , the government will combine it with national elections .
not all eu citizens get to vote on their constitution the eu 's most populous country , germany , is not putting the matter to the people .
both houses of parliament must ratify the treaty with a two-thirds majority .
this friday , the upper house , the bundesrat , began the ratification debate .
in less than one week , the lower house , the bundestag will have the topic on the agenda .

the european commission is examining german visas issued to eastern europeans , which are at the heart of a political scandal in the country , to determine whether they violated european law . a spokesman for the eu 's justice commissioner franco frattini confirmed sunday that the eu was looking into the matter .
" the commission has launched an investigation to find out if germany 's actions concerning the visas were in breach of european law , " said spokesman friso roscam abbing , in an interview to the german mass-selling daily bild . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the visa scandal involves joschka fischer , germany 's foreign minister and most popular politician , and the decision by his ministry in 1999 to ease conditions for citizens of the former soviet bloc to acquire german visas . germany 's conservative opposition has charged that " hundreds of thousands " of illegal immigrants from eastern europe - ukraine in particular - were able to enter the country on tourist visas between 2000 and 2003 , many of them with the help of organized crime networks .
the incoming numbers apparently included hundreds of illegal immigrants , prostitutes and human traffickers . the german parliament has started an investigation into the alleged mass smuggling of eastern europeans into germany . the inquiry by the commission in brussels , the european union 's executive arm , will verify whether german directives were in accordance with eu regulations .
in 1990 , the schengen accord established a european zone for the free movement of people and required member countries to maintain control of their borders at the zone 's common exterior . flood of visa-holders in march 2000 , the so-called volmer directive , named after germany 's former secretary of state ludger volmer , encouraged embassies to cut through the red tape for visas following complaints to the ministry that it was too strict in dispensing visas in decisions concerning family reunions and sickness . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people wait at the german embassy in the ukrainian capital of kiew to apply for a visa .
volmer then reportedly issued a decree that , when in doubt , embassy workers should decide in favor of issuing a visa to an applicant . the consequence of this directive was a drastic increase in the number of visas authorized by german embassies around the world .
a flood of applicants followed .
in 2001 , the number of visas approved by the embassy in kiev , ukraine alone reached 400,000 .
it was a large number , considering the 190 german embassies worldwide issue only 3 million visas each year on average . the directive was cancelled in march 2003 . afp / dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de when will fischer take the hot seat ?

fishing drives natural selection for smaller fish that grow more slowly and have reduced reproductive potential .
these changes are genetic and therefore hard to reverse , scuttling the renewal of dwindling fish populations .
details of the research were discussed on saturday at a major science conference in washington dc .
" most fisheries are collapsing and many are on the brink of potentially irreversible loss , " said jeremy jackson , of the scripps institution of oceanography in california .
" there are massive evolutionary shifts going on in the remnant populations of fish .
large fish with huge reproductive potential are being replaced by smaller fish with diminished reproductive potential , " he told the annual meeting of the american association for the advancement of science -lrb- aaas -rrb- .
no reverse david conover , of stony brook university in new york found a two-fold change in productivity in atlantic silversides within just four generations of fish .
" by selectively harvesting the largest fish , we end up changing the whole biology - not only growth rates , but egg size , fecundity , feeding behaviour , " he said .
" the scary part is that when we stopped size-selective harvest , the biology did n't change back , it was permanent . "
research by dr conover and other groups in norway , canada and austria also found declines in the reproductive potential of fish populations .
work by steven berkeley , of the university of california-santa cruz , shows that older and therefore bigger female pacific rockfish produce exponentially more eggs than younger , smaller females and their larvae have a greatly increased chance of survival .
safe haven " what we need to provide is some refuge from fishing so that the genes for larger , faster-growing fish have some sanctuary from fishing , " said dr berkeley .
andy rosenberg , of the university of new hampshire , said that the way fish resources were currently being managed was prolonging the period of recovery for stocks .
" the longer we ignore these fine-scale processes , the longer it will take for that recovery .
and it 's not a simple linear relationship - you can cause massive damage in a very short period of time and it can take them much longer to recover , " he said .
cod off the coast of newfoundland - once one of the largest fish populations in the world - have suffered a 99 % decline since the 1960s .
research shows that changes in size and age at maturity caused by just 30-50 years of fishing have reduced the chance of cod 's recovery by 25-30 % .

the security forces had been besieging a group of suspected islamic militants hiding in the block since saturday .
an unknown number of the alleged militants were killed when a firefight broke out and the security forces set off poison gas .
this is the latest in a series of confrontations with alleged extremists in the republic close to chechnya .
on saturday , police arrested three other suspected militants in nalchik .

i am not satisfied that i can be sure that they did it dr peter acland the gays were said to have force-fed the youngster four teaspoons of salt as a punishment at their then home in bromsgrove .

david beckham , arguably the most talented english footballer of his era , would no doubt have been famous whoever he married .
but the choice of victoria adams , a member of the spice girls , the most famous pop group of the late 1990s , was manna from heaven for the british tabloids .
the beckhams are expected to act as role models while the media dissects their every move - but once upon a time they were just like the rest of us ... almost .
david was brought up in leytonstone , east london , by parents , ted , a kitchen-fitter , and sandra , a hairdresser , while victoria lived in affluent goffs oak , hertfordshire . "
the simple truth is that i am very happily married " david beckham in 2004 her father , electronics engineer tony , used to drive her to school in a rolls-royce , and their house boasted a pool .
it was this background that led spice girls manager simon fuller to christen her posh spice .
he also gave the band a catchy song called wannabe .
it reached number one in 31 countries in 1996 and topped the uk chart for seven weeks .
weeks after wannabe went to number one , david seared himself on the public consciousness with a spectacular 50-yard goal against wimbledon on the opening day of the 1996/7 season .
within a month , he was in the england side .
in 1997 he met victoria when sporty spice , melanie chisholm , a liverpool fan , came along to a united game at old trafford .
the beckhams say it was love at first sight , and david knew victoria was the woman he would marry .
after dating for six months , david proposed , and their engagement made front page news in all the tabloids .
david 's profile reached a new level during the 1998 world cup , when he was sent off for a petulant kick at argentina 's diego simeone .
victoria was on tour in the us with the spice girls at the time and he flew to new york to be with her and escape the english press , which was castigating him for spoiling the team 's chances .
it was in new york that their son , brooklyn joseph , was conceived .
on 4 march 1999 , victoria gave birth in london , and the couple married in a castle near dublin , republic of ireland , four months later .
the guest list included sir elton john , david 's manchester united teammates and victoria 's fellow spice girls .
photographs from the " wedding of the year " were sold to ok ! magazine while critics said two thrones , the centrepieces of the event , were garish and symbolic of their giant egos .
after honeymooning in the south of france , the beckhams set up home in a £ 2.5m luxury mansion in sawbridgeworth , hertfordshire - dubbed " beckingham palace " .
victoria launched her solo career - but it quickly took a nosedive .
her album , vb , cost a reported £ 5m to make but only sold about 50,000 copies and she parted company with her record label , virgin .
family tattoos at the other end of the spectrum , david cast aside his villain status to rise to the position of hero following his free kick against greece which secured england 's entry into the 2002 world cup in japan .
victoria could not travel to japan to be with her husband during his triumph because she was already heavily pregnant .
romeo james beckham was born on 1 september 2002 at the exclusive portland hospital in london .
david and victoria have always worn their " happy family " credentials on their sleeves .
famous footballers ' wives wolves and england star billy wright married one of the beverley sisters , joy , in the 1950s george best went out with miss world mary stavin everton defender pat van den hauwe wed model mandy smith , the former wife of bill wyman , in 1993 .
england midfielder jamie redknapp married pop star louise nurding -lrb- above -rrb- in 1998 he has victoria 's name - albeit misspelled - in hindi tattooed on his arm .
she has " db " tattooed on her wrist .
his other works of body art include a guardian angel overlooking his first two sons ' names .
and david 's devotion to his family might have cost him the £ 10m a year he was reportedly earning at old trafford .
brooklyn later showed he may have inherited his dad 's footballing skills when he passed a three-day course at the bobby charlton soccer school at the age of four .
in july 2003 , david signed a £ 25m deal with real madrid , ending his time playing at the beloved team of his childhood heroes , manchester united .
but in 2004 , the downside of such fame reared its head when david was accused of having an affair and there were reports that their marriage was on the rocks .
david said at the time : " the simple truth is that i am very happily married , have a wonderful wife and two very special kids .
" there is nothing that any third party can do to change these facts . "
with the completion of a potential three-part boy band , or maybe a future midfield trio , they seem to have put those troubles behind them .

weeks after wannabe went to number one , david seared himself on the public consciousness with a spectacular 50-yard goal against wimbledon on the opening day of the 1996/7 season .
within a month , he was in the england side .
the beckham boys may have inherited david 's footballing skills in 1997 he met victoria when sporty spice , melanie chisholm , a liverpool fan , came along to a united game at old trafford .
the beckhams say it was love at first sight , and david knew victoria was the woman he would marry .

david 's profile reached a new level during the 1998 world cup , when he was sent off for a petulant kick at argentina 's diego simeone .
victoria was on tour in the us with the spice girls at the time and he flew to new york to be with her and escape the english press , which was castigating him for spoiling the team 's chances .
it was in new york that their son , brooklyn joseph , was conceived .
on 4 march 1999 , victoria gave birth in london , and the couple married in a castle near dublin , republic of ireland , four months later .

after honeymooning in the south of france , the beckhams set up home in a £ 2.5m luxury mansion in sawbridgeworth , hertfordshire - dubbed " beckingham palace " .
victoria launched her solo career - but it quickly took a nosedive .
her album , vb , cost a reported £ 5m to make but only sold about 50,000 copies and she parted company with her record label , virgin .
family tattoos at the other end of the spectrum , david cast aside his villain status to rise to the position of hero following his free kick against greece which secured england 's entry into the 2002 world cup in japan .
victoria could not travel to japan to be with her husband during his triumph because she was already heavily pregnant .

brooklyn later showed he may have inherited his dad 's footballing skills when he passed a three-day course at the bobby charlton soccer school at the age of four .
in july 2003 , david signed a £ 25m deal with real madrid , ending his time playing at the beloved team of his childhood heroes , manchester united .
but in 2004 , the downside of such fame reared its head when david was accused of having an affair and there were reports that their marriage was on the rocks .
david said at the time : " the simple truth is that i am very happily married , have a wonderful wife and two very special kids .
" there is nothing that any third party can do to change these facts . "
with the completion of a potential three-part boy band , or maybe a future midfield trio , they seem to have put those troubles behind them .
