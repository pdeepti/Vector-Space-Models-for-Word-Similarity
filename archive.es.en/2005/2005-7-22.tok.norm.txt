according to eyewitnesses , the man either fell or was pushed to the floor a train car where he shot him to death . police said the shooting was " directly linked " to the investigations of the bomb attacks on london 's transit system .
reports suggest that the suspect was apparently about to board a train at stockwell tube station in south london when armed officers shouted a warning to passengers before opening fire . metropolitan police officers are allegedly under ' shoot to kill ' orders when confronting suspected suicide bombers who are thought to be on the verge of detonating . it is still not clear whether the man killed by police at stockwell station was suspected of involvement in the failed bomb attacks or had been mistaken for someone else . a spokesman for london 's metropolitain police told reuters : " the gentleman shot at stockwell today has yet to be identified so it would be impossible to link him to anything at this stage . " chaos in station passengers reported the man - described as south asian - was boarding the train when police ordered the doors to be closed . witnesses said police chased the man before shooting him .
" they pushed him onto the floor and unloaded five shots into him .
he 's dead , " witness mark whitby told the bbc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police stand outside stockwell station , in london , friday july 22 , 2005 .
" we were on the tube and then we suddenly heard someone say ' get out , get out ' and then we heard gunshots , " said passenger briony coetsee .
alistair drummond , of the london ambulance service , said paramedics had been called to the station at 10:10 utc to remove the suspect 's body . before getting to the train , the man apparently vaulted over barriers while being chased by the armed police who it is alleged had been trailing him since receiving a tip-off that he was involved in thursday 's attacks . witnesses gave sketchy details of the man who some said was of south asian appearance .
the man raised suspicion by wearing a winter coat in the heat of summer .
most witnesses said he wore a backpack - reminding many of images of the four suicide bombers behind the july 7 attacks . arrest made , images released later on friday , two man were arrested in connection with thursday 's explosions .
both are said to be nabbed near stockwell station , where the man had been shot earlier . a spokeswoman for london 's metropolitan police said the first arrest occurred during a search of an address in the stockwell area . the second was confirmed by a police spokeswoman to reuters .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : picture released friday july 22 , 2005 , by scotland yard of one of four men who police wish to question in connection with the four suspected suicide attacks on three tube trains and a bus thursday in london .
this image was taken by a cctv camera at warren street - one of the three tube stations involved .
police issued on friday closed circuit television images of four men they want to question over the attempted bomb attacks on three tube trains and a bus in london on thursday .
police commissioner andy hayman said anyone who knew who or where the men were should contact police .
the bombers fled after detonators went off that failed to ignite explosives .
continued climate of fear hanging over capital whereas commuters were largely defiant after the first attacks that killed 56 people , they betrayed traces of nervousness after thursday 's failed attacks on three underground subway trains and a double-decker bus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a morning commuter reads the morning headlines onboard the underground after thursday 's bomb attacks plunged the tube networks into chaos in london , friday july 22 , 2005 .
investigators searched friday for fingerprints , dna and other forensic evidence collected from attacks on three subway trains and a double-decker bus that were hauntingly reminiscent of suicide bombings two weeks ago .
the new reports of further police action regarding possible terrorist activities will do nothing to ease the atmosphere of fear in the english capital . " yes , i 'm afraid .
i always take the tube -lrb- subway -rrb- to go to work but now i feel more confident with the bus , " said ehelena osaki , 24 , told afp in the city financial district .
" the bus also is worrying me a bit but you 've got to get to work , no ?
i 'm too young to die . " commuters faced disruption on the sections of london 's transport network , with two underground lines closed and three running a restricted service .
several stations on other lines were also shut down . up on street level , buses were running a full service , but diversions were in place near two of the four sites of thursday 's incidents . commuters taking alternative transport david roberts , 29 , who rode a bicycle to work , said that two incidents in as many weeks were " putting fears into people 's minds .
i would n't go in the underground with my two children .
i would fear too much for their safety . " matthew kube , 26 , who lives in southwest london , said he was using overground suburban trains for most of his journey to work , rather than his usual underground line .
" i 'm a little bit upset , " he said at blackfriars station .
" it 's the first day i feel a bit worried and i chose to take the overground train despite the tube from wimbledon .
i may avoid the tube as much as possible , but i 'm not sure yet . " luna martello , 28 , said she still rides double-decker buses , but avoids the back of the upper deck because that is where one of the july 7 bombs , at tavistock square in bloomsbury , central london , went off .
" i tend to stand by the driver in the front of the bus , even when there are vacant seats , " she said . dw staff -lrb- nda / jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european leaders stand by londoners british prime minister tony blair received backing from european leaders in the wake of the latest attacks on london .

according to eyewitnesses , the man either fell or was pushed to the floor a train car where he shot him to death . police said the shooting was " directly linked " to the investigations of the bomb attacks on london 's transit system .
reports suggest that the suspect was apparently about to board a train at stockwell tube station in south london when armed officers shouted a warning to passengers before opening fire . metropolitan police officers are allegedly under ' shoot to kill ' orders when confronting suspected suicide bombers who are thought to be on the verge of detonating . it is still not clear whether the man killed by police at stockwell station was suspected of involvement in the failed bomb attacks or had been mistaken for someone else . a spokesman for london 's metropolitain police told reuters : " the gentleman shot at stockwell today has yet to be identified so it would be impossible to link him to anything at this stage . " chaos in station passengers reported the man - described as south asian - was boarding the train when police ordered the doors to be closed . witnesses said police chased the man before shooting him .
" they pushed him onto the floor and unloaded five shots into him .
he 's dead , " witness mark whitby told the bbc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police stand outside stockwell station , in london , friday july 22 , 2005 .
" we were on the tube and then we suddenly heard someone say ' get out , get out ' and then we heard gunshots , " said passenger briony coetsee .
alistair drummond , of the london ambulance service , said paramedics had been called to the station at 10:10 utc to remove the suspect 's body . before getting to the train , the man apparently vaulted over barriers while being chased by the armed police who it is alleged had been trailing him since receiving a tip-off that he was involved in thursday 's attacks . witnesses gave sketchy details of the man who some said was of south asian appearance .
the man raised suspicion by wearing a winter coat in the heat of summer .
most witnesses said he wore a backpack - reminding many of images of the four suicide bombers behind the july 7 attacks . arrest made , images released later on friday , two man were arrested in connection with thursday 's explosions .
both are said to be nabbed near stockwell station , where the man had been shot earlier . a spokeswoman for london 's metropolitan police said the first arrest occurred during a search of an address in the stockwell area . the second was confirmed by a police spokeswoman to reuters .
details were n't available . " officers attended an address in connection with the ongoing investigation " into attacks staged on thursday on london underground trains and a bus .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : picture released friday july 22 , 2005 , by scotland yard of one of four men who police wish to question in connection with the four suspected suicide attacks on three tube trains and a bus thursday in london .
this image was taken by a cctv camera at warren street - one of the three tube stations involved .
police issued on friday closed circuit television images of four men they want to question over the attempted bomb attacks on three tube trains and a bus in london on thursday .
police commissioner andy hayman said anyone who knew who or where the men were should contact police .
the bombers fled after detonators went off that failed to ignite explosives .
continued climate of fear hanging over capital whereas commuters were largely defiant after the first attacks that killed 56 people , they betrayed traces of nervousness after thursday 's failed attacks on three underground subway trains and a double-decker bus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a morning commuter reads the morning headlines onboard the underground after thursday 's bomb attacks plunged the tube networks into chaos in london , friday july 22 , 2005 .
investigators searched friday for fingerprints , dna and other forensic evidence collected from attacks on three subway trains and a double-decker bus that were hauntingly reminiscent of suicide bombings two weeks ago .
the new reports of further police action regarding possible terrorist activities will do nothing to ease the atmosphere of fear in the english capital . " yes , i 'm afraid .
i always take the tube -lrb- subway -rrb- to go to work but now i feel more confident with the bus , " said ehelena osaki , 24 , told afp in the city financial district .
" the bus also is worrying me a bit but you 've got to get to work , no ?
i 'm too young to die . " commuters faced disruption on the sections of london 's transport network , with two underground lines closed and three running a restricted service .
several stations on other lines were also shut down . up on street level , buses were running a full service , but diversions were in place near two of the four sites of thursday 's incidents . commuters taking alternative transport david roberts , 29 , who rode a bicycle to work , said that two incidents in as many weeks were " putting fears into people 's minds .
i would n't go in the underground with my two children .
i would fear too much for their safety . " matthew kube , 26 , who lives in southwest london , said he was using overground suburban trains for most of his journey to work , rather than his usual underground line .
" i 'm a little bit upset , " he said at blackfriars station .
" it 's the first day i feel a bit worried and i chose to take the overground train despite the tube from wimbledon .
i may avoid the tube as much as possible , but i 'm not sure yet . " luna martello , 28 , said she still rides double-decker buses , but avoids the back of the upper deck because that is where one of the july 7 bombs , at tavistock square in bloomsbury , central london , went off .

the decision paves the way for early elections unless the federal constitutional court intervenes .
what could still happen ? why is the election date set for september 18 ?
german law states that elections must take at the latest 60 days after parliament was dissolved .
köhler waited to announce his decision until july 21 so that the poll could be held on september 18 which comes one week after the end of the summer school break for the states of bavaria and baden-württemberg .
it is tradition in germany not to hold an election during a school vacation .
could the elections still be prevented from taking place ?
yes , but only theoretically .
the bundestag parliamentarians werner schulz -lrb- greens -rrb- and jelena hoffmann -lrb- spd -rrb- , along with several smaller political parties , have announced they will appeal the dissolution to the federal constitutional court in karlsruhe .
they claim that chancellor gerhard schröder -lrb- spd -rrb- misused a vote of confidence so that early elections could be held .
according to them , early elections can only occur if the chancellor no longer can rely on his coalition to support him , something they say is not true , and hence , his call for a vote of confidence based on a lack of support was invalid .
how long could the constitutional court take to hand down a decision ?
in 1983 , when chancellor helmut kohl -lrb- cdu -rrb- held a vote of confidence , the judges on the country 's top court needed 28 days before handing down a decision .
it is possible to expedite the process .
for example , in june the judges took only ten days to demand a parliamentary commission inquiring into the " visa affair " continue .
does the 60-day deadline also apply to the constitutional court or can it take more time to make a decision ?
there is nothing that would prohibit the judges from taking more than 60 days .
if they feel that the matter is too complex , the september 18 election date could be postponed .
what would happen if the federal constitutional court ruled that köhler 's dissolution of parliament were unconstitutional ?

the decision paves the way for early elections unless the federal constitutional court intervenes .
what could still happen ? why is the election date set for september 18 ?
german law states that elections must take at the latest 60 days after parliament was dissolved .
köhler waited to announce his decision until july 21 so that the poll could be held on september 18 which comes one week after the end of the summer school break for the states of bavaria and baden-württemberg .
it is tradition in germany not to hold an election during a school vacation .
could the elections still be prevented from taking place ?
yes , but only theoretically .
the bundestag parliamentarians werner schulz -lrb- greens -rrb- and jelena hoffmann -lrb- spd -rrb- , along with several smaller political parties , have announced they will appeal the dissolution to the federal constitutional court in karlsruhe .
they claim that chancellor gerhard schröder -lrb- spd -rrb- misused a vote of confidence so that early elections could be held .
according to them , early elections can only occur if the chancellor no longer can rely on his coalition to support him , something they say is not true , and hence , his call for a vote of confidence based on a lack of support was invalid .
how long could the constitutional court take to hand down a decision ?
in 1983 , when chancellor helmut kohl -lrb- cdu -rrb- held a vote of confidence , the judges on the country 's top court needed 28 days before handing down a decision .
it is possible to expedite the process .
for example , in june the judges took only ten days to demand a parliamentary commission inquiring into the " visa affair " continue .
does the 60-day deadline also apply to the constitutional court or can it take more time to make a decision ?
there is nothing that would prohibit the judges from taking more than 60 days .
if they feel that the matter is too complex , the september 18 election date could be postponed .
what would happen if the federal constitutional court ruled that köhler 's dissolution of parliament were unconstitutional ?
firstly , germans would be outraged .
if the judges in karlsruhe were to decide that schröder did misuse the vote of confidence , then they would also be denigrating köhler .
the administration in berlin would be unable to rule just as schröder had described it .
spd party chair , franz müntefering has repeated that there is no alternative plan .
he said that schröder would not resign from his post .
the consequence : bundestag president wolfgang thierse said the center-left coalition would be forced to continue their partnership .
schröder would remain at the helm which the public just would not understand .

germans hope the election will bring changes , but they are n't sure they will . the chips have fallen .
after almost three weeks of speculation , president horst köhler has met the request of chancellor gerhard schröder to hold elections 12 months ahead of schedule .
pointing to the chancellor 's lack of a stable majority within his coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens , köhler will give a new - or potentially the same - administration to take on what he called " immense tasks " in the country .
something that with few exceptions was welcomed by germans across the country .
politicians pleased for most part although parliament is in recess and most politicians are enjoying their vacations at home or even abroad , the importance of dissolution meant a return to berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president horst köhler coming from his home town hanover to speak , schröder called the confirmation of his request " correct and necessary " and wasted no time in announcing that he would run again as the spd candidate for chancellor .
reforms are imperative according to schröder .
" i am going to fight to do that , " he said .
the whole party leadership stood behind the chancellor but within the ranks , there were voices of dissent .
spd parliamentarian jelena hoffmann , along with her green colleague werner schulz , want to go to the country 's constitutional court to overturn köhler 's dissolution of the bundestag .
angela merkel 's christian democrats are rubbing their hands over the decision .
sitting on an almost 17 point lead in the opinion polls , a victory in less than two months is theirs for the taking .
merkel referred to the country 's five million unemployed , saying the country did n't " have to make do " with that .
" i am asking us to move forward together for a better germany , in which people can again seize their opportunities , " she said after köhler 's address .
labor unions and big business agree on something bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tendency of the german economy has been downwards compared to the rest of the world the weak economic situation has been an achilles ' heel for schröder .
big business complains of costs , particularly non-wage labor costs .
labor unions protest that the country 's big companies are making money hand over fist while leaving workers in the lurch .
they also must watch their influence erode within the spd , and germany in general .
yet on this issue , the two sides are in agreement .
german trade union federation -lrb- dgb -rrb- chair michael sommer commented that a phase of uncertainty and stagnation could be brought to an end .
" we finally need some decisive policies for more growth and employment , " sommer said .
he also announced that the dgb would not throw its weight behind any one party , an open break with the historically labor-friendly spd .

" it 's most important that the new administration can break down the country 's weaknesses and build up its strengths with courage , strength and speed , " thumann said .
polls reveal that a large majority of the people , 73 percent , are behind the dissolution , but it 's hard to say if they will turn out in droves to turn in their ballots .
an equally large number , 76 percent , believe nothing will change if a new coalition takes over .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de election 2005 -pipe- 22.07.2005 early elections prompt reserved optimism großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor gerhard schröder had one request and it was fulfilled with the green light given by german president horst köhler , most politicians and people expect to vote on september 18 .
germans hope the election will bring changes , but they are n't sure they will . the chips have fallen .
after almost three weeks of speculation , president horst köhler has met the request of chancellor gerhard schröder to hold elections 12 months ahead of schedule .
pointing to the chancellor 's lack of a stable majority within his coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens , köhler will give a new - or potentially the same - administration to take on what he called " immense tasks " in the country .
something that with few exceptions was welcomed by germans across the country .
politicians pleased for most part although parliament is in recess and most politicians are enjoying their vacations at home or even abroad , the importance of dissolution meant a return to berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president horst köhler coming from his home town hanover to speak , schröder called the confirmation of his request " correct and necessary " and wasted no time in announcing that he would run again as the spd candidate for chancellor .
reforms are imperative according to schröder .
" i am going to fight to do that , " he said .
the whole party leadership stood behind the chancellor but within the ranks , there were voices of dissent .
spd parliamentarian jelena hoffmann , along with her green colleague werner schulz , want to go to the country 's constitutional court to overturn köhler 's dissolution of the bundestag .
angela merkel 's christian democrats are rubbing their hands over the decision .
sitting on an almost 17 point lead in the opinion polls , a victory in less than two months is theirs for the taking .
merkel referred to the country 's five million unemployed , saying the country did n't " have to make do " with that .
" i am asking us to move forward together for a better germany , in which people can again seize their opportunities , " she said after köhler 's address .
labor unions and big business agree on something bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tendency of the german economy has been downwards compared to the rest of the world the weak economic situation has been an achilles ' heel for schröder .
big business complains of costs , particularly non-wage labor costs .
labor unions protest that the country 's big companies are making money hand over fist while leaving workers in the lurch .
they also must watch their influence erode within the spd , and germany in general .
yet on this issue , the two sides are in agreement .
german trade union federation -lrb- dgb -rrb- chair michael sommer commented that a phase of uncertainty and stagnation could be brought to an end .
" we finally need some decisive policies for more growth and employment , " sommer said .
he also announced that the dgb would not throw its weight behind any one party , an open break with the historically labor-friendly spd .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen thumann the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- , a body representing german companies , also did n't hesitate to express their sanguinity about the effect of early elections .
bdi president jürgen thumann -lrb- photo right -rrb- offered a chance for a new start and growth .
" it 's most important that the new administration can break down the country 's weaknesses and build up its strengths with courage , strength and speed , " thumann said .
polls reveal that a large majority of the people , 73 percent , are behind the dissolution , but it 's hard to say if they will turn out in droves to turn in their ballots .
an equally large number , 76 percent , believe nothing will change if a new coalition takes over .
yet the new " left party " may find willing voters .
peter jung , a works council chairman who says he has fought losing battle after losing battle to his firm 's management , said he will vote again for the first time in years - for oskar lafontaine .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : left party co-chair oskar lafontaine marches for social justice in germany " maybe people will get scared enough that certain things will get done differently , " he offered .
" how can things ever change if you 're not prepared to offer resistance ? "

pointing to the chancellor 's lack of a stable majority within his coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens , köhler will give a new - or potentially the same - administration to take on what he called " immense tasks " in the country .
something that with few exceptions was welcomed by germans across the country .
politicians pleased for most part although parliament is in recess and most politicians are enjoying their vacations at home or even abroad , the importance of dissolution meant a return to berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president horst köhler coming from his home town hanover to speak , schröder called the confirmation of his request " correct and necessary " and wasted no time in announcing that he would run again as the spd candidate for chancellor .
reforms are imperative according to schröder .
" i am going to fight to do that , " he said .
the whole party leadership stood behind the chancellor but within the ranks , there were voices of dissent .
spd parliamentarian jelena hoffmann , along with her green colleague werner schulz , want to go to the country 's constitutional court to overturn köhler 's dissolution of the bundestag .
angela merkel 's christian democrats are rubbing their hands over the decision .
sitting on an almost 17 point lead in the opinion polls , a victory in less than two months is theirs for the taking .
merkel referred to the country 's five million unemployed , saying the country did n't " have to make do " with that .
" i am asking us to move forward together for a better germany , in which people can again seize their opportunities , " she said after köhler 's address .
labor unions and big business agree on something bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tendency of the german economy has been downwards compared to the rest of the world the weak economic situation has been an achilles ' heel for schröder .
big business complains of costs , particularly non-wage labor costs .
labor unions protest that the country 's big companies are making money hand over fist while leaving workers in the lurch .
they also must watch their influence erode within the spd , and germany in general .
yet on this issue , the two sides are in agreement .
german trade union federation -lrb- dgb -rrb- chair michael sommer commented that a phase of uncertainty and stagnation could be brought to an end .
" we finally need some decisive policies for more growth and employment , " sommer said .
he also announced that the dgb would not throw its weight behind any one party , an open break with the historically labor-friendly spd .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen thumann the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- , a body representing german companies , also did n't hesitate to express their sanguinity about the effect of early elections .
bdi president jürgen thumann -lrb- photo right -rrb- offered a chance for a new start and growth .
" it 's most important that the new administration can break down the country 's weaknesses and build up its strengths with courage , strength and speed , " thumann said .
polls reveal that a large majority of the people , 73 percent , are behind the dissolution , but it 's hard to say if they will turn out in droves to turn in their ballots .
an equally large number , 76 percent , believe nothing will change if a new coalition takes over .
yet the new " left party " may find willing voters .
peter jung , a works council chairman who says he has fought losing battle after losing battle to his firm 's management , said he will vote again for the first time in years - for oskar lafontaine .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : left party co-chair oskar lafontaine marches for social justice in germany " maybe people will get scared enough that certain things will get done differently , " he offered .
" how can things ever change if you 're not prepared to offer resistance ? "
everybody now agrees that change is necessary and are putting their chips on early elections to bring it about . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the road to the chancellery this year is n't the first time germany has dealt with a vote of confidence , but there is still plenty of gray area when it comes to the legal issues surrounding 2005 's early elections .
köhler gives go ahead for early elections german president horst köhler told his compatriots on thursday that he would dissolve parliament and called for federal elections on september 18 .
-lrb- july 22 , 2005 -rrb- what next for schröder 's government ?
when the german parliament defeated the confidence vote brought by chancellor gerhard schröder on friday , it set in motion a procedure designed to end in a general election in the fall .

germans hope the election will bring changes , but they are n't sure they will . the chips have fallen .
after almost three weeks of speculation , president horst köhler has met the request of chancellor gerhard schröder to hold elections 12 months ahead of schedule .
pointing to the chancellor 's lack of a stable majority within his coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens , köhler will give a new - or potentially the same - administration to take on what he called " immense tasks " in the country .
something that with few exceptions was welcomed by germans across the country .
politicians pleased for most part although parliament is in recess and most politicians are enjoying their vacations at home or even abroad , the importance of dissolution meant a return to berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president horst köhler coming from his home town hanover to speak , schröder called the confirmation of his request " correct and necessary " and wasted no time in announcing that he would run again as the spd candidate for chancellor .
reforms are imperative according to schröder .
" i am going to fight to do that , " he said .
the whole party leadership stood behind the chancellor but within the ranks , there were voices of dissent .
spd parliamentarian jelena hoffmann , along with her green colleague werner schulz , want to go to the country 's constitutional court to overturn köhler 's dissolution of the bundestag .
angela merkel 's christian democrats are rubbing their hands over the decision .
sitting on an almost 17 point lead in the opinion polls , a victory in less than two months is theirs for the taking .
merkel referred to the country 's five million unemployed , saying the country did n't " have to make do " with that .
" i am asking us to move forward together for a better germany , in which people can again seize their opportunities , " she said after köhler 's address .
labor unions and big business agree on something bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tendency of the german economy has been downwards compared to the rest of the world the weak economic situation has been an achilles ' heel for schröder .
big business complains of costs , particularly non-wage labor costs .
labor unions protest that the country 's big companies are making money hand over fist while leaving workers in the lurch .
they also must watch their influence erode within the spd , and germany in general .
yet on this issue , the two sides are in agreement .
german trade union federation -lrb- dgb -rrb- chair michael sommer commented that a phase of uncertainty and stagnation could be brought to an end .
" we finally need some decisive policies for more growth and employment , " sommer said .
he also announced that the dgb would not throw its weight behind any one party , an open break with the historically labor-friendly spd .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen thumann the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- , a body representing german companies , also did n't hesitate to express their sanguinity about the effect of early elections .
bdi president jürgen thumann -lrb- photo right -rrb- offered a chance for a new start and growth .
" it 's most important that the new administration can break down the country 's weaknesses and build up its strengths with courage , strength and speed , " thumann said .
polls reveal that a large majority of the people , 73 percent , are behind the dissolution , but it 's hard to say if they will turn out in droves to turn in their ballots .
an equally large number , 76 percent , believe nothing will change if a new coalition takes over .
yet the new " left party " may find willing voters .
peter jung , a works council chairman who says he has fought losing battle after losing battle to his firm 's management , said he will vote again for the first time in years - for oskar lafontaine .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : left party co-chair oskar lafontaine marches for social justice in germany " maybe people will get scared enough that certain things will get done differently , " he offered .
" how can things ever change if you 're not prepared to offer resistance ? "

merkel referred to the country 's five million unemployed , saying the country did n't " have to make do " with that .
" i am asking us to move forward together for a better germany , in which people can again seize their opportunities , " she said after köhler 's address .

" it 's most important that the new administration can break down the country 's weaknesses and build up its strengths with courage , strength and speed , " thumann said .
polls reveal that a large majority of the people , 73 percent , are behind the dissolution , but it 's hard to say if they will turn out in droves to turn in their ballots .
an equally large number , 76 percent , believe nothing will change if a new coalition takes over .
yet the new " left party " may find willing voters .

they lashed out at the bombers and vowed to unite against terrorism . after thursday 's bomb attacks on london , in which one person was injured , tetchy relations with france were put to one side and the european commission vowed to press for anti-terrorism measures across the bloc . " this second attack unfortunately confirms that terrorism constitutes a permanent threat from which nobody is safe , " the european commission said in a statement .
" it is also vital to focus on measures which aim at preventing terrorism and particularly preventing young people from becoming radicalized . " the european union has a strategy to fight terrorism , it said .
" we need to implement this without any delay . "
french president jacques chirac , who had swept aside franco-british squabbles over the future of the european union to support blair after the deadly july 7 attacks on london , reiterated france 's solidarity with britain . " i wish to express to the british people and to prime minister tony blair the solidarity and support of france , and i want to reiterate our determination to fight terrorism together , " he said during an official visit in the madagascan capital antananarivo .

ahern said he had no doubt the british government would actively pursue those who carried out the attacks and bring them to justice . " those responsible should know that they will not deter the international community from combating terrorism vigorously and uncompromisingly wherever it occurs . " spain , where over 200 people were killed in terrorist bombings in madrid last year , announced it was reinforcing its border controls following the london attacks .
foreign minister abdullah gul of turkey , whose country has also been targeted in bomb attacks , said " we condemn terrorism wherever it strikes and whatever its goals are . "
similarities to earlier attacks thursday 's attacks appeared to mirror the bombings in the city two weeks earlier , though they seem to have been smaller .
three underground trains were targeted and one bus .
the blasts in the underground occurred almost simultaneously .
an hour later the driver of a double-decker bus heard a bang on the vehicle 's top deck , followed by smoke , and found some of the windows had been blown out . police said the attacks were meant to kill people , but they had gone awry . " clearly the intention must have been to kill .
you do n't do this with any other intention , " said police chief ian blair . " terrorist experts have said the loud , popping bangs heard by some witnesses indicated the bomb detonators might have gone off without triggering the main explosive blasts . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de more coordinated blasts shake london four bombs on london 's subways and a bus wounded at least one person thursday afternoon and sparked panic in london again as the city mourned the dozens that died after four bombs exploded two weeks ago .

" it is my duty as president to decide this issue according to the law , " he told the nation in a televised broadcast .
" i think it is best to have a new election to let the people decide . " the announcement came three weeks after schröder engineered his own defeat in a parliamentary confidence vote in order to call early elections and one day before the expiration of the 21-day deadline he is allowed under the constitution to make the decision .
his decision , one of the few real powers he has as ceremonial head of state , could be overturned by the constitutional court . a government spokesman confirmed schröder had cut short a holiday at his family home in the northern city of hanover to return to berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chancellor gambles his government schröder had told parliament ahead of the vote that he wanted new elections to show if the german people still backed a set of sometimes painful social welfare reforms . however , despite the go-ahead from köhler , the decision faces a challenge from two members of parliament , one from schröder 's own social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and another from the greens , the spd 's coalition partner . the spd has suffered from plummeting polls all over the country , but schröder 's decision was prompted by a crushing defeat to the conservative opposition in the country 's most populous state and one-time spd stronghold , north rhine-westphalia , in may . merkel takes lead opinion polls show schröder 's conservative challenger , angela merkel , has a strong chance of becoming germany 's first woman chancellor - the latest opinion poll gave her christian union bloc a clear lead of 17 percentage points . merkel is promising to slash germany 's unemployment figures , which topped five million this year , and inject new life into the euro-zone 's biggest , but stagnating , economy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's new chancellor ?
inevitably compared with margaret thatcher , merkel has said she has " great respect " for the economic policies of the iron lady although her own program is likely to be less controversial . merkel has unveiled plans to create jobs and raise the value-added tax , a form of sales tax common throughout the european union , to 18 percent from the current level of 16 percent . " if i do nothing , the current developments will continue and ... lead germany into a spiral of decline , " merkel said in an interview with the financial times deutschland newspaper published on thursday . merkel this week traveled to paris to meet french president jacques chirac and the man who hopes to succeed him , the current interior minister nicolas sarkozy . no backing from coalition since schröder lost the confidence vote , köhler asked him to provide more evidence of his claim that he no longer enjoys the backing of his coalition . the chancellor replied with a 200-page dossier which included dozens of newspaper articles describing infighting within the coalition of spd and greens and interviews with some of his most outspoken critics . the spd 's own ottmar schreiner , for example , repeatedly attacked the government 's labor market reform drive because it had led to cuts in benefit payments for the jobless . and mp jelena hoffmann , also spd , confirmed on thursday that she and green party parliamentarian werner schulz would challenge a decision to dissolve parliament in the country 's constitutional court because they wanted to serve their full terms which run until autumn 2006 . vote " faked " the opponents of the new elections argue that chancellor schröder 's vote of confidence was " faked " because the chancellor still had a majority in the parliament . the german constitution , which was adopted in 1949 , makes it deliberately difficult for early elections to be called , and only under extraordinary circumstances . one of the main goals of the 1949 constitution was to create conditions for political stability in the post-war period and prevent governments from rotating , the way they did in the 1920s and early 30s .

" it is my duty as president to decide this issue according to the law , " he told the nation in a televised broadcast .
" i think it is best to have a new election to let the people decide . " the announcement came three weeks after schröder engineered his own defeat in a parliamentary confidence vote in order to call early elections and one day before the expiration of the 21-day deadline he is allowed under the constitution to make the decision .
his decision , one of the few real powers he has as ceremonial head of state , could be overturned by the constitutional court . a government spokesman confirmed schröder had cut short a holiday at his family home in the northern city of hanover to return to berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chancellor gambles his government schröder had told parliament ahead of the vote that he wanted new elections to show if the german people still backed a set of sometimes painful social welfare reforms . however , despite the go-ahead from köhler , the decision faces a challenge from two members of parliament , one from schröder 's own social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and another from the greens , the spd 's coalition partner . the spd has suffered from plummeting polls all over the country , but schröder 's decision was prompted by a crushing defeat to the conservative opposition in the country 's most populous state and one-time spd stronghold , north rhine-westphalia , in may . merkel takes lead opinion polls show schröder 's conservative challenger , angela merkel , has a strong chance of becoming germany 's first woman chancellor - the latest opinion poll gave her christian union bloc a clear lead of 17 percentage points . merkel is promising to slash germany 's unemployment figures , which topped five million this year , and inject new life into the euro-zone 's biggest , but stagnating , economy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's new chancellor ?
inevitably compared with margaret thatcher , merkel has said she has " great respect " for the economic policies of the iron lady although her own program is likely to be less controversial . merkel has unveiled plans to create jobs and raise the value-added tax , a form of sales tax common throughout the european union , to 18 percent from the current level of 16 percent . " if i do nothing , the current developments will continue and ... lead germany into a spiral of decline , " merkel said in an interview with the financial times deutschland newspaper published on thursday . merkel this week traveled to paris to meet french president jacques chirac and the man who hopes to succeed him , the current interior minister nicolas sarkozy . no backing from coalition since schröder lost the confidence vote , köhler asked him to provide more evidence of his claim that he no longer enjoys the backing of his coalition . the chancellor replied with a 200-page dossier which included dozens of newspaper articles describing infighting within the coalition of spd and greens and interviews with some of his most outspoken critics . the spd 's own ottmar schreiner , for example , repeatedly attacked the government 's labor market reform drive because it had led to cuts in benefit payments for the jobless . and mp jelena hoffmann , also spd , confirmed on thursday that she and green party parliamentarian werner schulz would challenge a decision to dissolve parliament in the country 's constitutional court because they wanted to serve their full terms which run until autumn 2006 . vote " faked " the opponents of the new elections argue that chancellor schröder 's vote of confidence was " faked " because the chancellor still had a majority in the parliament . the german constitution , which was adopted in 1949 , makes it deliberately difficult for early elections to be called , and only under extraordinary circumstances . one of the main goals of the 1949 constitution was to create conditions for political stability in the post-war period and prevent governments from rotating , the way they did in the 1920s and early 30s .
it is widely believed that the political instability of the period of the weimer republic , when german had no less than 12 chancellors , led to the rise of adolf hitler . germans eager for early elections the country , however , is very much in favor of new elections .
according to a recent poll , 73 percent of the population believes the elections are necessary .
a full 83 percent of germans believe the new elections will bring a change of government , although 76 percent also believe that the new conservative government would not do a better job than the ruling coalition of social democrats and the green party . if elections go ahead , schröder faces another headache with the creation of a new left-wing alliance which risks drawing working-class support away from the social democrats . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de background : federal constitutional court germany 's high court is the authority on upholding the country 's constitution and ensuring it 's laws are adhered to .

germans hope the election will bring changes , but they are n't sure they will . the chips have fallen .
after almost three weeks of speculation , president horst köhler has met the request of chancellor gerhard schröder to hold elections 12 months ahead of schedule .
pointing to the chancellor 's lack of a stable majority within his coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens , köhler will give a new - or potentially the same - administration to take on what he called " immense tasks " in the country .
something that with few exceptions was welcomed by germans across the country .
politicians pleased for most part although parliament is in recess and most politicians are enjoying their vacations at home or even abroad , the importance of dissolution meant a return to berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president horst köhler coming from his home town hanover to speak , schröder called the confirmation of his request " correct and necessary " and wasted no time in announcing that he would run again as the spd candidate for chancellor .
reforms are imperative according to schröder .
" i am going to fight to do that , " he said .
the whole party leadership stood behind the chancellor but within the ranks , there were voices of dissent .
spd parliamentarian jelena hoffmann , along with her green colleague werner schulz , want to go to the country 's constitutional court to overturn köhler 's dissolution of the bundestag .
angela merkel 's christian democrats are rubbing their hands over the decision .
sitting on an almost 17 point lead in the opinion polls , a victory in less than two months is theirs for the taking .
merkel referred to the country 's five million unemployed , saying the country did n't " have to make do " with that .
" i am asking us to move forward together for a better germany , in which people can again seize their opportunities , " she said after köhler 's address .
labor unions and big business agree on something bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tendency of the german economy has been downwards compared to the rest of the world the weak economic situation has been an achilles ' heel for schröder .
big business complains of costs , particularly non-wage labor costs .
labor unions protest that the country 's big companies are making money hand over fist while leaving workers in the lurch .
they also must watch their influence erode within the spd , and germany in general .
yet on this issue , the two sides are in agreement .
german trade union federation -lrb- dgb -rrb- chair michael sommer commented that a phase of uncertainty and stagnation could be brought to an end .
" we finally need some decisive policies for more growth and employment , " sommer said .
he also announced that the dgb would not throw its weight behind any one party , an open break with the historically labor-friendly spd .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen thumann the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- , a body representing german companies , also did n't hesitate to express their sanguinity about the effect of early elections .
bdi president jürgen thumann -lrb- photo right -rrb- offered a chance for a new start and growth .
" it 's most important that the new administration can break down the country 's weaknesses and build up its strengths with courage , strength and speed , " thumann said .
polls reveal that a large majority of the people , 73 percent , are behind the dissolution , but it 's hard to say if they will turn out in droves to turn in their ballots .
an equally large number , 76 percent , believe nothing will change if a new coalition takes over .
yet the new " left party " may find willing voters .
peter jung , a works council chairman who says he has fought losing battle after losing battle to his firm 's management , said he will vote again for the first time in years - for oskar lafontaine .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : left party co-chair oskar lafontaine marches for social justice in germany " maybe people will get scared enough that certain things will get done differently , " he offered .
" how can things ever change if you 're not prepared to offer resistance ? "

köhler gives go ahead for early elections german president horst köhler told his compatriots on thursday that he would dissolve parliament and called for federal elections on september 18 .

germans hope the election will bring changes , but they are n't sure they will . the chips have fallen .
after almost three weeks of speculation , president horst köhler has met the request of chancellor gerhard schröder to hold elections 12 months ahead of schedule .
pointing to the chancellor 's lack of a stable majority within his coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens , köhler will give a new - or potentially the same - administration to take on what he called " immense tasks " in the country .
something that with few exceptions was welcomed by germans across the country .
politicians pleased for most part although parliament is in recess and most politicians are enjoying their vacations at home or even abroad , the importance of dissolution meant a return to berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president horst köhler coming from his home town hanover to speak , schröder called the confirmation of his request " correct and necessary " and wasted no time in announcing that he would run again as the spd candidate for chancellor .
reforms are imperative according to schröder .
" i am going to fight to do that , " he said .
the whole party leadership stood behind the chancellor but within the ranks , there were voices of dissent .
spd parliamentarian jelena hoffmann , along with her green colleague werner schulz , want to go to the country 's constitutional court to overturn köhler 's dissolution of the bundestag .
angela merkel 's christian democrats are rubbing their hands over the decision .
sitting on an almost 17 point lead in the opinion polls , a victory in less than two months is theirs for the taking .
merkel referred to the country 's five million unemployed , saying the country did n't " have to make do " with that .
" i am asking us to move forward together for a better germany , in which people can again seize their opportunities , " she said after köhler 's address .
labor unions and big business agree on something bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tendency of the german economy has been downwards compared to the rest of the world the weak economic situation has been an achilles ' heel for schröder .
big business complains of costs , particularly non-wage labor costs .
labor unions protest that the country 's big companies are making money hand over fist while leaving workers in the lurch .
they also must watch their influence erode within the spd , and germany in general .
yet on this issue , the two sides are in agreement .
german trade union federation -lrb- dgb -rrb- chair michael sommer commented that a phase of uncertainty and stagnation could be brought to an end .
" we finally need some decisive policies for more growth and employment , " sommer said .
he also announced that the dgb would not throw its weight behind any one party , an open break with the historically labor-friendly spd .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen thumann the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- , a body representing german companies , also did n't hesitate to express their sanguinity about the effect of early elections .
bdi president jürgen thumann -lrb- photo right -rrb- offered a chance for a new start and growth .
" it 's most important that the new administration can break down the country 's weaknesses and build up its strengths with courage , strength and speed , " thumann said .
polls reveal that a large majority of the people , 73 percent , are behind the dissolution , but it 's hard to say if they will turn out in droves to turn in their ballots .
an equally large number , 76 percent , believe nothing will change if a new coalition takes over .
yet the new " left party " may find willing voters .
peter jung , a works council chairman who says he has fought losing battle after losing battle to his firm 's management , said he will vote again for the first time in years - for oskar lafontaine .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : left party co-chair oskar lafontaine marches for social justice in germany " maybe people will get scared enough that certain things will get done differently , " he offered .
" how can things ever change if you 're not prepared to offer resistance ? "

the decision paves the way for early elections unless the federal constitutional court intervenes .
what could still happen ? why is the election date set for september 18 ?
german law states that elections must take at the latest 60 days after parliament was dissolved .
köhler waited to announce his decision until july 21 so that the poll could be held on september 18 which comes one week after the end of the summer school break for the states of bavaria and baden-württemberg .
it is tradition in germany not to hold an election during a school vacation .
could the elections still be prevented from taking place ?
yes , but only theoretically .
the bundestag parliamentarians werner schulz -lrb- greens -rrb- and jelena hoffmann -lrb- spd -rrb- , along with several smaller political parties , have announced they will appeal the dissolution to the federal constitutional court in karlsruhe .
they claim that chancellor gerhard schröder -lrb- spd -rrb- misused a vote of confidence so that early elections could be held .
according to them , early elections can only occur if the chancellor no longer can rely on his coalition to support him , something they say is not true , and hence , his call for a vote of confidence based on a lack of support was invalid .
how long could the constitutional court take to hand down a decision ?
in 1983 , when chancellor helmut kohl -lrb- cdu -rrb- held a vote of confidence , the judges on the country 's top court needed 28 days before handing down a decision .
it is possible to expedite the process .
for example , in june the judges took only ten days to demand a parliamentary commission inquiring into the " visa affair " continue .
does the 60-day deadline also apply to the constitutional court or can it take more time to make a decision ?
there is nothing that would prohibit the judges from taking more than 60 days .
if they feel that the matter is too complex , the september 18 election date could be postponed .
what would happen if the federal constitutional court ruled that köhler 's dissolution of parliament were unconstitutional ?
firstly , germans would be outraged .
if the judges in karlsruhe were to decide that schröder did misuse the vote of confidence , then they would also be denigrating köhler .
the administration in berlin would be unable to rule just as schröder had described it .
spd party chair , franz müntefering has repeated that there is no alternative plan .
he said that schröder would not resign from his post .
the consequence : bundestag president wolfgang thierse said the center-left coalition would be forced to continue their partnership .
schröder would remain at the helm which the public just would not understand .

they lashed out at the bombers and vowed to unite against terrorism . after thursday 's bomb attacks on london , in which one person was injured , tetchy relations with france were put to one side and the european commission vowed to press for anti-terrorism measures across the bloc . " this second attack unfortunately confirms that terrorism constitutes a permanent threat from which nobody is safe , " the european commission said in a statement .
" it is also vital to focus on measures which aim at preventing terrorism and particularly preventing young people from becoming radicalized . " the european union has a strategy to fight terrorism , it said .
" we need to implement this without any delay . "
french president jacques chirac , who had swept aside franco-british squabbles over the future of the european union to support blair after the deadly july 7 attacks on london , reiterated france 's solidarity with britain . " i wish to express to the british people and to prime minister tony blair the solidarity and support of france , and i want to reiterate our determination to fight terrorism together , " he said during an official visit in the madagascan capital antananarivo .

the decision paves the way for early elections unless the federal constitutional court intervenes .
what could still happen ? why is the election date set for september 18 ?
german law states that elections must take at the latest 60 days after parliament was dissolved .
köhler waited to announce his decision until july 21 so that the poll could be held on september 18 which comes one week after the end of the summer school break for the states of bavaria and baden-württemberg .
it is tradition in germany not to hold an election during a school vacation .
could the elections still be prevented from taking place ?
yes , but only theoretically .
the bundestag parliamentarians werner schulz -lrb- greens -rrb- and jelena hoffmann -lrb- spd -rrb- , along with several smaller political parties , have announced they will appeal the dissolution to the federal constitutional court in karlsruhe .
they claim that chancellor gerhard schröder -lrb- spd -rrb- misused a vote of confidence so that early elections could be held .
according to them , early elections can only occur if the chancellor no longer can rely on his coalition to support him , something they say is not true , and hence , his call for a vote of confidence based on a lack of support was invalid .
how long could the constitutional court take to hand down a decision ?
in 1983 , when chancellor helmut kohl -lrb- cdu -rrb- held a vote of confidence , the judges on the country 's top court needed 28 days before handing down a decision .
it is possible to expedite the process .
for example , in june the judges took only ten days to demand a parliamentary commission inquiring into the " visa affair " continue .
does the 60-day deadline also apply to the constitutional court or can it take more time to make a decision ?
there is nothing that would prohibit the judges from taking more than 60 days .
if they feel that the matter is too complex , the september 18 election date could be postponed .
what would happen if the federal constitutional court ruled that köhler 's dissolution of parliament were unconstitutional ?
firstly , germans would be outraged .
if the judges in karlsruhe were to decide that schröder did misuse the vote of confidence , then they would also be denigrating köhler .

he said that schröder would not resign from his post .

the decision paves the way for early elections unless the federal constitutional court intervenes .
what could still happen ? why is the election date set for september 18 ?
german law states that elections must take at the latest 60 days after parliament was dissolved .
köhler waited to announce his decision until july 21 so that the poll could be held on september 18 which comes one week after the end of the summer school break for the states of bavaria and baden-württemberg .
it is tradition in germany not to hold an election during a school vacation .
could the elections still be prevented from taking place ?
yes , but only theoretically .
the bundestag parliamentarians werner schulz -lrb- greens -rrb- and jelena hoffmann -lrb- spd -rrb- , along with several smaller political parties , have announced they will appeal the dissolution to the federal constitutional court in karlsruhe .
they claim that chancellor gerhard schröder -lrb- spd -rrb- misused a vote of confidence so that early elections could be held .
according to them , early elections can only occur if the chancellor no longer can rely on his coalition to support him , something they say is not true , and hence , his call for a vote of confidence based on a lack of support was invalid .
how long could the constitutional court take to hand down a decision ?
in 1983 , when chancellor helmut kohl -lrb- cdu -rrb- held a vote of confidence , the judges on the country 's top court needed 28 days before handing down a decision .
it is possible to expedite the process .
for example , in june the judges took only ten days to demand a parliamentary commission inquiring into the " visa affair " continue .
does the 60-day deadline also apply to the constitutional court or can it take more time to make a decision ?
there is nothing that would prohibit the judges from taking more than 60 days .
if they feel that the matter is too complex , the september 18 election date could be postponed .
what would happen if the federal constitutional court ruled that köhler 's dissolution of parliament were unconstitutional ?
firstly , germans would be outraged .
if the judges in karlsruhe were to decide that schröder did misuse the vote of confidence , then they would also be denigrating köhler .
the administration in berlin would be unable to rule just as schröder had described it .
spd party chair , franz müntefering has repeated that there is no alternative plan .
he said that schröder would not resign from his post .
the consequence : bundestag president wolfgang thierse said the center-left coalition would be forced to continue their partnership .
schröder would remain at the helm which the public just would not understand .
polls have found that three-quarters of the population would like to see early elections . steffen leidel -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de background : federal constitutional court germany 's high court is the authority on upholding the country 's constitution and ensuring it 's laws are adhered to .
that goes for the chancellor 's self-confidence vote and call for early elections this september .
the road to the chancellery this year is n't the first time germany has dealt with a vote of confidence , but there is still plenty of gray area when it comes to the legal issues surrounding 2005 's early elections .

" it is my duty as president to decide this issue according to the law , " he told the nation in a televised broadcast .
" i think it is best to have a new election to let the people decide . " the announcement came three weeks after schröder engineered his own defeat in a parliamentary confidence vote in order to call early elections and one day before the expiration of the 21-day deadline he is allowed under the constitution to make the decision .
his decision , one of the few real powers he has as ceremonial head of state , could be overturned by the constitutional court . a government spokesman confirmed schröder had cut short a holiday at his family home in the northern city of hanover to return to berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chancellor gambles his government schröder had told parliament ahead of the vote that he wanted new elections to show if the german people still backed a set of sometimes painful social welfare reforms . however , despite the go-ahead from köhler , the decision faces a challenge from two members of parliament , one from schröder 's own social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and another from the greens , the spd 's coalition partner . the spd has suffered from plummeting polls all over the country , but schröder 's decision was prompted by a crushing defeat to the conservative opposition in the country 's most populous state and one-time spd stronghold , north rhine-westphalia , in may . merkel takes lead opinion polls show schröder 's conservative challenger , angela merkel , has a strong chance of becoming germany 's first woman chancellor - the latest opinion poll gave her christian union bloc a clear lead of 17 percentage points . merkel is promising to slash germany 's unemployment figures , which topped five million this year , and inject new life into the euro-zone 's biggest , but stagnating , economy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's new chancellor ?
inevitably compared with margaret thatcher , merkel has said she has " great respect " for the economic policies of the iron lady although her own program is likely to be less controversial . merkel has unveiled plans to create jobs and raise the value-added tax , a form of sales tax common throughout the european union , to 18 percent from the current level of 16 percent . " if i do nothing , the current developments will continue and ... lead germany into a spiral of decline , " merkel said in an interview with the financial times deutschland newspaper published on thursday . merkel this week traveled to paris to meet french president jacques chirac and the man who hopes to succeed him , the current interior minister nicolas sarkozy . no backing from coalition since schröder lost the confidence vote , köhler asked him to provide more evidence of his claim that he no longer enjoys the backing of his coalition . the chancellor replied with a 200-page dossier which included dozens of newspaper articles describing infighting within the coalition of spd and greens and interviews with some of his most outspoken critics . the spd 's own ottmar schreiner , for example , repeatedly attacked the government 's labor market reform drive because it had led to cuts in benefit payments for the jobless . and mp jelena hoffmann , also spd , confirmed on thursday that she and green party parliamentarian werner schulz would challenge a decision to dissolve parliament in the country 's constitutional court because they wanted to serve their full terms which run until autumn 2006 . vote " faked " the opponents of the new elections argue that chancellor schröder 's vote of confidence was " faked " because the chancellor still had a majority in the parliament . the german constitution , which was adopted in 1949 , makes it deliberately difficult for early elections to be called , and only under extraordinary circumstances . one of the main goals of the 1949 constitution was to create conditions for political stability in the post-war period and prevent governments from rotating , the way they did in the 1920s and early 30s .
it is widely believed that the political instability of the period of the weimer republic , when german had no less than 12 chancellors , led to the rise of adolf hitler . germans eager for early elections the country , however , is very much in favor of new elections .
according to a recent poll , 73 percent of the population believes the elections are necessary .
a full 83 percent of germans believe the new elections will bring a change of government , although 76 percent also believe that the new conservative government would not do a better job than the ruling coalition of social democrats and the green party . if elections go ahead , schröder faces another headache with the creation of a new left-wing alliance which risks drawing working-class support away from the social democrats . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de background : federal constitutional court germany 's high court is the authority on upholding the country 's constitution and ensuring it 's laws are adhered to .

" it is my duty as president to decide this issue according to the law , " he told the nation in a televised broadcast .
" i think it is best to have a new election to let the people decide . " the announcement came three weeks after schröder engineered his own defeat in a parliamentary confidence vote in order to call early elections and one day before the expiration of the 21-day deadline he is allowed under the constitution to make the decision .
his decision , one of the few real powers he has as ceremonial head of state , could be overturned by the constitutional court . a government spokesman confirmed schröder had cut short a holiday at his family home in the northern city of hanover to return to berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chancellor gambles his government schröder had told parliament ahead of the vote that he wanted new elections to show if the german people still backed a set of sometimes painful social welfare reforms . however , despite the go-ahead from köhler , the decision faces a challenge from two members of parliament , one from schröder 's own social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and another from the greens , the spd 's coalition partner . the spd has suffered from plummeting polls all over the country , but schröder 's decision was prompted by a crushing defeat to the conservative opposition in the country 's most populous state and one-time spd stronghold , north rhine-westphalia , in may . merkel takes lead opinion polls show schröder 's conservative challenger , angela merkel , has a strong chance of becoming germany 's first woman chancellor - the latest opinion poll gave her christian union bloc a clear lead of 17 percentage points . merkel is promising to slash germany 's unemployment figures , which topped five million this year , and inject new life into the euro-zone 's biggest , but stagnating , economy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's new chancellor ?
inevitably compared with margaret thatcher , merkel has said she has " great respect " for the economic policies of the iron lady although her own program is likely to be less controversial . merkel has unveiled plans to create jobs and raise the value-added tax , a form of sales tax common throughout the european union , to 18 percent from the current level of 16 percent . " if i do nothing , the current developments will continue and ... lead germany into a spiral of decline , " merkel said in an interview with the financial times deutschland newspaper published on thursday . merkel this week traveled to paris to meet french president jacques chirac and the man who hopes to succeed him , the current interior minister nicolas sarkozy . no backing from coalition since schröder lost the confidence vote , köhler asked him to provide more evidence of his claim that he no longer enjoys the backing of his coalition . the chancellor replied with a 200-page dossier which included dozens of newspaper articles describing infighting within the coalition of spd and greens and interviews with some of his most outspoken critics . the spd 's own ottmar schreiner , for example , repeatedly attacked the government 's labor market reform drive because it had led to cuts in benefit payments for the jobless . and mp jelena hoffmann , also spd , confirmed on thursday that she and green party parliamentarian werner schulz would challenge a decision to dissolve parliament in the country 's constitutional court because they wanted to serve their full terms which run until autumn 2006 . vote " faked " the opponents of the new elections argue that chancellor schröder 's vote of confidence was " faked " because the chancellor still had a majority in the parliament . the german constitution , which was adopted in 1949 , makes it deliberately difficult for early elections to be called , and only under extraordinary circumstances . one of the main goals of the 1949 constitution was to create conditions for political stability in the post-war period and prevent governments from rotating , the way they did in the 1920s and early 30s .
it is widely believed that the political instability of the period of the weimer republic , when german had no less than 12 chancellors , led to the rise of adolf hitler . germans eager for early elections the country , however , is very much in favor of new elections .
according to a recent poll , 73 percent of the population believes the elections are necessary .
a full 83 percent of germans believe the new elections will bring a change of government , although 76 percent also believe that the new conservative government would not do a better job than the ruling coalition of social democrats and the green party . if elections go ahead , schröder faces another headache with the creation of a new left-wing alliance which risks drawing working-class support away from the social democrats . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de background : federal constitutional court germany 's high court is the authority on upholding the country 's constitution and ensuring it 's laws are adhered to .

early german elections in legal limbo despite president köhler 's announcement , the country 's supreme court could still put an end to early elections in september .

according to eyewitnesses , the man either fell or was pushed to the floor a train car where he shot him to death . police said the shooting was " directly linked " to the investigations of the bomb attacks on london 's transit system .
reports suggest that the suspect was apparently about to board a train at stockwell tube station in south london when armed officers shouted a warning to passengers before opening fire . metropolitan police officers are allegedly under ' shoot to kill ' orders when confronting suspected suicide bombers who are thought to be on the verge of detonating . it is still not clear whether the man killed by police at stockwell station was suspected of involvement in the failed bomb attacks or had been mistaken for someone else . a spokesman for london 's metropolitain police told reuters : " the gentleman shot at stockwell today has yet to be identified so it would be impossible to link him to anything at this stage . " chaos in station passengers reported the man - described as south asian - was boarding the train when police ordered the doors to be closed . witnesses said police chased the man before shooting him .
" they pushed him onto the floor and unloaded five shots into him .
he 's dead , " witness mark whitby told the bbc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police stand outside stockwell station , in london , friday july 22 , 2005 .
" we were on the tube and then we suddenly heard someone say ' get out , get out ' and then we heard gunshots , " said passenger briony coetsee .
alistair drummond , of the london ambulance service , said paramedics had been called to the station at 10:10 utc to remove the suspect 's body . before getting to the train , the man apparently vaulted over barriers while being chased by the armed police who it is alleged had been trailing him since receiving a tip-off that he was involved in thursday 's attacks . witnesses gave sketchy details of the man who some said was of south asian appearance .
the man raised suspicion by wearing a winter coat in the heat of summer .
most witnesses said he wore a backpack - reminding many of images of the four suicide bombers behind the july 7 attacks . arrest made , images released later on friday , two man were arrested in connection with thursday 's explosions .
both are said to be nabbed near stockwell station , where the man had been shot earlier . a spokeswoman for london 's metropolitan police said the first arrest occurred during a search of an address in the stockwell area . the second was confirmed by a police spokeswoman to reuters .
details were n't available . " officers attended an address in connection with the ongoing investigation " into attacks staged on thursday on london underground trains and a bus .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : picture released friday july 22 , 2005 , by scotland yard of one of four men who police wish to question in connection with the four suspected suicide attacks on three tube trains and a bus thursday in london .
this image was taken by a cctv camera at warren street - one of the three tube stations involved .
police issued on friday closed circuit television images of four men they want to question over the attempted bomb attacks on three tube trains and a bus in london on thursday .
police commissioner andy hayman said anyone who knew who or where the men were should contact police .
the bombers fled after detonators went off that failed to ignite explosives .
continued climate of fear hanging over capital whereas commuters were largely defiant after the first attacks that killed 56 people , they betrayed traces of nervousness after thursday 's failed attacks on three underground subway trains and a double-decker bus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a morning commuter reads the morning headlines onboard the underground after thursday 's bomb attacks plunged the tube networks into chaos in london , friday july 22 , 2005 .
investigators searched friday for fingerprints , dna and other forensic evidence collected from attacks on three subway trains and a double-decker bus that were hauntingly reminiscent of suicide bombings two weeks ago .
the new reports of further police action regarding possible terrorist activities will do nothing to ease the atmosphere of fear in the english capital . " yes , i 'm afraid .
i always take the tube -lrb- subway -rrb- to go to work but now i feel more confident with the bus , " said ehelena osaki , 24 , told afp in the city financial district .
" the bus also is worrying me a bit but you 've got to get to work , no ?
i 'm too young to die . " commuters faced disruption on the sections of london 's transport network , with two underground lines closed and three running a restricted service .
several stations on other lines were also shut down . up on street level , buses were running a full service , but diversions were in place near two of the four sites of thursday 's incidents . commuters taking alternative transport david roberts , 29 , who rode a bicycle to work , said that two incidents in as many weeks were " putting fears into people 's minds .
i would n't go in the underground with my two children .
i would fear too much for their safety . " matthew kube , 26 , who lives in southwest london , said he was using overground suburban trains for most of his journey to work , rather than his usual underground line .
" i 'm a little bit upset , " he said at blackfriars station .
" it 's the first day i feel a bit worried and i chose to take the overground train despite the tube from wimbledon .
i may avoid the tube as much as possible , but i 'm not sure yet . " luna martello , 28 , said she still rides double-decker buses , but avoids the back of the upper deck because that is where one of the july 7 bombs , at tavistock square in bloomsbury , central london , went off .

" it is also vital to focus on measures which aim at preventing terrorism and particularly preventing young people from becoming radicalized . " the european union has a strategy to fight terrorism , it said .
" we need to implement this without any delay . "

" those responsible should know that they will not deter the international community from combating terrorism vigorously and uncompromisingly wherever it occurs . " spain , where over 200 people were killed in terrorist bombings in madrid last year , announced it was reinforcing its border controls following the london attacks .
foreign minister abdullah gul of turkey , whose country has also been targeted in bomb attacks , said " we condemn terrorism wherever it strikes and whatever its goals are . "
similarities to earlier attacks thursday 's attacks appeared to mirror the bombings in the city two weeks earlier , though they seem to have been smaller .
three underground trains were targeted and one bus .
the blasts in the underground occurred almost simultaneously .
an hour later the driver of a double-decker bus heard a bang on the vehicle 's top deck , followed by smoke , and found some of the windows had been blown out . police said the attacks were meant to kill people , but they had gone awry . " clearly the intention must have been to kill .

" it is my duty as president to decide this issue according to the law , " he told the nation in a televised broadcast .
" i think it is best to have a new election to let the people decide . " the announcement came three weeks after schröder engineered his own defeat in a parliamentary confidence vote in order to call early elections and one day before the expiration of the 21-day deadline he is allowed under the constitution to make the decision .
his decision , one of the few real powers he has as ceremonial head of state , could be overturned by the constitutional court . a government spokesman confirmed schröder had cut short a holiday at his family home in the northern city of hanover to return to berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chancellor gambles his government schröder had told parliament ahead of the vote that he wanted new elections to show if the german people still backed a set of sometimes painful social welfare reforms . however , despite the go-ahead from köhler , the decision faces a challenge from two members of parliament , one from schröder 's own social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and another from the greens , the spd 's coalition partner . the spd has suffered from plummeting polls all over the country , but schröder 's decision was prompted by a crushing defeat to the conservative opposition in the country 's most populous state and one-time spd stronghold , north rhine-westphalia , in may . merkel takes lead opinion polls show schröder 's conservative challenger , angela merkel , has a strong chance of becoming germany 's first woman chancellor - the latest opinion poll gave her christian union bloc a clear lead of 17 percentage points . merkel is promising to slash germany 's unemployment figures , which topped five million this year , and inject new life into the euro-zone 's biggest , but stagnating , economy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's new chancellor ?
inevitably compared with margaret thatcher , merkel has said she has " great respect " for the economic policies of the iron lady although her own program is likely to be less controversial . merkel has unveiled plans to create jobs and raise the value-added tax , a form of sales tax common throughout the european union , to 18 percent from the current level of 16 percent . " if i do nothing , the current developments will continue and ... lead germany into a spiral of decline , " merkel said in an interview with the financial times deutschland newspaper published on thursday . merkel this week traveled to paris to meet french president jacques chirac and the man who hopes to succeed him , the current interior minister nicolas sarkozy . no backing from coalition since schröder lost the confidence vote , köhler asked him to provide more evidence of his claim that he no longer enjoys the backing of his coalition . the chancellor replied with a 200-page dossier which included dozens of newspaper articles describing infighting within the coalition of spd and greens and interviews with some of his most outspoken critics . the spd 's own ottmar schreiner , for example , repeatedly attacked the government 's labor market reform drive because it had led to cuts in benefit payments for the jobless . and mp jelena hoffmann , also spd , confirmed on thursday that she and green party parliamentarian werner schulz would challenge a decision to dissolve parliament in the country 's constitutional court because they wanted to serve their full terms which run until autumn 2006 . vote " faked " the opponents of the new elections argue that chancellor schröder 's vote of confidence was " faked " because the chancellor still had a majority in the parliament . the german constitution , which was adopted in 1949 , makes it deliberately difficult for early elections to be called , and only under extraordinary circumstances . one of the main goals of the 1949 constitution was to create conditions for political stability in the post-war period and prevent governments from rotating , the way they did in the 1920s and early 30s .
it is widely believed that the political instability of the period of the weimer republic , when german had no less than 12 chancellors , led to the rise of adolf hitler . germans eager for early elections the country , however , is very much in favor of new elections .
according to a recent poll , 73 percent of the population believes the elections are necessary .
a full 83 percent of germans believe the new elections will bring a change of government , although 76 percent also believe that the new conservative government would not do a better job than the ruling coalition of social democrats and the green party . if elections go ahead , schröder faces another headache with the creation of a new left-wing alliance which risks drawing working-class support away from the social democrats . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de background : federal constitutional court germany 's high court is the authority on upholding the country 's constitution and ensuring it 's laws are adhered to .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de election 2005 -pipe- 22.07.2005 early elections prompt reserved optimism großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor gerhard schröder had one request and it was fulfilled with the green light given by german president horst köhler , most politicians and people expect to vote on september 18 .
germans hope the election will bring changes , but they are n't sure they will . the chips have fallen .
after almost three weeks of speculation , president horst köhler has met the request of chancellor gerhard schröder to hold elections 12 months ahead of schedule .
pointing to the chancellor 's lack of a stable majority within his coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens , köhler will give a new - or potentially the same - administration to take on what he called " immense tasks " in the country .
something that with few exceptions was welcomed by germans across the country .
politicians pleased for most part although parliament is in recess and most politicians are enjoying their vacations at home or even abroad , the importance of dissolution meant a return to berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president horst köhler coming from his home town hanover to speak , schröder called the confirmation of his request " correct and necessary " and wasted no time in announcing that he would run again as the spd candidate for chancellor .
reforms are imperative according to schröder .
" i am going to fight to do that , " he said .
the whole party leadership stood behind the chancellor but within the ranks , there were voices of dissent .
spd parliamentarian jelena hoffmann , along with her green colleague werner schulz , want to go to the country 's constitutional court to overturn köhler 's dissolution of the bundestag .
angela merkel 's christian democrats are rubbing their hands over the decision .
sitting on an almost 17 point lead in the opinion polls , a victory in less than two months is theirs for the taking .
merkel referred to the country 's five million unemployed , saying the country did n't " have to make do " with that .
" i am asking us to move forward together for a better germany , in which people can again seize their opportunities , " she said after köhler 's address .
labor unions and big business agree on something bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tendency of the german economy has been downwards compared to the rest of the world the weak economic situation has been an achilles ' heel for schröder .
big business complains of costs , particularly non-wage labor costs .
labor unions protest that the country 's big companies are making money hand over fist while leaving workers in the lurch .
they also must watch their influence erode within the spd , and germany in general .
yet on this issue , the two sides are in agreement .
german trade union federation -lrb- dgb -rrb- chair michael sommer commented that a phase of uncertainty and stagnation could be brought to an end .
" we finally need some decisive policies for more growth and employment , " sommer said .
he also announced that the dgb would not throw its weight behind any one party , an open break with the historically labor-friendly spd .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen thumann the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- , a body representing german companies , also did n't hesitate to express their sanguinity about the effect of early elections .
bdi president jürgen thumann -lrb- photo right -rrb- offered a chance for a new start and growth .
" it 's most important that the new administration can break down the country 's weaknesses and build up its strengths with courage , strength and speed , " thumann said .
polls reveal that a large majority of the people , 73 percent , are behind the dissolution , but it 's hard to say if they will turn out in droves to turn in their ballots .
an equally large number , 76 percent , believe nothing will change if a new coalition takes over .
yet the new " left party " may find willing voters .
peter jung , a works council chairman who says he has fought losing battle after losing battle to his firm 's management , said he will vote again for the first time in years - for oskar lafontaine .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : left party co-chair oskar lafontaine marches for social justice in germany " maybe people will get scared enough that certain things will get done differently , " he offered .
" how can things ever change if you 're not prepared to offer resistance ? "
everybody now agrees that change is necessary and are putting their chips on early elections to bring it about . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the road to the chancellery this year is n't the first time germany has dealt with a vote of confidence , but there is still plenty of gray area when it comes to the legal issues surrounding 2005 's early elections .

-lrb- july 22 , 2005 -rrb- what next for schröder 's government ?
when the german parliament defeated the confidence vote brought by chancellor gerhard schröder on friday , it set in motion a procedure designed to end in a general election in the fall .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de election 2005 -pipe- 22.07.2005 german elections : what happens now ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the judges in karlsruhe will be coming back from vacation soon german president horst köhler has dissolved the german bundestag parliament .
the decision paves the way for early elections unless the federal constitutional court intervenes .
what could still happen ? why is the election date set for september 18 ?
german law states that elections must take at the latest 60 days after parliament was dissolved .
köhler waited to announce his decision until july 21 so that the poll could be held on september 18 which comes one week after the end of the summer school break for the states of bavaria and baden-württemberg .
it is tradition in germany not to hold an election during a school vacation .
could the elections still be prevented from taking place ?
yes , but only theoretically .
the bundestag parliamentarians werner schulz -lrb- greens -rrb- and jelena hoffmann -lrb- spd -rrb- , along with several smaller political parties , have announced they will appeal the dissolution to the federal constitutional court in karlsruhe .
they claim that chancellor gerhard schröder -lrb- spd -rrb- misused a vote of confidence so that early elections could be held .
according to them , early elections can only occur if the chancellor no longer can rely on his coalition to support him , something they say is not true , and hence , his call for a vote of confidence based on a lack of support was invalid .
how long could the constitutional court take to hand down a decision ?
in 1983 , when chancellor helmut kohl -lrb- cdu -rrb- held a vote of confidence , the judges on the country 's top court needed 28 days before handing down a decision .
it is possible to expedite the process .
for example , in june the judges took only ten days to demand a parliamentary commission inquiring into the " visa affair " continue .
does the 60-day deadline also apply to the constitutional court or can it take more time to make a decision ?
there is nothing that would prohibit the judges from taking more than 60 days .
if they feel that the matter is too complex , the september 18 election date could be postponed .
what would happen if the federal constitutional court ruled that köhler 's dissolution of parliament were unconstitutional ?
firstly , germans would be outraged .
if the judges in karlsruhe were to decide that schröder did misuse the vote of confidence , then they would also be denigrating köhler .
the administration in berlin would be unable to rule just as schröder had described it .
spd party chair , franz müntefering has repeated that there is no alternative plan .
he said that schröder would not resign from his post .
the consequence : bundestag president wolfgang thierse said the center-left coalition would be forced to continue their partnership .
schröder would remain at the helm which the public just would not understand .
polls have found that three-quarters of the population would like to see early elections . steffen leidel -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de background : federal constitutional court germany 's high court is the authority on upholding the country 's constitution and ensuring it 's laws are adhered to .
that goes for the chancellor 's self-confidence vote and call for early elections this september .
the road to the chancellery this year is n't the first time germany has dealt with a vote of confidence , but there is still plenty of gray area when it comes to the legal issues surrounding 2005 's early elections .

the decision paves the way for early elections unless the federal constitutional court intervenes .
what could still happen ? why is the election date set for september 18 ?
german law states that elections must take at the latest 60 days after parliament was dissolved .
köhler waited to announce his decision until july 21 so that the poll could be held on september 18 which comes one week after the end of the summer school break for the states of bavaria and baden-württemberg .
it is tradition in germany not to hold an election during a school vacation .
could the elections still be prevented from taking place ?
yes , but only theoretically .
the bundestag parliamentarians werner schulz -lrb- greens -rrb- and jelena hoffmann -lrb- spd -rrb- , along with several smaller political parties , have announced they will appeal the dissolution to the federal constitutional court in karlsruhe .
they claim that chancellor gerhard schröder -lrb- spd -rrb- misused a vote of confidence so that early elections could be held .
according to them , early elections can only occur if the chancellor no longer can rely on his coalition to support him , something they say is not true , and hence , his call for a vote of confidence based on a lack of support was invalid .

germans hope the election will bring changes , but they are n't sure they will . the chips have fallen .
after almost three weeks of speculation , president horst köhler has met the request of chancellor gerhard schröder to hold elections 12 months ahead of schedule .
pointing to the chancellor 's lack of a stable majority within his coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens , köhler will give a new - or potentially the same - administration to take on what he called " immense tasks " in the country .

reforms are imperative according to schröder .
" i am going to fight to do that , " he said .
the whole party leadership stood behind the chancellor but within the ranks , there were voices of dissent .

angela merkel 's christian democrats are rubbing their hands over the decision .

" it 's most important that the new administration can break down the country 's weaknesses and build up its strengths with courage , strength and speed , " thumann said .

after almost three weeks of speculation , president horst köhler has met the request of chancellor gerhard schröder to hold elections 12 months ahead of schedule .
pointing to the chancellor 's lack of a stable majority within his coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens , köhler will give a new - or potentially the same - administration to take on what he called " immense tasks " in the country .
something that with few exceptions was welcomed by germans across the country .

merkel referred to the country 's five million unemployed , saying the country did n't " have to make do " with that .
" i am asking us to move forward together for a better germany , in which people can again seize their opportunities , " she said after köhler 's address .

" it is my duty as president to decide this issue according to the law , " he told the nation in a televised broadcast .
" i think it is best to have a new election to let the people decide . " the announcement came three weeks after schröder engineered his own defeat in a parliamentary confidence vote in order to call early elections and one day before the expiration of the 21-day deadline he is allowed under the constitution to make the decision .
his decision , one of the few real powers he has as ceremonial head of state , could be overturned by the constitutional court . a government spokesman confirmed schröder had cut short a holiday at his family home in the northern city of hanover to return to berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chancellor gambles his government schröder had told parliament ahead of the vote that he wanted new elections to show if the german people still backed a set of sometimes painful social welfare reforms . however , despite the go-ahead from köhler , the decision faces a challenge from two members of parliament , one from schröder 's own social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and another from the greens , the spd 's coalition partner . the spd has suffered from plummeting polls all over the country , but schröder 's decision was prompted by a crushing defeat to the conservative opposition in the country 's most populous state and one-time spd stronghold , north rhine-westphalia , in may . merkel takes lead opinion polls show schröder 's conservative challenger , angela merkel , has a strong chance of becoming germany 's first woman chancellor - the latest opinion poll gave her christian union bloc a clear lead of 17 percentage points . merkel is promising to slash germany 's unemployment figures , which topped five million this year , and inject new life into the euro-zone 's biggest , but stagnating , economy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's new chancellor ?
inevitably compared with margaret thatcher , merkel has said she has " great respect " for the economic policies of the iron lady although her own program is likely to be less controversial . merkel has unveiled plans to create jobs and raise the value-added tax , a form of sales tax common throughout the european union , to 18 percent from the current level of 16 percent . " if i do nothing , the current developments will continue and ... lead germany into a spiral of decline , " merkel said in an interview with the financial times deutschland newspaper published on thursday . merkel this week traveled to paris to meet french president jacques chirac and the man who hopes to succeed him , the current interior minister nicolas sarkozy . no backing from coalition since schröder lost the confidence vote , köhler asked him to provide more evidence of his claim that he no longer enjoys the backing of his coalition . the chancellor replied with a 200-page dossier which included dozens of newspaper articles describing infighting within the coalition of spd and greens and interviews with some of his most outspoken critics . the spd 's own ottmar schreiner , for example , repeatedly attacked the government 's labor market reform drive because it had led to cuts in benefit payments for the jobless . and mp jelena hoffmann , also spd , confirmed on thursday that she and green party parliamentarian werner schulz would challenge a decision to dissolve parliament in the country 's constitutional court because they wanted to serve their full terms which run until autumn 2006 . vote " faked " the opponents of the new elections argue that chancellor schröder 's vote of confidence was " faked " because the chancellor still had a majority in the parliament . the german constitution , which was adopted in 1949 , makes it deliberately difficult for early elections to be called , and only under extraordinary circumstances . one of the main goals of the 1949 constitution was to create conditions for political stability in the post-war period and prevent governments from rotating , the way they did in the 1920s and early 30s .
it is widely believed that the political instability of the period of the weimer republic , when german had no less than 12 chancellors , led to the rise of adolf hitler . germans eager for early elections the country , however , is very much in favor of new elections .
according to a recent poll , 73 percent of the population believes the elections are necessary .
a full 83 percent of germans believe the new elections will bring a change of government , although 76 percent also believe that the new conservative government would not do a better job than the ruling coalition of social democrats and the green party . if elections go ahead , schröder faces another headache with the creation of a new left-wing alliance which risks drawing working-class support away from the social democrats . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de background : federal constitutional court germany 's high court is the authority on upholding the country 's constitution and ensuring it 's laws are adhered to .

according to eyewitnesses , the man either fell or was pushed to the floor a train car where he shot him to death . police said the shooting was " directly linked " to the investigations of the bomb attacks on london 's transit system .
reports suggest that the suspect was apparently about to board a train at stockwell tube station in south london when armed officers shouted a warning to passengers before opening fire . metropolitan police officers are allegedly under ' shoot to kill ' orders when confronting suspected suicide bombers who are thought to be on the verge of detonating . it is still not clear whether the man killed by police at stockwell station was suspected of involvement in the failed bomb attacks or had been mistaken for someone else . a spokesman for london 's metropolitain police told reuters : " the gentleman shot at stockwell today has yet to be identified so it would be impossible to link him to anything at this stage . " chaos in station passengers reported the man - described as south asian - was boarding the train when police ordered the doors to be closed . witnesses said police chased the man before shooting him .
" they pushed him onto the floor and unloaded five shots into him .
he 's dead , " witness mark whitby told the bbc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police stand outside stockwell station , in london , friday july 22 , 2005 .
" we were on the tube and then we suddenly heard someone say ' get out , get out ' and then we heard gunshots , " said passenger briony coetsee .
alistair drummond , of the london ambulance service , said paramedics had been called to the station at 10:10 utc to remove the suspect 's body . before getting to the train , the man apparently vaulted over barriers while being chased by the armed police who it is alleged had been trailing him since receiving a tip-off that he was involved in thursday 's attacks . witnesses gave sketchy details of the man who some said was of south asian appearance .
the man raised suspicion by wearing a winter coat in the heat of summer .
most witnesses said he wore a backpack - reminding many of images of the four suicide bombers behind the july 7 attacks . arrest made , images released later on friday , two man were arrested in connection with thursday 's explosions .
both are said to be nabbed near stockwell station , where the man had been shot earlier . a spokeswoman for london 's metropolitan police said the first arrest occurred during a search of an address in the stockwell area . the second was confirmed by a police spokeswoman to reuters .
details were n't available . " officers attended an address in connection with the ongoing investigation " into attacks staged on thursday on london underground trains and a bus .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : picture released friday july 22 , 2005 , by scotland yard of one of four men who police wish to question in connection with the four suspected suicide attacks on three tube trains and a bus thursday in london .
this image was taken by a cctv camera at warren street - one of the three tube stations involved .
police issued on friday closed circuit television images of four men they want to question over the attempted bomb attacks on three tube trains and a bus in london on thursday .
police commissioner andy hayman said anyone who knew who or where the men were should contact police .
the bombers fled after detonators went off that failed to ignite explosives .
continued climate of fear hanging over capital whereas commuters were largely defiant after the first attacks that killed 56 people , they betrayed traces of nervousness after thursday 's failed attacks on three underground subway trains and a double-decker bus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a morning commuter reads the morning headlines onboard the underground after thursday 's bomb attacks plunged the tube networks into chaos in london , friday july 22 , 2005 .
investigators searched friday for fingerprints , dna and other forensic evidence collected from attacks on three subway trains and a double-decker bus that were hauntingly reminiscent of suicide bombings two weeks ago .
the new reports of further police action regarding possible terrorist activities will do nothing to ease the atmosphere of fear in the english capital . " yes , i 'm afraid .
i always take the tube -lrb- subway -rrb- to go to work but now i feel more confident with the bus , " said ehelena osaki , 24 , told afp in the city financial district .
" the bus also is worrying me a bit but you 've got to get to work , no ?
i 'm too young to die . " commuters faced disruption on the sections of london 's transport network , with two underground lines closed and three running a restricted service .
several stations on other lines were also shut down . up on street level , buses were running a full service , but diversions were in place near two of the four sites of thursday 's incidents . commuters taking alternative transport david roberts , 29 , who rode a bicycle to work , said that two incidents in as many weeks were " putting fears into people 's minds .
i would n't go in the underground with my two children .
i would fear too much for their safety . " matthew kube , 26 , who lives in southwest london , said he was using overground suburban trains for most of his journey to work , rather than his usual underground line .
" i 'm a little bit upset , " he said at blackfriars station .
" it 's the first day i feel a bit worried and i chose to take the overground train despite the tube from wimbledon .
i may avoid the tube as much as possible , but i 'm not sure yet . " luna martello , 28 , said she still rides double-decker buses , but avoids the back of the upper deck because that is where one of the july 7 bombs , at tavistock square in bloomsbury , central london , went off .

they lashed out at the bombers and vowed to unite against terrorism . after thursday 's bomb attacks on london , in which one person was injured , tetchy relations with france were put to one side and the european commission vowed to press for anti-terrorism measures across the bloc . " this second attack unfortunately confirms that terrorism constitutes a permanent threat from which nobody is safe , " the european commission said in a statement .
" it is also vital to focus on measures which aim at preventing terrorism and particularly preventing young people from becoming radicalized . " the european union has a strategy to fight terrorism , it said .
" we need to implement this without any delay . "
french president jacques chirac , who had swept aside franco-british squabbles over the future of the european union to support blair after the deadly july 7 attacks on london , reiterated france 's solidarity with britain . " i wish to express to the british people and to prime minister tony blair the solidarity and support of france , and i want to reiterate our determination to fight terrorism together , " he said during an official visit in the madagascan capital antananarivo .

ahern said he had no doubt the british government would actively pursue those who carried out the attacks and bring them to justice . " those responsible should know that they will not deter the international community from combating terrorism vigorously and uncompromisingly wherever it occurs . " spain , where over 200 people were killed in terrorist bombings in madrid last year , announced it was reinforcing its border controls following the london attacks .
foreign minister abdullah gul of turkey , whose country has also been targeted in bomb attacks , said " we condemn terrorism wherever it strikes and whatever its goals are . "
similarities to earlier attacks thursday 's attacks appeared to mirror the bombings in the city two weeks earlier , though they seem to have been smaller .
three underground trains were targeted and one bus .
the blasts in the underground occurred almost simultaneously .
an hour later the driver of a double-decker bus heard a bang on the vehicle 's top deck , followed by smoke , and found some of the windows had been blown out . police said the attacks were meant to kill people , but they had gone awry . " clearly the intention must have been to kill .
you do n't do this with any other intention , " said police chief ian blair .

the decision paves the way for early elections unless the federal constitutional court intervenes .
what could still happen ? why is the election date set for september 18 ?
german law states that elections must take at the latest 60 days after parliament was dissolved .
köhler waited to announce his decision until july 21 so that the poll could be held on september 18 which comes one week after the end of the summer school break for the states of bavaria and baden-württemberg .
it is tradition in germany not to hold an election during a school vacation .
could the elections still be prevented from taking place ?
yes , but only theoretically .
the bundestag parliamentarians werner schulz -lrb- greens -rrb- and jelena hoffmann -lrb- spd -rrb- , along with several smaller political parties , have announced they will appeal the dissolution to the federal constitutional court in karlsruhe .
they claim that chancellor gerhard schröder -lrb- spd -rrb- misused a vote of confidence so that early elections could be held .
according to them , early elections can only occur if the chancellor no longer can rely on his coalition to support him , something they say is not true , and hence , his call for a vote of confidence based on a lack of support was invalid .
how long could the constitutional court take to hand down a decision ?
in 1983 , when chancellor helmut kohl -lrb- cdu -rrb- held a vote of confidence , the judges on the country 's top court needed 28 days before handing down a decision .
it is possible to expedite the process .
for example , in june the judges took only ten days to demand a parliamentary commission inquiring into the " visa affair " continue .
does the 60-day deadline also apply to the constitutional court or can it take more time to make a decision ?
there is nothing that would prohibit the judges from taking more than 60 days .
if they feel that the matter is too complex , the september 18 election date could be postponed .
what would happen if the federal constitutional court ruled that köhler 's dissolution of parliament were unconstitutional ?
firstly , germans would be outraged .
if the judges in karlsruhe were to decide that schröder did misuse the vote of confidence , then they would also be denigrating köhler .
the administration in berlin would be unable to rule just as schröder had described it .
spd party chair , franz müntefering has repeated that there is no alternative plan .
he said that schröder would not resign from his post .
the consequence : bundestag president wolfgang thierse said the center-left coalition would be forced to continue their partnership .
schröder would remain at the helm which the public just would not understand .
polls have found that three-quarters of the population would like to see early elections . steffen leidel -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de background : federal constitutional court germany 's high court is the authority on upholding the country 's constitution and ensuring it 's laws are adhered to .
that goes for the chancellor 's self-confidence vote and call for early elections this september .

" it is my duty as president to decide this issue according to the law , " he told the nation in a televised broadcast .
" i think it is best to have a new election to let the people decide . " the announcement came three weeks after schröder engineered his own defeat in a parliamentary confidence vote in order to call early elections and one day before the expiration of the 21-day deadline he is allowed under the constitution to make the decision .
his decision , one of the few real powers he has as ceremonial head of state , could be overturned by the constitutional court . a government spokesman confirmed schröder had cut short a holiday at his family home in the northern city of hanover to return to berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chancellor gambles his government schröder had told parliament ahead of the vote that he wanted new elections to show if the german people still backed a set of sometimes painful social welfare reforms . however , despite the go-ahead from köhler , the decision faces a challenge from two members of parliament , one from schröder 's own social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and another from the greens , the spd 's coalition partner . the spd has suffered from plummeting polls all over the country , but schröder 's decision was prompted by a crushing defeat to the conservative opposition in the country 's most populous state and one-time spd stronghold , north rhine-westphalia , in may . merkel takes lead opinion polls show schröder 's conservative challenger , angela merkel , has a strong chance of becoming germany 's first woman chancellor - the latest opinion poll gave her christian union bloc a clear lead of 17 percentage points . merkel is promising to slash germany 's unemployment figures , which topped five million this year , and inject new life into the euro-zone 's biggest , but stagnating , economy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's new chancellor ?
inevitably compared with margaret thatcher , merkel has said she has " great respect " for the economic policies of the iron lady although her own program is likely to be less controversial . merkel has unveiled plans to create jobs and raise the value-added tax , a form of sales tax common throughout the european union , to 18 percent from the current level of 16 percent . " if i do nothing , the current developments will continue and ... lead germany into a spiral of decline , " merkel said in an interview with the financial times deutschland newspaper published on thursday . merkel this week traveled to paris to meet french president jacques chirac and the man who hopes to succeed him , the current interior minister nicolas sarkozy . no backing from coalition since schröder lost the confidence vote , köhler asked him to provide more evidence of his claim that he no longer enjoys the backing of his coalition . the chancellor replied with a 200-page dossier which included dozens of newspaper articles describing infighting within the coalition of spd and greens and interviews with some of his most outspoken critics . the spd 's own ottmar schreiner , for example , repeatedly attacked the government 's labor market reform drive because it had led to cuts in benefit payments for the jobless . and mp jelena hoffmann , also spd , confirmed on thursday that she and green party parliamentarian werner schulz would challenge a decision to dissolve parliament in the country 's constitutional court because they wanted to serve their full terms which run until autumn 2006 . vote " faked " the opponents of the new elections argue that chancellor schröder 's vote of confidence was " faked " because the chancellor still had a majority in the parliament . the german constitution , which was adopted in 1949 , makes it deliberately difficult for early elections to be called , and only under extraordinary circumstances . one of the main goals of the 1949 constitution was to create conditions for political stability in the post-war period and prevent governments from rotating , the way they did in the 1920s and early 30s .
it is widely believed that the political instability of the period of the weimer republic , when german had no less than 12 chancellors , led to the rise of adolf hitler . germans eager for early elections the country , however , is very much in favor of new elections .
according to a recent poll , 73 percent of the population believes the elections are necessary .
a full 83 percent of germans believe the new elections will bring a change of government , although 76 percent also believe that the new conservative government would not do a better job than the ruling coalition of social democrats and the green party . if elections go ahead , schröder faces another headache with the creation of a new left-wing alliance which risks drawing working-class support away from the social democrats . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de background : federal constitutional court germany 's high court is the authority on upholding the country 's constitution and ensuring it 's laws are adhered to .

they lashed out at the bombers and vowed to unite against terrorism . after thursday 's bomb attacks on london , in which one person was injured , tetchy relations with france were put to one side and the european commission vowed to press for anti-terrorism measures across the bloc . " this second attack unfortunately confirms that terrorism constitutes a permanent threat from which nobody is safe , " the european commission said in a statement .
" it is also vital to focus on measures which aim at preventing terrorism and particularly preventing young people from becoming radicalized . " the european union has a strategy to fight terrorism , it said .
" we need to implement this without any delay . "
french president jacques chirac , who had swept aside franco-british squabbles over the future of the european union to support blair after the deadly july 7 attacks on london , reiterated france 's solidarity with britain . " i wish to express to the british people and to prime minister tony blair the solidarity and support of france , and i want to reiterate our determination to fight terrorism together , " he said during an official visit in the madagascan capital antananarivo .
increased vigilance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police and emergency services outside oval tube station on thursday other countries railed against the attackers . irish foreign minister dermot ahern condemned the attempt to " strike fear and terror " into the community .
ahern said he had no doubt the british government would actively pursue those who carried out the attacks and bring them to justice . " those responsible should know that they will not deter the international community from combating terrorism vigorously and uncompromisingly wherever it occurs . " spain , where over 200 people were killed in terrorist bombings in madrid last year , announced it was reinforcing its border controls following the london attacks .
foreign minister abdullah gul of turkey , whose country has also been targeted in bomb attacks , said " we condemn terrorism wherever it strikes and whatever its goals are . "
similarities to earlier attacks thursday 's attacks appeared to mirror the bombings in the city two weeks earlier , though they seem to have been smaller .
three underground trains were targeted and one bus .
the blasts in the underground occurred almost simultaneously .
an hour later the driver of a double-decker bus heard a bang on the vehicle 's top deck , followed by smoke , and found some of the windows had been blown out . police said the attacks were meant to kill people , but they had gone awry . " clearly the intention must have been to kill .
you do n't do this with any other intention , " said police chief ian blair . " terrorist experts have said the loud , popping bangs heard by some witnesses indicated the bomb detonators might have gone off without triggering the main explosive blasts . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de more coordinated blasts shake london four bombs on london 's subways and a bus wounded at least one person thursday afternoon and sparked panic in london again as the city mourned the dozens that died after four bombs exploded two weeks ago .

according to eyewitnesses , the man either fell or was pushed to the floor a train car where he shot him to death . police said the shooting was " directly linked " to the investigations of the bomb attacks on london 's transit system .
reports suggest that the suspect was apparently about to board a train at stockwell tube station in south london when armed officers shouted a warning to passengers before opening fire . metropolitan police officers are allegedly under ' shoot to kill ' orders when confronting suspected suicide bombers who are thought to be on the verge of detonating . it is still not clear whether the man killed by police at stockwell station was suspected of involvement in the failed bomb attacks or had been mistaken for someone else . a spokesman for london 's metropolitain police told reuters : " the gentleman shot at stockwell today has yet to be identified so it would be impossible to link him to anything at this stage . " chaos in station passengers reported the man - described as south asian - was boarding the train when police ordered the doors to be closed . witnesses said police chased the man before shooting him .
" they pushed him onto the floor and unloaded five shots into him .

germans hope the election will bring changes , but they are n't sure they will . the chips have fallen .
after almost three weeks of speculation , president horst köhler has met the request of chancellor gerhard schröder to hold elections 12 months ahead of schedule .
pointing to the chancellor 's lack of a stable majority within his coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens , köhler will give a new - or potentially the same - administration to take on what he called " immense tasks " in the country .
something that with few exceptions was welcomed by germans across the country .
politicians pleased for most part although parliament is in recess and most politicians are enjoying their vacations at home or even abroad , the importance of dissolution meant a return to berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president horst köhler coming from his home town hanover to speak , schröder called the confirmation of his request " correct and necessary " and wasted no time in announcing that he would run again as the spd candidate for chancellor .
reforms are imperative according to schröder .
" i am going to fight to do that , " he said .
the whole party leadership stood behind the chancellor but within the ranks , there were voices of dissent .
spd parliamentarian jelena hoffmann , along with her green colleague werner schulz , want to go to the country 's constitutional court to overturn köhler 's dissolution of the bundestag .
angela merkel 's christian democrats are rubbing their hands over the decision .
sitting on an almost 17 point lead in the opinion polls , a victory in less than two months is theirs for the taking .
merkel referred to the country 's five million unemployed , saying the country did n't " have to make do " with that .
" i am asking us to move forward together for a better germany , in which people can again seize their opportunities , " she said after köhler 's address .
labor unions and big business agree on something bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tendency of the german economy has been downwards compared to the rest of the world the weak economic situation has been an achilles ' heel for schröder .
big business complains of costs , particularly non-wage labor costs .
labor unions protest that the country 's big companies are making money hand over fist while leaving workers in the lurch .
they also must watch their influence erode within the spd , and germany in general .
yet on this issue , the two sides are in agreement .
german trade union federation -lrb- dgb -rrb- chair michael sommer commented that a phase of uncertainty and stagnation could be brought to an end .
" we finally need some decisive policies for more growth and employment , " sommer said .
he also announced that the dgb would not throw its weight behind any one party , an open break with the historically labor-friendly spd .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen thumann the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- , a body representing german companies , also did n't hesitate to express their sanguinity about the effect of early elections .
bdi president jürgen thumann -lrb- photo right -rrb- offered a chance for a new start and growth .
" it 's most important that the new administration can break down the country 's weaknesses and build up its strengths with courage , strength and speed , " thumann said .
polls reveal that a large majority of the people , 73 percent , are behind the dissolution , but it 's hard to say if they will turn out in droves to turn in their ballots .
an equally large number , 76 percent , believe nothing will change if a new coalition takes over .
yet the new " left party " may find willing voters .
peter jung , a works council chairman who says he has fought losing battle after losing battle to his firm 's management , said he will vote again for the first time in years - for oskar lafontaine .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : left party co-chair oskar lafontaine marches for social justice in germany " maybe people will get scared enough that certain things will get done differently , " he offered .
" how can things ever change if you 're not prepared to offer resistance ? "
everybody now agrees that change is necessary and are putting their chips on early elections to bring it about . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the road to the chancellery this year is n't the first time germany has dealt with a vote of confidence , but there is still plenty of gray area when it comes to the legal issues surrounding 2005 's early elections .
köhler gives go ahead for early elections german president horst köhler told his compatriots on thursday that he would dissolve parliament and called for federal elections on september 18 .
-lrb- july 22 , 2005 -rrb- what next for schröder 's government ?

according to eyewitnesses , the man either fell or was pushed to the floor a train car where he shot him to death . police said the shooting was " directly linked " to the investigations of the bomb attacks on london 's transit system .
reports suggest that the suspect was apparently about to board a train at stockwell tube station in south london when armed officers shouted a warning to passengers before opening fire . metropolitan police officers are allegedly under ' shoot to kill ' orders when confronting suspected suicide bombers who are thought to be on the verge of detonating . it is still not clear whether the man killed by police at stockwell station was suspected of involvement in the failed bomb attacks or had been mistaken for someone else . a spokesman for london 's metropolitain police told reuters : " the gentleman shot at stockwell today has yet to be identified so it would be impossible to link him to anything at this stage . " chaos in station passengers reported the man - described as south asian - was boarding the train when police ordered the doors to be closed . witnesses said police chased the man before shooting him .
" they pushed him onto the floor and unloaded five shots into him .
he 's dead , " witness mark whitby told the bbc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police stand outside stockwell station , in london , friday july 22 , 2005 .
" we were on the tube and then we suddenly heard someone say ' get out , get out ' and then we heard gunshots , " said passenger briony coetsee .
alistair drummond , of the london ambulance service , said paramedics had been called to the station at 10:10 utc to remove the suspect 's body . before getting to the train , the man apparently vaulted over barriers while being chased by the armed police who it is alleged had been trailing him since receiving a tip-off that he was involved in thursday 's attacks . witnesses gave sketchy details of the man who some said was of south asian appearance .
the man raised suspicion by wearing a winter coat in the heat of summer .
most witnesses said he wore a backpack - reminding many of images of the four suicide bombers behind the july 7 attacks . arrest made , images released later on friday , two man were arrested in connection with thursday 's explosions .
both are said to be nabbed near stockwell station , where the man had been shot earlier . a spokeswoman for london 's metropolitan police said the first arrest occurred during a search of an address in the stockwell area . the second was confirmed by a police spokeswoman to reuters .
details were n't available . " officers attended an address in connection with the ongoing investigation " into attacks staged on thursday on london underground trains and a bus .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : picture released friday july 22 , 2005 , by scotland yard of one of four men who police wish to question in connection with the four suspected suicide attacks on three tube trains and a bus thursday in london .
this image was taken by a cctv camera at warren street - one of the three tube stations involved .
police issued on friday closed circuit television images of four men they want to question over the attempted bomb attacks on three tube trains and a bus in london on thursday .
police commissioner andy hayman said anyone who knew who or where the men were should contact police .
the bombers fled after detonators went off that failed to ignite explosives .
continued climate of fear hanging over capital whereas commuters were largely defiant after the first attacks that killed 56 people , they betrayed traces of nervousness after thursday 's failed attacks on three underground subway trains and a double-decker bus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a morning commuter reads the morning headlines onboard the underground after thursday 's bomb attacks plunged the tube networks into chaos in london , friday july 22 , 2005 .
investigators searched friday for fingerprints , dna and other forensic evidence collected from attacks on three subway trains and a double-decker bus that were hauntingly reminiscent of suicide bombings two weeks ago .
the new reports of further police action regarding possible terrorist activities will do nothing to ease the atmosphere of fear in the english capital . " yes , i 'm afraid .
i always take the tube -lrb- subway -rrb- to go to work but now i feel more confident with the bus , " said ehelena osaki , 24 , told afp in the city financial district .
" the bus also is worrying me a bit but you 've got to get to work , no ?
i 'm too young to die . " commuters faced disruption on the sections of london 's transport network , with two underground lines closed and three running a restricted service .
several stations on other lines were also shut down . up on street level , buses were running a full service , but diversions were in place near two of the four sites of thursday 's incidents . commuters taking alternative transport david roberts , 29 , who rode a bicycle to work , said that two incidents in as many weeks were " putting fears into people 's minds .
i would n't go in the underground with my two children .
i would fear too much for their safety . " matthew kube , 26 , who lives in southwest london , said he was using overground suburban trains for most of his journey to work , rather than his usual underground line .
" i 'm a little bit upset , " he said at blackfriars station .
" it 's the first day i feel a bit worried and i chose to take the overground train despite the tube from wimbledon .
i may avoid the tube as much as possible , but i 'm not sure yet . " luna martello , 28 , said she still rides double-decker buses , but avoids the back of the upper deck because that is where one of the july 7 bombs , at tavistock square in bloomsbury , central london , went off .

they lashed out at the bombers and vowed to unite against terrorism . after thursday 's bomb attacks on london , in which one person was injured , tetchy relations with france were put to one side and the european commission vowed to press for anti-terrorism measures across the bloc . " this second attack unfortunately confirms that terrorism constitutes a permanent threat from which nobody is safe , " the european commission said in a statement .
" it is also vital to focus on measures which aim at preventing terrorism and particularly preventing young people from becoming radicalized . " the european union has a strategy to fight terrorism , it said .
" we need to implement this without any delay . "
french president jacques chirac , who had swept aside franco-british squabbles over the future of the european union to support blair after the deadly july 7 attacks on london , reiterated france 's solidarity with britain . " i wish to express to the british people and to prime minister tony blair the solidarity and support of france , and i want to reiterate our determination to fight terrorism together , " he said during an official visit in the madagascan capital antananarivo .

ahern said he had no doubt the british government would actively pursue those who carried out the attacks and bring them to justice . " those responsible should know that they will not deter the international community from combating terrorism vigorously and uncompromisingly wherever it occurs . " spain , where over 200 people were killed in terrorist bombings in madrid last year , announced it was reinforcing its border controls following the london attacks .
foreign minister abdullah gul of turkey , whose country has also been targeted in bomb attacks , said " we condemn terrorism wherever it strikes and whatever its goals are . "
similarities to earlier attacks thursday 's attacks appeared to mirror the bombings in the city two weeks earlier , though they seem to have been smaller .
three underground trains were targeted and one bus .
the blasts in the underground occurred almost simultaneously .
an hour later the driver of a double-decker bus heard a bang on the vehicle 's top deck , followed by smoke , and found some of the windows had been blown out . police said the attacks were meant to kill people , but they had gone awry . " clearly the intention must have been to kill .
you do n't do this with any other intention , " said police chief ian blair .

the decision paves the way for early elections unless the federal constitutional court intervenes .
what could still happen ? why is the election date set for september 18 ?
german law states that elections must take at the latest 60 days after parliament was dissolved .
köhler waited to announce his decision until july 21 so that the poll could be held on september 18 which comes one week after the end of the summer school break for the states of bavaria and baden-württemberg .
it is tradition in germany not to hold an election during a school vacation .
could the elections still be prevented from taking place ?
yes , but only theoretically .
the bundestag parliamentarians werner schulz -lrb- greens -rrb- and jelena hoffmann -lrb- spd -rrb- , along with several smaller political parties , have announced they will appeal the dissolution to the federal constitutional court in karlsruhe .
they claim that chancellor gerhard schröder -lrb- spd -rrb- misused a vote of confidence so that early elections could be held .
according to them , early elections can only occur if the chancellor no longer can rely on his coalition to support him , something they say is not true , and hence , his call for a vote of confidence based on a lack of support was invalid .
how long could the constitutional court take to hand down a decision ?
in 1983 , when chancellor helmut kohl -lrb- cdu -rrb- held a vote of confidence , the judges on the country 's top court needed 28 days before handing down a decision .
it is possible to expedite the process .
for example , in june the judges took only ten days to demand a parliamentary commission inquiring into the " visa affair " continue .
does the 60-day deadline also apply to the constitutional court or can it take more time to make a decision ?
there is nothing that would prohibit the judges from taking more than 60 days .
if they feel that the matter is too complex , the september 18 election date could be postponed .
what would happen if the federal constitutional court ruled that köhler 's dissolution of parliament were unconstitutional ?
firstly , germans would be outraged .
if the judges in karlsruhe were to decide that schröder did misuse the vote of confidence , then they would also be denigrating köhler .
the administration in berlin would be unable to rule just as schröder had described it .
spd party chair , franz müntefering has repeated that there is no alternative plan .
he said that schröder would not resign from his post .
the consequence : bundestag president wolfgang thierse said the center-left coalition would be forced to continue their partnership .
schröder would remain at the helm which the public just would not understand .
polls have found that three-quarters of the population would like to see early elections . steffen leidel -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de background : federal constitutional court germany 's high court is the authority on upholding the country 's constitution and ensuring it 's laws are adhered to .

germans hope the election will bring changes , but they are n't sure they will . the chips have fallen .
after almost three weeks of speculation , president horst köhler has met the request of chancellor gerhard schröder to hold elections 12 months ahead of schedule .
pointing to the chancellor 's lack of a stable majority within his coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens , köhler will give a new - or potentially the same - administration to take on what he called " immense tasks " in the country .
something that with few exceptions was welcomed by germans across the country .
politicians pleased for most part although parliament is in recess and most politicians are enjoying their vacations at home or even abroad , the importance of dissolution meant a return to berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president horst köhler coming from his home town hanover to speak , schröder called the confirmation of his request " correct and necessary " and wasted no time in announcing that he would run again as the spd candidate for chancellor .
reforms are imperative according to schröder .
" i am going to fight to do that , " he said .
the whole party leadership stood behind the chancellor but within the ranks , there were voices of dissent .
spd parliamentarian jelena hoffmann , along with her green colleague werner schulz , want to go to the country 's constitutional court to overturn köhler 's dissolution of the bundestag .
angela merkel 's christian democrats are rubbing their hands over the decision .
sitting on an almost 17 point lead in the opinion polls , a victory in less than two months is theirs for the taking .
merkel referred to the country 's five million unemployed , saying the country did n't " have to make do " with that .
" i am asking us to move forward together for a better germany , in which people can again seize their opportunities , " she said after köhler 's address .
labor unions and big business agree on something bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tendency of the german economy has been downwards compared to the rest of the world the weak economic situation has been an achilles ' heel for schröder .
big business complains of costs , particularly non-wage labor costs .
labor unions protest that the country 's big companies are making money hand over fist while leaving workers in the lurch .
they also must watch their influence erode within the spd , and germany in general .
yet on this issue , the two sides are in agreement .
german trade union federation -lrb- dgb -rrb- chair michael sommer commented that a phase of uncertainty and stagnation could be brought to an end .
" we finally need some decisive policies for more growth and employment , " sommer said .
he also announced that the dgb would not throw its weight behind any one party , an open break with the historically labor-friendly spd .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen thumann the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- , a body representing german companies , also did n't hesitate to express their sanguinity about the effect of early elections .
bdi president jürgen thumann -lrb- photo right -rrb- offered a chance for a new start and growth .
" it 's most important that the new administration can break down the country 's weaknesses and build up its strengths with courage , strength and speed , " thumann said .
polls reveal that a large majority of the people , 73 percent , are behind the dissolution , but it 's hard to say if they will turn out in droves to turn in their ballots .

germans hope the election will bring changes , but they are n't sure they will . the chips have fallen .
after almost three weeks of speculation , president horst köhler has met the request of chancellor gerhard schröder to hold elections 12 months ahead of schedule .
pointing to the chancellor 's lack of a stable majority within his coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens , köhler will give a new - or potentially the same - administration to take on what he called " immense tasks " in the country .
something that with few exceptions was welcomed by germans across the country .
politicians pleased for most part although parliament is in recess and most politicians are enjoying their vacations at home or even abroad , the importance of dissolution meant a return to berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president horst köhler coming from his home town hanover to speak , schröder called the confirmation of his request " correct and necessary " and wasted no time in announcing that he would run again as the spd candidate for chancellor .
reforms are imperative according to schröder .
" i am going to fight to do that , " he said .
the whole party leadership stood behind the chancellor but within the ranks , there were voices of dissent .
spd parliamentarian jelena hoffmann , along with her green colleague werner schulz , want to go to the country 's constitutional court to overturn köhler 's dissolution of the bundestag .
angela merkel 's christian democrats are rubbing their hands over the decision .
sitting on an almost 17 point lead in the opinion polls , a victory in less than two months is theirs for the taking .
merkel referred to the country 's five million unemployed , saying the country did n't " have to make do " with that .
" i am asking us to move forward together for a better germany , in which people can again seize their opportunities , " she said after köhler 's address .
labor unions and big business agree on something bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tendency of the german economy has been downwards compared to the rest of the world the weak economic situation has been an achilles ' heel for schröder .
big business complains of costs , particularly non-wage labor costs .
labor unions protest that the country 's big companies are making money hand over fist while leaving workers in the lurch .
they also must watch their influence erode within the spd , and germany in general .
yet on this issue , the two sides are in agreement .
german trade union federation -lrb- dgb -rrb- chair michael sommer commented that a phase of uncertainty and stagnation could be brought to an end .
" we finally need some decisive policies for more growth and employment , " sommer said .
he also announced that the dgb would not throw its weight behind any one party , an open break with the historically labor-friendly spd .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen thumann the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- , a body representing german companies , also did n't hesitate to express their sanguinity about the effect of early elections .
bdi president jürgen thumann -lrb- photo right -rrb- offered a chance for a new start and growth .
" it 's most important that the new administration can break down the country 's weaknesses and build up its strengths with courage , strength and speed , " thumann said .
polls reveal that a large majority of the people , 73 percent , are behind the dissolution , but it 's hard to say if they will turn out in droves to turn in their ballots .

germans hope the election will bring changes , but they are n't sure they will . the chips have fallen .
after almost three weeks of speculation , president horst köhler has met the request of chancellor gerhard schröder to hold elections 12 months ahead of schedule .
pointing to the chancellor 's lack of a stable majority within his coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens , köhler will give a new - or potentially the same - administration to take on what he called " immense tasks " in the country .
something that with few exceptions was welcomed by germans across the country .
politicians pleased for most part although parliament is in recess and most politicians are enjoying their vacations at home or even abroad , the importance of dissolution meant a return to berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president horst köhler coming from his home town hanover to speak , schröder called the confirmation of his request " correct and necessary " and wasted no time in announcing that he would run again as the spd candidate for chancellor .
reforms are imperative according to schröder .
" i am going to fight to do that , " he said .
the whole party leadership stood behind the chancellor but within the ranks , there were voices of dissent .
spd parliamentarian jelena hoffmann , along with her green colleague werner schulz , want to go to the country 's constitutional court to overturn köhler 's dissolution of the bundestag .
angela merkel 's christian democrats are rubbing their hands over the decision .
sitting on an almost 17 point lead in the opinion polls , a victory in less than two months is theirs for the taking .
merkel referred to the country 's five million unemployed , saying the country did n't " have to make do " with that .
" i am asking us to move forward together for a better germany , in which people can again seize their opportunities , " she said after köhler 's address .
labor unions and big business agree on something bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tendency of the german economy has been downwards compared to the rest of the world the weak economic situation has been an achilles ' heel for schröder .
big business complains of costs , particularly non-wage labor costs .
labor unions protest that the country 's big companies are making money hand over fist while leaving workers in the lurch .
they also must watch their influence erode within the spd , and germany in general .
yet on this issue , the two sides are in agreement .
german trade union federation -lrb- dgb -rrb- chair michael sommer commented that a phase of uncertainty and stagnation could be brought to an end .
" we finally need some decisive policies for more growth and employment , " sommer said .
he also announced that the dgb would not throw its weight behind any one party , an open break with the historically labor-friendly spd .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen thumann the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- , a body representing german companies , also did n't hesitate to express their sanguinity about the effect of early elections .
bdi president jürgen thumann -lrb- photo right -rrb- offered a chance for a new start and growth .
" it 's most important that the new administration can break down the country 's weaknesses and build up its strengths with courage , strength and speed , " thumann said .
polls reveal that a large majority of the people , 73 percent , are behind the dissolution , but it 's hard to say if they will turn out in droves to turn in their ballots .
an equally large number , 76 percent , believe nothing will change if a new coalition takes over .
yet the new " left party " may find willing voters .
peter jung , a works council chairman who says he has fought losing battle after losing battle to his firm 's management , said he will vote again for the first time in years - for oskar lafontaine .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : left party co-chair oskar lafontaine marches for social justice in germany " maybe people will get scared enough that certain things will get done differently , " he offered .

" it is my duty as president to decide this issue according to the law , " he told the nation in a televised broadcast .
" i think it is best to have a new election to let the people decide . " the announcement came three weeks after schröder engineered his own defeat in a parliamentary confidence vote in order to call early elections and one day before the expiration of the 21-day deadline he is allowed under the constitution to make the decision .
his decision , one of the few real powers he has as ceremonial head of state , could be overturned by the constitutional court . a government spokesman confirmed schröder had cut short a holiday at his family home in the northern city of hanover to return to berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chancellor gambles his government schröder had told parliament ahead of the vote that he wanted new elections to show if the german people still backed a set of sometimes painful social welfare reforms . however , despite the go-ahead from köhler , the decision faces a challenge from two members of parliament , one from schröder 's own social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and another from the greens , the spd 's coalition partner . the spd has suffered from plummeting polls all over the country , but schröder 's decision was prompted by a crushing defeat to the conservative opposition in the country 's most populous state and one-time spd stronghold , north rhine-westphalia , in may . merkel takes lead opinion polls show schröder 's conservative challenger , angela merkel , has a strong chance of becoming germany 's first woman chancellor - the latest opinion poll gave her christian union bloc a clear lead of 17 percentage points . merkel is promising to slash germany 's unemployment figures , which topped five million this year , and inject new life into the euro-zone 's biggest , but stagnating , economy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's new chancellor ?
inevitably compared with margaret thatcher , merkel has said she has " great respect " for the economic policies of the iron lady although her own program is likely to be less controversial . merkel has unveiled plans to create jobs and raise the value-added tax , a form of sales tax common throughout the european union , to 18 percent from the current level of 16 percent . " if i do nothing , the current developments will continue and ... lead germany into a spiral of decline , " merkel said in an interview with the financial times deutschland newspaper published on thursday . merkel this week traveled to paris to meet french president jacques chirac and the man who hopes to succeed him , the current interior minister nicolas sarkozy . no backing from coalition since schröder lost the confidence vote , köhler asked him to provide more evidence of his claim that he no longer enjoys the backing of his coalition . the chancellor replied with a 200-page dossier which included dozens of newspaper articles describing infighting within the coalition of spd and greens and interviews with some of his most outspoken critics . the spd 's own ottmar schreiner , for example , repeatedly attacked the government 's labor market reform drive because it had led to cuts in benefit payments for the jobless . and mp jelena hoffmann , also spd , confirmed on thursday that she and green party parliamentarian werner schulz would challenge a decision to dissolve parliament in the country 's constitutional court because they wanted to serve their full terms which run until autumn 2006 . vote " faked " the opponents of the new elections argue that chancellor schröder 's vote of confidence was " faked " because the chancellor still had a majority in the parliament . the german constitution , which was adopted in 1949 , makes it deliberately difficult for early elections to be called , and only under extraordinary circumstances . one of the main goals of the 1949 constitution was to create conditions for political stability in the post-war period and prevent governments from rotating , the way they did in the 1920s and early 30s .
it is widely believed that the political instability of the period of the weimer republic , when german had no less than 12 chancellors , led to the rise of adolf hitler . germans eager for early elections the country , however , is very much in favor of new elections .
according to a recent poll , 73 percent of the population believes the elections are necessary .
a full 83 percent of germans believe the new elections will bring a change of government , although 76 percent also believe that the new conservative government would not do a better job than the ruling coalition of social democrats and the green party . if elections go ahead , schröder faces another headache with the creation of a new left-wing alliance which risks drawing working-class support away from the social democrats . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de background : federal constitutional court germany 's high court is the authority on upholding the country 's constitution and ensuring it 's laws are adhered to .

the decision paves the way for early elections unless the federal constitutional court intervenes .
what could still happen ? why is the election date set for september 18 ?
german law states that elections must take at the latest 60 days after parliament was dissolved .
köhler waited to announce his decision until july 21 so that the poll could be held on september 18 which comes one week after the end of the summer school break for the states of bavaria and baden-württemberg .
it is tradition in germany not to hold an election during a school vacation .
could the elections still be prevented from taking place ?
yes , but only theoretically .
the bundestag parliamentarians werner schulz -lrb- greens -rrb- and jelena hoffmann -lrb- spd -rrb- , along with several smaller political parties , have announced they will appeal the dissolution to the federal constitutional court in karlsruhe .
they claim that chancellor gerhard schröder -lrb- spd -rrb- misused a vote of confidence so that early elections could be held .
according to them , early elections can only occur if the chancellor no longer can rely on his coalition to support him , something they say is not true , and hence , his call for a vote of confidence based on a lack of support was invalid .
how long could the constitutional court take to hand down a decision ?
in 1983 , when chancellor helmut kohl -lrb- cdu -rrb- held a vote of confidence , the judges on the country 's top court needed 28 days before handing down a decision .
it is possible to expedite the process .
for example , in june the judges took only ten days to demand a parliamentary commission inquiring into the " visa affair " continue .
does the 60-day deadline also apply to the constitutional court or can it take more time to make a decision ?
there is nothing that would prohibit the judges from taking more than 60 days .
if they feel that the matter is too complex , the september 18 election date could be postponed .
what would happen if the federal constitutional court ruled that köhler 's dissolution of parliament were unconstitutional ?
firstly , germans would be outraged .
if the judges in karlsruhe were to decide that schröder did misuse the vote of confidence , then they would also be denigrating köhler .

the decision paves the way for early elections unless the federal constitutional court intervenes .
what could still happen ? why is the election date set for september 18 ?
german law states that elections must take at the latest 60 days after parliament was dissolved .
köhler waited to announce his decision until july 21 so that the poll could be held on september 18 which comes one week after the end of the summer school break for the states of bavaria and baden-württemberg .
it is tradition in germany not to hold an election during a school vacation .
could the elections still be prevented from taking place ?
yes , but only theoretically .
the bundestag parliamentarians werner schulz -lrb- greens -rrb- and jelena hoffmann -lrb- spd -rrb- , along with several smaller political parties , have announced they will appeal the dissolution to the federal constitutional court in karlsruhe .
they claim that chancellor gerhard schröder -lrb- spd -rrb- misused a vote of confidence so that early elections could be held .
according to them , early elections can only occur if the chancellor no longer can rely on his coalition to support him , something they say is not true , and hence , his call for a vote of confidence based on a lack of support was invalid .
how long could the constitutional court take to hand down a decision ?
in 1983 , when chancellor helmut kohl -lrb- cdu -rrb- held a vote of confidence , the judges on the country 's top court needed 28 days before handing down a decision .
it is possible to expedite the process .
for example , in june the judges took only ten days to demand a parliamentary commission inquiring into the " visa affair " continue .
does the 60-day deadline also apply to the constitutional court or can it take more time to make a decision ?
there is nothing that would prohibit the judges from taking more than 60 days .
if they feel that the matter is too complex , the september 18 election date could be postponed .
what would happen if the federal constitutional court ruled that köhler 's dissolution of parliament were unconstitutional ?
firstly , germans would be outraged .
if the judges in karlsruhe were to decide that schröder did misuse the vote of confidence , then they would also be denigrating köhler .
the administration in berlin would be unable to rule just as schröder had described it .
spd party chair , franz müntefering has repeated that there is no alternative plan .
he said that schröder would not resign from his post .

" it is my duty as president to decide this issue according to the law , " he told the nation in a televised broadcast .
" i think it is best to have a new election to let the people decide . " the announcement came three weeks after schröder engineered his own defeat in a parliamentary confidence vote in order to call early elections and one day before the expiration of the 21-day deadline he is allowed under the constitution to make the decision .
his decision , one of the few real powers he has as ceremonial head of state , could be overturned by the constitutional court . a government spokesman confirmed schröder had cut short a holiday at his family home in the northern city of hanover to return to berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chancellor gambles his government schröder had told parliament ahead of the vote that he wanted new elections to show if the german people still backed a set of sometimes painful social welfare reforms . however , despite the go-ahead from köhler , the decision faces a challenge from two members of parliament , one from schröder 's own social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and another from the greens , the spd 's coalition partner . the spd has suffered from plummeting polls all over the country , but schröder 's decision was prompted by a crushing defeat to the conservative opposition in the country 's most populous state and one-time spd stronghold , north rhine-westphalia , in may . merkel takes lead opinion polls show schröder 's conservative challenger , angela merkel , has a strong chance of becoming germany 's first woman chancellor - the latest opinion poll gave her christian union bloc a clear lead of 17 percentage points . merkel is promising to slash germany 's unemployment figures , which topped five million this year , and inject new life into the euro-zone 's biggest , but stagnating , economy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's new chancellor ?
inevitably compared with margaret thatcher , merkel has said she has " great respect " for the economic policies of the iron lady although her own program is likely to be less controversial . merkel has unveiled plans to create jobs and raise the value-added tax , a form of sales tax common throughout the european union , to 18 percent from the current level of 16 percent . " if i do nothing , the current developments will continue and ... lead germany into a spiral of decline , " merkel said in an interview with the financial times deutschland newspaper published on thursday . merkel this week traveled to paris to meet french president jacques chirac and the man who hopes to succeed him , the current interior minister nicolas sarkozy . no backing from coalition since schröder lost the confidence vote , köhler asked him to provide more evidence of his claim that he no longer enjoys the backing of his coalition . the chancellor replied with a 200-page dossier which included dozens of newspaper articles describing infighting within the coalition of spd and greens and interviews with some of his most outspoken critics . the spd 's own ottmar schreiner , for example , repeatedly attacked the government 's labor market reform drive because it had led to cuts in benefit payments for the jobless . and mp jelena hoffmann , also spd , confirmed on thursday that she and green party parliamentarian werner schulz would challenge a decision to dissolve parliament in the country 's constitutional court because they wanted to serve their full terms which run until autumn 2006 . vote " faked " the opponents of the new elections argue that chancellor schröder 's vote of confidence was " faked " because the chancellor still had a majority in the parliament . the german constitution , which was adopted in 1949 , makes it deliberately difficult for early elections to be called , and only under extraordinary circumstances . one of the main goals of the 1949 constitution was to create conditions for political stability in the post-war period and prevent governments from rotating , the way they did in the 1920s and early 30s .
it is widely believed that the political instability of the period of the weimer republic , when german had no less than 12 chancellors , led to the rise of adolf hitler . germans eager for early elections the country , however , is very much in favor of new elections .
according to a recent poll , 73 percent of the population believes the elections are necessary .
a full 83 percent of germans believe the new elections will bring a change of government , although 76 percent also believe that the new conservative government would not do a better job than the ruling coalition of social democrats and the green party . if elections go ahead , schröder faces another headache with the creation of a new left-wing alliance which risks drawing working-class support away from the social democrats . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de background : federal constitutional court germany 's high court is the authority on upholding the country 's constitution and ensuring it 's laws are adhered to .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 22.07.2005 european leaders stand by londoners großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london was again racked by terror on thursday british prime minister tony blair received backing from european leaders in the wake of the latest attacks on london .
they lashed out at the bombers and vowed to unite against terrorism . after thursday 's bomb attacks on london , in which one person was injured , tetchy relations with france were put to one side and the european commission vowed to press for anti-terrorism measures across the bloc . " this second attack unfortunately confirms that terrorism constitutes a permanent threat from which nobody is safe , " the european commission said in a statement .
" it is also vital to focus on measures which aim at preventing terrorism and particularly preventing young people from becoming radicalized . " the european union has a strategy to fight terrorism , it said .
" we need to implement this without any delay . "
french president jacques chirac , who had swept aside franco-british squabbles over the future of the european union to support blair after the deadly july 7 attacks on london , reiterated france 's solidarity with britain . " i wish to express to the british people and to prime minister tony blair the solidarity and support of france , and i want to reiterate our determination to fight terrorism together , " he said during an official visit in the madagascan capital antananarivo .
increased vigilance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police and emergency services outside oval tube station on thursday other countries railed against the attackers . irish foreign minister dermot ahern condemned the attempt to " strike fear and terror " into the community .
ahern said he had no doubt the british government would actively pursue those who carried out the attacks and bring them to justice . " those responsible should know that they will not deter the international community from combating terrorism vigorously and uncompromisingly wherever it occurs . " spain , where over 200 people were killed in terrorist bombings in madrid last year , announced it was reinforcing its border controls following the london attacks .
foreign minister abdullah gul of turkey , whose country has also been targeted in bomb attacks , said " we condemn terrorism wherever it strikes and whatever its goals are . "
similarities to earlier attacks thursday 's attacks appeared to mirror the bombings in the city two weeks earlier , though they seem to have been smaller .
three underground trains were targeted and one bus .
the blasts in the underground occurred almost simultaneously .
an hour later the driver of a double-decker bus heard a bang on the vehicle 's top deck , followed by smoke , and found some of the windows had been blown out . police said the attacks were meant to kill people , but they had gone awry . " clearly the intention must have been to kill .
you do n't do this with any other intention , " said police chief ian blair . " terrorist experts have said the loud , popping bangs heard by some witnesses indicated the bomb detonators might have gone off without triggering the main explosive blasts . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de more coordinated blasts shake london four bombs on london 's subways and a bus wounded at least one person thursday afternoon and sparked panic in london again as the city mourned the dozens that died after four bombs exploded two weeks ago .

-lrb- july 15 , 2005 -rrb- eu pledges to adopt security laws eu ministers vowed to unite in the fight against terrorism and committed themselves wednesday , days after the london bombings , to implementing security laws agreed on a year ago after the madrid attacks .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 22.07.2005 -pipe- 15:00 utc german press relieved by call for early polls the german press breathed a sigh of relief friday that president horst köhler paved the way to new elections , ending weeks of uncertainty and offering the promise of a fresh political start .
" now we have the choice ! " cheered mass-selling daily bild , calling köhler 's decision thursday to dissolve parliament and call early elections on september 18 " historic . "
" now the sizing up of the parties and the competition for the best solutions for the major problems facing the country begin , " bild 's editor-in-chief kai diekmann wrote .
the paper then listed 50 reasons to vote for chancellor gerhard schröder versus 50 to vote for his conservative challenger angela merkel , who is tipped to become the country 's first female leader .
berlin 's center-left tagesspiegel said köhler 's call had " spared germany an agonizing year of political standstill , " but noted that the elections could still be stopped by a constitutional court challenge .
" köhler has taken a great risk .
if the constitutional court upholds a complaint against his decision , it would be a blow to his presidency from which it would hardly be able to recover , " he said .
the financial times deutschland , the german sister paper to the london-based broadsheet , said the waiting game following schröder 's announcement in may that he would seek new elections and köhler 's permission thursday had created deep uncertainty in the country .
" köhler 's grounds for his decision were much more political than legal .
germany needs a new start , that was the message , " it said .
" but he must be convinced that his decision will be upheld by the constitutional court in karlsruhe .
" now the second act of the face begins : waiting for karlsruhe . " dw-world.de early elections prompt reserved optimism with the green light given by german president horst köhler , most politicians and people expect to vote on september 18 .
there is relief that changes might happen but do gemrans think they will ?

if the constitutional court upholds a complaint against his decision , it would be a blow to his presidency from which it would hardly be able to recover , " he said .
the financial times deutschland , the german sister paper to the london-based broadsheet , said the waiting game following schröder 's announcement in may that he would seek new elections and köhler 's permission thursday had created deep uncertainty in the country .

according to eyewitnesses , the man either fell or was pushed to the floor a train car where he shot him to death . police said the shooting was " directly linked " to the investigations of the bomb attacks on london 's transit system .
reports suggest that the suspect was apparently about to board a train at stockwell tube station in south london when armed officers shouted a warning to passengers before opening fire . metropolitan police officers are allegedly under ' shoot to kill ' orders when confronting suspected suicide bombers who are thought to be on the verge of detonating . it is still not clear whether the man killed by police at stockwell station was suspected of involvement in the failed bomb attacks or had been mistaken for someone else . a spokesman for london 's metropolitain police told reuters : " the gentleman shot at stockwell today has yet to be identified so it would be impossible to link him to anything at this stage . " chaos in station passengers reported the man - described as south asian - was boarding the train when police ordered the doors to be closed . witnesses said police chased the man before shooting him .
" they pushed him onto the floor and unloaded five shots into him .
he 's dead , " witness mark whitby told the bbc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police stand outside stockwell station , in london , friday july 22 , 2005 .
" we were on the tube and then we suddenly heard someone say ' get out , get out ' and then we heard gunshots , " said passenger briony coetsee .
alistair drummond , of the london ambulance service , said paramedics had been called to the station at 10:10 utc to remove the suspect 's body . before getting to the train , the man apparently vaulted over barriers while being chased by the armed police who it is alleged had been trailing him since receiving a tip-off that he was involved in thursday 's attacks . witnesses gave sketchy details of the man who some said was of south asian appearance .
the man raised suspicion by wearing a winter coat in the heat of summer .
most witnesses said he wore a backpack - reminding many of images of the four suicide bombers behind the july 7 attacks . arrest made , images released later on friday , two man were arrested in connection with thursday 's explosions .

i would fear too much for their safety . " matthew kube , 26 , who lives in southwest london , said he was using overground suburban trains for most of his journey to work , rather than his usual underground line .
" i 'm a little bit upset , " he said at blackfriars station .
" it 's the first day i feel a bit worried and i chose to take the overground train despite the tube from wimbledon .
i may avoid the tube as much as possible , but i 'm not sure yet . " luna martello , 28 , said she still rides double-decker buses , but avoids the back of the upper deck because that is where one of the july 7 bombs , at tavistock square in bloomsbury , central london , went off .

" it is my duty as president to decide this issue according to the law , " he told the nation in a televised broadcast .
" i think it is best to have a new election to let the people decide . " the announcement came three weeks after schröder engineered his own defeat in a parliamentary confidence vote in order to call early elections and one day before the expiration of the 21-day deadline he is allowed under the constitution to make the decision .
his decision , one of the few real powers he has as ceremonial head of state , could be overturned by the constitutional court . a government spokesman confirmed schröder had cut short a holiday at his family home in the northern city of hanover to return to berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chancellor gambles his government schröder had told parliament ahead of the vote that he wanted new elections to show if the german people still backed a set of sometimes painful social welfare reforms . however , despite the go-ahead from köhler , the decision faces a challenge from two members of parliament , one from schröder 's own social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and another from the greens , the spd 's coalition partner . the spd has suffered from plummeting polls all over the country , but schröder 's decision was prompted by a crushing defeat to the conservative opposition in the country 's most populous state and one-time spd stronghold , north rhine-westphalia , in may . merkel takes lead opinion polls show schröder 's conservative challenger , angela merkel , has a strong chance of becoming germany 's first woman chancellor - the latest opinion poll gave her christian union bloc a clear lead of 17 percentage points . merkel is promising to slash germany 's unemployment figures , which topped five million this year , and inject new life into the euro-zone 's biggest , but stagnating , economy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's new chancellor ?
inevitably compared with margaret thatcher , merkel has said she has " great respect " for the economic policies of the iron lady although her own program is likely to be less controversial . merkel has unveiled plans to create jobs and raise the value-added tax , a form of sales tax common throughout the european union , to 18 percent from the current level of 16 percent . " if i do nothing , the current developments will continue and ... lead germany into a spiral of decline , " merkel said in an interview with the financial times deutschland newspaper published on thursday . merkel this week traveled to paris to meet french president jacques chirac and the man who hopes to succeed him , the current interior minister nicolas sarkozy . no backing from coalition since schröder lost the confidence vote , köhler asked him to provide more evidence of his claim that he no longer enjoys the backing of his coalition . the chancellor replied with a 200-page dossier which included dozens of newspaper articles describing infighting within the coalition of spd and greens and interviews with some of his most outspoken critics . the spd 's own ottmar schreiner , for example , repeatedly attacked the government 's labor market reform drive because it had led to cuts in benefit payments for the jobless . and mp jelena hoffmann , also spd , confirmed on thursday that she and green party parliamentarian werner schulz would challenge a decision to dissolve parliament in the country 's constitutional court because they wanted to serve their full terms which run until autumn 2006 . vote " faked " the opponents of the new elections argue that chancellor schröder 's vote of confidence was " faked " because the chancellor still had a majority in the parliament . the german constitution , which was adopted in 1949 , makes it deliberately difficult for early elections to be called , and only under extraordinary circumstances . one of the main goals of the 1949 constitution was to create conditions for political stability in the post-war period and prevent governments from rotating , the way they did in the 1920s and early 30s .
it is widely believed that the political instability of the period of the weimer republic , when german had no less than 12 chancellors , led to the rise of adolf hitler . germans eager for early elections the country , however , is very much in favor of new elections .
according to a recent poll , 73 percent of the population believes the elections are necessary .
a full 83 percent of germans believe the new elections will bring a change of government , although 76 percent also believe that the new conservative government would not do a better job than the ruling coalition of social democrats and the green party . if elections go ahead , schröder faces another headache with the creation of a new left-wing alliance which risks drawing working-class support away from the social democrats . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de background : federal constitutional court germany 's high court is the authority on upholding the country 's constitution and ensuring it 's laws are adhered to .

the decision paves the way for early elections unless the federal constitutional court intervenes .
what could still happen ? why is the election date set for september 18 ?
german law states that elections must take at the latest 60 days after parliament was dissolved .
köhler waited to announce his decision until july 21 so that the poll could be held on september 18 which comes one week after the end of the summer school break for the states of bavaria and baden-württemberg .
it is tradition in germany not to hold an election during a school vacation .
could the elections still be prevented from taking place ?
yes , but only theoretically .
the bundestag parliamentarians werner schulz -lrb- greens -rrb- and jelena hoffmann -lrb- spd -rrb- , along with several smaller political parties , have announced they will appeal the dissolution to the federal constitutional court in karlsruhe .
they claim that chancellor gerhard schröder -lrb- spd -rrb- misused a vote of confidence so that early elections could be held .
according to them , early elections can only occur if the chancellor no longer can rely on his coalition to support him , something they say is not true , and hence , his call for a vote of confidence based on a lack of support was invalid .
how long could the constitutional court take to hand down a decision ?
in 1983 , when chancellor helmut kohl -lrb- cdu -rrb- held a vote of confidence , the judges on the country 's top court needed 28 days before handing down a decision .
it is possible to expedite the process .
for example , in june the judges took only ten days to demand a parliamentary commission inquiring into the " visa affair " continue .
does the 60-day deadline also apply to the constitutional court or can it take more time to make a decision ?
there is nothing that would prohibit the judges from taking more than 60 days .
if they feel that the matter is too complex , the september 18 election date could be postponed .
what would happen if the federal constitutional court ruled that köhler 's dissolution of parliament were unconstitutional ?
firstly , germans would be outraged .
if the judges in karlsruhe were to decide that schröder did misuse the vote of confidence , then they would also be denigrating köhler .
the administration in berlin would be unable to rule just as schröder had described it .
spd party chair , franz müntefering has repeated that there is no alternative plan .
he said that schröder would not resign from his post .
the consequence : bundestag president wolfgang thierse said the center-left coalition would be forced to continue their partnership .

the decision paves the way for early elections unless the federal constitutional court intervenes .
what could still happen ? why is the election date set for september 18 ?
german law states that elections must take at the latest 60 days after parliament was dissolved .
köhler waited to announce his decision until july 21 so that the poll could be held on september 18 which comes one week after the end of the summer school break for the states of bavaria and baden-württemberg .
it is tradition in germany not to hold an election during a school vacation .
could the elections still be prevented from taking place ?
yes , but only theoretically .
the bundestag parliamentarians werner schulz -lrb- greens -rrb- and jelena hoffmann -lrb- spd -rrb- , along with several smaller political parties , have announced they will appeal the dissolution to the federal constitutional court in karlsruhe .
they claim that chancellor gerhard schröder -lrb- spd -rrb- misused a vote of confidence so that early elections could be held .
according to them , early elections can only occur if the chancellor no longer can rely on his coalition to support him , something they say is not true , and hence , his call for a vote of confidence based on a lack of support was invalid .
how long could the constitutional court take to hand down a decision ?
in 1983 , when chancellor helmut kohl -lrb- cdu -rrb- held a vote of confidence , the judges on the country 's top court needed 28 days before handing down a decision .
it is possible to expedite the process .
for example , in june the judges took only ten days to demand a parliamentary commission inquiring into the " visa affair " continue .
does the 60-day deadline also apply to the constitutional court or can it take more time to make a decision ?
there is nothing that would prohibit the judges from taking more than 60 days .
if they feel that the matter is too complex , the september 18 election date could be postponed .
what would happen if the federal constitutional court ruled that köhler 's dissolution of parliament were unconstitutional ?
firstly , germans would be outraged .
if the judges in karlsruhe were to decide that schröder did misuse the vote of confidence , then they would also be denigrating köhler .
the administration in berlin would be unable to rule just as schröder had described it .

germans hope the election will bring changes , but they are n't sure they will . the chips have fallen .
after almost three weeks of speculation , president horst köhler has met the request of chancellor gerhard schröder to hold elections 12 months ahead of schedule .
pointing to the chancellor 's lack of a stable majority within his coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens , köhler will give a new - or potentially the same - administration to take on what he called " immense tasks " in the country .
something that with few exceptions was welcomed by germans across the country .
politicians pleased for most part although parliament is in recess and most politicians are enjoying their vacations at home or even abroad , the importance of dissolution meant a return to berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president horst köhler coming from his home town hanover to speak , schröder called the confirmation of his request " correct and necessary " and wasted no time in announcing that he would run again as the spd candidate for chancellor .
reforms are imperative according to schröder .
" i am going to fight to do that , " he said .
the whole party leadership stood behind the chancellor but within the ranks , there were voices of dissent .
spd parliamentarian jelena hoffmann , along with her green colleague werner schulz , want to go to the country 's constitutional court to overturn köhler 's dissolution of the bundestag .
angela merkel 's christian democrats are rubbing their hands over the decision .
sitting on an almost 17 point lead in the opinion polls , a victory in less than two months is theirs for the taking .
merkel referred to the country 's five million unemployed , saying the country did n't " have to make do " with that .
" i am asking us to move forward together for a better germany , in which people can again seize their opportunities , " she said after köhler 's address .
labor unions and big business agree on something bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tendency of the german economy has been downwards compared to the rest of the world the weak economic situation has been an achilles ' heel for schröder .
big business complains of costs , particularly non-wage labor costs .
labor unions protest that the country 's big companies are making money hand over fist while leaving workers in the lurch .
they also must watch their influence erode within the spd , and germany in general .
yet on this issue , the two sides are in agreement .
german trade union federation -lrb- dgb -rrb- chair michael sommer commented that a phase of uncertainty and stagnation could be brought to an end .

bdi president jürgen thumann -lrb- photo right -rrb- offered a chance for a new start and growth .
" it 's most important that the new administration can break down the country 's weaknesses and build up its strengths with courage , strength and speed , " thumann said .
polls reveal that a large majority of the people , 73 percent , are behind the dissolution , but it 's hard to say if they will turn out in droves to turn in their ballots .
an equally large number , 76 percent , believe nothing will change if a new coalition takes over .

germans hope the election will bring changes , but they are n't sure they will . the chips have fallen .
after almost three weeks of speculation , president horst köhler has met the request of chancellor gerhard schröder to hold elections 12 months ahead of schedule .
pointing to the chancellor 's lack of a stable majority within his coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens , köhler will give a new - or potentially the same - administration to take on what he called " immense tasks " in the country .
something that with few exceptions was welcomed by germans across the country .
politicians pleased for most part although parliament is in recess and most politicians are enjoying their vacations at home or even abroad , the importance of dissolution meant a return to berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president horst köhler coming from his home town hanover to speak , schröder called the confirmation of his request " correct and necessary " and wasted no time in announcing that he would run again as the spd candidate for chancellor .
reforms are imperative according to schröder .
" i am going to fight to do that , " he said .
the whole party leadership stood behind the chancellor but within the ranks , there were voices of dissent .
spd parliamentarian jelena hoffmann , along with her green colleague werner schulz , want to go to the country 's constitutional court to overturn köhler 's dissolution of the bundestag .
angela merkel 's christian democrats are rubbing their hands over the decision .
sitting on an almost 17 point lead in the opinion polls , a victory in less than two months is theirs for the taking .
merkel referred to the country 's five million unemployed , saying the country did n't " have to make do " with that .
" i am asking us to move forward together for a better germany , in which people can again seize their opportunities , " she said after köhler 's address .
labor unions and big business agree on something bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tendency of the german economy has been downwards compared to the rest of the world the weak economic situation has been an achilles ' heel for schröder .
big business complains of costs , particularly non-wage labor costs .
labor unions protest that the country 's big companies are making money hand over fist while leaving workers in the lurch .
they also must watch their influence erode within the spd , and germany in general .
yet on this issue , the two sides are in agreement .
german trade union federation -lrb- dgb -rrb- chair michael sommer commented that a phase of uncertainty and stagnation could be brought to an end .
" we finally need some decisive policies for more growth and employment , " sommer said .
he also announced that the dgb would not throw its weight behind any one party , an open break with the historically labor-friendly spd .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen thumann the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- , a body representing german companies , also did n't hesitate to express their sanguinity about the effect of early elections .
bdi president jürgen thumann -lrb- photo right -rrb- offered a chance for a new start and growth .
" it 's most important that the new administration can break down the country 's weaknesses and build up its strengths with courage , strength and speed , " thumann said .
polls reveal that a large majority of the people , 73 percent , are behind the dissolution , but it 's hard to say if they will turn out in droves to turn in their ballots .
an equally large number , 76 percent , believe nothing will change if a new coalition takes over .
yet the new " left party " may find willing voters .
peter jung , a works council chairman who says he has fought losing battle after losing battle to his firm 's management , said he will vote again for the first time in years - for oskar lafontaine .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : left party co-chair oskar lafontaine marches for social justice in germany " maybe people will get scared enough that certain things will get done differently , " he offered .
" how can things ever change if you 're not prepared to offer resistance ? "
everybody now agrees that change is necessary and are putting their chips on early elections to bring it about . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the road to the chancellery this year is n't the first time germany has dealt with a vote of confidence , but there is still plenty of gray area when it comes to the legal issues surrounding 2005 's early elections .

she was 110 years old . for the past nine years , müller had lived in a nursing home in potsdam , just outside of the german capital .
it was here in this baroque town that she first saw the light of day , more than a century earlier , and was given the name frieda ihnenfeld . although she lived a long life , relatively little was actually known about her by those who took care of her for the last decade .
according to nursing home personnel , she slept a lot , spoke little , had few possessions and few visitors , since she had apparently outlived almost all of those close to her . staff members were able to track down a living nephew and glean some information about her long life .
she was born on october 18 , 1894 in potsdam and married a railroad employee , wilhelm müller , in 1914 .
he died in 1958 . müller liked listening to classical music and have the occasional bite of nougat .
she aged well , according to nursing home staff , who said she did n't look her 110 years because her face was hardly wrinkled at all . the title of the oldest german now passes to robert meier , who lives in north rhine-westphalia .

they lashed out at the bombers and vowed to unite against terrorism . after thursday 's bomb attacks on london , in which one person was injured , tetchy relations with france were put to one side and the european commission vowed to press for anti-terrorism measures across the bloc . " this second attack unfortunately confirms that terrorism constitutes a permanent threat from which nobody is safe , " the european commission said in a statement .
" it is also vital to focus on measures which aim at preventing terrorism and particularly preventing young people from becoming radicalized . " the european union has a strategy to fight terrorism , it said .
" we need to implement this without any delay . "
french president jacques chirac , who had swept aside franco-british squabbles over the future of the european union to support blair after the deadly july 7 attacks on london , reiterated france 's solidarity with britain . " i wish to express to the british people and to prime minister tony blair the solidarity and support of france , and i want to reiterate our determination to fight terrorism together , " he said during an official visit in the madagascan capital antananarivo .

" spain , where over 200 people were killed in terrorist bombings in madrid last year , announced it was reinforcing its border controls following the london attacks .
foreign minister abdullah gul of turkey , whose country has also been targeted in bomb attacks , said " we condemn terrorism wherever it strikes and whatever its goals are . "
similarities to earlier attacks thursday 's attacks appeared to mirror the bombings in the city two weeks earlier , though they seem to have been smaller .
three underground trains were targeted and one bus .
the blasts in the underground occurred almost simultaneously .
an hour later the driver of a double-decker bus heard a bang on the vehicle 's top deck , followed by smoke , and found some of the windows had been blown out . police said the attacks were meant to kill people , but they had gone awry . " clearly the intention must have been to kill .
you do n't do this with any other intention , " said police chief ian blair . " terrorist experts have said the loud , popping bangs heard by some witnesses indicated the bomb detonators might have gone off without triggering the main explosive blasts . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de more coordinated blasts shake london four bombs on london 's subways and a bus wounded at least one person thursday afternoon and sparked panic in london again as the city mourned the dozens that died after four bombs exploded two weeks ago .

the decision paves the way for early elections unless the federal constitutional court intervenes .
what could still happen ? why is the election date set for september 18 ?
german law states that elections must take at the latest 60 days after parliament was dissolved .
köhler waited to announce his decision until july 21 so that the poll could be held on september 18 which comes one week after the end of the summer school break for the states of bavaria and baden-württemberg .
it is tradition in germany not to hold an election during a school vacation .
could the elections still be prevented from taking place ?
yes , but only theoretically .
the bundestag parliamentarians werner schulz -lrb- greens -rrb- and jelena hoffmann -lrb- spd -rrb- , along with several smaller political parties , have announced they will appeal the dissolution to the federal constitutional court in karlsruhe .
they claim that chancellor gerhard schröder -lrb- spd -rrb- misused a vote of confidence so that early elections could be held .
according to them , early elections can only occur if the chancellor no longer can rely on his coalition to support him , something they say is not true , and hence , his call for a vote of confidence based on a lack of support was invalid .
how long could the constitutional court take to hand down a decision ?
in 1983 , when chancellor helmut kohl -lrb- cdu -rrb- held a vote of confidence , the judges on the country 's top court needed 28 days before handing down a decision .
it is possible to expedite the process .
for example , in june the judges took only ten days to demand a parliamentary commission inquiring into the " visa affair " continue .
does the 60-day deadline also apply to the constitutional court or can it take more time to make a decision ?
there is nothing that would prohibit the judges from taking more than 60 days .
if they feel that the matter is too complex , the september 18 election date could be postponed .
what would happen if the federal constitutional court ruled that köhler 's dissolution of parliament were unconstitutional ?
firstly , germans would be outraged .
if the judges in karlsruhe were to decide that schröder did misuse the vote of confidence , then they would also be denigrating köhler .
the administration in berlin would be unable to rule just as schröder had described it .
spd party chair , franz müntefering has repeated that there is no alternative plan .
he said that schröder would not resign from his post .
the consequence : bundestag president wolfgang thierse said the center-left coalition would be forced to continue their partnership .
schröder would remain at the helm which the public just would not understand .

germans hope the election will bring changes , but they are n't sure they will . the chips have fallen .
after almost three weeks of speculation , president horst köhler has met the request of chancellor gerhard schröder to hold elections 12 months ahead of schedule .
pointing to the chancellor 's lack of a stable majority within his coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens , köhler will give a new - or potentially the same - administration to take on what he called " immense tasks " in the country .
something that with few exceptions was welcomed by germans across the country .

the decision paves the way for early elections unless the federal constitutional court intervenes .
what could still happen ? why is the election date set for september 18 ?
german law states that elections must take at the latest 60 days after parliament was dissolved .
köhler waited to announce his decision until july 21 so that the poll could be held on september 18 which comes one week after the end of the summer school break for the states of bavaria and baden-württemberg .
it is tradition in germany not to hold an election during a school vacation .
could the elections still be prevented from taking place ?
yes , but only theoretically .
the bundestag parliamentarians werner schulz -lrb- greens -rrb- and jelena hoffmann -lrb- spd -rrb- , along with several smaller political parties , have announced they will appeal the dissolution to the federal constitutional court in karlsruhe .
they claim that chancellor gerhard schröder -lrb- spd -rrb- misused a vote of confidence so that early elections could be held .
according to them , early elections can only occur if the chancellor no longer can rely on his coalition to support him , something they say is not true , and hence , his call for a vote of confidence based on a lack of support was invalid .
how long could the constitutional court take to hand down a decision ?
in 1983 , when chancellor helmut kohl -lrb- cdu -rrb- held a vote of confidence , the judges on the country 's top court needed 28 days before handing down a decision .
it is possible to expedite the process .
for example , in june the judges took only ten days to demand a parliamentary commission inquiring into the " visa affair " continue .
does the 60-day deadline also apply to the constitutional court or can it take more time to make a decision ?
there is nothing that would prohibit the judges from taking more than 60 days .
if they feel that the matter is too complex , the september 18 election date could be postponed .
what would happen if the federal constitutional court ruled that köhler 's dissolution of parliament were unconstitutional ?
firstly , germans would be outraged .
if the judges in karlsruhe were to decide that schröder did misuse the vote of confidence , then they would also be denigrating köhler .

he said that schröder would not resign from his post .

according to eyewitnesses , the man either fell or was pushed to the floor a train car where he shot him to death . police said the shooting was " directly linked " to the investigations of the bomb attacks on london 's transit system .
reports suggest that the suspect was apparently about to board a train at stockwell tube station in south london when armed officers shouted a warning to passengers before opening fire . metropolitan police officers are allegedly under ' shoot to kill ' orders when confronting suspected suicide bombers who are thought to be on the verge of detonating . it is still not clear whether the man killed by police at stockwell station was suspected of involvement in the failed bomb attacks or had been mistaken for someone else . a spokesman for london 's metropolitain police told reuters : " the gentleman shot at stockwell today has yet to be identified so it would be impossible to link him to anything at this stage . " chaos in station passengers reported the man - described as south asian - was boarding the train when police ordered the doors to be closed . witnesses said police chased the man before shooting him .

" we were on the tube and then we suddenly heard someone say ' get out , get out ' and then we heard gunshots , " said passenger briony coetsee .

this image was taken by a cctv camera at warren street - one of the three tube stations involved .
police issued on friday closed circuit television images of four men they want to question over the attempted bomb attacks on three tube trains and a bus in london on thursday .
police commissioner andy hayman said anyone who knew who or where the men were should contact police .
the bombers fled after detonators went off that failed to ignite explosives .
continued climate of fear hanging over capital whereas commuters were largely defiant after the first attacks that killed 56 people , they betrayed traces of nervousness after thursday 's failed attacks on three underground subway trains and a double-decker bus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a morning commuter reads the morning headlines onboard the underground after thursday 's bomb attacks plunged the tube networks into chaos in london , friday july 22 , 2005 .
investigators searched friday for fingerprints , dna and other forensic evidence collected from attacks on three subway trains and a double-decker bus that were hauntingly reminiscent of suicide bombings two weeks ago .
the new reports of further police action regarding possible terrorist activities will do nothing to ease the atmosphere of fear in the english capital . " yes , i 'm afraid .
i always take the tube -lrb- subway -rrb- to go to work but now i feel more confident with the bus , " said ehelena osaki , 24 , told afp in the city financial district .
" the bus also is worrying me a bit but you 've got to get to work , no ?
i 'm too young to die . " commuters faced disruption on the sections of london 's transport network , with two underground lines closed and three running a restricted service .
several stations on other lines were also shut down . up on street level , buses were running a full service , but diversions were in place near two of the four sites of thursday 's incidents . commuters taking alternative transport david roberts , 29 , who rode a bicycle to work , said that two incidents in as many weeks were " putting fears into people 's minds .
i would n't go in the underground with my two children .
i would fear too much for their safety . " matthew kube , 26 , who lives in southwest london , said he was using overground suburban trains for most of his journey to work , rather than his usual underground line .
" i 'm a little bit upset , " he said at blackfriars station .
" it 's the first day i feel a bit worried and i chose to take the overground train despite the tube from wimbledon .
i may avoid the tube as much as possible , but i 'm not sure yet . " luna martello , 28 , said she still rides double-decker buses , but avoids the back of the upper deck because that is where one of the july 7 bombs , at tavistock square in bloomsbury , central london , went off .

germans hope the election will bring changes , but they are n't sure they will . the chips have fallen .
after almost three weeks of speculation , president horst köhler has met the request of chancellor gerhard schröder to hold elections 12 months ahead of schedule .
pointing to the chancellor 's lack of a stable majority within his coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens , köhler will give a new - or potentially the same - administration to take on what he called " immense tasks " in the country .
something that with few exceptions was welcomed by germans across the country .
politicians pleased for most part although parliament is in recess and most politicians are enjoying their vacations at home or even abroad , the importance of dissolution meant a return to berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president horst köhler coming from his home town hanover to speak , schröder called the confirmation of his request " correct and necessary " and wasted no time in announcing that he would run again as the spd candidate for chancellor .
reforms are imperative according to schröder .
" i am going to fight to do that , " he said .
the whole party leadership stood behind the chancellor but within the ranks , there were voices of dissent .
spd parliamentarian jelena hoffmann , along with her green colleague werner schulz , want to go to the country 's constitutional court to overturn köhler 's dissolution of the bundestag .
angela merkel 's christian democrats are rubbing their hands over the decision .
sitting on an almost 17 point lead in the opinion polls , a victory in less than two months is theirs for the taking .
merkel referred to the country 's five million unemployed , saying the country did n't " have to make do " with that .
" i am asking us to move forward together for a better germany , in which people can again seize their opportunities , " she said after köhler 's address .

" it 's most important that the new administration can break down the country 's weaknesses and build up its strengths with courage , strength and speed , " thumann said .
polls reveal that a large majority of the people , 73 percent , are behind the dissolution , but it 's hard to say if they will turn out in droves to turn in their ballots .
an equally large number , 76 percent , believe nothing will change if a new coalition takes over .
yet the new " left party " may find willing voters .
peter jung , a works council chairman who says he has fought losing battle after losing battle to his firm 's management , said he will vote again for the first time in years - for oskar lafontaine .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : left party co-chair oskar lafontaine marches for social justice in germany " maybe people will get scared enough that certain things will get done differently , " he offered .

" it is my duty as president to decide this issue according to the law , " he told the nation in a televised broadcast .
" i think it is best to have a new election to let the people decide . " the announcement came three weeks after schröder engineered his own defeat in a parliamentary confidence vote in order to call early elections and one day before the expiration of the 21-day deadline he is allowed under the constitution to make the decision .
his decision , one of the few real powers he has as ceremonial head of state , could be overturned by the constitutional court . a government spokesman confirmed schröder had cut short a holiday at his family home in the northern city of hanover to return to berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chancellor gambles his government schröder had told parliament ahead of the vote that he wanted new elections to show if the german people still backed a set of sometimes painful social welfare reforms . however , despite the go-ahead from köhler , the decision faces a challenge from two members of parliament , one from schröder 's own social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and another from the greens , the spd 's coalition partner . the spd has suffered from plummeting polls all over the country , but schröder 's decision was prompted by a crushing defeat to the conservative opposition in the country 's most populous state and one-time spd stronghold , north rhine-westphalia , in may . merkel takes lead opinion polls show schröder 's conservative challenger , angela merkel , has a strong chance of becoming germany 's first woman chancellor - the latest opinion poll gave her christian union bloc a clear lead of 17 percentage points . merkel is promising to slash germany 's unemployment figures , which topped five million this year , and inject new life into the euro-zone 's biggest , but stagnating , economy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's new chancellor ?
inevitably compared with margaret thatcher , merkel has said she has " great respect " for the economic policies of the iron lady although her own program is likely to be less controversial . merkel has unveiled plans to create jobs and raise the value-added tax , a form of sales tax common throughout the european union , to 18 percent from the current level of 16 percent . " if i do nothing , the current developments will continue and ... lead germany into a spiral of decline , " merkel said in an interview with the financial times deutschland newspaper published on thursday . merkel this week traveled to paris to meet french president jacques chirac and the man who hopes to succeed him , the current interior minister nicolas sarkozy . no backing from coalition since schröder lost the confidence vote , köhler asked him to provide more evidence of his claim that he no longer enjoys the backing of his coalition . the chancellor replied with a 200-page dossier which included dozens of newspaper articles describing infighting within the coalition of spd and greens and interviews with some of his most outspoken critics . the spd 's own ottmar schreiner , for example , repeatedly attacked the government 's labor market reform drive because it had led to cuts in benefit payments for the jobless . and mp jelena hoffmann , also spd , confirmed on thursday that she and green party parliamentarian werner schulz would challenge a decision to dissolve parliament in the country 's constitutional court because they wanted to serve their full terms which run until autumn 2006 . vote " faked " the opponents of the new elections argue that chancellor schröder 's vote of confidence was " faked " because the chancellor still had a majority in the parliament . the german constitution , which was adopted in 1949 , makes it deliberately difficult for early elections to be called , and only under extraordinary circumstances . one of the main goals of the 1949 constitution was to create conditions for political stability in the post-war period and prevent governments from rotating , the way they did in the 1920s and early 30s .
it is widely believed that the political instability of the period of the weimer republic , when german had no less than 12 chancellors , led to the rise of adolf hitler . germans eager for early elections the country , however , is very much in favor of new elections .
according to a recent poll , 73 percent of the population believes the elections are necessary .
a full 83 percent of germans believe the new elections will bring a change of government , although 76 percent also believe that the new conservative government would not do a better job than the ruling coalition of social democrats and the green party . if elections go ahead , schröder faces another headache with the creation of a new left-wing alliance which risks drawing working-class support away from the social democrats . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de background : federal constitutional court germany 's high court is the authority on upholding the country 's constitution and ensuring it 's laws are adhered to .

introduced in the wake of the september 2001 attacks on the us , the act grants the government unprecedented powers to investigate terror suspects .
some provisions are due to expire this year unless renewed by congress .
the legislation now goes before the senate .
opponents say many of its provisions infringe civil liberties .
in a late session on thursday , the house reauthorized the act by 257-171 .
the vote was largely split along party lines - with most republican in favour and most democrats against .
concerns the debate included frequent references to the london attacks earlier in the day . "
the patriot act is a key part of our effort to combat terrorism and protect the american people " george w bush the act gives officials greater access to educational , financial and medical records .
president george w bush welcomed the vote and said the legislation was vital .
" the patriot act is a key part of our efforts to combat terrorism and protect the american people , and the congress needs to send me a bill soon that renews the act without weakening our ability to fight terror , " he said on thursday .
however , during the debate many democrats voiced concern that the law could infringe civil liberties .
" the bill before us fails to assure accountability , " said house minority leader nancy pelosi .
" today , we are deciding whether the government will be accountable to the people , to the congress and to the courts for the exercise of its power . "

businesses , shops and homes in the area were evacuated for more than eight hours and surrounding roads were closed for much of the day .
overnight armed police officers guarded the entrance to the station .
police confirmed few details of the incident , saying only an attempt was made to set off an explosive device .
but one bbc correspondent was told that a suspect on a train used a handgun to try to detonate explosives in a rucksack .
a tube passenger said there was something on her train 's floor and she " could see something had exploded " .
the northern line passenger , who gave her name only as andrea , told the bbc she had heard a bang , and saw a man running away .

' acrid smoke ' " apparently a guy was running away so they tried to catch him .
some people saw him and they saw a small bomb explode in a bag , but it did n't hurt anybody , there was just loads and loads of smoke . "
the blast was on the northern line of the london underground another eyewitness also spoke of " champagne corks popping " and " acrid smoke " , and another of someone running from the station .
another said he was in the ticket hall when he heard screaming and an argument coming from the platform .
a man then came running out , being chased .
as he ran he was reportedly shouting , " what 's wrong with these people ? " .
the witness said he heard no explosion .

the announcement on thursday was widely seen as the first step towards the liberalisation of china 's currency .
the yuan will no longer be pegged to the dollar , but will float against a basket of currencies .
it will also appreciate against the dollar , mollifying critics who say a cheap yuan has helped chinese exports .
" i welcome china 's announcement today that it is adopting a more flexible exchange rate regime , " said us treasury secretary john snow in a statement .
" as we have said , reform of china 's currency regime is important for china and the international financial system . "
moving ' in tune ' mr snow said the us would watch china 's implementation of its new system , which will see the yuan float against a basket of currencies , rather than linking it at a fixed rate to the us dollar .
the change in china 's exchange rate regime announced today represents a move in the direction of greater exchange rate flexibility thomas c dawson , imf q & a : chinese revaluation china 's currency had been pegged at 8.28 against the dollar , but the new move effectively strengthens it by 2.1 % , to 8.11 to the dollar .
" the chinese have now put in place a system to allow their currency to move in tune with the global economy , " mr snow said .
meanwhile the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- said it was ready to " work with the authorities on the continuing evolution for the exchange rate system " .
after the announcement the euro came under pressure from a rallying japanese yen , which rallied sharply across the board - including against the us dollar .
japanese officials welcomed the yuan 's revaluation , saying it would benefit both the economies of china and japan .
the dollar dropped against several asian currencies following the chinese announcement , sinking from 112.50 yen to 110.38 yen , its lowest level since 30 june .
malaysian move criticism had been strongest in the us , where many blame china for the decline of domestic industry .
however the white house also welcomed the move , with presidential spokesman scott mcclellan saying : " we are encouraged by china 's announcement today that they are adopting a more flexible market-based currency system . "
and thomas c dawson , director of external relations at the imf said : " the change in china 's exchange rate regime announced today represents a move in the direction of greater exchange rate flexibility .
the chinese people 's money people 's bank of china establishes the renminbi , or people 's money , in december 1948 .
the currency is more commonly called the yuan .
the yuan is fixed at 2.42 to the dollar from 1953 to 1972 - the height of china 's soviet-style planned economy .
china introduces a dual track currency system .
the yuan is maintained for domestic use only , while foreigners are required to use foreign exchange certificates .
china adopts current account convertibility in 1996 .
the yuan trades in a narrow band of 8.28 to the dollar july 2005 : china announces a shake-up in the way it values its currency .
it ditches the dollar peg in favour of a basket of currencies .
" greater flexibility is very much in china 's best interest , as it would provide more room for monetary independence , enhancing the government 's ability to manage the economy .
" we would encourage the authorities to utilise fully the scope for flexibility in the new exchange rate arrangement . "
in an announcement on state television , the chinese government said that from friday the yuan would be allowed to trade in a tight range of 0.3 % against a basket of foreign currencies .
however , it did not indicate which currencies they would be .
in a move that seems to be coordinated with the chinese decision , malaysia has also scrapped its currency 's link with the dollar .
the malaysian ringgit had been pegged at 3.8 to the dollar since september 1998 , in the aftermath of the asian financial crisis .
tariffs threat malaysia 's central bank said it did not expect the currency to deviate widely from its current level against the dollar .
the chinese revaluation came a day after us federal reserve chairman alan greenspan warned that china faced a " very serious " risk to its economy if it did not allow its currency to rise in value .
senior us politicians had threatened to impose tariffs against china if it did not revalue the yuan .
however despite the warm reactions , some analysts reacted with some caution to beijing 's decision .
" this looks like a very minimalist move , " said mark cliffe , an economist with ing .

the south east wales race equality council -lrb- sewrec -rrb- said it had seen a " very big " rise in incidents .
it said the rate of abuse had risen from 10 incidents a month to more than 30 in just two weeks .
it also said most were happening in newport .
a hate letter was sent to a cardiff mosque this week , but incidents in the welsh capital appear to be fewer .
sewrec chief executive dave phillips said the organisation had reports of a rise in incidents such as verbal racial abuse , threatening telephone calls and even eggs being thrown at people leaving a mosque .
" there has been a very big increase and it is very worrying , " he said .
mr phillips said that sewrec operated its own scheme in which people could report racial incidents , a scheme separate from the one run by police .
there has been a very big increase and it is very worrying dave phillips , sewrec " there has been nothing as sinister as an actual assault , but the things that have been reported are very worrying , " he added .
" we have had reports of people being spat at , being called offensive names , there have even been threats against children .
it is very concerning . "
he said that although police figures did not indicate a rise in the number of incidents , he believed that it was not a true reflection of what was happening .
city mosque " people are very sceptical about what can actually be done about incidents like this and many people do n't see the benefit of reporting it to the police , " he said .
" often people feel more comfortable reporting such things to us instead . "
last year sewrec received 136 complaints of racial incidents but is expecting the figures to rise considerably for the next year .
but its counterpart in cardiff , race equality first , said there was a different picture in the capital .
a spokeswoman said they had not had an increase in the number of racial incidents reported to them .
however , animal parts and a hate letter were sent to a city mosque following the london bombs .
tolerance the situation in the south wales valleys appears to be similar to cardiff .
manny hothi from valleys race equality council said although reports of racial incidents made to them had not increased , there was anecdotal evidence to suggest that tolerance of people of other faiths was suffering .
he said : " there seems to be a lot of ignorance .
one of the staff members heard some people say they would n't get on a bus if there was an asian person on there with a bag for instance .
" people are expressing very negative and ignorant views which has an effect on the minority ethnic communities . "
but south wales police said that the number of reported racial incidents had not increased in the wake of the london bombings which killed 56 people .
gwent police said 36 racist incidents were reported to them between 7 july and 21 july .

after friday prayers , most worshippers express their condemnation as well as fear they could be the target of knee-jerk revenge attacks by racist whites after the 7 july bombs that rocked london .
some fear the worst could be yet to come , with hostility against the estimated 22,000 muslims in cardiff .

but many muslim inhabitants say cardiff has always been a better place to live , with a more tolerant population and less discrimination than other areas in the uk .

as london absorbs the shock of another attack , this is his view of race relations in wales .
in one of the oldest mosques in cardiff , there is a feeling of tension , which also hangs over the small district predominantly populated by arab and muslim immigrants .
after friday prayers , most worshippers express their condemnation as well as fear they could be the target of knee-jerk revenge attacks by racist whites after the 7 july bombs that rocked london .
some fear the worst could be yet to come , with hostility against the estimated 22,000 muslims in cardiff .
many muslim inhabitants say cardiff has always been a better place to live , with a more tolerant population and less discrimination after the first london blasts , the muslim council of britain said it had already received more than 1,000 e-mails containing threats and messages of hate .
but many muslim inhabitants say cardiff has always been a better place to live , with a more tolerant population and less discrimination than other areas in the uk .
the city now boasts 12 mosques to accommodate the growing number of muslim immigrants , mostly somalis and asians .
muslims in cardiff live side by side with old cardiff residents in several mixed areas - thanks to official cooperation and relative public receptiveness .
police set up cordons in london after the 21 july incidents local school curricula also give the students the chance to explore knowledge about islam and muslims .
and the local media are generally tolerant and relatively sensitive - evident in the care they took not to point any finger after the london attacks .
this widely claimed racial harmony in the city was apparent at friday prayers , when the preacher at the cardiff islamic centre , mohamed tolba , condemned in the strongest words the london bombings .
he said that the bombings targeted arabs and muslims in the uk , too , as these were the people who could bear the brunt of any reaction .
degree of integration in the streets of butetown , an inner city suburb of cardiff , immigrants look to have bigger concerns , including those related to their home countries , than their degree of integration into welsh society .
many immigrants come from hotspots and war zones , including iraq , afghanistan and the palestinian territories .
eisteddfod officials said more than any other region , next year they wanted participation from the middle east according to researchers , integration between different muslim groups living in cardiff is what is needed first .
while sudanese are more integrated , yemenis seem keener to preserve yemeni culture .
each of these and other communities tends to live near each other - fuelling fears that " ghettos " could develop populated only by immigrant communities .
several refugees in cardiff also face language hurdles and find it difficult to get a job until their applications for asylum have been settled - a process that can take as long as seven or eight years .
unemployment also pushes life to the extreme , with drug addiction and drug dealing thought to be becoming more prevalent in poor immigrant areas .
silence was observed across wales for the 7 july bomb victims the welsh and cardiff city governments try to address these problems with more urban regeneration - and sometimes with increased monitoring of immigrant areas and programmes to foster tolerance among welsh people .
one way of fostering tolerance is exposing residents to different cultures , including those of immigrant communities in wales .
in llangollen , in north wales , the international eisteddfod is held annually bringing together troupes from dozens of countries .
this year , the event drew 4,000 performers and visitors from 50 countries , but the festival has just a few arab countries participating .
eisteddfod officials said , however , that more than any other region , next year they wanted participation from the middle east .
cardiff has also just hosted another annual event , an international food and drinks festival bringing different countries ' dishes and brews .
interestingly , some local muslims have begun learning welsh to help in their assimilation .
no wonder that in the butetown mosque , sign directions and notice boards convey messages in arabic and welsh .
" as far as we are living in cymru , we have to be part and parcel of it , whatever different interests or concerns we have , " said mohamed tolba , preacher at the cardiff islamic centre .

experts say returning 440 hectares -lrb- 1,087 acres -rrb- of arable land at alkborough , north lincs , to the estuary will reduce flooding elsewhere .
the move will also create wetland habitats for local wildlife .
the scheme will be officially launched on friday by environment minister elliot morley and the land should start to flood again in late summer 2006 .
mr morley said taking down the flood defences at alkborough would reduce the risk of flooding in the inner humber and the tidal rivers that flow into it .
" such long-term solutions are essential if we are to protect the lives and homes of people who live and work in the area as well as the many businesses that are based around the estuary , " the minister added .
" we all know that the risks from flooding in the uk will increase as a result of the more extreme weather events prompted by climate change and it is important we are prepared . "

safety rules mean capacity has been halved for the opening friendly against fulham , but a 10,000 sell-out crowd will still pack into the £ 27m ground .
singers bonnie tyler and lisa scott lee will perform before kick-off and a good-luck message from hollywood star catherine zeta jones will be read out .
swansea city will share the ground with the ospreys rugby union team .
the stadium will mean a new routine for fans used to watching football at the vetch .
whereas the swans ' former ground was in easy walking distance of the city centre the new arena is out of town .

at the traditional drinking haunts around the vetch , landlords expect it to be quieter than normal on a match day .
but john lewis , who has run the clarence inn in the shadow of the east stand for 10 years , believes many regulars will still call on the way to the game .
when the league season kicks-off against tranmere rovers on 6 august , he will be running a double-decker bus up to the new ground in landore .

jackie seward , who runs the coopers arms , one of the closest pubs to the new stadium , said she was looking forward to saturday , but with slight trepidation .
" i hope it 's going to be a good thing and bring more trade for the area - not just my pub but all the other pubs and businesses , " she said .
" no-one knows how it is going to work out but it 's a beautiful stadium , it 's about time swansea had something like it , and i hope it 's going to be good for us . "

the stadium itself has its own bars , food stalls and lounges and functions rooms - a far cry from the facilities at the vetch .
