experts believe the government in berlin alone will have to borrow at least 35 billion euros this year to meet its expenditures , not counting the budget shortfalls of local and regional authorities . the chief negotiators for the christian union parties and the social democrats on monday reaffirmed their determination to drastically reduce the overall german deficit , nearing about 4 percent of gross national product this year .

" a difficult heritage " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel now has a better idea of germany 's budget gap " it 's a difficult heritage , but we are determined to overcome our financial problems , " she said .
" we have to take drastic measures to come back to a sustainable path that ensures a decent future for next generations .
there is a strong will but this task should n't be underestimated . " the enormous sum of 35 billion amounts to more than 10 percent of the german national budget .
merkel said that there would be no taboos when it comes to cutting expenditure but added that precise savings measures would be hammered out in bipartisan deliberations scheduled to last until mid-november . she also would n't rule out that taxes in germany would have to rise in order to meet the ambitious goal .
in their election campaign merkel 's cdu already announced a 2 percent hike in value added tax here to finance a reduction in german non-wage labor costs and to help consolidate the budget . not pointing the finger analysts now believe that merkel 's plan to reduce business taxes is most likely to be scrapped given the dire state of german public finances .
but on monday , the conservatives held back from laying the blame on outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder and his ruling social democrats . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel , müntefering and schröder now seem to get along merkel said the in spite of the bad news the talks were held in a positive atmosphere - a view shared by spd party leader franz müntefering who is scheduled to become labor minister in merkel 's cabinet . " the challenge is big , but confidence is not unfounded , " müntefering said .
" both sides showed a willingness to tackle the problems and move germany foward again . " national debt keeps growing with german state coffers almost empty , germans are bound to lose some cherished subsidies such as state money for private home builders and tax breaks for commuters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's national debt increases by the second but a future grand coalition government would also have to lay the ax to pensions and benefits for germany 's four million unemployed who make up the largest bulk of state expenditure . the third biggest chunk , with 38 billion euros , is interest on national debt .

they accuse the telecoms group of misleading them before two public share placements . the second round of a landmark lawsuit against german telecommunications giant deutsche telekom is set to begin tuesday , nearly one year after a preliminary hearing .
some 15,000 small investors divided into almost 2,200 groups are suing deutsche telekom for some 100 million euros -lrb- $ 119 million -rrb- . the focus of the suit is the shareholders ' claim that deutsch telekom deliberately misled them about the valuation of its property portfolio in stock exchange prospectuses for two public share placements during the height of the internet and dot-com boom in 1999 and 2000 .
at the end of the preliminary round of hearings last november , the small investors already booked a small victory when judge meinrad wösthoff criticized the methods used to value deutsche telekom 's vast real estate portfolio . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : telekom ceo kai-uwe ricke must face the ire of investors , a legacy of his predecessor the judge hit out at the company for valuing a huge portfolio of real estate comprising 35,000 buildings and plots of land en bloc rather than individually as required by german law .
the plaintiffs said the value of the properties was consistently overstated , inflating the book value of deutsche telekom itself , which in turn meant that investors paid a stiff premium for their shares . " people 's share " loses dramatically wösthoff said last year that the so-called " cluster " method of valuing property used by deutsche telekom did not correspond to the rules .
but he cautioned that that did not automatically mean that the valuations themselves were wrong . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : along with the dax , deutsche telekom shares plummeted in 2000-2002 the deutsche telekom court case is legally and logistically without precedent in germany .
the 15,000 small shareholders are suing the company because they feel they paid too much for shares bought when the former state-owned monopoly was privatized in the 1990s . it was only when deutsche telekom was forced to write down the value of its real estate holdings at the beginning of 2001 that shareholders became aware of the problem .
then investors quickly saw their savings go up in smoke as the news sent what germany had once proudly dubbed the " people 's share " into a long and precipitous slide on the stock market .
now , the pensioners and small-time savers who believed their hard-earned savings would be safe in europe 's biggest phone company want their money back . lots to blame in precedent setting case the roughly 15,000 investors have instructed 750 lawyers to file 2,200 separate lawsuits for a total of around 100 million euros in compensation .
no stone is being left unturned by the plaintiffs who are suing everyone involved in the privatization of deutsche telekom - the company itself and its former chief ron sommer , the government , the state-owned privatization vehicle kfw bank , and even the underwriting banks , such as deutsche bank . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investors want to return the bill to sender , deutsche telekom investors also feel cheated that they were not fully informed about the risks connected with deutsche telekom 's planned acquisition of us mobile phone operator voicestream barely a month after the third share offering in july 2000 .
in a takeover that many analysts called much too expensive , deutsche telekom paid more than $ 40 billion for voicestream , and it became another key factor behind the dizzying fall in the price of the german group 's shares . they lost almost 92 percent of their value , plunging from the giddy heights of a record 103.90 euros at the height of the internet boom to an all-time low of 8.59 euros on june 26 , 2002 . judge wösthoff said last november that those complaints were not justified .
the court also said that deutsche telekom 's former chief ron sommer could not be held responsible for the slide in the share price . dw staff / afp -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de judge criticizes telekom in first hearing german telecoms giant deutsche telekom was reprimanded by the judge overseeing the massive lawsuit brought against the company by 15,000 angry shareholders in the first court hearing on tuesday .

" the german health minister considers this a serious development and says the rise in hiv infections is worrying , " health ministry spokeswoman dagmar reitenbach told reporters .
" unfortunately , it is often the case that hiv / aids is no longer taken seriously as a life-threatening disease . " according to a report from the robert koch institute , the federal government 's disease control center , 1,164 people were infected in the first half of 2005 with the virus .
the institute said the hiv risk for males was roughly 7.5 times greater than for women and that most of the new infections were in males between the ages of 25 and 45 .
german cities such as berlin , hamburg , cologne and frankfurt have the highest risk of new infection , the report said .
gays ' hiv risk climbing about 40 million people worldwide are infected with hiv / aids , and africa is the hardest hit region with 25 million .
in the eu , infections are on the rise .
in germany , the infection rate was stable for years , remaining under 2,000 annually in a population of 82 million .
but in 2004 , the infection rate topped 2,000 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drug advances appear to cause people to be less concerned about hiv / aids woman make up about half of the number of the infected worldwide .
the most significant hiv risk factor for women in germany is sexual contact with males from other high-risk groups : men from countries with a high prevalence of hiv / aids , intravenous drug users and men who have had homosexual contact .
almost 60 percent of the new infections were among homosexual men , and the risk of infection among this group is almost twice as high as it was 12 years ago .
the head of the robert koch institute , reinhard kurth , said the news was worrying and that more attempts needed to be made to communicate to the populace that aids , despite improved therapies , is still an incurable disease .
he added that the new drug cocktails , that have proven effective in treating the symptoms of aids , have led to many taking the consequences of infection less seriously .
" more efforts must be made to explain and inform people that despite an improvement in therapy , there is no cure for this disease , " he said in a statement . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german aids foundation thinks positive when the german aids foundation presented its annual report in bonn on friday , it revealed that even in germany , one common side-effect of hiv infection is poverty .

the plaintiffs said the value of the properties was consistently overstated , inflating the book value of deutsche telekom itself , which in turn meant that investors paid a stiff premium for their shares . " people 's share " loses dramatically wösthoff said last year that the so-called " cluster " method of valuing property used by deutsche telekom did not correspond to the rules .
but he cautioned that that did not automatically mean that the valuations themselves were wrong . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : along with the dax , deutsche telekom shares plummeted in 2000-2002 the deutsche telekom court case is legally and logistically without precedent in germany .
the 15,000 small shareholders are suing the company because they feel they paid too much for shares bought when the former state-owned monopoly was privatized in the 1990s . it was only when deutsche telekom was forced to write down the value of its real estate holdings at the beginning of 2001 that shareholders became aware of the problem .
then investors quickly saw their savings go up in smoke as the news sent what germany had once proudly dubbed the " people 's share " into a long and precipitous slide on the stock market .
now , the pensioners and small-time savers who believed their hard-earned savings would be safe in europe 's biggest phone company want their money back . lots to blame in precedent setting case the roughly 15,000 investors have instructed 750 lawyers to file 2,200 separate lawsuits for a total of around 100 million euros in compensation .
no stone is being left unturned by the plaintiffs who are suing everyone involved in the privatization of deutsche telekom - the company itself and its former chief ron sommer , the government , the state-owned privatization vehicle kfw bank , and even the underwriting banks , such as deutsche bank . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investors want to return the bill to sender , deutsche telekom investors also feel cheated that they were not fully informed about the risks connected with deutsche telekom 's planned acquisition of us mobile phone operator voicestream barely a month after the third share offering in july 2000 .
in a takeover that many analysts called much too expensive , deutsche telekom paid more than $ 40 billion for voicestream , and it became another key factor behind the dizzying fall in the price of the german group 's shares . they lost almost 92 percent of their value , plunging from the giddy heights of a record 103.90 euros at the height of the internet boom to an all-time low of 8.59 euros on june 26 , 2002 . judge wösthoff said last november that those complaints were not justified .

fearing bird flu , germans stockpile meds germany -pipe- 25.10.2005 german poultry lockdown restarts cage controversy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most eggs in germany are still laid by caged-up chickens a mandatory measure to coop up poultry to prevent an outbreak of bird flu has taken effect in germany .
most farmers support the move but some worry it might lead to chickens being held in cages for longer than needed . for german geese , fall is traditionally a bad time of year : many of them end up on dining tables in celebration of st. martin 's day on nov .
11 .
but , this year the birds ' short lives are facing further curbs . the threat of an outbreak of bird flu in germany means they now have to spend their last days cooped up instead of waddling outdoors . acting german agricultural minister jürgen trittin has ordered the country 's poultry farmers to cage their animals to prevent possible infection with the virus by migratory birds . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no fans of indoor life " it 's an unusual situation for geese , which usually get to go outside and are now stuck in stables , " said gerald wehde , a spokesman for bioland , germany 's largest association of organic farmers .
" it 's stressful for them . " geese farmers themselves are probably not too relaxed , either .
many do n't have adequate enclosures for their poultry and are scrambling to adhere to trittin 's order , wehde said . no fi n a n cial harm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some farms keep chickens in " conservatories " during the curfew organic chicken farmers on the other hand do n't face the same problem , as most already have fence-like structures in place . they 're also unlikely to suffer financially . while the bird flu scare is n't likely to boost the overall consumption of poultry products in germany , the mandatory lockdown wo n't put an extra burden on them . compared to conventional farmers who already keep their animals in cages , organic and free-range chicken farms are allowed to continue to market their products as if their poultry stock were still running around outside . some oppositio n but not everyone is happy with the mandatory nationwide chicken caging , with some complaining it 's unnecessary harassment that has only scared people . " we think it is complete nonsense , " said reinhard jung , who represents an association of 300 family farms in the eastern state of brandenburg . " people behave as if the plague were about to strike , " he said , adding that he thinks the lockdown can not prevent animals from getting infected . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : free-range no more but most major famers ' associations , including bioland , back the lockdown as a sensible precaution to prevent the spread of bird flu . " it 's simply meant to protect the animals , " said dirk höppner of the umbrella organization for germany 's poultry industry . threate n i n g orga n ic farms ? bioland 's wehde , however , said he worried that the house arrest for chickens could reignite the debate about a german ban on caged chickens that 's meant to take effect in 2007 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conventional farmers agree that chicken cages should be phased out the bird flu scare " could discredit alternative forms of farming , " wehde said , referring to organic farming .
conventional farmers , who want to replace tiny cages with larger ones for several animals , could argue that keeping animals outside would pose too many risks . jung expressed similar concerns . " there 's a danger that appropriate farming methods that are slowly gaining ground will be pushed to the side again , " he said . far from it , said gert stuke , whose german breakfast egg company has about 4.8 million chickens producing eggs in conventional , organic and free-range farms . " we 're not going to play off farming methods against each other , " stuke said , adding that his firm backed so-called " mini aviaries " that can hold 60 animals .
about 90 percent of germany 's 40 million chickens in egg production are still kept in cages . caged u n til 2013 ? " we do n't want to keep the old cages , we 're responsible egg producers , and the mini aviaries are the best farming method , " stuke said , adding that german breakfast egg will still offer organic and free-range eggs as long as people want to buy them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are aviaries the solution ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 25.10.2005 telekom investors ' suit starts 2nd round großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investors are red in the face over the magenta telekom t the german telecommunications company deutsche telekom faces a lawsuit brought forth by some 15,000 small investors .
they accuse the telecoms group of misleading them before two public share placements . the second round of a landmark lawsuit against german telecommunications giant deutsche telekom is set to begin tuesday , nearly one year after a preliminary hearing .
some 15,000 small investors divided into almost 2,200 groups are suing deutsche telekom for some 100 million euros -lrb- $ 119 million -rrb- . the focus of the suit is the shareholders ' claim that deutsch telekom deliberately misled them about the valuation of its property portfolio in stock exchange prospectuses for two public share placements during the height of the internet and dot-com boom in 1999 and 2000 .
at the end of the preliminary round of hearings last november , the small investors already booked a small victory when judge meinrad wösthoff criticized the methods used to value deutsche telekom 's vast real estate portfolio . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : telekom ceo kai-uwe ricke must face the ire of investors , a legacy of his predecessor the judge hit out at the company for valuing a huge portfolio of real estate comprising 35,000 buildings and plots of land en bloc rather than individually as required by german law .
the plaintiffs said the value of the properties was consistently overstated , inflating the book value of deutsche telekom itself , which in turn meant that investors paid a stiff premium for their shares . " people 's share " loses dramatically wösthoff said last year that the so-called " cluster " method of valuing property used by deutsche telekom did not correspond to the rules .
but he cautioned that that did not automatically mean that the valuations themselves were wrong . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : along with the dax , deutsche telekom shares plummeted in 2000-2002 the deutsche telekom court case is legally and logistically without precedent in germany .
the 15,000 small shareholders are suing the company because they feel they paid too much for shares bought when the former state-owned monopoly was privatized in the 1990s . it was only when deutsche telekom was forced to write down the value of its real estate holdings at the beginning of 2001 that shareholders became aware of the problem .
then investors quickly saw their savings go up in smoke as the news sent what germany had once proudly dubbed the " people 's share " into a long and precipitous slide on the stock market .
now , the pensioners and small-time savers who believed their hard-earned savings would be safe in europe 's biggest phone company want their money back . lots to blame in precedent setting case the roughly 15,000 investors have instructed 750 lawyers to file 2,200 separate lawsuits for a total of around 100 million euros in compensation .
no stone is being left unturned by the plaintiffs who are suing everyone involved in the privatization of deutsche telekom - the company itself and its former chief ron sommer , the government , the state-owned privatization vehicle kfw bank , and even the underwriting banks , such as deutsche bank . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investors want to return the bill to sender , deutsche telekom investors also feel cheated that they were not fully informed about the risks connected with deutsche telekom 's planned acquisition of us mobile phone operator voicestream barely a month after the third share offering in july 2000 .
in a takeover that many analysts called much too expensive , deutsche telekom paid more than $ 40 billion for voicestream , and it became another key factor behind the dizzying fall in the price of the german group 's shares . they lost almost 92 percent of their value , plunging from the giddy heights of a record 103.90 euros at the height of the internet boom to an all-time low of 8.59 euros on june 26 , 2002 . judge wösthoff said last november that those complaints were not justified .
the court also said that deutsche telekom 's former chief ron sommer could not be held responsible for the slide in the share price . dw staff / afp -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de judge criticizes telekom in first hearing german telecoms giant deutsche telekom was reprimanded by the judge overseeing the massive lawsuit brought against the company by 15,000 angry shareholders in the first court hearing on tuesday .

they accuse the telecoms group of misleading them before two public share placements . the second round of a landmark lawsuit against german telecommunications giant deutsche telekom is set to begin tuesday , nearly one year after a preliminary hearing .
some 15,000 small investors divided into almost 2,200 groups are suing deutsche telekom for some 100 million euros -lrb- $ 119 million -rrb- . the focus of the suit is the shareholders ' claim that deutsch telekom deliberately misled them about the valuation of its property portfolio in stock exchange prospectuses for two public share placements during the height of the internet and dot-com boom in 1999 and 2000 .
at the end of the preliminary round of hearings last november , the small investors already booked a small victory when judge meinrad wösthoff criticized the methods used to value deutsche telekom 's vast real estate portfolio . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : telekom ceo kai-uwe ricke must face the ire of investors , a legacy of his predecessor the judge hit out at the company for valuing a huge portfolio of real estate comprising 35,000 buildings and plots of land en bloc rather than individually as required by german law .
the plaintiffs said the value of the properties was consistently overstated , inflating the book value of deutsche telekom itself , which in turn meant that investors paid a stiff premium for their shares . " people 's share " loses dramatically wösthoff said last year that the so-called " cluster " method of valuing property used by deutsche telekom did not correspond to the rules .
but he cautioned that that did not automatically mean that the valuations themselves were wrong . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : along with the dax , deutsche telekom shares plummeted in 2000-2002 the deutsche telekom court case is legally and logistically without precedent in germany .
the 15,000 small shareholders are suing the company because they feel they paid too much for shares bought when the former state-owned monopoly was privatized in the 1990s . it was only when deutsche telekom was forced to write down the value of its real estate holdings at the beginning of 2001 that shareholders became aware of the problem .
then investors quickly saw their savings go up in smoke as the news sent what germany had once proudly dubbed the " people 's share " into a long and precipitous slide on the stock market .
now , the pensioners and small-time savers who believed their hard-earned savings would be safe in europe 's biggest phone company want their money back . lots to blame in precedent setting case the roughly 15,000 investors have instructed 750 lawyers to file 2,200 separate lawsuits for a total of around 100 million euros in compensation .
no stone is being left unturned by the plaintiffs who are suing everyone involved in the privatization of deutsche telekom - the company itself and its former chief ron sommer , the government , the state-owned privatization vehicle kfw bank , and even the underwriting banks , such as deutsche bank . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investors want to return the bill to sender , deutsche telekom investors also feel cheated that they were not fully informed about the risks connected with deutsche telekom 's planned acquisition of us mobile phone operator voicestream barely a month after the third share offering in july 2000 .
in a takeover that many analysts called much too expensive , deutsche telekom paid more than $ 40 billion for voicestream , and it became another key factor behind the dizzying fall in the price of the german group 's shares . they lost almost 92 percent of their value , plunging from the giddy heights of a record 103.90 euros at the height of the internet boom to an all-time low of 8.59 euros on june 26 , 2002 . judge wösthoff said last november that those complaints were not justified .
the court also said that deutsche telekom 's former chief ron sommer could not be held responsible for the slide in the share price . dw staff / afp -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de judge criticizes telekom in first hearing german telecoms giant deutsche telekom was reprimanded by the judge overseeing the massive lawsuit brought against the company by 15,000 angry shareholders in the first court hearing on tuesday .

experts believe the government in berlin alone will have to borrow at least 35 billion euros this year to meet its expenditures , not counting the budget shortfalls of local and regional authorities . the chief negotiators for the christian union parties and the social democrats on monday reaffirmed their determination to drastically reduce the overall german deficit , nearing about 4 percent of gross national product this year .

" we have to take drastic measures to come back to a sustainable path that ensures a decent future for next generations .
there is a strong will but this task should n't be underestimated . " the enormous sum of 35 billion amounts to more than 10 percent of the german national budget .
merkel said that there would be no taboos when it comes to cutting expenditure but added that precise savings measures would be hammered out in bipartisan deliberations scheduled to last until mid-november . she also would n't rule out that taxes in germany would have to rise in order to meet the ambitious goal .
in their election campaign merkel 's cdu already announced a 2 percent hike in value added tax here to finance a reduction in german non-wage labor costs and to help consolidate the budget . not pointing the finger analysts now believe that merkel 's plan to reduce business taxes is most likely to be scrapped given the dire state of german public finances .
but on monday , the conservatives held back from laying the blame on outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder and his ruling social democrats . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel , müntefering and schröder now seem to get along merkel said the in spite of the bad news the talks were held in a positive atmosphere - a view shared by spd party leader franz müntefering who is scheduled to become labor minister in merkel 's cabinet . " the challenge is big , but confidence is not unfounded , " müntefering said .
" both sides showed a willingness to tackle the problems and move germany foward again .

" the german health minister considers this a serious development and says the rise in hiv infections is worrying , " health ministry spokeswoman dagmar reitenbach told reporters .
" unfortunately , it is often the case that hiv / aids is no longer taken seriously as a life-threatening disease . " according to a report from the robert koch institute , the federal government 's disease control center , 1,164 people were infected in the first half of 2005 with the virus .
the institute said the hiv risk for males was roughly 7.5 times greater than for women and that most of the new infections were in males between the ages of 25 and 45 .

"
he said it " gives romania the chance to join the eu on january 1 , 2007 . " " the report should not lead us to rejoicing or sadness .
we must remain vigilant , ready to meet what is required for joining in 2007 , " basescu said . he said romania would " feel the benefits of joining the eu only when it is a full member " and that " up until this moment romanians must pay the price of joining . " basescu called on legal officials and police to fight corruption , as the eu demands .
he said they should have " zero tolerance " for corruption . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ivaylo kalfin assured the eu that bulgaria would do what was needed .

"
he said it " gives romania the chance to join the eu on january 1 , 2007 . " " the report should not lead us to rejoicing or sadness .
we must remain vigilant , ready to meet what is required for joining in 2007 , " basescu said . he said romania would " feel the benefits of joining the eu only when it is a full member " and that " up until this moment romanians must pay the price of joining . " basescu called on legal officials and police to fight corruption , as the eu demands .
he said they should have " zero tolerance " for corruption . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ivaylo kalfin assured the eu that bulgaria would do what was needed .
in sofia , bulgarian foreign minister ivaylo kalfin said : " both countries fully understand our responsibility in the months left ahead of our accession into the eu .
we accept the report as a partner 's assessment and will fully focus on implementing what has been negotiated , " kalfin said . progress needed to ensure accession the two former communist states are on track to join the eu as planned in 2007 , the eu 's executive announced on tuesday , but warned the eastern european states to make further progress on reforms . the two balkan states are doing too little to fight corruption , the european commission said , in annual progress reports on their eu membership suitability , amid speculation that their entry could be delayed by a year . the reports stated that there were " serious concerns " in areas accounting for around ten percent of eu legislation , where " unless immediate action is taken the countries will not be ready for accession " .
brussels is also concerned about administrative capacity , where the commission said " overall reform of administrative structures " needs to be stepped up in order for both romania and bulgaria to be able to absorb eu funds .
other areas which needed to be addressed were the shortcomings in the veterinary field , which may " put at risk food safety " in the eu , and the level of corruption in the two countries " particularly at a high level " .
commission threatens year-long delays bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olli rehn said the eu would not hesitate to implement delays .
before the talks , european enlargement commissioner olli rehn said the commission would not hesitate to delay the scheduled accession if reform efforts in the key areas fail .
romania and bulgaria signed their accession treaties on april 25 this year , but these treaties contain a unique clause which gives the european commission the option to delay the 2007 entry date until 2008 if entry preparations are insufficient .
rehn added that brussels would " not hesitate " to make use of the option in its recommendation on the entry date to eu member states .
" we may recommend , if needed , to postpone accession by one year " , he said .
" the possibility of being ready in 2007 is not lost , but making it will require a lot of work . ” the commission is due to meet to discuss the two countries ’ entry date in may or april next year .
bulgaria slips from lead in race with neighbor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traian basescu 's romania has " caught up impressively . "
these warnings , known in accession speak as " yellow cards " , come as a particular blow to bulgaria .
it has been widely accepted that the bulgarians have always been ahead of their neighbor romania in their eu preparation , but a close general election result in june plunged the country in a reform deadlock .

make sure you are where you say you are in their coalition talks , the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have agreed to get tough on abuse of germany 's reformed unemployment regulations , known as hartz iv . the cost of germany 's labor market reform is almost double the amount originally planned - 26 billion instead of the estimated 14 billion euros .
spd head franz müntefering said the hike could partly be attributed to the fact that local authorities transferred more of the old system 's welfare recipients into the new hartz iv unemployment benefit scheme than expected .
but politicians are also lashing out at benefit cheats , announcing plans to step up controls on fraudulent claims .
the discussion has taken on a virulent tone , with a report posted on the economics and labor ministry 's web site indirectly comparing welfare recipients to parasites .
the report contains a detailed list of real life examples of benefit cheats , referring to them as " freeloaders " and " spongers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement 's ministry indirectly compared people on benefit to parasites peter clever , the deputy head of the board of directors for the federal labor office told broadcaster deutschlandfunk that , in random telephone checks since july on 390,000 hartz iv recipients , 170,000 could not be reached , despite 10 phone calls being made at different times of the day and different days of the week .
" you 'd have to be really naïve to believe that all 170,000 people happened to be in job interviews at the time , " clever said . the economics and labor ministry said it intends to step up telephone checks as well as other forms of control in the future .
a spokeswoman from the ministry said that welfare recipients have a duty to cooperate with their local authorities and must be available for consultation . housing benefit open to fraud bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : state subsidized housing has been identified as a major area open to abuse experts say that subsidized housing under hartz iv is one of the biggest sources of welfare abuse .
a long-term unemployed person on welfare support can have an " appropriate " apartment -lrb- for example , up to 50 square meters of living space for a single person or 70 square meters for two people -rrb- including heat and electricity , completely paid for by the state . the problem is that many welfare recipients are moving into these " appropriate " apartments on paper only .
for that reason , housing benefit should only be paid to young adults living alone if their parents ' income is insufficient , the director of the german association of local authorities , gerd landsberg , told the osnabrücker zeitung .
young people who qualify as long-term unemployed should be required to prove that they need their own apartment in order to take up job training or other qualification measures , landsberg said . politicians are now calling for further reforms to hartz iv in order to cut back on the number of households claiming state-subsidized housing . interest groups , charities outraged an internet forum for the unemployed -lrb- erwerbslosen forum deutschland -rrb- has reacted angrily to the accusations made by the labor ministry , claiming it is looking for a scapegoat to draw attention away from its past failure to clamp down on welfare fraud . germany 's main social and charitable organizations also protested against accusations of welfare abuse , saying the cost of labor market reform was set at an unreasonably low level to begin with .

make sure you are where you say you are in their coalition talks , the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have agreed to get tough on abuse of germany 's reformed unemployment regulations , known as hartz iv . the cost of germany 's labor market reform is almost double the amount originally planned - 26 billion instead of the estimated 14 billion euros .
spd head franz müntefering said the hike could partly be attributed to the fact that local authorities transferred more of the old system 's welfare recipients into the new hartz iv unemployment benefit scheme than expected .
but politicians are also lashing out at benefit cheats , announcing plans to step up controls on fraudulent claims .
the discussion has taken on a virulent tone , with a report posted on the economics and labor ministry 's web site indirectly comparing welfare recipients to parasites .
the report contains a detailed list of real life examples of benefit cheats , referring to them as " freeloaders " and " spongers . "

a german-based artist from new zealand might have found an answer to the problem . as a 17-year-old exchange student from new zealand , joanne moar initially felt pretty lost at the other end of the world .
she 'd come to hamburg with very little german and a very different childhood and youth experience . when her friends got giggly about a party game that involves unwrapping a chocolate bar parcel while wearing gloves and using cutlery , she did n't really know how to react .
she had no idea that " hui bu , the castle ghost " was a popular audio play on tape german kids listened to .
moar had also never heard of harry potter 's german predecessor winnetou , the native american hero of novels by author karl may . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : generations of german boys have looked up to winnetou " i could n't connect to them on that level , " moar said .
" i did n't share these memories . " now 34 years old , moar has since spent more than a decade in germany and speaks the language without a hint of an accent .
a german childhood was still lacking , however , so moar decided to search for one . collecting memories she devised an art project called " becoming german " and set out to collect childhood memories from her adopted countrymen and women .

they accuse the telecoms group of misleading them before two public share placements . the second round of a landmark lawsuit against german telecommunications giant deutsche telekom is set to begin tuesday , nearly one year after a preliminary hearing .
some 15,000 small investors divided into almost 2,200 groups are suing deutsche telekom for some 100 million euros -lrb- $ 119 million -rrb- . the focus of the suit is the shareholders ' claim that deutsch telekom deliberately misled them about the valuation of its property portfolio in stock exchange prospectuses for two public share placements during the height of the internet and dot-com boom in 1999 and 2000 .
at the end of the preliminary round of hearings last november , the small investors already booked a small victory when judge meinrad wösthoff criticized the methods used to value deutsche telekom 's vast real estate portfolio . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : telekom ceo kai-uwe ricke must face the ire of investors , a legacy of his predecessor the judge hit out at the company for valuing a huge portfolio of real estate comprising 35,000 buildings and plots of land en bloc rather than individually as required by german law .
the plaintiffs said the value of the properties was consistently overstated , inflating the book value of deutsche telekom itself , which in turn meant that investors paid a stiff premium for their shares . " people 's share " loses dramatically wösthoff said last year that the so-called " cluster " method of valuing property used by deutsche telekom did not correspond to the rules .
but he cautioned that that did not automatically mean that the valuations themselves were wrong . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : along with the dax , deutsche telekom shares plummeted in 2000-2002 the deutsche telekom court case is legally and logistically without precedent in germany .
the 15,000 small shareholders are suing the company because they feel they paid too much for shares bought when the former state-owned monopoly was privatized in the 1990s . it was only when deutsche telekom was forced to write down the value of its real estate holdings at the beginning of 2001 that shareholders became aware of the problem .
then investors quickly saw their savings go up in smoke as the news sent what germany had once proudly dubbed the " people 's share " into a long and precipitous slide on the stock market .
now , the pensioners and small-time savers who believed their hard-earned savings would be safe in europe 's biggest phone company want their money back . lots to blame in precedent setting case the roughly 15,000 investors have instructed 750 lawyers to file 2,200 separate lawsuits for a total of around 100 million euros in compensation .
no stone is being left unturned by the plaintiffs who are suing everyone involved in the privatization of deutsche telekom - the company itself and its former chief ron sommer , the government , the state-owned privatization vehicle kfw bank , and even the underwriting banks , such as deutsche bank . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investors want to return the bill to sender , deutsche telekom investors also feel cheated that they were not fully informed about the risks connected with deutsche telekom 's planned acquisition of us mobile phone operator voicestream barely a month after the third share offering in july 2000 .
in a takeover that many analysts called much too expensive , deutsche telekom paid more than $ 40 billion for voicestream , and it became another key factor behind the dizzying fall in the price of the german group 's shares . they lost almost 92 percent of their value , plunging from the giddy heights of a record 103.90 euros at the height of the internet boom to an all-time low of 8.59 euros on june 26 , 2002 . judge wösthoff said last november that those complaints were not justified .
the court also said that deutsche telekom 's former chief ron sommer could not be held responsible for the slide in the share price . dw staff / afp -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de judge criticizes telekom in first hearing german telecoms giant deutsche telekom was reprimanded by the judge overseeing the massive lawsuit brought against the company by 15,000 angry shareholders in the first court hearing on tuesday .

they accuse the telecoms group of misleading them before two public share placements . the second round of a landmark lawsuit against german telecommunications giant deutsche telekom is set to begin tuesday , nearly one year after a preliminary hearing .
some 15,000 small investors divided into almost 2,200 groups are suing deutsche telekom for some 100 million euros -lrb- $ 119 million -rrb- . the focus of the suit is the shareholders ' claim that deutsch telekom deliberately misled them about the valuation of its property portfolio in stock exchange prospectuses for two public share placements during the height of the internet and dot-com boom in 1999 and 2000 .
at the end of the preliminary round of hearings last november , the small investors already booked a small victory when judge meinrad wösthoff criticized the methods used to value deutsche telekom 's vast real estate portfolio . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : telekom ceo kai-uwe ricke must face the ire of investors , a legacy of his predecessor the judge hit out at the company for valuing a huge portfolio of real estate comprising 35,000 buildings and plots of land en bloc rather than individually as required by german law .
the plaintiffs said the value of the properties was consistently overstated , inflating the book value of deutsche telekom itself , which in turn meant that investors paid a stiff premium for their shares . " people 's share " loses dramatically wösthoff said last year that the so-called " cluster " method of valuing property used by deutsche telekom did not correspond to the rules .
but he cautioned that that did not automatically mean that the valuations themselves were wrong . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : along with the dax , deutsche telekom shares plummeted in 2000-2002 the deutsche telekom court case is legally and logistically without precedent in germany .
the 15,000 small shareholders are suing the company because they feel they paid too much for shares bought when the former state-owned monopoly was privatized in the 1990s . it was only when deutsche telekom was forced to write down the value of its real estate holdings at the beginning of 2001 that shareholders became aware of the problem .
then investors quickly saw their savings go up in smoke as the news sent what germany had once proudly dubbed the " people 's share " into a long and precipitous slide on the stock market .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 25.10.2005 telekom investors ' suit starts 2nd round großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investors are red in the face over the magenta telekom t the german telecommunications company deutsche telekom faces a lawsuit brought forth by some 15,000 small investors .
they accuse the telecoms group of misleading them before two public share placements . the second round of a landmark lawsuit against german telecommunications giant deutsche telekom is set to begin tuesday , nearly one year after a preliminary hearing .
some 15,000 small investors divided into almost 2,200 groups are suing deutsche telekom for some 100 million euros -lrb- $ 119 million -rrb- . the focus of the suit is the shareholders ' claim that deutsch telekom deliberately misled them about the valuation of its property portfolio in stock exchange prospectuses for two public share placements during the height of the internet and dot-com boom in 1999 and 2000 .
at the end of the preliminary round of hearings last november , the small investors already booked a small victory when judge meinrad wösthoff criticized the methods used to value deutsche telekom 's vast real estate portfolio . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : telekom ceo kai-uwe ricke must face the ire of investors , a legacy of his predecessor the judge hit out at the company for valuing a huge portfolio of real estate comprising 35,000 buildings and plots of land en bloc rather than individually as required by german law .
the plaintiffs said the value of the properties was consistently overstated , inflating the book value of deutsche telekom itself , which in turn meant that investors paid a stiff premium for their shares . " people 's share " loses dramatically wösthoff said last year that the so-called " cluster " method of valuing property used by deutsche telekom did not correspond to the rules .
but he cautioned that that did not automatically mean that the valuations themselves were wrong . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : along with the dax , deutsche telekom shares plummeted in 2000-2002 the deutsche telekom court case is legally and logistically without precedent in germany .
the 15,000 small shareholders are suing the company because they feel they paid too much for shares bought when the former state-owned monopoly was privatized in the 1990s . it was only when deutsche telekom was forced to write down the value of its real estate holdings at the beginning of 2001 that shareholders became aware of the problem .

they accuse the telecoms group of misleading them before two public share placements . the second round of a landmark lawsuit against german telecommunications giant deutsche telekom is set to begin tuesday , nearly one year after a preliminary hearing .
some 15,000 small investors divided into almost 2,200 groups are suing deutsche telekom for some 100 million euros -lrb- $ 119 million -rrb- . the focus of the suit is the shareholders ' claim that deutsch telekom deliberately misled them about the valuation of its property portfolio in stock exchange prospectuses for two public share placements during the height of the internet and dot-com boom in 1999 and 2000 .
at the end of the preliminary round of hearings last november , the small investors already booked a small victory when judge meinrad wösthoff criticized the methods used to value deutsche telekom 's vast real estate portfolio . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : telekom ceo kai-uwe ricke must face the ire of investors , a legacy of his predecessor the judge hit out at the company for valuing a huge portfolio of real estate comprising 35,000 buildings and plots of land en bloc rather than individually as required by german law .
the plaintiffs said the value of the properties was consistently overstated , inflating the book value of deutsche telekom itself , which in turn meant that investors paid a stiff premium for their shares . " people 's share " loses dramatically wösthoff said last year that the so-called " cluster " method of valuing property used by deutsche telekom did not correspond to the rules .
but he cautioned that that did not automatically mean that the valuations themselves were wrong . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : along with the dax , deutsche telekom shares plummeted in 2000-2002 the deutsche telekom court case is legally and logistically without precedent in germany .
the 15,000 small shareholders are suing the company because they feel they paid too much for shares bought when the former state-owned monopoly was privatized in the 1990s . it was only when deutsche telekom was forced to write down the value of its real estate holdings at the beginning of 2001 that shareholders became aware of the problem .

they said it would not be clear whether the birds had died from a virus until tuesday evening at the earliest , and that it would be several days before scientists knew whether the virus were dangerous . " nothing has been proven yet , " said a spokeswoman from the state environment ministry , adding that dead birds were not a rarity and that there is no cause for panic . the dead geese were found on a pond that serves as a resting place for migratory birds .
police officers at the scene reported seeing several of the birds die while suffering severe cramping .
the geese were sharing the pond with other types of birds , which showed no signs of the illness .

could der kaiser be looking for some holy help ? the german national soccer team 's recent slew of mediocre results in their preparation games ahead of the world cup in 2006 are really causing concern for the host country . with public denunciations of coach jürgen klinsmann 's ability to lead germany to glory rife over the past few months , those who have a vested interest in seeing the hosts do well are doing everything in their power to summon help . germany looking for some help from above bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi will meet with beckenbauer and his entourage .
first it was announced that the german team would have its own priest during the soccer spectacle and that special church services would be arranged during the world cup for fans to offer their prayers of hope .
now , franz beckenbauer , the head of the german organizing committee -lrb- ok -rrb- , is heading to the vatican for an audience with pope benedict xvi . although the meeting with the pontiff is being included in beckenbauer 's world cup welcome tour , many detractors of the german team and their chances may see it as a chance for the concerned chairman to call on some divine intervention from a very connected source . " der kaiser , " as beckenbauer is known , has already visited tehran , riyadh , seoul and tokyo as part of the tour that will eventually see him visit all 32 countries that have qualified for the world cup by february 2006 . vatican visit arranged after turkey , china debacles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's nuri sahin scored the second goal in germany 's 2-0 defeat .
conspiracy theorists may read much into the fact that the audience has been hastily organized ; germany lost to turkey and just squeezed past china in friendly games this month . " our request to the vatican to meet the holy father was made quite late , " admitted beckenbauer .
" for that reason we are delighted and grateful that this meeting is now possible . " it is unlikely that any plea for a word in germany 's favor from the pope will be made public after beckenbauer , ok vice-president wolfgang niersbach , advisor fedor h. radmann and germany 's former coach rudi völler depart from the vatican . but a reversal of the team 's fortunes after the visit may cause some to look to the heavens and offer thanks . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany considers offers of holy guidance the german soccer team are being inundated with offers of divine guidance during the world cup .

" said the professor of education at the university of münster . opera lovers of the world , unite but while it 's nice to walk down childhood-memory lane with others , wenning said that similar social backgrounds often played a much more important role than the country of origin when it comes to the ability to communicate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visiting london 's covent garden wo n't shock japanese opera lovers " if i 'm used to going to the opera , it does n't really matter which country i 'm in , " wenning said .
" differences within cultures are always bigger than those between cultures . " he added that other factors such as geography also play a role .

" many times i was in the situation where i did n't know what people were talking about , " she said .
" but it always depends on how one deals with the situation .

11 .
but , this year the birds ' short lives are facing further curbs . the threat of an outbreak of bird flu in germany means they now have to spend their last days cooped up instead of waddling outdoors . acting german agricultural minister jürgen trittin has ordered the country 's poultry farmers to cage their animals to prevent possible infection with the virus by migratory birds . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no fans of indoor life " it 's an unusual situation for geese , which usually get to go outside and are now stuck in stables , " said gerald wehde , a spokesman for bioland , germany 's largest association of organic farmers .

" we think it is complete nonsense , " said reinhard jung , who represents an association of 300 family farms in the eastern state of brandenburg . " people behave as if the plague were about to strike , " he said , adding that he thinks the lockdown can not prevent animals from getting infected . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : free-range no more but most major famers ' associations , including bioland , back the lockdown as a sensible precaution to prevent the spread of bird flu .

conventional farmers , who want to replace tiny cages with larger ones for several animals , could argue that keeping animals outside would pose too many risks . jung expressed similar concerns . " there 's a danger that appropriate farming methods that are slowly gaining ground will be pushed to the side again , " he said . far from it , said gert stuke , whose german breakfast egg company has about 4.8 million chickens producing eggs in conventional , organic and free-range farms . " we 're not going to play off farming methods against each other , " stuke said , adding that his firm backed so-called " mini aviaries " that can hold 60 animals .
about 90 percent of germany 's 40 million chickens in egg production are still kept in cages . caged u n til 2013 ? " we do n't want to keep the old cages , we 're responsible egg producers , and the mini aviaries are the best farming method , " stuke said , adding that german breakfast egg will still offer organic and free-range eggs as long as people want to buy them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are aviaries the solution ?
so far , the mini aviaries have not been approved as an alternative farming method .
stuke has only been able to try them out on a test farm .
but along with other conventional egg producers , he hopes the incoming government of christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and social democrats will change that in the near future . that could well turn out to be the case . " we want to allow for a transition period to give chicken farmers the opportunity to switch to aviaries , " said peter bleser , the cdu 's agriculture spokesman , adding there was no connection between the bird flu and the debate about chicken cages . theoretically cages could stay until 2012 , when an eu-wide ban takes effect . mathis winkler , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu considers wild bird import ban the european commission is facing increasing pressure to ban all wild bird imports after new cases of bird flu appeared in russia , croatia and british quarantine .

" it 's simply meant to protect the animals , " said dirk höppner of the umbrella organization for germany 's poultry industry . threate n i n g orga n ic farms ? bioland 's wehde , however , said he worried that the house arrest for chickens could reignite the debate about a german ban on caged chickens that 's meant to take effect in 2007 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conventional farmers agree that chicken cages should be phased out the bird flu scare " could discredit alternative forms of farming , " wehde said , referring to organic farming .
conventional farmers , who want to replace tiny cages with larger ones for several animals , could argue that keeping animals outside would pose too many risks . jung expressed similar concerns . " there 's a danger that appropriate farming methods that are slowly gaining ground will be pushed to the side again , " he said . far from it , said gert stuke , whose german breakfast egg company has about 4.8 million chickens producing eggs in conventional , organic and free-range farms . " we 're not going to play off farming methods against each other , " stuke said , adding that his firm backed so-called " mini aviaries " that can hold 60 animals .
about 90 percent of germany 's 40 million chickens in egg production are still kept in cages . caged u n til 2013 ? " we do n't want to keep the old cages , we 're responsible egg producers , and the mini aviaries are the best farming method , " stuke said , adding that german breakfast egg will still offer organic and free-range eggs as long as people want to buy them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are aviaries the solution ?
so far , the mini aviaries have not been approved as an alternative farming method .
stuke has only been able to try them out on a test farm .
but along with other conventional egg producers , he hopes the incoming government of christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and social democrats will change that in the near future . that could well turn out to be the case . " we want to allow for a transition period to give chicken farmers the opportunity to switch to aviaries , " said peter bleser , the cdu 's agriculture spokesman , adding there was no connection between the bird flu and the debate about chicken cages . theoretically cages could stay until 2012 , when an eu-wide ban takes effect . mathis winkler , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu considers wild bird import ban the european commission is facing increasing pressure to ban all wild bird imports after new cases of bird flu appeared in russia , croatia and british quarantine .

they accuse the telecoms group of misleading them before two public share placements . the second round of a landmark lawsuit against german telecommunications giant deutsche telekom is set to begin tuesday , nearly one year after a preliminary hearing .
some 15,000 small investors divided into almost 2,200 groups are suing deutsche telekom for some 100 million euros -lrb- $ 119 million -rrb- . the focus of the suit is the shareholders ' claim that deutsch telekom deliberately misled them about the valuation of its property portfolio in stock exchange prospectuses for two public share placements during the height of the internet and dot-com boom in 1999 and 2000 .
at the end of the preliminary round of hearings last november , the small investors already booked a small victory when judge meinrad wösthoff criticized the methods used to value deutsche telekom 's vast real estate portfolio . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : telekom ceo kai-uwe ricke must face the ire of investors , a legacy of his predecessor the judge hit out at the company for valuing a huge portfolio of real estate comprising 35,000 buildings and plots of land en bloc rather than individually as required by german law .
the plaintiffs said the value of the properties was consistently overstated , inflating the book value of deutsche telekom itself , which in turn meant that investors paid a stiff premium for their shares . " people 's share " loses dramatically wösthoff said last year that the so-called " cluster " method of valuing property used by deutsche telekom did not correspond to the rules .
but he cautioned that that did not automatically mean that the valuations themselves were wrong . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : along with the dax , deutsche telekom shares plummeted in 2000-2002 the deutsche telekom court case is legally and logistically without precedent in germany .
the 15,000 small shareholders are suing the company because they feel they paid too much for shares bought when the former state-owned monopoly was privatized in the 1990s . it was only when deutsche telekom was forced to write down the value of its real estate holdings at the beginning of 2001 that shareholders became aware of the problem .
then investors quickly saw their savings go up in smoke as the news sent what germany had once proudly dubbed the " people 's share " into a long and precipitous slide on the stock market .
now , the pensioners and small-time savers who believed their hard-earned savings would be safe in europe 's biggest phone company want their money back . lots to blame in precedent setting case the roughly 15,000 investors have instructed 750 lawyers to file 2,200 separate lawsuits for a total of around 100 million euros in compensation .
no stone is being left unturned by the plaintiffs who are suing everyone involved in the privatization of deutsche telekom - the company itself and its former chief ron sommer , the government , the state-owned privatization vehicle kfw bank , and even the underwriting banks , such as deutsche bank . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investors want to return the bill to sender , deutsche telekom investors also feel cheated that they were not fully informed about the risks connected with deutsche telekom 's planned acquisition of us mobile phone operator voicestream barely a month after the third share offering in july 2000 .
in a takeover that many analysts called much too expensive , deutsche telekom paid more than $ 40 billion for voicestream , and it became another key factor behind the dizzying fall in the price of the german group 's shares . they lost almost 92 percent of their value , plunging from the giddy heights of a record 103.90 euros at the height of the internet boom to an all-time low of 8.59 euros on june 26 , 2002 . judge wösthoff said last november that those complaints were not justified .

" the german health minister considers this a serious development and says the rise in hiv infections is worrying , " health ministry spokeswoman dagmar reitenbach told reporters .
" unfortunately , it is often the case that hiv / aids is no longer taken seriously as a life-threatening disease . " according to a report from the robert koch institute , the federal government 's disease control center , 1,164 people were infected in the first half of 2005 with the virus .
the institute said the hiv risk for males was roughly 7.5 times greater than for women and that most of the new infections were in males between the ages of 25 and 45 .
german cities such as berlin , hamburg , cologne and frankfurt have the highest risk of new infection , the report said .
gays ' hiv risk climbing about 40 million people worldwide are infected with hiv / aids , and africa is the hardest hit region with 25 million .
in the eu , infections are on the rise .
in germany , the infection rate was stable for years , remaining under 2,000 annually in a population of 82 million .
but in 2004 , the infection rate topped 2,000 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drug advances appear to cause people to be less concerned about hiv / aids woman make up about half of the number of the infected worldwide .
the most significant hiv risk factor for women in germany is sexual contact with males from other high-risk groups : men from countries with a high prevalence of hiv / aids , intravenous drug users and men who have had homosexual contact .
almost 60 percent of the new infections were among homosexual men , and the risk of infection among this group is almost twice as high as it was 12 years ago .
the head of the robert koch institute , reinhard kurth , said the news was worrying and that more attempts needed to be made to communicate to the populace that aids , despite improved therapies , is still an incurable disease .
he added that the new drug cocktails , that have proven effective in treating the symptoms of aids , have led to many taking the consequences of infection less seriously .
" more efforts must be made to explain and inform people that despite an improvement in therapy , there is no cure for this disease , " he said in a statement . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german aids foundation thinks positive when the german aids foundation presented its annual report in bonn on friday , it revealed that even in germany , one common side-effect of hiv infection is poverty .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 25.10.2005 german hiv infections on the rise großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hiv awareness is declining , officials say new cases of hiv rose in germany this year with health officials saying that drug cocktails to fight the disease are contributing to the increase . the number of new hiv infections in germany rose 20 percent in the first six months of this year over the same period in 2004 , and government officials are worried that drugs that fight hiv / aids have led to underestimation of the disease .
" the german health minister considers this a serious development and says the rise in hiv infections is worrying , " health ministry spokeswoman dagmar reitenbach told reporters .
" unfortunately , it is often the case that hiv / aids is no longer taken seriously as a life-threatening disease . " according to a report from the robert koch institute , the federal government 's disease control center , 1,164 people were infected in the first half of 2005 with the virus .
the institute said the hiv risk for males was roughly 7.5 times greater than for women and that most of the new infections were in males between the ages of 25 and 45 .
german cities such as berlin , hamburg , cologne and frankfurt have the highest risk of new infection , the report said .
gays ' hiv risk climbing about 40 million people worldwide are infected with hiv / aids , and africa is the hardest hit region with 25 million .
in the eu , infections are on the rise .
in germany , the infection rate was stable for years , remaining under 2,000 annually in a population of 82 million .
but in 2004 , the infection rate topped 2,000 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drug advances appear to cause people to be less concerned about hiv / aids woman make up about half of the number of the infected worldwide .
the most significant hiv risk factor for women in germany is sexual contact with males from other high-risk groups : men from countries with a high prevalence of hiv / aids , intravenous drug users and men who have had homosexual contact .
almost 60 percent of the new infections were among homosexual men , and the risk of infection among this group is almost twice as high as it was 12 years ago .
the head of the robert koch institute , reinhard kurth , said the news was worrying and that more attempts needed to be made to communicate to the populace that aids , despite improved therapies , is still an incurable disease .
he added that the new drug cocktails , that have proven effective in treating the symptoms of aids , have led to many taking the consequences of infection less seriously .
" more efforts must be made to explain and inform people that despite an improvement in therapy , there is no cure for this disease , " he said in a statement . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german aids foundation thinks positive when the german aids foundation presented its annual report in bonn on friday , it revealed that even in germany , one common side-effect of hiv infection is poverty .

22 , 2005 -rrb- young germans face rising hiv rates after falling for several years , rates of hiv infection , particularly among young gay men , are rising again .

experts believe the government in berlin alone will have to borrow at least 35 billion euros this year to meet its expenditures , not counting the budget shortfalls of local and regional authorities . the chief negotiators for the christian union parties and the social democrats on monday reaffirmed their determination to drastically reduce the overall german deficit , nearing about 4 percent of gross national product this year .
after the talks , which ended late monday , chancellor-designate angela merkel announced the proposed budget cuts for the coming years . " a difficult heritage " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel now has a better idea of germany 's budget gap " it 's a difficult heritage , but we are determined to overcome our financial problems , " she said .
" we have to take drastic measures to come back to a sustainable path that ensures a decent future for next generations .
there is a strong will but this task should n't be underestimated . " the enormous sum of 35 billion amounts to more than 10 percent of the german national budget .
merkel said that there would be no taboos when it comes to cutting expenditure but added that precise savings measures would be hammered out in bipartisan deliberations scheduled to last until mid-november . she also would n't rule out that taxes in germany would have to rise in order to meet the ambitious goal .
in their election campaign merkel 's cdu already announced a 2 percent hike in value added tax here to finance a reduction in german non-wage labor costs and to help consolidate the budget . not pointing the finger analysts now believe that merkel 's plan to reduce business taxes is most likely to be scrapped given the dire state of german public finances .
but on monday , the conservatives held back from laying the blame on outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder and his ruling social democrats . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel , müntefering and schröder now seem to get along merkel said the in spite of the bad news the talks were held in a positive atmosphere - a view shared by spd party leader franz müntefering who is scheduled to become labor minister in merkel 's cabinet . " the challenge is big , but confidence is not unfounded , " müntefering said .
" both sides showed a willingness to tackle the problems and move germany foward again . " national debt keeps growing with german state coffers almost empty , germans are bound to lose some cherished subsidies such as state money for private home builders and tax breaks for commuters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's national debt increases by the second but a future grand coalition government would also have to lay the ax to pensions and benefits for germany 's four million unemployed who make up the largest bulk of state expenditure . the third biggest chunk , with 38 billion euros , is interest on national debt .

experts believe the government in berlin alone will have to borrow at least 35 billion euros this year to meet its expenditures , not counting the budget shortfalls of local and regional authorities . the chief negotiators for the christian union parties and the social democrats on monday reaffirmed their determination to drastically reduce the overall german deficit , nearing about 4 percent of gross national product this year .
after the talks , which ended late monday , chancellor-designate angela merkel announced the proposed budget cuts for the coming years . " a difficult heritage " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel now has a better idea of germany 's budget gap " it 's a difficult heritage , but we are determined to overcome our financial problems , " she said .
" we have to take drastic measures to come back to a sustainable path that ensures a decent future for next generations .
there is a strong will but this task should n't be underestimated . " the enormous sum of 35 billion amounts to more than 10 percent of the german national budget .
merkel said that there would be no taboos when it comes to cutting expenditure but added that precise savings measures would be hammered out in bipartisan deliberations scheduled to last until mid-november . she also would n't rule out that taxes in germany would have to rise in order to meet the ambitious goal .
in their election campaign merkel 's cdu already announced a 2 percent hike in value added tax here to finance a reduction in german non-wage labor costs and to help consolidate the budget . not pointing the finger analysts now believe that merkel 's plan to reduce business taxes is most likely to be scrapped given the dire state of german public finances .
but on monday , the conservatives held back from laying the blame on outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder and his ruling social democrats . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel , müntefering and schröder now seem to get along merkel said the in spite of the bad news the talks were held in a positive atmosphere - a view shared by spd party leader franz müntefering who is scheduled to become labor minister in merkel 's cabinet . " the challenge is big , but confidence is not unfounded , " müntefering said .
" both sides showed a willingness to tackle the problems and move germany foward again . " national debt keeps growing with german state coffers almost empty , germans are bound to lose some cherished subsidies such as state money for private home builders and tax breaks for commuters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's national debt increases by the second but a future grand coalition government would also have to lay the ax to pensions and benefits for germany 's four million unemployed who make up the largest bulk of state expenditure . the third biggest chunk , with 38 billion euros , is interest on national debt .

they accuse the telecoms group of misleading them before two public share placements . the second round of a landmark lawsuit against german telecommunications giant deutsche telekom is set to begin tuesday , nearly one year after a preliminary hearing .
some 15,000 small investors divided into almost 2,200 groups are suing deutsche telekom for some 100 million euros -lrb- $ 119 million -rrb- . the focus of the suit is the shareholders ' claim that deutsch telekom deliberately misled them about the valuation of its property portfolio in stock exchange prospectuses for two public share placements during the height of the internet and dot-com boom in 1999 and 2000 .
at the end of the preliminary round of hearings last november , the small investors already booked a small victory when judge meinrad wösthoff criticized the methods used to value deutsche telekom 's vast real estate portfolio . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : telekom ceo kai-uwe ricke must face the ire of investors , a legacy of his predecessor the judge hit out at the company for valuing a huge portfolio of real estate comprising 35,000 buildings and plots of land en bloc rather than individually as required by german law .
the plaintiffs said the value of the properties was consistently overstated , inflating the book value of deutsche telekom itself , which in turn meant that investors paid a stiff premium for their shares . " people 's share " loses dramatically wösthoff said last year that the so-called " cluster " method of valuing property used by deutsche telekom did not correspond to the rules .
but he cautioned that that did not automatically mean that the valuations themselves were wrong . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : along with the dax , deutsche telekom shares plummeted in 2000-2002 the deutsche telekom court case is legally and logistically without precedent in germany .
the 15,000 small shareholders are suing the company because they feel they paid too much for shares bought when the former state-owned monopoly was privatized in the 1990s . it was only when deutsche telekom was forced to write down the value of its real estate holdings at the beginning of 2001 that shareholders became aware of the problem .
then investors quickly saw their savings go up in smoke as the news sent what germany had once proudly dubbed the " people 's share " into a long and precipitous slide on the stock market .
now , the pensioners and small-time savers who believed their hard-earned savings would be safe in europe 's biggest phone company want their money back . lots to blame in precedent setting case the roughly 15,000 investors have instructed 750 lawyers to file 2,200 separate lawsuits for a total of around 100 million euros in compensation .
no stone is being left unturned by the plaintiffs who are suing everyone involved in the privatization of deutsche telekom - the company itself and its former chief ron sommer , the government , the state-owned privatization vehicle kfw bank , and even the underwriting banks , such as deutsche bank . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investors want to return the bill to sender , deutsche telekom investors also feel cheated that they were not fully informed about the risks connected with deutsche telekom 's planned acquisition of us mobile phone operator voicestream barely a month after the third share offering in july 2000 .
in a takeover that many analysts called much too expensive , deutsche telekom paid more than $ 40 billion for voicestream , and it became another key factor behind the dizzying fall in the price of the german group 's shares . they lost almost 92 percent of their value , plunging from the giddy heights of a record 103.90 euros at the height of the internet boom to an all-time low of 8.59 euros on june 26 , 2002 . judge wösthoff said last november that those complaints were not justified .
the court also said that deutsche telekom 's former chief ron sommer could not be held responsible for the slide in the share price . dw staff / afp -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de judge criticizes telekom in first hearing german telecoms giant deutsche telekom was reprimanded by the judge overseeing the massive lawsuit brought against the company by 15,000 angry shareholders in the first court hearing on tuesday .

" basescu called on legal officials and police to fight corruption , as the eu demands .
he said they should have " zero tolerance " for corruption . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ivaylo kalfin assured the eu that bulgaria would do what was needed .
in sofia , bulgarian foreign minister ivaylo kalfin said : " both countries fully understand our responsibility in the months left ahead of our accession into the eu .

rehn added that brussels would " not hesitate " to make use of the option in its recommendation on the entry date to eu member states .
" we may recommend , if needed , to postpone accession by one year " , he said .

"
he said it " gives romania the chance to join the eu on january 1 , 2007 . " " the report should not lead us to rejoicing or sadness .
we must remain vigilant , ready to meet what is required for joining in 2007 , " basescu said . he said romania would " feel the benefits of joining the eu only when it is a full member " and that " up until this moment romanians must pay the price of joining . " basescu called on legal officials and police to fight corruption , as the eu demands .
he said they should have " zero tolerance " for corruption . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ivaylo kalfin assured the eu that bulgaria would do what was needed .
in sofia , bulgarian foreign minister ivaylo kalfin said : " both countries fully understand our responsibility in the months left ahead of our accession into the eu .
we accept the report as a partner 's assessment and will fully focus on implementing what has been negotiated , " kalfin said . progress needed to ensure accession the two former communist states are on track to join the eu as planned in 2007 , the eu 's executive announced on tuesday , but warned the eastern european states to make further progress on reforms . the two balkan states are doing too little to fight corruption , the european commission said , in annual progress reports on their eu membership suitability , amid speculation that their entry could be delayed by a year . the reports stated that there were " serious concerns " in areas accounting for around ten percent of eu legislation , where " unless immediate action is taken the countries will not be ready for accession " .
brussels is also concerned about administrative capacity , where the commission said " overall reform of administrative structures " needs to be stepped up in order for both romania and bulgaria to be able to absorb eu funds .
other areas which needed to be addressed were the shortcomings in the veterinary field , which may " put at risk food safety " in the eu , and the level of corruption in the two countries " particularly at a high level " .
commission threatens year-long delays bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olli rehn said the eu would not hesitate to implement delays .
before the talks , european enlargement commissioner olli rehn said the commission would not hesitate to delay the scheduled accession if reform efforts in the key areas fail .
romania and bulgaria signed their accession treaties on april 25 this year , but these treaties contain a unique clause which gives the european commission the option to delay the 2007 entry date until 2008 if entry preparations are insufficient .
rehn added that brussels would " not hesitate " to make use of the option in its recommendation on the entry date to eu member states .
" we may recommend , if needed , to postpone accession by one year " , he said .
" the possibility of being ready in 2007 is not lost , but making it will require a lot of work . ” the commission is due to meet to discuss the two countries ’ entry date in may or april next year .
bulgaria slips from lead in race with neighbor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traian basescu 's romania has " caught up impressively . "
these warnings , known in accession speak as " yellow cards " , come as a particular blow to bulgaria .
it has been widely accepted that the bulgarians have always been ahead of their neighbor romania in their eu preparation , but a close general election result in june plunged the country in a reform deadlock .
the commission said that bulgaria was " working energetically " after it had " lost the momentum somewhat " , but it was romania who had " caught up impressively " , particularly in the areas of competition policy , justice , state aid and overall alignment with eu law . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de romania , bulgaria sign eu entry pact romania and bulgaria signed an accession treaty with the european union monday , paving the way to join the bloc in january 2007 in what they hailed as an " historic " step for their ex-communist nations .
-lrb- april 25 , 2005 -rrb- bulgaria 's list of unanswered questions the european parliament gave the green light to eu accession for bulgaria come january 2007 , but there are still some hurdles to clear .

" the german health minister considers this a serious development and says the rise in hiv infections is worrying , " health ministry spokeswoman dagmar reitenbach told reporters .
" unfortunately , it is often the case that hiv / aids is no longer taken seriously as a life-threatening disease . " according to a report from the robert koch institute , the federal government 's disease control center , 1,164 people were infected in the first half of 2005 with the virus .
the institute said the hiv risk for males was roughly 7.5 times greater than for women and that most of the new infections were in males between the ages of 25 and 45 .
german cities such as berlin , hamburg , cologne and frankfurt have the highest risk of new infection , the report said .
gays ' hiv risk climbing about 40 million people worldwide are infected with hiv / aids , and africa is the hardest hit region with 25 million .
in the eu , infections are on the rise .
in germany , the infection rate was stable for years , remaining under 2,000 annually in a population of 82 million .
but in 2004 , the infection rate topped 2,000 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drug advances appear to cause people to be less concerned about hiv / aids woman make up about half of the number of the infected worldwide .
the most significant hiv risk factor for women in germany is sexual contact with males from other high-risk groups : men from countries with a high prevalence of hiv / aids , intravenous drug users and men who have had homosexual contact .
almost 60 percent of the new infections were among homosexual men , and the risk of infection among this group is almost twice as high as it was 12 years ago .
the head of the robert koch institute , reinhard kurth , said the news was worrying and that more attempts needed to be made to communicate to the populace that aids , despite improved therapies , is still an incurable disease .
he added that the new drug cocktails , that have proven effective in treating the symptoms of aids , have led to many taking the consequences of infection less seriously .
" more efforts must be made to explain and inform people that despite an improvement in therapy , there is no cure for this disease , " he said in a statement . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german aids foundation thinks positive when the german aids foundation presented its annual report in bonn on friday , it revealed that even in germany , one common side-effect of hiv infection is poverty .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 25.10.2005 massive national budget cuts likely in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not much left in germany 's coffers a new round of talks on forming a grand coalition government in germany ended with a call for germans to tighten their belts as tens of billions of euros must be saved in the national budget over the coming years . negotiators for the conservative christian union parties and the social democrats have agreed to cut government expenditure to the tune of 14 billion euros -lrb- $ 16.7 billion -rrb- next year and 35 billion euros in 2007 in efforts to consolidate the cash-strapped national budget . the drastic cuts are needed to meet the european union 's budget deficit criteria by 2007 and to bring german state finances back on a sustainable track , they said . german public finances are deeper in the red than ever before .
experts believe the government in berlin alone will have to borrow at least 35 billion euros this year to meet its expenditures , not counting the budget shortfalls of local and regional authorities . the chief negotiators for the christian union parties and the social democrats on monday reaffirmed their determination to drastically reduce the overall german deficit , nearing about 4 percent of gross national product this year .
after the talks , which ended late monday , chancellor-designate angela merkel announced the proposed budget cuts for the coming years . " a difficult heritage " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel now has a better idea of germany 's budget gap " it 's a difficult heritage , but we are determined to overcome our financial problems , " she said .
" we have to take drastic measures to come back to a sustainable path that ensures a decent future for next generations .
there is a strong will but this task should n't be underestimated . " the enormous sum of 35 billion amounts to more than 10 percent of the german national budget .
merkel said that there would be no taboos when it comes to cutting expenditure but added that precise savings measures would be hammered out in bipartisan deliberations scheduled to last until mid-november . she also would n't rule out that taxes in germany would have to rise in order to meet the ambitious goal .

" the german health minister considers this a serious development and says the rise in hiv infections is worrying , " health ministry spokeswoman dagmar reitenbach told reporters .
" unfortunately , it is often the case that hiv / aids is no longer taken seriously as a life-threatening disease . " according to a report from the robert koch institute , the federal government 's disease control center , 1,164 people were infected in the first half of 2005 with the virus .
the institute said the hiv risk for males was roughly 7.5 times greater than for women and that most of the new infections were in males between the ages of 25 and 45 .
german cities such as berlin , hamburg , cologne and frankfurt have the highest risk of new infection , the report said .
gays ' hiv risk climbing about 40 million people worldwide are infected with hiv / aids , and africa is the hardest hit region with 25 million .
in the eu , infections are on the rise .
in germany , the infection rate was stable for years , remaining under 2,000 annually in a population of 82 million .
but in 2004 , the infection rate topped 2,000 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drug advances appear to cause people to be less concerned about hiv / aids woman make up about half of the number of the infected worldwide .
the most significant hiv risk factor for women in germany is sexual contact with males from other high-risk groups : men from countries with a high prevalence of hiv / aids , intravenous drug users and men who have had homosexual contact .
almost 60 percent of the new infections were among homosexual men , and the risk of infection among this group is almost twice as high as it was 12 years ago .
the head of the robert koch institute , reinhard kurth , said the news was worrying and that more attempts needed to be made to communicate to the populace that aids , despite improved therapies , is still an incurable disease .
he added that the new drug cocktails , that have proven effective in treating the symptoms of aids , have led to many taking the consequences of infection less seriously .
" more efforts must be made to explain and inform people that despite an improvement in therapy , there is no cure for this disease , " he said in a statement . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german aids foundation thinks positive when the german aids foundation presented its annual report in bonn on friday , it revealed that even in germany , one common side-effect of hiv infection is poverty .

"
he said it " gives romania the chance to join the eu on january 1 , 2007 . " " the report should not lead us to rejoicing or sadness .
we must remain vigilant , ready to meet what is required for joining in 2007 , " basescu said . he said romania would " feel the benefits of joining the eu only when it is a full member " and that " up until this moment romanians must pay the price of joining . " basescu called on legal officials and police to fight corruption , as the eu demands .
he said they should have " zero tolerance " for corruption . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ivaylo kalfin assured the eu that bulgaria would do what was needed .
in sofia , bulgarian foreign minister ivaylo kalfin said : " both countries fully understand our responsibility in the months left ahead of our accession into the eu .
we accept the report as a partner 's assessment and will fully focus on implementing what has been negotiated , " kalfin said . progress needed to ensure accession the two former communist states are on track to join the eu as planned in 2007 , the eu 's executive announced on tuesday , but warned the eastern european states to make further progress on reforms . the two balkan states are doing too little to fight corruption , the european commission said , in annual progress reports on their eu membership suitability , amid speculation that their entry could be delayed by a year . the reports stated that there were " serious concerns " in areas accounting for around ten percent of eu legislation , where " unless immediate action is taken the countries will not be ready for accession " .
brussels is also concerned about administrative capacity , where the commission said " overall reform of administrative structures " needs to be stepped up in order for both romania and bulgaria to be able to absorb eu funds .
other areas which needed to be addressed were the shortcomings in the veterinary field , which may " put at risk food safety " in the eu , and the level of corruption in the two countries " particularly at a high level " .
commission threatens year-long delays bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olli rehn said the eu would not hesitate to implement delays .
before the talks , european enlargement commissioner olli rehn said the commission would not hesitate to delay the scheduled accession if reform efforts in the key areas fail .
romania and bulgaria signed their accession treaties on april 25 this year , but these treaties contain a unique clause which gives the european commission the option to delay the 2007 entry date until 2008 if entry preparations are insufficient .
rehn added that brussels would " not hesitate " to make use of the option in its recommendation on the entry date to eu member states .
" we may recommend , if needed , to postpone accession by one year " , he said .
" the possibility of being ready in 2007 is not lost , but making it will require a lot of work . ” the commission is due to meet to discuss the two countries ’ entry date in may or april next year .
bulgaria slips from lead in race with neighbor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traian basescu 's romania has " caught up impressively . "
these warnings , known in accession speak as " yellow cards " , come as a particular blow to bulgaria .
it has been widely accepted that the bulgarians have always been ahead of their neighbor romania in their eu preparation , but a close general election result in june plunged the country in a reform deadlock .
the commission said that bulgaria was " working energetically " after it had " lost the momentum somewhat " , but it was romania who had " caught up impressively " , particularly in the areas of competition policy , justice , state aid and overall alignment with eu law . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de romania , bulgaria sign eu entry pact romania and bulgaria signed an accession treaty with the european union monday , paving the way to join the bloc in january 2007 in what they hailed as an " historic " step for their ex-communist nations .
-lrb- april 25 , 2005 -rrb- bulgaria 's list of unanswered questions the european parliament gave the green light to eu accession for bulgaria come january 2007 , but there are still some hurdles to clear .

make sure you are where you say you are in their coalition talks , the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have agreed to get tough on abuse of germany 's reformed unemployment regulations , known as hartz iv . the cost of germany 's labor market reform is almost double the amount originally planned - 26 billion instead of the estimated 14 billion euros .
spd head franz müntefering said the hike could partly be attributed to the fact that local authorities transferred more of the old system 's welfare recipients into the new hartz iv unemployment benefit scheme than expected .
but politicians are also lashing out at benefit cheats , announcing plans to step up controls on fraudulent claims .
the discussion has taken on a virulent tone , with a report posted on the economics and labor ministry 's web site indirectly comparing welfare recipients to parasites .
the report contains a detailed list of real life examples of benefit cheats , referring to them as " freeloaders " and " spongers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement 's ministry indirectly compared people on benefit to parasites peter clever , the deputy head of the board of directors for the federal labor office told broadcaster deutschlandfunk that , in random telephone checks since july on 390,000 hartz iv recipients , 170,000 could not be reached , despite 10 phone calls being made at different times of the day and different days of the week .
" you 'd have to be really naïve to believe that all 170,000 people happened to be in job interviews at the time , " clever said . the economics and labor ministry said it intends to step up telephone checks as well as other forms of control in the future .
a spokeswoman from the ministry said that welfare recipients have a duty to cooperate with their local authorities and must be available for consultation . housing benefit open to fraud bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : state subsidized housing has been identified as a major area open to abuse experts say that subsidized housing under hartz iv is one of the biggest sources of welfare abuse .
a long-term unemployed person on welfare support can have an " appropriate " apartment -lrb- for example , up to 50 square meters of living space for a single person or 70 square meters for two people -rrb- including heat and electricity , completely paid for by the state . the problem is that many welfare recipients are moving into these " appropriate " apartments on paper only .
for that reason , housing benefit should only be paid to young adults living alone if their parents ' income is insufficient , the director of the german association of local authorities , gerd landsberg , told the osnabrücker zeitung .
young people who qualify as long-term unemployed should be required to prove that they need their own apartment in order to take up job training or other qualification measures , landsberg said . politicians are now calling for further reforms to hartz iv in order to cut back on the number of households claiming state-subsidized housing . interest groups , charities outraged an internet forum for the unemployed -lrb- erwerbslosen forum deutschland -rrb- has reacted angrily to the accusations made by the labor ministry , claiming it is looking for a scapegoat to draw attention away from its past failure to clamp down on welfare fraud . germany 's main social and charitable organizations also protested against accusations of welfare abuse , saying the cost of labor market reform was set at an unreasonably low level to begin with .

fearing bird flu , germans stockpile meds germany -pipe- 25.10.2005 german poultry lockdown restarts cage controversy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most eggs in germany are still laid by caged-up chickens a mandatory measure to coop up poultry to prevent an outbreak of bird flu has taken effect in germany .
most farmers support the move but some worry it might lead to chickens being held in cages for longer than needed . for german geese , fall is traditionally a bad time of year : many of them end up on dining tables in celebration of st. martin 's day on nov .
11 .
but , this year the birds ' short lives are facing further curbs . the threat of an outbreak of bird flu in germany means they now have to spend their last days cooped up instead of waddling outdoors . acting german agricultural minister jürgen trittin has ordered the country 's poultry farmers to cage their animals to prevent possible infection with the virus by migratory birds . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no fans of indoor life " it 's an unusual situation for geese , which usually get to go outside and are now stuck in stables , " said gerald wehde , a spokesman for bioland , germany 's largest association of organic farmers .
" it 's stressful for them . " geese farmers themselves are probably not too relaxed , either .
many do n't have adequate enclosures for their poultry and are scrambling to adhere to trittin 's order , wehde said . no fi n a n cial harm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some farms keep chickens in " conservatories " during the curfew organic chicken farmers on the other hand do n't face the same problem , as most already have fence-like structures in place . they 're also unlikely to suffer financially . while the bird flu scare is n't likely to boost the overall consumption of poultry products in germany , the mandatory lockdown wo n't put an extra burden on them . compared to conventional farmers who already keep their animals in cages , organic and free-range chicken farms are allowed to continue to market their products as if their poultry stock were still running around outside . some oppositio n but not everyone is happy with the mandatory nationwide chicken caging , with some complaining it 's unnecessary harassment that has only scared people . " we think it is complete nonsense , " said reinhard jung , who represents an association of 300 family farms in the eastern state of brandenburg . " people behave as if the plague were about to strike , " he said , adding that he thinks the lockdown can not prevent animals from getting infected . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : free-range no more but most major famers ' associations , including bioland , back the lockdown as a sensible precaution to prevent the spread of bird flu . " it 's simply meant to protect the animals , " said dirk höppner of the umbrella organization for germany 's poultry industry . threate n i n g orga n ic farms ? bioland 's wehde , however , said he worried that the house arrest for chickens could reignite the debate about a german ban on caged chickens that 's meant to take effect in 2007 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conventional farmers agree that chicken cages should be phased out the bird flu scare " could discredit alternative forms of farming , " wehde said , referring to organic farming .
conventional farmers , who want to replace tiny cages with larger ones for several animals , could argue that keeping animals outside would pose too many risks . jung expressed similar concerns . " there 's a danger that appropriate farming methods that are slowly gaining ground will be pushed to the side again , " he said . far from it , said gert stuke , whose german breakfast egg company has about 4.8 million chickens producing eggs in conventional , organic and free-range farms . " we 're not going to play off farming methods against each other , " stuke said , adding that his firm backed so-called " mini aviaries " that can hold 60 animals .
about 90 percent of germany 's 40 million chickens in egg production are still kept in cages . caged u n til 2013 ? " we do n't want to keep the old cages , we 're responsible egg producers , and the mini aviaries are the best farming method , " stuke said , adding that german breakfast egg will still offer organic and free-range eggs as long as people want to buy them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are aviaries the solution ?
so far , the mini aviaries have not been approved as an alternative farming method .
stuke has only been able to try them out on a test farm .
but along with other conventional egg producers , he hopes the incoming government of christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and social democrats will change that in the near future . that could well turn out to be the case . " we want to allow for a transition period to give chicken farmers the opportunity to switch to aviaries , " said peter bleser , the cdu 's agriculture spokesman , adding there was no connection between the bird flu and the debate about chicken cages . theoretically cages could stay until 2012 , when an eu-wide ban takes effect . mathis winkler , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu considers wild bird import ban the european commission is facing increasing pressure to ban all wild bird imports after new cases of bird flu appeared in russia , croatia and british quarantine .

a german-based artist from new zealand might have found an answer to the problem . as a 17-year-old exchange student from new zealand , joanne moar initially felt pretty lost at the other end of the world .
she 'd come to hamburg with very little german and a very different childhood and youth experience . when her friends got giggly about a party game that involves unwrapping a chocolate bar parcel while wearing gloves and using cutlery , she did n't really know how to react .
she had no idea that " hui bu , the castle ghost " was a popular audio play on tape german kids listened to .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 25.10.2005 telekom investors ' suit starts 2nd round großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investors are red in the face over the magenta telekom t the german telecommunications company deutsche telekom faces a lawsuit brought forth by some 15,000 small investors .
they accuse the telecoms group of misleading them before two public share placements . the second round of a landmark lawsuit against german telecommunications giant deutsche telekom is set to begin tuesday , nearly one year after a preliminary hearing .
some 15,000 small investors divided into almost 2,200 groups are suing deutsche telekom for some 100 million euros -lrb- $ 119 million -rrb- . the focus of the suit is the shareholders ' claim that deutsch telekom deliberately misled them about the valuation of its property portfolio in stock exchange prospectuses for two public share placements during the height of the internet and dot-com boom in 1999 and 2000 .
at the end of the preliminary round of hearings last november , the small investors already booked a small victory when judge meinrad wösthoff criticized the methods used to value deutsche telekom 's vast real estate portfolio . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : telekom ceo kai-uwe ricke must face the ire of investors , a legacy of his predecessor the judge hit out at the company for valuing a huge portfolio of real estate comprising 35,000 buildings and plots of land en bloc rather than individually as required by german law .
the plaintiffs said the value of the properties was consistently overstated , inflating the book value of deutsche telekom itself , which in turn meant that investors paid a stiff premium for their shares . " people 's share " loses dramatically wösthoff said last year that the so-called " cluster " method of valuing property used by deutsche telekom did not correspond to the rules .
but he cautioned that that did not automatically mean that the valuations themselves were wrong . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : along with the dax , deutsche telekom shares plummeted in 2000-2002 the deutsche telekom court case is legally and logistically without precedent in germany .
the 15,000 small shareholders are suing the company because they feel they paid too much for shares bought when the former state-owned monopoly was privatized in the 1990s . it was only when deutsche telekom was forced to write down the value of its real estate holdings at the beginning of 2001 that shareholders became aware of the problem .
then investors quickly saw their savings go up in smoke as the news sent what germany had once proudly dubbed the " people 's share " into a long and precipitous slide on the stock market .
now , the pensioners and small-time savers who believed their hard-earned savings would be safe in europe 's biggest phone company want their money back . lots to blame in precedent setting case the roughly 15,000 investors have instructed 750 lawyers to file 2,200 separate lawsuits for a total of around 100 million euros in compensation .
no stone is being left unturned by the plaintiffs who are suing everyone involved in the privatization of deutsche telekom - the company itself and its former chief ron sommer , the government , the state-owned privatization vehicle kfw bank , and even the underwriting banks , such as deutsche bank . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investors want to return the bill to sender , deutsche telekom investors also feel cheated that they were not fully informed about the risks connected with deutsche telekom 's planned acquisition of us mobile phone operator voicestream barely a month after the third share offering in july 2000 .
in a takeover that many analysts called much too expensive , deutsche telekom paid more than $ 40 billion for voicestream , and it became another key factor behind the dizzying fall in the price of the german group 's shares . they lost almost 92 percent of their value , plunging from the giddy heights of a record 103.90 euros at the height of the internet boom to an all-time low of 8.59 euros on june 26 , 2002 . judge wösthoff said last november that those complaints were not justified .
the court also said that deutsche telekom 's former chief ron sommer could not be held responsible for the slide in the share price . dw staff / afp -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de judge criticizes telekom in first hearing german telecoms giant deutsche telekom was reprimanded by the judge overseeing the massive lawsuit brought against the company by 15,000 angry shareholders in the first court hearing on tuesday .

they accuse the telecoms group of misleading them before two public share placements . the second round of a landmark lawsuit against german telecommunications giant deutsche telekom is set to begin tuesday , nearly one year after a preliminary hearing .
some 15,000 small investors divided into almost 2,200 groups are suing deutsche telekom for some 100 million euros -lrb- $ 119 million -rrb- . the focus of the suit is the shareholders ' claim that deutsch telekom deliberately misled them about the valuation of its property portfolio in stock exchange prospectuses for two public share placements during the height of the internet and dot-com boom in 1999 and 2000 .
at the end of the preliminary round of hearings last november , the small investors already booked a small victory when judge meinrad wösthoff criticized the methods used to value deutsche telekom 's vast real estate portfolio . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : telekom ceo kai-uwe ricke must face the ire of investors , a legacy of his predecessor the judge hit out at the company for valuing a huge portfolio of real estate comprising 35,000 buildings and plots of land en bloc rather than individually as required by german law .
the plaintiffs said the value of the properties was consistently overstated , inflating the book value of deutsche telekom itself , which in turn meant that investors paid a stiff premium for their shares . " people 's share " loses dramatically wösthoff said last year that the so-called " cluster " method of valuing property used by deutsche telekom did not correspond to the rules .
but he cautioned that that did not automatically mean that the valuations themselves were wrong . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : along with the dax , deutsche telekom shares plummeted in 2000-2002 the deutsche telekom court case is legally and logistically without precedent in germany .
the 15,000 small shareholders are suing the company because they feel they paid too much for shares bought when the former state-owned monopoly was privatized in the 1990s . it was only when deutsche telekom was forced to write down the value of its real estate holdings at the beginning of 2001 that shareholders became aware of the problem .
then investors quickly saw their savings go up in smoke as the news sent what germany had once proudly dubbed the " people 's share " into a long and precipitous slide on the stock market .
now , the pensioners and small-time savers who believed their hard-earned savings would be safe in europe 's biggest phone company want their money back . lots to blame in precedent setting case the roughly 15,000 investors have instructed 750 lawyers to file 2,200 separate lawsuits for a total of around 100 million euros in compensation .
no stone is being left unturned by the plaintiffs who are suing everyone involved in the privatization of deutsche telekom - the company itself and its former chief ron sommer , the government , the state-owned privatization vehicle kfw bank , and even the underwriting banks , such as deutsche bank . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investors want to return the bill to sender , deutsche telekom investors also feel cheated that they were not fully informed about the risks connected with deutsche telekom 's planned acquisition of us mobile phone operator voicestream barely a month after the third share offering in july 2000 .
in a takeover that many analysts called much too expensive , deutsche telekom paid more than $ 40 billion for voicestream , and it became another key factor behind the dizzying fall in the price of the german group 's shares . they lost almost 92 percent of their value , plunging from the giddy heights of a record 103.90 euros at the height of the internet boom to an all-time low of 8.59 euros on june 26 , 2002 . judge wösthoff said last november that those complaints were not justified .
the court also said that deutsche telekom 's former chief ron sommer could not be held responsible for the slide in the share price . dw staff / afp -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de judge criticizes telekom in first hearing german telecoms giant deutsche telekom was reprimanded by the judge overseeing the massive lawsuit brought against the company by 15,000 angry shareholders in the first court hearing on tuesday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 25.10.2005 massive national budget cuts likely in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not much left in germany 's coffers a new round of talks on forming a grand coalition government in germany ended with a call for germans to tighten their belts as tens of billions of euros must be saved in the national budget over the coming years . negotiators for the conservative christian union parties and the social democrats have agreed to cut government expenditure to the tune of 14 billion euros -lrb- $ 16.7 billion -rrb- next year and 35 billion euros in 2007 in efforts to consolidate the cash-strapped national budget . the drastic cuts are needed to meet the european union 's budget deficit criteria by 2007 and to bring german state finances back on a sustainable track , they said . german public finances are deeper in the red than ever before .
experts believe the government in berlin alone will have to borrow at least 35 billion euros this year to meet its expenditures , not counting the budget shortfalls of local and regional authorities . the chief negotiators for the christian union parties and the social democrats on monday reaffirmed their determination to drastically reduce the overall german deficit , nearing about 4 percent of gross national product this year .
after the talks , which ended late monday , chancellor-designate angela merkel announced the proposed budget cuts for the coming years . " a difficult heritage " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel now has a better idea of germany 's budget gap " it 's a difficult heritage , but we are determined to overcome our financial problems , " she said .
" we have to take drastic measures to come back to a sustainable path that ensures a decent future for next generations .
there is a strong will but this task should n't be underestimated . " the enormous sum of 35 billion amounts to more than 10 percent of the german national budget .
merkel said that there would be no taboos when it comes to cutting expenditure but added that precise savings measures would be hammered out in bipartisan deliberations scheduled to last until mid-november . she also would n't rule out that taxes in germany would have to rise in order to meet the ambitious goal .
in their election campaign merkel 's cdu already announced a 2 percent hike in value added tax here to finance a reduction in german non-wage labor costs and to help consolidate the budget . not pointing the finger analysts now believe that merkel 's plan to reduce business taxes is most likely to be scrapped given the dire state of german public finances .

experts believe the government in berlin alone will have to borrow at least 35 billion euros this year to meet its expenditures , not counting the budget shortfalls of local and regional authorities . the chief negotiators for the christian union parties and the social democrats on monday reaffirmed their determination to drastically reduce the overall german deficit , nearing about 4 percent of gross national product this year .
after the talks , which ended late monday , chancellor-designate angela merkel announced the proposed budget cuts for the coming years . " a difficult heritage " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel now has a better idea of germany 's budget gap " it 's a difficult heritage , but we are determined to overcome our financial problems , " she said .
" we have to take drastic measures to come back to a sustainable path that ensures a decent future for next generations .
there is a strong will but this task should n't be underestimated . " the enormous sum of 35 billion amounts to more than 10 percent of the german national budget .
merkel said that there would be no taboos when it comes to cutting expenditure but added that precise savings measures would be hammered out in bipartisan deliberations scheduled to last until mid-november . she also would n't rule out that taxes in germany would have to rise in order to meet the ambitious goal .
in their election campaign merkel 's cdu already announced a 2 percent hike in value added tax here to finance a reduction in german non-wage labor costs and to help consolidate the budget . not pointing the finger analysts now believe that merkel 's plan to reduce business taxes is most likely to be scrapped given the dire state of german public finances .
but on monday , the conservatives held back from laying the blame on outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder and his ruling social democrats . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel , müntefering and schröder now seem to get along merkel said the in spite of the bad news the talks were held in a positive atmosphere - a view shared by spd party leader franz müntefering who is scheduled to become labor minister in merkel 's cabinet . " the challenge is big , but confidence is not unfounded , " müntefering said .
" both sides showed a willingness to tackle the problems and move germany foward again . " national debt keeps growing with german state coffers almost empty , germans are bound to lose some cherished subsidies such as state money for private home builders and tax breaks for commuters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's national debt increases by the second but a future grand coalition government would also have to lay the ax to pensions and benefits for germany 's four million unemployed who make up the largest bulk of state expenditure . the third biggest chunk , with 38 billion euros , is interest on national debt .

experts believe the government in berlin alone will have to borrow at least 35 billion euros this year to meet its expenditures , not counting the budget shortfalls of local and regional authorities . the chief negotiators for the christian union parties and the social democrats on monday reaffirmed their determination to drastically reduce the overall german deficit , nearing about 4 percent of gross national product this year .

" we have to take drastic measures to come back to a sustainable path that ensures a decent future for next generations .
there is a strong will but this task should n't be underestimated . " the enormous sum of 35 billion amounts to more than 10 percent of the german national budget .
merkel said that there would be no taboos when it comes to cutting expenditure but added that precise savings measures would be hammered out in bipartisan deliberations scheduled to last until mid-november . she also would n't rule out that taxes in germany would have to rise in order to meet the ambitious goal .
in their election campaign merkel 's cdu already announced a 2 percent hike in value added tax here to finance a reduction in german non-wage labor costs and to help consolidate the budget . not pointing the finger analysts now believe that merkel 's plan to reduce business taxes is most likely to be scrapped given the dire state of german public finances .
but on monday , the conservatives held back from laying the blame on outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder and his ruling social democrats . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel , müntefering and schröder now seem to get along merkel said the in spite of the bad news the talks were held in a positive atmosphere - a view shared by spd party leader franz müntefering who is scheduled to become labor minister in merkel 's cabinet . " the challenge is big , but confidence is not unfounded , " müntefering said .
" both sides showed a willingness to tackle the problems and move germany foward again . " national debt keeps growing with german state coffers almost empty , germans are bound to lose some cherished subsidies such as state money for private home builders and tax breaks for commuters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's national debt increases by the second but a future grand coalition government would also have to lay the ax to pensions and benefits for germany 's four million unemployed who make up the largest bulk of state expenditure . the third biggest chunk , with 38 billion euros , is interest on national debt .

"
he said it " gives romania the chance to join the eu on january 1 , 2007 . " " the report should not lead us to rejoicing or sadness .
we must remain vigilant , ready to meet what is required for joining in 2007 , " basescu said . he said romania would " feel the benefits of joining the eu only when it is a full member " and that " up until this moment romanians must pay the price of joining . " basescu called on legal officials and police to fight corruption , as the eu demands .
he said they should have " zero tolerance " for corruption . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ivaylo kalfin assured the eu that bulgaria would do what was needed .
in sofia , bulgarian foreign minister ivaylo kalfin said : " both countries fully understand our responsibility in the months left ahead of our accession into the eu .
we accept the report as a partner 's assessment and will fully focus on implementing what has been negotiated , " kalfin said . progress needed to ensure accession the two former communist states are on track to join the eu as planned in 2007 , the eu 's executive announced on tuesday , but warned the eastern european states to make further progress on reforms . the two balkan states are doing too little to fight corruption , the european commission said , in annual progress reports on their eu membership suitability , amid speculation that their entry could be delayed by a year . the reports stated that there were " serious concerns " in areas accounting for around ten percent of eu legislation , where " unless immediate action is taken the countries will not be ready for accession " .
brussels is also concerned about administrative capacity , where the commission said " overall reform of administrative structures " needs to be stepped up in order for both romania and bulgaria to be able to absorb eu funds .
other areas which needed to be addressed were the shortcomings in the veterinary field , which may " put at risk food safety " in the eu , and the level of corruption in the two countries " particularly at a high level " .

before the talks , european enlargement commissioner olli rehn said the commission would not hesitate to delay the scheduled accession if reform efforts in the key areas fail .
romania and bulgaria signed their accession treaties on april 25 this year , but these treaties contain a unique clause which gives the european commission the option to delay the 2007 entry date until 2008 if entry preparations are insufficient .
rehn added that brussels would " not hesitate " to make use of the option in its recommendation on the entry date to eu member states .
" we may recommend , if needed , to postpone accession by one year " , he said .
" the possibility of being ready in 2007 is not lost , but making it will require a lot of work . ” the commission is due to meet to discuss the two countries ’ entry date in may or april next year .

romania and bulgaria signed their accession treaties on april 25 this year , but these treaties contain a unique clause which gives the european commission the option to delay the 2007 entry date until 2008 if entry preparations are insufficient .
rehn added that brussels would " not hesitate " to make use of the option in its recommendation on the entry date to eu member states .
" we may recommend , if needed , to postpone accession by one year " , he said .
" the possibility of being ready in 2007 is not lost , but making it will require a lot of work . ” the commission is due to meet to discuss the two countries ’ entry date in may or april next year .

it has been widely accepted that the bulgarians have always been ahead of their neighbor romania in their eu preparation , but a close general election result in june plunged the country in a reform deadlock .
the commission said that bulgaria was " working energetically " after it had " lost the momentum somewhat " , but it was romania who had " caught up impressively " , particularly in the areas of competition policy , justice , state aid and overall alignment with eu law . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de romania , bulgaria sign eu entry pact romania and bulgaria signed an accession treaty with the european union monday , paving the way to join the bloc in january 2007 in what they hailed as an " historic " step for their ex-communist nations .

"
he said it " gives romania the chance to join the eu on january 1 , 2007 . " " the report should not lead us to rejoicing or sadness .
we must remain vigilant , ready to meet what is required for joining in 2007 , " basescu said . he said romania would " feel the benefits of joining the eu only when it is a full member " and that " up until this moment romanians must pay the price of joining . " basescu called on legal officials and police to fight corruption , as the eu demands .
he said they should have " zero tolerance " for corruption . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ivaylo kalfin assured the eu that bulgaria would do what was needed .
in sofia , bulgarian foreign minister ivaylo kalfin said : " both countries fully understand our responsibility in the months left ahead of our accession into the eu .
we accept the report as a partner 's assessment and will fully focus on implementing what has been negotiated , " kalfin said . progress needed to ensure accession the two former communist states are on track to join the eu as planned in 2007 , the eu 's executive announced on tuesday , but warned the eastern european states to make further progress on reforms . the two balkan states are doing too little to fight corruption , the european commission said , in annual progress reports on their eu membership suitability , amid speculation that their entry could be delayed by a year . the reports stated that there were " serious concerns " in areas accounting for around ten percent of eu legislation , where " unless immediate action is taken the countries will not be ready for accession " .
brussels is also concerned about administrative capacity , where the commission said " overall reform of administrative structures " needs to be stepped up in order for both romania and bulgaria to be able to absorb eu funds .
other areas which needed to be addressed were the shortcomings in the veterinary field , which may " put at risk food safety " in the eu , and the level of corruption in the two countries " particularly at a high level " .

make sure you are where you say you are in their coalition talks , the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have agreed to get tough on abuse of germany 's reformed unemployment regulations , known as hartz iv . the cost of germany 's labor market reform is almost double the amount originally planned - 26 billion instead of the estimated 14 billion euros .
spd head franz müntefering said the hike could partly be attributed to the fact that local authorities transferred more of the old system 's welfare recipients into the new hartz iv unemployment benefit scheme than expected .
but politicians are also lashing out at benefit cheats , announcing plans to step up controls on fraudulent claims .
the discussion has taken on a virulent tone , with a report posted on the economics and labor ministry 's web site indirectly comparing welfare recipients to parasites .
the report contains a detailed list of real life examples of benefit cheats , referring to them as " freeloaders " and " spongers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement 's ministry indirectly compared people on benefit to parasites peter clever , the deputy head of the board of directors for the federal labor office told broadcaster deutschlandfunk that , in random telephone checks since july on 390,000 hartz iv recipients , 170,000 could not be reached , despite 10 phone calls being made at different times of the day and different days of the week .
" you 'd have to be really naïve to believe that all 170,000 people happened to be in job interviews at the time , " clever said . the economics and labor ministry said it intends to step up telephone checks as well as other forms of control in the future .
a spokeswoman from the ministry said that welfare recipients have a duty to cooperate with their local authorities and must be available for consultation . housing benefit open to fraud bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : state subsidized housing has been identified as a major area open to abuse experts say that subsidized housing under hartz iv is one of the biggest sources of welfare abuse .
a long-term unemployed person on welfare support can have an " appropriate " apartment -lrb- for example , up to 50 square meters of living space for a single person or 70 square meters for two people -rrb- including heat and electricity , completely paid for by the state . the problem is that many welfare recipients are moving into these " appropriate " apartments on paper only .
for that reason , housing benefit should only be paid to young adults living alone if their parents ' income is insufficient , the director of the german association of local authorities , gerd landsberg , told the osnabrücker zeitung .
young people who qualify as long-term unemployed should be required to prove that they need their own apartment in order to take up job training or other qualification measures , landsberg said . politicians are now calling for further reforms to hartz iv in order to cut back on the number of households claiming state-subsidized housing . interest groups , charities outraged an internet forum for the unemployed -lrb- erwerbslosen forum deutschland -rrb- has reacted angrily to the accusations made by the labor ministry , claiming it is looking for a scapegoat to draw attention away from its past failure to clamp down on welfare fraud . germany 's main social and charitable organizations also protested against accusations of welfare abuse , saying the cost of labor market reform was set at an unreasonably low level to begin with . " it 's an attempt to lay the blame for persistent labor market misery at the door of those affected by it , " said georg cremer , general secretary of the german caritas association . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de looking abroad for reform models while what worked in other countries is n't a guarantee for success , many believe looking beyond germany 's borders could provide the inspiration needed to reform europe 's largest economy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 25.10.2005 searching for a german childhood großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german headdress meets global childhood memory people living in a foreign country often feel left out when the natives start reminiscing about their common childhood memories .
a german-based artist from new zealand might have found an answer to the problem . as a 17-year-old exchange student from new zealand , joanne moar initially felt pretty lost at the other end of the world .
she 'd come to hamburg with very little german and a very different childhood and youth experience . when her friends got giggly about a party game that involves unwrapping a chocolate bar parcel while wearing gloves and using cutlery , she did n't really know how to react .
she had no idea that " hui bu , the castle ghost " was a popular audio play on tape german kids listened to .
moar had also never heard of harry potter 's german predecessor winnetou , the native american hero of novels by author karl may . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : generations of german boys have looked up to winnetou " i could n't connect to them on that level , " moar said .
" i did n't share these memories . " now 34 years old , moar has since spent more than a decade in germany and speaks the language without a hint of an accent .
a german childhood was still lacking , however , so moar decided to search for one . collecting memories she devised an art project called " becoming german " and set out to collect childhood memories from her adopted countrymen and women .
equipped with a laptop , two chairs and a table , moar made for pedestrian zones and lakeside promenades to invite germans to share their childhood memories with her . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moar -lrb- left -rrb- while gathering memories " people get a chance to tell their story , " moar said , adding that many people have thanked her for the possibility to remember their past . in return , moar lights up people 's eyes when she offers a now rarely sold cherry-flavored lollipop from their formative years . norbert wenning remembers the candy well . " the one with the green stick , right ? " said the professor of education at the university of münster . opera lovers of the world , unite but while it 's nice to walk down childhood-memory lane with others , wenning said that similar social backgrounds often played a much more important role than the country of origin when it comes to the ability to communicate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visiting london 's covent garden wo n't shock japanese opera lovers " if i 'm used to going to the opera , it does n't really matter which country i 'm in , " wenning said .
" differences within cultures are always bigger than those between cultures . " he added that other factors such as geography also play a role . " if you take a child who grew up in istanbul , a child who grew up in a large city , it 's going to be much easier for the child to move to berlin than for a child from -lrb- rural turkish region -rrb- anatolia to move to istanbul , " he said . a wealth of memories the lack of a shared childhood culture can potentially become a problem for migrant families with a low level of education , said cristina allemann-ghionda , a professor and expert on intercultural education at cologne university . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting along just fine in berlin 's kreuzberg district " but it 's definitely not a tragedy if someone can not share the memory of a certain children 's song or game , " said allemann-ghionda , who spent her formative years in italy , brazil , colombia , peru , belgium , germany and switzerland . " many times i was in the situation where i did n't know what people were talking about , " she said .
" but it always depends on how one deals with the situation .
i feel quite positive about it .
my head is full of memories . " a typical , atypical german childhood full of memories - just like moar 's online database , where 2,700 german childhoods have been entered so far . on her web site , people can now also receive a german childhood by entering some personal information that 's used to create a tailor-made early history for them . bildunterschrift : moar also collected childhood memories from the children of migrants who grew up in germany but instead of finding her own definitive faux german history , moar said she discovered that a typical german childhood does n't exist . " there are very many facets to it , " she said .
" i 'm finding that a typical german childhood is not like i expected a typical german childhood to be .

fearing bird flu , germans stockpile meds germany -pipe- 25.10.2005 german poultry lockdown restarts cage controversy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most eggs in germany are still laid by caged-up chickens a mandatory measure to coop up poultry to prevent an outbreak of bird flu has taken effect in germany .
most farmers support the move but some worry it might lead to chickens being held in cages for longer than needed . for german geese , fall is traditionally a bad time of year : many of them end up on dining tables in celebration of st. martin 's day on nov .
11 .
but , this year the birds ' short lives are facing further curbs . the threat of an outbreak of bird flu in germany means they now have to spend their last days cooped up instead of waddling outdoors . acting german agricultural minister jürgen trittin has ordered the country 's poultry farmers to cage their animals to prevent possible infection with the virus by migratory birds . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no fans of indoor life " it 's an unusual situation for geese , which usually get to go outside and are now stuck in stables , " said gerald wehde , a spokesman for bioland , germany 's largest association of organic farmers .
" it 's stressful for them . " geese farmers themselves are probably not too relaxed , either .
many do n't have adequate enclosures for their poultry and are scrambling to adhere to trittin 's order , wehde said . no fi n a n cial harm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some farms keep chickens in " conservatories " during the curfew organic chicken farmers on the other hand do n't face the same problem , as most already have fence-like structures in place . they 're also unlikely to suffer financially . while the bird flu scare is n't likely to boost the overall consumption of poultry products in germany , the mandatory lockdown wo n't put an extra burden on them . compared to conventional farmers who already keep their animals in cages , organic and free-range chicken farms are allowed to continue to market their products as if their poultry stock were still running around outside . some oppositio n but not everyone is happy with the mandatory nationwide chicken caging , with some complaining it 's unnecessary harassment that has only scared people . " we think it is complete nonsense , " said reinhard jung , who represents an association of 300 family farms in the eastern state of brandenburg . " people behave as if the plague were about to strike , " he said , adding that he thinks the lockdown can not prevent animals from getting infected . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : free-range no more but most major famers ' associations , including bioland , back the lockdown as a sensible precaution to prevent the spread of bird flu . " it 's simply meant to protect the animals , " said dirk höppner of the umbrella organization for germany 's poultry industry . threate n i n g orga n ic farms ? bioland 's wehde , however , said he worried that the house arrest for chickens could reignite the debate about a german ban on caged chickens that 's meant to take effect in 2007 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conventional farmers agree that chicken cages should be phased out the bird flu scare " could discredit alternative forms of farming , " wehde said , referring to organic farming .
conventional farmers , who want to replace tiny cages with larger ones for several animals , could argue that keeping animals outside would pose too many risks . jung expressed similar concerns . " there 's a danger that appropriate farming methods that are slowly gaining ground will be pushed to the side again , " he said . far from it , said gert stuke , whose german breakfast egg company has about 4.8 million chickens producing eggs in conventional , organic and free-range farms . " we 're not going to play off farming methods against each other , " stuke said , adding that his firm backed so-called " mini aviaries " that can hold 60 animals .
about 90 percent of germany 's 40 million chickens in egg production are still kept in cages . caged u n til 2013 ? " we do n't want to keep the old cages , we 're responsible egg producers , and the mini aviaries are the best farming method , " stuke said , adding that german breakfast egg will still offer organic and free-range eggs as long as people want to buy them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are aviaries the solution ?
so far , the mini aviaries have not been approved as an alternative farming method .
stuke has only been able to try them out on a test farm .
but along with other conventional egg producers , he hopes the incoming government of christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and social democrats will change that in the near future . that could well turn out to be the case . " we want to allow for a transition period to give chicken farmers the opportunity to switch to aviaries , " said peter bleser , the cdu 's agriculture spokesman , adding there was no connection between the bird flu and the debate about chicken cages . theoretically cages could stay until 2012 , when an eu-wide ban takes effect . mathis winkler , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu considers wild bird import ban the european commission is facing increasing pressure to ban all wild bird imports after new cases of bird flu appeared in russia , croatia and british quarantine .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 25.10.2005 telekom investors ' suit starts 2nd round großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investors are red in the face over the magenta telekom t the german telecommunications company deutsche telekom faces a lawsuit brought forth by some 15,000 small investors .
they accuse the telecoms group of misleading them before two public share placements . the second round of a landmark lawsuit against german telecommunications giant deutsche telekom is set to begin tuesday , nearly one year after a preliminary hearing .
some 15,000 small investors divided into almost 2,200 groups are suing deutsche telekom for some 100 million euros -lrb- $ 119 million -rrb- . the focus of the suit is the shareholders ' claim that deutsch telekom deliberately misled them about the valuation of its property portfolio in stock exchange prospectuses for two public share placements during the height of the internet and dot-com boom in 1999 and 2000 .
at the end of the preliminary round of hearings last november , the small investors already booked a small victory when judge meinrad wösthoff criticized the methods used to value deutsche telekom 's vast real estate portfolio . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : telekom ceo kai-uwe ricke must face the ire of investors , a legacy of his predecessor the judge hit out at the company for valuing a huge portfolio of real estate comprising 35,000 buildings and plots of land en bloc rather than individually as required by german law .
the plaintiffs said the value of the properties was consistently overstated , inflating the book value of deutsche telekom itself , which in turn meant that investors paid a stiff premium for their shares . " people 's share " loses dramatically wösthoff said last year that the so-called " cluster " method of valuing property used by deutsche telekom did not correspond to the rules .
but he cautioned that that did not automatically mean that the valuations themselves were wrong . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : along with the dax , deutsche telekom shares plummeted in 2000-2002 the deutsche telekom court case is legally and logistically without precedent in germany .
the 15,000 small shareholders are suing the company because they feel they paid too much for shares bought when the former state-owned monopoly was privatized in the 1990s . it was only when deutsche telekom was forced to write down the value of its real estate holdings at the beginning of 2001 that shareholders became aware of the problem .
then investors quickly saw their savings go up in smoke as the news sent what germany had once proudly dubbed the " people 's share " into a long and precipitous slide on the stock market .
now , the pensioners and small-time savers who believed their hard-earned savings would be safe in europe 's biggest phone company want their money back . lots to blame in precedent setting case the roughly 15,000 investors have instructed 750 lawyers to file 2,200 separate lawsuits for a total of around 100 million euros in compensation .
no stone is being left unturned by the plaintiffs who are suing everyone involved in the privatization of deutsche telekom - the company itself and its former chief ron sommer , the government , the state-owned privatization vehicle kfw bank , and even the underwriting banks , such as deutsche bank . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investors want to return the bill to sender , deutsche telekom investors also feel cheated that they were not fully informed about the risks connected with deutsche telekom 's planned acquisition of us mobile phone operator voicestream barely a month after the third share offering in july 2000 .
in a takeover that many analysts called much too expensive , deutsche telekom paid more than $ 40 billion for voicestream , and it became another key factor behind the dizzying fall in the price of the german group 's shares . they lost almost 92 percent of their value , plunging from the giddy heights of a record 103.90 euros at the height of the internet boom to an all-time low of 8.59 euros on june 26 , 2002 . judge wösthoff said last november that those complaints were not justified .
the court also said that deutsche telekom 's former chief ron sommer could not be held responsible for the slide in the share price . dw staff / afp -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de judge criticizes telekom in first hearing german telecoms giant deutsche telekom was reprimanded by the judge overseeing the massive lawsuit brought against the company by 15,000 angry shareholders in the first court hearing on tuesday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 25.10.2005 searching for a german childhood großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german headdress meets global childhood memory people living in a foreign country often feel left out when the natives start reminiscing about their common childhood memories .
a german-based artist from new zealand might have found an answer to the problem . as a 17-year-old exchange student from new zealand , joanne moar initially felt pretty lost at the other end of the world .
she 'd come to hamburg with very little german and a very different childhood and youth experience . when her friends got giggly about a party game that involves unwrapping a chocolate bar parcel while wearing gloves and using cutlery , she did n't really know how to react .
she had no idea that " hui bu , the castle ghost " was a popular audio play on tape german kids listened to .
moar had also never heard of harry potter 's german predecessor winnetou , the native american hero of novels by author karl may . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : generations of german boys have looked up to winnetou " i could n't connect to them on that level , " moar said .
" i did n't share these memories . " now 34 years old , moar has since spent more than a decade in germany and speaks the language without a hint of an accent .
a german childhood was still lacking , however , so moar decided to search for one . collecting memories she devised an art project called " becoming german " and set out to collect childhood memories from her adopted countrymen and women .
equipped with a laptop , two chairs and a table , moar made for pedestrian zones and lakeside promenades to invite germans to share their childhood memories with her . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moar -lrb- left -rrb- while gathering memories " people get a chance to tell their story , " moar said , adding that many people have thanked her for the possibility to remember their past . in return , moar lights up people 's eyes when she offers a now rarely sold cherry-flavored lollipop from their formative years . norbert wenning remembers the candy well . " the one with the green stick , right ? " said the professor of education at the university of münster . opera lovers of the world , unite but while it 's nice to walk down childhood-memory lane with others , wenning said that similar social backgrounds often played a much more important role than the country of origin when it comes to the ability to communicate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visiting london 's covent garden wo n't shock japanese opera lovers " if i 'm used to going to the opera , it does n't really matter which country i 'm in , " wenning said .
" differences within cultures are always bigger than those between cultures . " he added that other factors such as geography also play a role . " if you take a child who grew up in istanbul , a child who grew up in a large city , it 's going to be much easier for the child to move to berlin than for a child from -lrb- rural turkish region -rrb- anatolia to move to istanbul , " he said . a wealth of memories the lack of a shared childhood culture can potentially become a problem for migrant families with a low level of education , said cristina allemann-ghionda , a professor and expert on intercultural education at cologne university . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting along just fine in berlin 's kreuzberg district " but it 's definitely not a tragedy if someone can not share the memory of a certain children 's song or game , " said allemann-ghionda , who spent her formative years in italy , brazil , colombia , peru , belgium , germany and switzerland . " many times i was in the situation where i did n't know what people were talking about , " she said .
" but it always depends on how one deals with the situation .
i feel quite positive about it .
my head is full of memories . " a typical , atypical german childhood full of memories - just like moar 's online database , where 2,700 german childhoods have been entered so far . on her web site , people can now also receive a german childhood by entering some personal information that 's used to create a tailor-made early history for them . bildunterschrift : moar also collected childhood memories from the children of migrants who grew up in germany but instead of finding her own definitive faux german history , moar said she discovered that a typical german childhood does n't exist . " there are very many facets to it , " she said .
" i 'm finding that a typical german childhood is not like i expected a typical german childhood to be .

make sure you are where you say you are in their coalition talks , the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have agreed to get tough on abuse of germany 's reformed unemployment regulations , known as hartz iv . the cost of germany 's labor market reform is almost double the amount originally planned - 26 billion instead of the estimated 14 billion euros .
spd head franz müntefering said the hike could partly be attributed to the fact that local authorities transferred more of the old system 's welfare recipients into the new hartz iv unemployment benefit scheme than expected .
but politicians are also lashing out at benefit cheats , announcing plans to step up controls on fraudulent claims .
the discussion has taken on a virulent tone , with a report posted on the economics and labor ministry 's web site indirectly comparing welfare recipients to parasites .
the report contains a detailed list of real life examples of benefit cheats , referring to them as " freeloaders " and " spongers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement 's ministry indirectly compared people on benefit to parasites peter clever , the deputy head of the board of directors for the federal labor office told broadcaster deutschlandfunk that , in random telephone checks since july on 390,000 hartz iv recipients , 170,000 could not be reached , despite 10 phone calls being made at different times of the day and different days of the week .
" you 'd have to be really naïve to believe that all 170,000 people happened to be in job interviews at the time , " clever said . the economics and labor ministry said it intends to step up telephone checks as well as other forms of control in the future .
a spokeswoman from the ministry said that welfare recipients have a duty to cooperate with their local authorities and must be available for consultation . housing benefit open to fraud bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : state subsidized housing has been identified as a major area open to abuse experts say that subsidized housing under hartz iv is one of the biggest sources of welfare abuse .
a long-term unemployed person on welfare support can have an " appropriate " apartment -lrb- for example , up to 50 square meters of living space for a single person or 70 square meters for two people -rrb- including heat and electricity , completely paid for by the state . the problem is that many welfare recipients are moving into these " appropriate " apartments on paper only .
for that reason , housing benefit should only be paid to young adults living alone if their parents ' income is insufficient , the director of the german association of local authorities , gerd landsberg , told the osnabrücker zeitung .
young people who qualify as long-term unemployed should be required to prove that they need their own apartment in order to take up job training or other qualification measures , landsberg said . politicians are now calling for further reforms to hartz iv in order to cut back on the number of households claiming state-subsidized housing . interest groups , charities outraged an internet forum for the unemployed -lrb- erwerbslosen forum deutschland -rrb- has reacted angrily to the accusations made by the labor ministry , claiming it is looking for a scapegoat to draw attention away from its past failure to clamp down on welfare fraud . germany 's main social and charitable organizations also protested against accusations of welfare abuse , saying the cost of labor market reform was set at an unreasonably low level to begin with .

make sure you are where you say you are in their coalition talks , the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have agreed to get tough on abuse of germany 's reformed unemployment regulations , known as hartz iv . the cost of germany 's labor market reform is almost double the amount originally planned - 26 billion instead of the estimated 14 billion euros .
spd head franz müntefering said the hike could partly be attributed to the fact that local authorities transferred more of the old system 's welfare recipients into the new hartz iv unemployment benefit scheme than expected .
but politicians are also lashing out at benefit cheats , announcing plans to step up controls on fraudulent claims .
the discussion has taken on a virulent tone , with a report posted on the economics and labor ministry 's web site indirectly comparing welfare recipients to parasites .
the report contains a detailed list of real life examples of benefit cheats , referring to them as " freeloaders " and " spongers . "

could der kaiser be looking for some holy help ? the german national soccer team 's recent slew of mediocre results in their preparation games ahead of the world cup in 2006 are really causing concern for the host country . with public denunciations of coach jürgen klinsmann 's ability to lead germany to glory rife over the past few months , those who have a vested interest in seeing the hosts do well are doing everything in their power to summon help . germany looking for some help from above bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi will meet with beckenbauer and his entourage .
first it was announced that the german team would have its own priest during the soccer spectacle and that special church services would be arranged during the world cup for fans to offer their prayers of hope .
now , franz beckenbauer , the head of the german organizing committee -lrb- ok -rrb- , is heading to the vatican for an audience with pope benedict xvi . although the meeting with the pontiff is being included in beckenbauer 's world cup welcome tour , many detractors of the german team and their chances may see it as a chance for the concerned chairman to call on some divine intervention from a very connected source . " der kaiser , " as beckenbauer is known , has already visited tehran , riyadh , seoul and tokyo as part of the tour that will eventually see him visit all 32 countries that have qualified for the world cup by february 2006 . vatican visit arranged after turkey , china debacles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's nuri sahin scored the second goal in germany 's 2-0 defeat .
conspiracy theorists may read much into the fact that the audience has been hastily organized ; germany lost to turkey and just squeezed past china in friendly games this month . " our request to the vatican to meet the holy father was made quite late , " admitted beckenbauer .
" for that reason we are delighted and grateful that this meeting is now possible . " it is unlikely that any plea for a word in germany 's favor from the pope will be made public after beckenbauer , ok vice-president wolfgang niersbach , advisor fedor h. radmann and germany 's former coach rudi völler depart from the vatican . but a reversal of the team 's fortunes after the visit may cause some to look to the heavens and offer thanks . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany considers offers of holy guidance the german soccer team are being inundated with offers of divine guidance during the world cup .

"
he said it " gives romania the chance to join the eu on january 1 , 2007 . " " the report should not lead us to rejoicing or sadness .
we must remain vigilant , ready to meet what is required for joining in 2007 , " basescu said . he said romania would " feel the benefits of joining the eu only when it is a full member " and that " up until this moment romanians must pay the price of joining . " basescu called on legal officials and police to fight corruption , as the eu demands .
he said they should have " zero tolerance " for corruption . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ivaylo kalfin assured the eu that bulgaria would do what was needed .
in sofia , bulgarian foreign minister ivaylo kalfin said : " both countries fully understand our responsibility in the months left ahead of our accession into the eu .
we accept the report as a partner 's assessment and will fully focus on implementing what has been negotiated , " kalfin said . progress needed to ensure accession the two former communist states are on track to join the eu as planned in 2007 , the eu 's executive announced on tuesday , but warned the eastern european states to make further progress on reforms . the two balkan states are doing too little to fight corruption , the european commission said , in annual progress reports on their eu membership suitability , amid speculation that their entry could be delayed by a year . the reports stated that there were " serious concerns " in areas accounting for around ten percent of eu legislation , where " unless immediate action is taken the countries will not be ready for accession " .
brussels is also concerned about administrative capacity , where the commission said " overall reform of administrative structures " needs to be stepped up in order for both romania and bulgaria to be able to absorb eu funds .
other areas which needed to be addressed were the shortcomings in the veterinary field , which may " put at risk food safety " in the eu , and the level of corruption in the two countries " particularly at a high level " .
commission threatens year-long delays bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olli rehn said the eu would not hesitate to implement delays .
before the talks , european enlargement commissioner olli rehn said the commission would not hesitate to delay the scheduled accession if reform efforts in the key areas fail .
romania and bulgaria signed their accession treaties on april 25 this year , but these treaties contain a unique clause which gives the european commission the option to delay the 2007 entry date until 2008 if entry preparations are insufficient .
rehn added that brussels would " not hesitate " to make use of the option in its recommendation on the entry date to eu member states .
" we may recommend , if needed , to postpone accession by one year " , he said .
" the possibility of being ready in 2007 is not lost , but making it will require a lot of work . ” the commission is due to meet to discuss the two countries ’ entry date in may or april next year .
bulgaria slips from lead in race with neighbor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traian basescu 's romania has " caught up impressively . "
these warnings , known in accession speak as " yellow cards " , come as a particular blow to bulgaria .
it has been widely accepted that the bulgarians have always been ahead of their neighbor romania in their eu preparation , but a close general election result in june plunged the country in a reform deadlock .
the commission said that bulgaria was " working energetically " after it had " lost the momentum somewhat " , but it was romania who had " caught up impressively " , particularly in the areas of competition policy , justice , state aid and overall alignment with eu law . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de romania , bulgaria sign eu entry pact romania and bulgaria signed an accession treaty with the european union monday , paving the way to join the bloc in january 2007 in what they hailed as an " historic " step for their ex-communist nations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 25.10.2005 searching for a german childhood großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german headdress meets global childhood memory people living in a foreign country often feel left out when the natives start reminiscing about their common childhood memories .
a german-based artist from new zealand might have found an answer to the problem . as a 17-year-old exchange student from new zealand , joanne moar initially felt pretty lost at the other end of the world .
she 'd come to hamburg with very little german and a very different childhood and youth experience . when her friends got giggly about a party game that involves unwrapping a chocolate bar parcel while wearing gloves and using cutlery , she did n't really know how to react .
she had no idea that " hui bu , the castle ghost " was a popular audio play on tape german kids listened to .
moar had also never heard of harry potter 's german predecessor winnetou , the native american hero of novels by author karl may . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : generations of german boys have looked up to winnetou " i could n't connect to them on that level , " moar said .
" i did n't share these memories . " now 34 years old , moar has since spent more than a decade in germany and speaks the language without a hint of an accent .
a german childhood was still lacking , however , so moar decided to search for one . collecting memories she devised an art project called " becoming german " and set out to collect childhood memories from her adopted countrymen and women .
equipped with a laptop , two chairs and a table , moar made for pedestrian zones and lakeside promenades to invite germans to share their childhood memories with her . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moar -lrb- left -rrb- while gathering memories " people get a chance to tell their story , " moar said , adding that many people have thanked her for the possibility to remember their past . in return , moar lights up people 's eyes when she offers a now rarely sold cherry-flavored lollipop from their formative years . norbert wenning remembers the candy well . " the one with the green stick , right ? " said the professor of education at the university of münster . opera lovers of the world , unite but while it 's nice to walk down childhood-memory lane with others , wenning said that similar social backgrounds often played a much more important role than the country of origin when it comes to the ability to communicate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visiting london 's covent garden wo n't shock japanese opera lovers " if i 'm used to going to the opera , it does n't really matter which country i 'm in , " wenning said .
" differences within cultures are always bigger than those between cultures . " he added that other factors such as geography also play a role . " if you take a child who grew up in istanbul , a child who grew up in a large city , it 's going to be much easier for the child to move to berlin than for a child from -lrb- rural turkish region -rrb- anatolia to move to istanbul , " he said . a wealth of memories the lack of a shared childhood culture can potentially become a problem for migrant families with a low level of education , said cristina allemann-ghionda , a professor and expert on intercultural education at cologne university . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting along just fine in berlin 's kreuzberg district " but it 's definitely not a tragedy if someone can not share the memory of a certain children 's song or game , " said allemann-ghionda , who spent her formative years in italy , brazil , colombia , peru , belgium , germany and switzerland . " many times i was in the situation where i did n't know what people were talking about , " she said .
" but it always depends on how one deals with the situation .
i feel quite positive about it .
my head is full of memories . " a typical , atypical german childhood full of memories - just like moar 's online database , where 2,700 german childhoods have been entered so far . on her web site , people can now also receive a german childhood by entering some personal information that 's used to create a tailor-made early history for them . bildunterschrift : moar also collected childhood memories from the children of migrants who grew up in germany but instead of finding her own definitive faux german history , moar said she discovered that a typical german childhood does n't exist . " there are very many facets to it , " she said .
" i 'm finding that a typical german childhood is not like i expected a typical german childhood to be .

" we 're not going to play off farming methods against each other , " stuke said , adding that his firm backed so-called " mini aviaries " that can hold 60 animals .
about 90 percent of germany 's 40 million chickens in egg production are still kept in cages . caged u n til 2013 ? " we do n't want to keep the old cages , we 're responsible egg producers , and the mini aviaries are the best farming method , " stuke said , adding that german breakfast egg will still offer organic and free-range eggs as long as people want to buy them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are aviaries the solution ?
so far , the mini aviaries have not been approved as an alternative farming method .
stuke has only been able to try them out on a test farm .

" we want to allow for a transition period to give chicken farmers the opportunity to switch to aviaries , " said peter bleser , the cdu 's agriculture spokesman , adding there was no connection between the bird flu and the debate about chicken cages . theoretically cages could stay until 2012 , when an eu-wide ban takes effect . mathis winkler , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu considers wild bird import ban the european commission is facing increasing pressure to ban all wild bird imports after new cases of bird flu appeared in russia , croatia and british quarantine .

make sure you are where you say you are in their coalition talks , the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have agreed to get tough on abuse of germany 's reformed unemployment regulations , known as hartz iv . the cost of germany 's labor market reform is almost double the amount originally planned - 26 billion instead of the estimated 14 billion euros .
spd head franz müntefering said the hike could partly be attributed to the fact that local authorities transferred more of the old system 's welfare recipients into the new hartz iv unemployment benefit scheme than expected .
but politicians are also lashing out at benefit cheats , announcing plans to step up controls on fraudulent claims .
the discussion has taken on a virulent tone , with a report posted on the economics and labor ministry 's web site indirectly comparing welfare recipients to parasites .
the report contains a detailed list of real life examples of benefit cheats , referring to them as " freeloaders " and " spongers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement 's ministry indirectly compared people on benefit to parasites peter clever , the deputy head of the board of directors for the federal labor office told broadcaster deutschlandfunk that , in random telephone checks since july on 390,000 hartz iv recipients , 170,000 could not be reached , despite 10 phone calls being made at different times of the day and different days of the week .
" you 'd have to be really naïve to believe that all 170,000 people happened to be in job interviews at the time , " clever said . the economics and labor ministry said it intends to step up telephone checks as well as other forms of control in the future .
a spokeswoman from the ministry said that welfare recipients have a duty to cooperate with their local authorities and must be available for consultation . housing benefit open to fraud bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : state subsidized housing has been identified as a major area open to abuse experts say that subsidized housing under hartz iv is one of the biggest sources of welfare abuse .
a long-term unemployed person on welfare support can have an " appropriate " apartment -lrb- for example , up to 50 square meters of living space for a single person or 70 square meters for two people -rrb- including heat and electricity , completely paid for by the state . the problem is that many welfare recipients are moving into these " appropriate " apartments on paper only .
for that reason , housing benefit should only be paid to young adults living alone if their parents ' income is insufficient , the director of the german association of local authorities , gerd landsberg , told the osnabrücker zeitung .
young people who qualify as long-term unemployed should be required to prove that they need their own apartment in order to take up job training or other qualification measures , landsberg said . politicians are now calling for further reforms to hartz iv in order to cut back on the number of households claiming state-subsidized housing . interest groups , charities outraged an internet forum for the unemployed -lrb- erwerbslosen forum deutschland -rrb- has reacted angrily to the accusations made by the labor ministry , claiming it is looking for a scapegoat to draw attention away from its past failure to clamp down on welfare fraud . germany 's main social and charitable organizations also protested against accusations of welfare abuse , saying the cost of labor market reform was set at an unreasonably low level to begin with . " it 's an attempt to lay the blame for persistent labor market misery at the door of those affected by it , " said georg cremer , general secretary of the german caritas association . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de looking abroad for reform models while what worked in other countries is n't a guarantee for success , many believe looking beyond germany 's borders could provide the inspiration needed to reform europe 's largest economy .

make sure you are where you say you are in their coalition talks , the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have agreed to get tough on abuse of germany 's reformed unemployment regulations , known as hartz iv . the cost of germany 's labor market reform is almost double the amount originally planned - 26 billion instead of the estimated 14 billion euros .
spd head franz müntefering said the hike could partly be attributed to the fact that local authorities transferred more of the old system 's welfare recipients into the new hartz iv unemployment benefit scheme than expected .
but politicians are also lashing out at benefit cheats , announcing plans to step up controls on fraudulent claims .
the discussion has taken on a virulent tone , with a report posted on the economics and labor ministry 's web site indirectly comparing welfare recipients to parasites .
the report contains a detailed list of real life examples of benefit cheats , referring to them as " freeloaders " and " spongers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement 's ministry indirectly compared people on benefit to parasites peter clever , the deputy head of the board of directors for the federal labor office told broadcaster deutschlandfunk that , in random telephone checks since july on 390,000 hartz iv recipients , 170,000 could not be reached , despite 10 phone calls being made at different times of the day and different days of the week .
" you 'd have to be really naïve to believe that all 170,000 people happened to be in job interviews at the time , " clever said . the economics and labor ministry said it intends to step up telephone checks as well as other forms of control in the future .
a spokeswoman from the ministry said that welfare recipients have a duty to cooperate with their local authorities and must be available for consultation . housing benefit open to fraud bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : state subsidized housing has been identified as a major area open to abuse experts say that subsidized housing under hartz iv is one of the biggest sources of welfare abuse .
a long-term unemployed person on welfare support can have an " appropriate " apartment -lrb- for example , up to 50 square meters of living space for a single person or 70 square meters for two people -rrb- including heat and electricity , completely paid for by the state . the problem is that many welfare recipients are moving into these " appropriate " apartments on paper only .
for that reason , housing benefit should only be paid to young adults living alone if their parents ' income is insufficient , the director of the german association of local authorities , gerd landsberg , told the osnabrücker zeitung .
young people who qualify as long-term unemployed should be required to prove that they need their own apartment in order to take up job training or other qualification measures , landsberg said . politicians are now calling for further reforms to hartz iv in order to cut back on the number of households claiming state-subsidized housing . interest groups , charities outraged an internet forum for the unemployed -lrb- erwerbslosen forum deutschland -rrb- has reacted angrily to the accusations made by the labor ministry , claiming it is looking for a scapegoat to draw attention away from its past failure to clamp down on welfare fraud . germany 's main social and charitable organizations also protested against accusations of welfare abuse , saying the cost of labor market reform was set at an unreasonably low level to begin with .

make sure you are where you say you are in their coalition talks , the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have agreed to get tough on abuse of germany 's reformed unemployment regulations , known as hartz iv . the cost of germany 's labor market reform is almost double the amount originally planned - 26 billion instead of the estimated 14 billion euros .
spd head franz müntefering said the hike could partly be attributed to the fact that local authorities transferred more of the old system 's welfare recipients into the new hartz iv unemployment benefit scheme than expected .
but politicians are also lashing out at benefit cheats , announcing plans to step up controls on fraudulent claims .
the discussion has taken on a virulent tone , with a report posted on the economics and labor ministry 's web site indirectly comparing welfare recipients to parasites .
the report contains a detailed list of real life examples of benefit cheats , referring to them as " freeloaders " and " spongers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement 's ministry indirectly compared people on benefit to parasites peter clever , the deputy head of the board of directors for the federal labor office told broadcaster deutschlandfunk that , in random telephone checks since july on 390,000 hartz iv recipients , 170,000 could not be reached , despite 10 phone calls being made at different times of the day and different days of the week .
" you 'd have to be really naïve to believe that all 170,000 people happened to be in job interviews at the time , " clever said . the economics and labor ministry said it intends to step up telephone checks as well as other forms of control in the future .
a spokeswoman from the ministry said that welfare recipients have a duty to cooperate with their local authorities and must be available for consultation . housing benefit open to fraud bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : state subsidized housing has been identified as a major area open to abuse experts say that subsidized housing under hartz iv is one of the biggest sources of welfare abuse .
a long-term unemployed person on welfare support can have an " appropriate " apartment -lrb- for example , up to 50 square meters of living space for a single person or 70 square meters for two people -rrb- including heat and electricity , completely paid for by the state . the problem is that many welfare recipients are moving into these " appropriate " apartments on paper only .
for that reason , housing benefit should only be paid to young adults living alone if their parents ' income is insufficient , the director of the german association of local authorities , gerd landsberg , told the osnabrücker zeitung .
young people who qualify as long-term unemployed should be required to prove that they need their own apartment in order to take up job training or other qualification measures , landsberg said . politicians are now calling for further reforms to hartz iv in order to cut back on the number of households claiming state-subsidized housing . interest groups , charities outraged an internet forum for the unemployed -lrb- erwerbslosen forum deutschland -rrb- has reacted angrily to the accusations made by the labor ministry , claiming it is looking for a scapegoat to draw attention away from its past failure to clamp down on welfare fraud . germany 's main social and charitable organizations also protested against accusations of welfare abuse , saying the cost of labor market reform was set at an unreasonably low level to begin with . " it 's an attempt to lay the blame for persistent labor market misery at the door of those affected by it , " said georg cremer , general secretary of the german caritas association . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de looking abroad for reform models while what worked in other countries is n't a guarantee for success , many believe looking beyond germany 's borders could provide the inspiration needed to reform europe 's largest economy .

he said they should have " zero tolerance " for corruption . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ivaylo kalfin assured the eu that bulgaria would do what was needed .

rehn added that brussels would " not hesitate " to make use of the option in its recommendation on the entry date to eu member states .
" we may recommend , if needed , to postpone accession by one year " , he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 25.10.2005 german hiv infections on the rise großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hiv awareness is declining , officials say new cases of hiv rose in germany this year with health officials saying that drug cocktails to fight the disease are contributing to the increase . the number of new hiv infections in germany rose 20 percent in the first six months of this year over the same period in 2004 , and government officials are worried that drugs that fight hiv / aids have led to underestimation of the disease .
" the german health minister considers this a serious development and says the rise in hiv infections is worrying , " health ministry spokeswoman dagmar reitenbach told reporters .
" unfortunately , it is often the case that hiv / aids is no longer taken seriously as a life-threatening disease . " according to a report from the robert koch institute , the federal government 's disease control center , 1,164 people were infected in the first half of 2005 with the virus .
the institute said the hiv risk for males was roughly 7.5 times greater than for women and that most of the new infections were in males between the ages of 25 and 45 .
german cities such as berlin , hamburg , cologne and frankfurt have the highest risk of new infection , the report said .
gays ' hiv risk climbing about 40 million people worldwide are infected with hiv / aids , and africa is the hardest hit region with 25 million .
in the eu , infections are on the rise .
in germany , the infection rate was stable for years , remaining under 2,000 annually in a population of 82 million .
but in 2004 , the infection rate topped 2,000 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drug advances appear to cause people to be less concerned about hiv / aids woman make up about half of the number of the infected worldwide .
the most significant hiv risk factor for women in germany is sexual contact with males from other high-risk groups : men from countries with a high prevalence of hiv / aids , intravenous drug users and men who have had homosexual contact .
almost 60 percent of the new infections were among homosexual men , and the risk of infection among this group is almost twice as high as it was 12 years ago .
the head of the robert koch institute , reinhard kurth , said the news was worrying and that more attempts needed to be made to communicate to the populace that aids , despite improved therapies , is still an incurable disease .
he added that the new drug cocktails , that have proven effective in treating the symptoms of aids , have led to many taking the consequences of infection less seriously .
" more efforts must be made to explain and inform people that despite an improvement in therapy , there is no cure for this disease , " he said in a statement . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german aids foundation thinks positive when the german aids foundation presented its annual report in bonn on friday , it revealed that even in germany , one common side-effect of hiv infection is poverty .

a german-based artist from new zealand might have found an answer to the problem . as a 17-year-old exchange student from new zealand , joanne moar initially felt pretty lost at the other end of the world .
she 'd come to hamburg with very little german and a very different childhood and youth experience . when her friends got giggly about a party game that involves unwrapping a chocolate bar parcel while wearing gloves and using cutlery , she did n't really know how to react .
she had no idea that " hui bu , the castle ghost " was a popular audio play on tape german kids listened to .
moar had also never heard of harry potter 's german predecessor winnetou , the native american hero of novels by author karl may . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : generations of german boys have looked up to winnetou " i could n't connect to them on that level , " moar said .
" i did n't share these memories . " now 34 years old , moar has since spent more than a decade in germany and speaks the language without a hint of an accent .
a german childhood was still lacking , however , so moar decided to search for one . collecting memories she devised an art project called " becoming german " and set out to collect childhood memories from her adopted countrymen and women .
equipped with a laptop , two chairs and a table , moar made for pedestrian zones and lakeside promenades to invite germans to share their childhood memories with her . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moar -lrb- left -rrb- while gathering memories " people get a chance to tell their story , " moar said , adding that many people have thanked her for the possibility to remember their past . in return , moar lights up people 's eyes when she offers a now rarely sold cherry-flavored lollipop from their formative years . norbert wenning remembers the candy well . " the one with the green stick , right ? " said the professor of education at the university of münster . opera lovers of the world , unite but while it 's nice to walk down childhood-memory lane with others , wenning said that similar social backgrounds often played a much more important role than the country of origin when it comes to the ability to communicate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visiting london 's covent garden wo n't shock japanese opera lovers " if i 'm used to going to the opera , it does n't really matter which country i 'm in , " wenning said .
" differences within cultures are always bigger than those between cultures . " he added that other factors such as geography also play a role . " if you take a child who grew up in istanbul , a child who grew up in a large city , it 's going to be much easier for the child to move to berlin than for a child from -lrb- rural turkish region -rrb- anatolia to move to istanbul , " he said . a wealth of memories the lack of a shared childhood culture can potentially become a problem for migrant families with a low level of education , said cristina allemann-ghionda , a professor and expert on intercultural education at cologne university . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting along just fine in berlin 's kreuzberg district " but it 's definitely not a tragedy if someone can not share the memory of a certain children 's song or game , " said allemann-ghionda , who spent her formative years in italy , brazil , colombia , peru , belgium , germany and switzerland . " many times i was in the situation where i did n't know what people were talking about , " she said .
" but it always depends on how one deals with the situation .
i feel quite positive about it .
my head is full of memories . " a typical , atypical german childhood full of memories - just like moar 's online database , where 2,700 german childhoods have been entered so far . on her web site , people can now also receive a german childhood by entering some personal information that 's used to create a tailor-made early history for them . bildunterschrift : moar also collected childhood memories from the children of migrants who grew up in germany but instead of finding her own definitive faux german history , moar said she discovered that a typical german childhood does n't exist . " there are very many facets to it , " she said .
" i 'm finding that a typical german childhood is not like i expected a typical german childhood to be .

"
he said it " gives romania the chance to join the eu on january 1 , 2007 . " " the report should not lead us to rejoicing or sadness .
we must remain vigilant , ready to meet what is required for joining in 2007 , " basescu said . he said romania would " feel the benefits of joining the eu only when it is a full member " and that " up until this moment romanians must pay the price of joining . " basescu called on legal officials and police to fight corruption , as the eu demands .
he said they should have " zero tolerance " for corruption . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ivaylo kalfin assured the eu that bulgaria would do what was needed .
in sofia , bulgarian foreign minister ivaylo kalfin said : " both countries fully understand our responsibility in the months left ahead of our accession into the eu .
we accept the report as a partner 's assessment and will fully focus on implementing what has been negotiated , " kalfin said . progress needed to ensure accession the two former communist states are on track to join the eu as planned in 2007 , the eu 's executive announced on tuesday , but warned the eastern european states to make further progress on reforms . the two balkan states are doing too little to fight corruption , the european commission said , in annual progress reports on their eu membership suitability , amid speculation that their entry could be delayed by a year . the reports stated that there were " serious concerns " in areas accounting for around ten percent of eu legislation , where " unless immediate action is taken the countries will not be ready for accession " .
brussels is also concerned about administrative capacity , where the commission said " overall reform of administrative structures " needs to be stepped up in order for both romania and bulgaria to be able to absorb eu funds .
other areas which needed to be addressed were the shortcomings in the veterinary field , which may " put at risk food safety " in the eu , and the level of corruption in the two countries " particularly at a high level " .
commission threatens year-long delays bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olli rehn said the eu would not hesitate to implement delays .
before the talks , european enlargement commissioner olli rehn said the commission would not hesitate to delay the scheduled accession if reform efforts in the key areas fail .
romania and bulgaria signed their accession treaties on april 25 this year , but these treaties contain a unique clause which gives the european commission the option to delay the 2007 entry date until 2008 if entry preparations are insufficient .
rehn added that brussels would " not hesitate " to make use of the option in its recommendation on the entry date to eu member states .
" we may recommend , if needed , to postpone accession by one year " , he said .
" the possibility of being ready in 2007 is not lost , but making it will require a lot of work . ” the commission is due to meet to discuss the two countries ’ entry date in may or april next year .

" the german health minister considers this a serious development and says the rise in hiv infections is worrying , " health ministry spokeswoman dagmar reitenbach told reporters .
" unfortunately , it is often the case that hiv / aids is no longer taken seriously as a life-threatening disease . " according to a report from the robert koch institute , the federal government 's disease control center , 1,164 people were infected in the first half of 2005 with the virus .
the institute said the hiv risk for males was roughly 7.5 times greater than for women and that most of the new infections were in males between the ages of 25 and 45 .
german cities such as berlin , hamburg , cologne and frankfurt have the highest risk of new infection , the report said .
gays ' hiv risk climbing about 40 million people worldwide are infected with hiv / aids , and africa is the hardest hit region with 25 million .
in the eu , infections are on the rise .
in germany , the infection rate was stable for years , remaining under 2,000 annually in a population of 82 million .
but in 2004 , the infection rate topped 2,000 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drug advances appear to cause people to be less concerned about hiv / aids woman make up about half of the number of the infected worldwide .
the most significant hiv risk factor for women in germany is sexual contact with males from other high-risk groups : men from countries with a high prevalence of hiv / aids , intravenous drug users and men who have had homosexual contact .
almost 60 percent of the new infections were among homosexual men , and the risk of infection among this group is almost twice as high as it was 12 years ago .
the head of the robert koch institute , reinhard kurth , said the news was worrying and that more attempts needed to be made to communicate to the populace that aids , despite improved therapies , is still an incurable disease .
he added that the new drug cocktails , that have proven effective in treating the symptoms of aids , have led to many taking the consequences of infection less seriously .
" more efforts must be made to explain and inform people that despite an improvement in therapy , there is no cure for this disease , " he said in a statement . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german aids foundation thinks positive when the german aids foundation presented its annual report in bonn on friday , it revealed that even in germany , one common side-effect of hiv infection is poverty .

" the german health minister considers this a serious development and says the rise in hiv infections is worrying , " health ministry spokeswoman dagmar reitenbach told reporters .
" unfortunately , it is often the case that hiv / aids is no longer taken seriously as a life-threatening disease . " according to a report from the robert koch institute , the federal government 's disease control center , 1,164 people were infected in the first half of 2005 with the virus .
the institute said the hiv risk for males was roughly 7.5 times greater than for women and that most of the new infections were in males between the ages of 25 and 45 .
german cities such as berlin , hamburg , cologne and frankfurt have the highest risk of new infection , the report said .
gays ' hiv risk climbing about 40 million people worldwide are infected with hiv / aids , and africa is the hardest hit region with 25 million .
in the eu , infections are on the rise .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drug advances appear to cause people to be less concerned about hiv / aids woman make up about half of the number of the infected worldwide .
the most significant hiv risk factor for women in germany is sexual contact with males from other high-risk groups : men from countries with a high prevalence of hiv / aids , intravenous drug users and men who have had homosexual contact .
almost 60 percent of the new infections were among homosexual men , and the risk of infection among this group is almost twice as high as it was 12 years ago .
the head of the robert koch institute , reinhard kurth , said the news was worrying and that more attempts needed to be made to communicate to the populace that aids , despite improved therapies , is still an incurable disease .
he added that the new drug cocktails , that have proven effective in treating the symptoms of aids , have led to many taking the consequences of infection less seriously .

a german childhood was still lacking , however , so moar decided to search for one . collecting memories she devised an art project called " becoming german " and set out to collect childhood memories from her adopted countrymen and women .

could der kaiser be looking for some holy help ? the german national soccer team 's recent slew of mediocre results in their preparation games ahead of the world cup in 2006 are really causing concern for the host country . with public denunciations of coach jürgen klinsmann 's ability to lead germany to glory rife over the past few months , those who have a vested interest in seeing the hosts do well are doing everything in their power to summon help . germany looking for some help from above bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi will meet with beckenbauer and his entourage .
first it was announced that the german team would have its own priest during the soccer spectacle and that special church services would be arranged during the world cup for fans to offer their prayers of hope .
now , franz beckenbauer , the head of the german organizing committee -lrb- ok -rrb- , is heading to the vatican for an audience with pope benedict xvi . although the meeting with the pontiff is being included in beckenbauer 's world cup welcome tour , many detractors of the german team and their chances may see it as a chance for the concerned chairman to call on some divine intervention from a very connected source . " der kaiser , " as beckenbauer is known , has already visited tehran , riyadh , seoul and tokyo as part of the tour that will eventually see him visit all 32 countries that have qualified for the world cup by february 2006 . vatican visit arranged after turkey , china debacles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's nuri sahin scored the second goal in germany 's 2-0 defeat .
conspiracy theorists may read much into the fact that the audience has been hastily organized ; germany lost to turkey and just squeezed past china in friendly games this month . " our request to the vatican to meet the holy father was made quite late , " admitted beckenbauer .
" for that reason we are delighted and grateful that this meeting is now possible . " it is unlikely that any plea for a word in germany 's favor from the pope will be made public after beckenbauer , ok vice-president wolfgang niersbach , advisor fedor h. radmann and germany 's former coach rudi völler depart from the vatican . but a reversal of the team 's fortunes after the visit may cause some to look to the heavens and offer thanks . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany considers offers of holy guidance the german soccer team are being inundated with offers of divine guidance during the world cup .

could der kaiser be looking for some holy help ? the german national soccer team 's recent slew of mediocre results in their preparation games ahead of the world cup in 2006 are really causing concern for the host country . with public denunciations of coach jürgen klinsmann 's ability to lead germany to glory rife over the past few months , those who have a vested interest in seeing the hosts do well are doing everything in their power to summon help . germany looking for some help from above bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi will meet with beckenbauer and his entourage .
first it was announced that the german team would have its own priest during the soccer spectacle and that special church services would be arranged during the world cup for fans to offer their prayers of hope .
now , franz beckenbauer , the head of the german organizing committee -lrb- ok -rrb- , is heading to the vatican for an audience with pope benedict xvi . although the meeting with the pontiff is being included in beckenbauer 's world cup welcome tour , many detractors of the german team and their chances may see it as a chance for the concerned chairman to call on some divine intervention from a very connected source . " der kaiser , " as beckenbauer is known , has already visited tehran , riyadh , seoul and tokyo as part of the tour that will eventually see him visit all 32 countries that have qualified for the world cup by february 2006 . vatican visit arranged after turkey , china debacles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's nuri sahin scored the second goal in germany 's 2-0 defeat .
conspiracy theorists may read much into the fact that the audience has been hastily organized ; germany lost to turkey and just squeezed past china in friendly games this month . " our request to the vatican to meet the holy father was made quite late , " admitted beckenbauer .
" for that reason we are delighted and grateful that this meeting is now possible . " it is unlikely that any plea for a word in germany 's favor from the pope will be made public after beckenbauer , ok vice-president wolfgang niersbach , advisor fedor h. radmann and germany 's former coach rudi völler depart from the vatican . but a reversal of the team 's fortunes after the visit may cause some to look to the heavens and offer thanks . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany considers offers of holy guidance the german soccer team are being inundated with offers of divine guidance during the world cup .
the protestant church wants to set up special prayer centers while the evangelists want to install a priest with the squad .

experts believe the government in berlin alone will have to borrow at least 35 billion euros this year to meet its expenditures , not counting the budget shortfalls of local and regional authorities . the chief negotiators for the christian union parties and the social democrats on monday reaffirmed their determination to drastically reduce the overall german deficit , nearing about 4 percent of gross national product this year .
after the talks , which ended late monday , chancellor-designate angela merkel announced the proposed budget cuts for the coming years . " a difficult heritage " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel now has a better idea of germany 's budget gap " it 's a difficult heritage , but we are determined to overcome our financial problems , " she said .
" we have to take drastic measures to come back to a sustainable path that ensures a decent future for next generations .
there is a strong will but this task should n't be underestimated . " the enormous sum of 35 billion amounts to more than 10 percent of the german national budget .
merkel said that there would be no taboos when it comes to cutting expenditure but added that precise savings measures would be hammered out in bipartisan deliberations scheduled to last until mid-november . she also would n't rule out that taxes in germany would have to rise in order to meet the ambitious goal .
in their election campaign merkel 's cdu already announced a 2 percent hike in value added tax here to finance a reduction in german non-wage labor costs and to help consolidate the budget . not pointing the finger analysts now believe that merkel 's plan to reduce business taxes is most likely to be scrapped given the dire state of german public finances .
but on monday , the conservatives held back from laying the blame on outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder and his ruling social democrats . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel , müntefering and schröder now seem to get along merkel said the in spite of the bad news the talks were held in a positive atmosphere - a view shared by spd party leader franz müntefering who is scheduled to become labor minister in merkel 's cabinet . " the challenge is big , but confidence is not unfounded , " müntefering said .
" both sides showed a willingness to tackle the problems and move germany foward again . " national debt keeps growing with german state coffers almost empty , germans are bound to lose some cherished subsidies such as state money for private home builders and tax breaks for commuters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's national debt increases by the second but a future grand coalition government would also have to lay the ax to pensions and benefits for germany 's four million unemployed who make up the largest bulk of state expenditure . the third biggest chunk , with 38 billion euros , is interest on national debt .

experts believe the government in berlin alone will have to borrow at least 35 billion euros this year to meet its expenditures , not counting the budget shortfalls of local and regional authorities . the chief negotiators for the christian union parties and the social democrats on monday reaffirmed their determination to drastically reduce the overall german deficit , nearing about 4 percent of gross national product this year .
after the talks , which ended late monday , chancellor-designate angela merkel announced the proposed budget cuts for the coming years . " a difficult heritage " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel now has a better idea of germany 's budget gap " it 's a difficult heritage , but we are determined to overcome our financial problems , " she said .
" we have to take drastic measures to come back to a sustainable path that ensures a decent future for next generations .
there is a strong will but this task should n't be underestimated . " the enormous sum of 35 billion amounts to more than 10 percent of the german national budget .
merkel said that there would be no taboos when it comes to cutting expenditure but added that precise savings measures would be hammered out in bipartisan deliberations scheduled to last until mid-november . she also would n't rule out that taxes in germany would have to rise in order to meet the ambitious goal .
in their election campaign merkel 's cdu already announced a 2 percent hike in value added tax here to finance a reduction in german non-wage labor costs and to help consolidate the budget . not pointing the finger analysts now believe that merkel 's plan to reduce business taxes is most likely to be scrapped given the dire state of german public finances .
but on monday , the conservatives held back from laying the blame on outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder and his ruling social democrats . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel , müntefering and schröder now seem to get along merkel said the in spite of the bad news the talks were held in a positive atmosphere - a view shared by spd party leader franz müntefering who is scheduled to become labor minister in merkel 's cabinet . " the challenge is big , but confidence is not unfounded , " müntefering said .
" both sides showed a willingness to tackle the problems and move germany foward again . " national debt keeps growing with german state coffers almost empty , germans are bound to lose some cherished subsidies such as state money for private home builders and tax breaks for commuters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's national debt increases by the second but a future grand coalition government would also have to lay the ax to pensions and benefits for germany 's four million unemployed who make up the largest bulk of state expenditure . the third biggest chunk , with 38 billion euros , is interest on national debt .

they accuse the telecoms group of misleading them before two public share placements . the second round of a landmark lawsuit against german telecommunications giant deutsche telekom is set to begin tuesday , nearly one year after a preliminary hearing .
some 15,000 small investors divided into almost 2,200 groups are suing deutsche telekom for some 100 million euros -lrb- $ 119 million -rrb- . the focus of the suit is the shareholders ' claim that deutsch telekom deliberately misled them about the valuation of its property portfolio in stock exchange prospectuses for two public share placements during the height of the internet and dot-com boom in 1999 and 2000 .
at the end of the preliminary round of hearings last november , the small investors already booked a small victory when judge meinrad wösthoff criticized the methods used to value deutsche telekom 's vast real estate portfolio . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : telekom ceo kai-uwe ricke must face the ire of investors , a legacy of his predecessor the judge hit out at the company for valuing a huge portfolio of real estate comprising 35,000 buildings and plots of land en bloc rather than individually as required by german law .
the plaintiffs said the value of the properties was consistently overstated , inflating the book value of deutsche telekom itself , which in turn meant that investors paid a stiff premium for their shares . " people 's share " loses dramatically wösthoff said last year that the so-called " cluster " method of valuing property used by deutsche telekom did not correspond to the rules .
but he cautioned that that did not automatically mean that the valuations themselves were wrong . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : along with the dax , deutsche telekom shares plummeted in 2000-2002 the deutsche telekom court case is legally and logistically without precedent in germany .
the 15,000 small shareholders are suing the company because they feel they paid too much for shares bought when the former state-owned monopoly was privatized in the 1990s . it was only when deutsche telekom was forced to write down the value of its real estate holdings at the beginning of 2001 that shareholders became aware of the problem .
then investors quickly saw their savings go up in smoke as the news sent what germany had once proudly dubbed the " people 's share " into a long and precipitous slide on the stock market .
now , the pensioners and small-time savers who believed their hard-earned savings would be safe in europe 's biggest phone company want their money back . lots to blame in precedent setting case the roughly 15,000 investors have instructed 750 lawyers to file 2,200 separate lawsuits for a total of around 100 million euros in compensation .
no stone is being left unturned by the plaintiffs who are suing everyone involved in the privatization of deutsche telekom - the company itself and its former chief ron sommer , the government , the state-owned privatization vehicle kfw bank , and even the underwriting banks , such as deutsche bank . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investors want to return the bill to sender , deutsche telekom investors also feel cheated that they were not fully informed about the risks connected with deutsche telekom 's planned acquisition of us mobile phone operator voicestream barely a month after the third share offering in july 2000 .
in a takeover that many analysts called much too expensive , deutsche telekom paid more than $ 40 billion for voicestream , and it became another key factor behind the dizzying fall in the price of the german group 's shares . they lost almost 92 percent of their value , plunging from the giddy heights of a record 103.90 euros at the height of the internet boom to an all-time low of 8.59 euros on june 26 , 2002 . judge wösthoff said last november that those complaints were not justified .
the court also said that deutsche telekom 's former chief ron sommer could not be held responsible for the slide in the share price . dw staff / afp -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de judge criticizes telekom in first hearing german telecoms giant deutsche telekom was reprimanded by the judge overseeing the massive lawsuit brought against the company by 15,000 angry shareholders in the first court hearing on tuesday .

they accuse the telecoms group of misleading them before two public share placements . the second round of a landmark lawsuit against german telecommunications giant deutsche telekom is set to begin tuesday , nearly one year after a preliminary hearing .
some 15,000 small investors divided into almost 2,200 groups are suing deutsche telekom for some 100 million euros -lrb- $ 119 million -rrb- . the focus of the suit is the shareholders ' claim that deutsch telekom deliberately misled them about the valuation of its property portfolio in stock exchange prospectuses for two public share placements during the height of the internet and dot-com boom in 1999 and 2000 .
at the end of the preliminary round of hearings last november , the small investors already booked a small victory when judge meinrad wösthoff criticized the methods used to value deutsche telekom 's vast real estate portfolio . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : telekom ceo kai-uwe ricke must face the ire of investors , a legacy of his predecessor the judge hit out at the company for valuing a huge portfolio of real estate comprising 35,000 buildings and plots of land en bloc rather than individually as required by german law .
the plaintiffs said the value of the properties was consistently overstated , inflating the book value of deutsche telekom itself , which in turn meant that investors paid a stiff premium for their shares . " people 's share " loses dramatically wösthoff said last year that the so-called " cluster " method of valuing property used by deutsche telekom did not correspond to the rules .
but he cautioned that that did not automatically mean that the valuations themselves were wrong . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : along with the dax , deutsche telekom shares plummeted in 2000-2002 the deutsche telekom court case is legally and logistically without precedent in germany .

" the german health minister considers this a serious development and says the rise in hiv infections is worrying , " health ministry spokeswoman dagmar reitenbach told reporters .
" unfortunately , it is often the case that hiv / aids is no longer taken seriously as a life-threatening disease . " according to a report from the robert koch institute , the federal government 's disease control center , 1,164 people were infected in the first half of 2005 with the virus .
the institute said the hiv risk for males was roughly 7.5 times greater than for women and that most of the new infections were in males between the ages of 25 and 45 .
german cities such as berlin , hamburg , cologne and frankfurt have the highest risk of new infection , the report said .
gays ' hiv risk climbing about 40 million people worldwide are infected with hiv / aids , and africa is the hardest hit region with 25 million .
in the eu , infections are on the rise .
in germany , the infection rate was stable for years , remaining under 2,000 annually in a population of 82 million .
but in 2004 , the infection rate topped 2,000 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drug advances appear to cause people to be less concerned about hiv / aids woman make up about half of the number of the infected worldwide .
the most significant hiv risk factor for women in germany is sexual contact with males from other high-risk groups : men from countries with a high prevalence of hiv / aids , intravenous drug users and men who have had homosexual contact .
almost 60 percent of the new infections were among homosexual men , and the risk of infection among this group is almost twice as high as it was 12 years ago .
the head of the robert koch institute , reinhard kurth , said the news was worrying and that more attempts needed to be made to communicate to the populace that aids , despite improved therapies , is still an incurable disease .
he added that the new drug cocktails , that have proven effective in treating the symptoms of aids , have led to many taking the consequences of infection less seriously .
" more efforts must be made to explain and inform people that despite an improvement in therapy , there is no cure for this disease , " he said in a statement . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german aids foundation thinks positive when the german aids foundation presented its annual report in bonn on friday , it revealed that even in germany , one common side-effect of hiv infection is poverty .

a german-based artist from new zealand might have found an answer to the problem . as a 17-year-old exchange student from new zealand , joanne moar initially felt pretty lost at the other end of the world .
she 'd come to hamburg with very little german and a very different childhood and youth experience . when her friends got giggly about a party game that involves unwrapping a chocolate bar parcel while wearing gloves and using cutlery , she did n't really know how to react .
she had no idea that " hui bu , the castle ghost " was a popular audio play on tape german kids listened to .
moar had also never heard of harry potter 's german predecessor winnetou , the native american hero of novels by author karl may . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : generations of german boys have looked up to winnetou " i could n't connect to them on that level , " moar said .
" i did n't share these memories . " now 34 years old , moar has since spent more than a decade in germany and speaks the language without a hint of an accent .
a german childhood was still lacking , however , so moar decided to search for one . collecting memories she devised an art project called " becoming german " and set out to collect childhood memories from her adopted countrymen and women .
equipped with a laptop , two chairs and a table , moar made for pedestrian zones and lakeside promenades to invite germans to share their childhood memories with her . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moar -lrb- left -rrb- while gathering memories " people get a chance to tell their story , " moar said , adding that many people have thanked her for the possibility to remember their past . in return , moar lights up people 's eyes when she offers a now rarely sold cherry-flavored lollipop from their formative years . norbert wenning remembers the candy well . " the one with the green stick , right ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 25.10.2005 searching for a german childhood großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german headdress meets global childhood memory people living in a foreign country often feel left out when the natives start reminiscing about their common childhood memories .
a german-based artist from new zealand might have found an answer to the problem . as a 17-year-old exchange student from new zealand , joanne moar initially felt pretty lost at the other end of the world .
she 'd come to hamburg with very little german and a very different childhood and youth experience . when her friends got giggly about a party game that involves unwrapping a chocolate bar parcel while wearing gloves and using cutlery , she did n't really know how to react .
she had no idea that " hui bu , the castle ghost " was a popular audio play on tape german kids listened to .
moar had also never heard of harry potter 's german predecessor winnetou , the native american hero of novels by author karl may . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : generations of german boys have looked up to winnetou " i could n't connect to them on that level , " moar said .
" i did n't share these memories . " now 34 years old , moar has since spent more than a decade in germany and speaks the language without a hint of an accent .
a german childhood was still lacking , however , so moar decided to search for one . collecting memories she devised an art project called " becoming german " and set out to collect childhood memories from her adopted countrymen and women .
equipped with a laptop , two chairs and a table , moar made for pedestrian zones and lakeside promenades to invite germans to share their childhood memories with her . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moar -lrb- left -rrb- while gathering memories " people get a chance to tell their story , " moar said , adding that many people have thanked her for the possibility to remember their past . in return , moar lights up people 's eyes when she offers a now rarely sold cherry-flavored lollipop from their formative years . norbert wenning remembers the candy well . " the one with the green stick , right ? " said the professor of education at the university of münster . opera lovers of the world , unite but while it 's nice to walk down childhood-memory lane with others , wenning said that similar social backgrounds often played a much more important role than the country of origin when it comes to the ability to communicate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visiting london 's covent garden wo n't shock japanese opera lovers " if i 'm used to going to the opera , it does n't really matter which country i 'm in , " wenning said .
" differences within cultures are always bigger than those between cultures . " he added that other factors such as geography also play a role . " if you take a child who grew up in istanbul , a child who grew up in a large city , it 's going to be much easier for the child to move to berlin than for a child from -lrb- rural turkish region -rrb- anatolia to move to istanbul , " he said . a wealth of memories the lack of a shared childhood culture can potentially become a problem for migrant families with a low level of education , said cristina allemann-ghionda , a professor and expert on intercultural education at cologne university . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting along just fine in berlin 's kreuzberg district " but it 's definitely not a tragedy if someone can not share the memory of a certain children 's song or game , " said allemann-ghionda , who spent her formative years in italy , brazil , colombia , peru , belgium , germany and switzerland . " many times i was in the situation where i did n't know what people were talking about , " she said .
" but it always depends on how one deals with the situation .
i feel quite positive about it .
my head is full of memories . " a typical , atypical german childhood full of memories - just like moar 's online database , where 2,700 german childhoods have been entered so far . on her web site , people can now also receive a german childhood by entering some personal information that 's used to create a tailor-made early history for them . bildunterschrift : moar also collected childhood memories from the children of migrants who grew up in germany but instead of finding her own definitive faux german history , moar said she discovered that a typical german childhood does n't exist .

experts believe the government in berlin alone will have to borrow at least 35 billion euros this year to meet its expenditures , not counting the budget shortfalls of local and regional authorities . the chief negotiators for the christian union parties and the social democrats on monday reaffirmed their determination to drastically reduce the overall german deficit , nearing about 4 percent of gross national product this year .

there is a strong will but this task should n't be underestimated . " the enormous sum of 35 billion amounts to more than 10 percent of the german national budget .
merkel said that there would be no taboos when it comes to cutting expenditure but added that precise savings measures would be hammered out in bipartisan deliberations scheduled to last until mid-november . she also would n't rule out that taxes in germany would have to rise in order to meet the ambitious goal .
in their election campaign merkel 's cdu already announced a 2 percent hike in value added tax here to finance a reduction in german non-wage labor costs and to help consolidate the budget . not pointing the finger analysts now believe that merkel 's plan to reduce business taxes is most likely to be scrapped given the dire state of german public finances .

" the challenge is big , but confidence is not unfounded , " müntefering said .
" both sides showed a willingness to tackle the problems and move germany foward again .

fearing bird flu , germans stockpile meds germany -pipe- 25.10.2005 german poultry lockdown restarts cage controversy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most eggs in germany are still laid by caged-up chickens a mandatory measure to coop up poultry to prevent an outbreak of bird flu has taken effect in germany .
most farmers support the move but some worry it might lead to chickens being held in cages for longer than needed . for german geese , fall is traditionally a bad time of year : many of them end up on dining tables in celebration of st. martin 's day on nov .
11 .
but , this year the birds ' short lives are facing further curbs . the threat of an outbreak of bird flu in germany means they now have to spend their last days cooped up instead of waddling outdoors . acting german agricultural minister jürgen trittin has ordered the country 's poultry farmers to cage their animals to prevent possible infection with the virus by migratory birds . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no fans of indoor life " it 's an unusual situation for geese , which usually get to go outside and are now stuck in stables , " said gerald wehde , a spokesman for bioland , germany 's largest association of organic farmers .
" it 's stressful for them . " geese farmers themselves are probably not too relaxed , either .
many do n't have adequate enclosures for their poultry and are scrambling to adhere to trittin 's order , wehde said . no fi n a n cial harm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some farms keep chickens in " conservatories " during the curfew organic chicken farmers on the other hand do n't face the same problem , as most already have fence-like structures in place . they 're also unlikely to suffer financially . while the bird flu scare is n't likely to boost the overall consumption of poultry products in germany , the mandatory lockdown wo n't put an extra burden on them . compared to conventional farmers who already keep their animals in cages , organic and free-range chicken farms are allowed to continue to market their products as if their poultry stock were still running around outside . some oppositio n but not everyone is happy with the mandatory nationwide chicken caging , with some complaining it 's unnecessary harassment that has only scared people . " we think it is complete nonsense , " said reinhard jung , who represents an association of 300 family farms in the eastern state of brandenburg . " people behave as if the plague were about to strike , " he said , adding that he thinks the lockdown can not prevent animals from getting infected . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : free-range no more but most major famers ' associations , including bioland , back the lockdown as a sensible precaution to prevent the spread of bird flu . " it 's simply meant to protect the animals , " said dirk höppner of the umbrella organization for germany 's poultry industry . threate n i n g orga n ic farms ? bioland 's wehde , however , said he worried that the house arrest for chickens could reignite the debate about a german ban on caged chickens that 's meant to take effect in 2007 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conventional farmers agree that chicken cages should be phased out the bird flu scare " could discredit alternative forms of farming , " wehde said , referring to organic farming .
conventional farmers , who want to replace tiny cages with larger ones for several animals , could argue that keeping animals outside would pose too many risks . jung expressed similar concerns . " there 's a danger that appropriate farming methods that are slowly gaining ground will be pushed to the side again , " he said . far from it , said gert stuke , whose german breakfast egg company has about 4.8 million chickens producing eggs in conventional , organic and free-range farms . " we 're not going to play off farming methods against each other , " stuke said , adding that his firm backed so-called " mini aviaries " that can hold 60 animals .
about 90 percent of germany 's 40 million chickens in egg production are still kept in cages . caged u n til 2013 ? " we do n't want to keep the old cages , we 're responsible egg producers , and the mini aviaries are the best farming method , " stuke said , adding that german breakfast egg will still offer organic and free-range eggs as long as people want to buy them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are aviaries the solution ?
so far , the mini aviaries have not been approved as an alternative farming method .
stuke has only been able to try them out on a test farm .
but along with other conventional egg producers , he hopes the incoming government of christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and social democrats will change that in the near future . that could well turn out to be the case . " we want to allow for a transition period to give chicken farmers the opportunity to switch to aviaries , " said peter bleser , the cdu 's agriculture spokesman , adding there was no connection between the bird flu and the debate about chicken cages . theoretically cages could stay until 2012 , when an eu-wide ban takes effect . mathis winkler , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu considers wild bird import ban the european commission is facing increasing pressure to ban all wild bird imports after new cases of bird flu appeared in russia , croatia and british quarantine .

"
he said it " gives romania the chance to join the eu on january 1 , 2007 . " " the report should not lead us to rejoicing or sadness .
we must remain vigilant , ready to meet what is required for joining in 2007 , " basescu said . he said romania would " feel the benefits of joining the eu only when it is a full member " and that " up until this moment romanians must pay the price of joining . " basescu called on legal officials and police to fight corruption , as the eu demands .
he said they should have " zero tolerance " for corruption . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ivaylo kalfin assured the eu that bulgaria would do what was needed .
in sofia , bulgarian foreign minister ivaylo kalfin said : " both countries fully understand our responsibility in the months left ahead of our accession into the eu .
we accept the report as a partner 's assessment and will fully focus on implementing what has been negotiated , " kalfin said . progress needed to ensure accession the two former communist states are on track to join the eu as planned in 2007 , the eu 's executive announced on tuesday , but warned the eastern european states to make further progress on reforms . the two balkan states are doing too little to fight corruption , the european commission said , in annual progress reports on their eu membership suitability , amid speculation that their entry could be delayed by a year . the reports stated that there were " serious concerns " in areas accounting for around ten percent of eu legislation , where " unless immediate action is taken the countries will not be ready for accession " .
brussels is also concerned about administrative capacity , where the commission said " overall reform of administrative structures " needs to be stepped up in order for both romania and bulgaria to be able to absorb eu funds .
other areas which needed to be addressed were the shortcomings in the veterinary field , which may " put at risk food safety " in the eu , and the level of corruption in the two countries " particularly at a high level " .
commission threatens year-long delays bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olli rehn said the eu would not hesitate to implement delays .
before the talks , european enlargement commissioner olli rehn said the commission would not hesitate to delay the scheduled accession if reform efforts in the key areas fail .
romania and bulgaria signed their accession treaties on april 25 this year , but these treaties contain a unique clause which gives the european commission the option to delay the 2007 entry date until 2008 if entry preparations are insufficient .
rehn added that brussels would " not hesitate " to make use of the option in its recommendation on the entry date to eu member states .
" we may recommend , if needed , to postpone accession by one year " , he said .
" the possibility of being ready in 2007 is not lost , but making it will require a lot of work . ” the commission is due to meet to discuss the two countries ’ entry date in may or april next year .
bulgaria slips from lead in race with neighbor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traian basescu 's romania has " caught up impressively . "
these warnings , known in accession speak as " yellow cards " , come as a particular blow to bulgaria .
it has been widely accepted that the bulgarians have always been ahead of their neighbor romania in their eu preparation , but a close general election result in june plunged the country in a reform deadlock .
the commission said that bulgaria was " working energetically " after it had " lost the momentum somewhat " , but it was romania who had " caught up impressively " , particularly in the areas of competition policy , justice , state aid and overall alignment with eu law . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de romania , bulgaria sign eu entry pact romania and bulgaria signed an accession treaty with the european union monday , paving the way to join the bloc in january 2007 in what they hailed as an " historic " step for their ex-communist nations .
-lrb- april 25 , 2005 -rrb- bulgaria 's list of unanswered questions the european parliament gave the green light to eu accession for bulgaria come january 2007 , but there are still some hurdles to clear .

" the german health minister considers this a serious development and says the rise in hiv infections is worrying , " health ministry spokeswoman dagmar reitenbach told reporters .
" unfortunately , it is often the case that hiv / aids is no longer taken seriously as a life-threatening disease . " according to a report from the robert koch institute , the federal government 's disease control center , 1,164 people were infected in the first half of 2005 with the virus .
the institute said the hiv risk for males was roughly 7.5 times greater than for women and that most of the new infections were in males between the ages of 25 and 45 .
german cities such as berlin , hamburg , cologne and frankfurt have the highest risk of new infection , the report said .
gays ' hiv risk climbing about 40 million people worldwide are infected with hiv / aids , and africa is the hardest hit region with 25 million .
in the eu , infections are on the rise .
in germany , the infection rate was stable for years , remaining under 2,000 annually in a population of 82 million .
but in 2004 , the infection rate topped 2,000 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drug advances appear to cause people to be less concerned about hiv / aids woman make up about half of the number of the infected worldwide .
the most significant hiv risk factor for women in germany is sexual contact with males from other high-risk groups : men from countries with a high prevalence of hiv / aids , intravenous drug users and men who have had homosexual contact .
almost 60 percent of the new infections were among homosexual men , and the risk of infection among this group is almost twice as high as it was 12 years ago .
the head of the robert koch institute , reinhard kurth , said the news was worrying and that more attempts needed to be made to communicate to the populace that aids , despite improved therapies , is still an incurable disease .
he added that the new drug cocktails , that have proven effective in treating the symptoms of aids , have led to many taking the consequences of infection less seriously .
" more efforts must be made to explain and inform people that despite an improvement in therapy , there is no cure for this disease , " he said in a statement . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german aids foundation thinks positive when the german aids foundation presented its annual report in bonn on friday , it revealed that even in germany , one common side-effect of hiv infection is poverty .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 25.10.2005 coalition vows to crack down on welfare abuse großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the coalition could be calling .
make sure you are where you say you are in their coalition talks , the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have agreed to get tough on abuse of germany 's reformed unemployment regulations , known as hartz iv . the cost of germany 's labor market reform is almost double the amount originally planned - 26 billion instead of the estimated 14 billion euros .
spd head franz müntefering said the hike could partly be attributed to the fact that local authorities transferred more of the old system 's welfare recipients into the new hartz iv unemployment benefit scheme than expected .
but politicians are also lashing out at benefit cheats , announcing plans to step up controls on fraudulent claims .
the discussion has taken on a virulent tone , with a report posted on the economics and labor ministry 's web site indirectly comparing welfare recipients to parasites .
the report contains a detailed list of real life examples of benefit cheats , referring to them as " freeloaders " and " spongers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement 's ministry indirectly compared people on benefit to parasites peter clever , the deputy head of the board of directors for the federal labor office told broadcaster deutschlandfunk that , in random telephone checks since july on 390,000 hartz iv recipients , 170,000 could not be reached , despite 10 phone calls being made at different times of the day and different days of the week .
" you 'd have to be really naïve to believe that all 170,000 people happened to be in job interviews at the time , " clever said . the economics and labor ministry said it intends to step up telephone checks as well as other forms of control in the future .
a spokeswoman from the ministry said that welfare recipients have a duty to cooperate with their local authorities and must be available for consultation . housing benefit open to fraud bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : state subsidized housing has been identified as a major area open to abuse experts say that subsidized housing under hartz iv is one of the biggest sources of welfare abuse .

spd head franz müntefering said the hike could partly be attributed to the fact that local authorities transferred more of the old system 's welfare recipients into the new hartz iv unemployment benefit scheme than expected .
but politicians are also lashing out at benefit cheats , announcing plans to step up controls on fraudulent claims .
the discussion has taken on a virulent tone , with a report posted on the economics and labor ministry 's web site indirectly comparing welfare recipients to parasites .

they accuse the telecoms group of misleading them before two public share placements . the second round of a landmark lawsuit against german telecommunications giant deutsche telekom is set to begin tuesday , nearly one year after a preliminary hearing .
some 15,000 small investors divided into almost 2,200 groups are suing deutsche telekom for some 100 million euros -lrb- $ 119 million -rrb- . the focus of the suit is the shareholders ' claim that deutsch telekom deliberately misled them about the valuation of its property portfolio in stock exchange prospectuses for two public share placements during the height of the internet and dot-com boom in 1999 and 2000 .
at the end of the preliminary round of hearings last november , the small investors already booked a small victory when judge meinrad wösthoff criticized the methods used to value deutsche telekom 's vast real estate portfolio . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : telekom ceo kai-uwe ricke must face the ire of investors , a legacy of his predecessor the judge hit out at the company for valuing a huge portfolio of real estate comprising 35,000 buildings and plots of land en bloc rather than individually as required by german law .
the plaintiffs said the value of the properties was consistently overstated , inflating the book value of deutsche telekom itself , which in turn meant that investors paid a stiff premium for their shares . " people 's share " loses dramatically wösthoff said last year that the so-called " cluster " method of valuing property used by deutsche telekom did not correspond to the rules .
but he cautioned that that did not automatically mean that the valuations themselves were wrong . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : along with the dax , deutsche telekom shares plummeted in 2000-2002 the deutsche telekom court case is legally and logistically without precedent in germany .
the 15,000 small shareholders are suing the company because they feel they paid too much for shares bought when the former state-owned monopoly was privatized in the 1990s . it was only when deutsche telekom was forced to write down the value of its real estate holdings at the beginning of 2001 that shareholders became aware of the problem .
then investors quickly saw their savings go up in smoke as the news sent what germany had once proudly dubbed the " people 's share " into a long and precipitous slide on the stock market .
now , the pensioners and small-time savers who believed their hard-earned savings would be safe in europe 's biggest phone company want their money back . lots to blame in precedent setting case the roughly 15,000 investors have instructed 750 lawyers to file 2,200 separate lawsuits for a total of around 100 million euros in compensation .
no stone is being left unturned by the plaintiffs who are suing everyone involved in the privatization of deutsche telekom - the company itself and its former chief ron sommer , the government , the state-owned privatization vehicle kfw bank , and even the underwriting banks , such as deutsche bank . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investors want to return the bill to sender , deutsche telekom investors also feel cheated that they were not fully informed about the risks connected with deutsche telekom 's planned acquisition of us mobile phone operator voicestream barely a month after the third share offering in july 2000 .
in a takeover that many analysts called much too expensive , deutsche telekom paid more than $ 40 billion for voicestream , and it became another key factor behind the dizzying fall in the price of the german group 's shares . they lost almost 92 percent of their value , plunging from the giddy heights of a record 103.90 euros at the height of the internet boom to an all-time low of 8.59 euros on june 26 , 2002 . judge wösthoff said last november that those complaints were not justified .
the court also said that deutsche telekom 's former chief ron sommer could not be held responsible for the slide in the share price . dw staff / afp -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de judge criticizes telekom in first hearing german telecoms giant deutsche telekom was reprimanded by the judge overseeing the massive lawsuit brought against the company by 15,000 angry shareholders in the first court hearing on tuesday .

" the german health minister considers this a serious development and says the rise in hiv infections is worrying , " health ministry spokeswoman dagmar reitenbach told reporters .
" unfortunately , it is often the case that hiv / aids is no longer taken seriously as a life-threatening disease . " according to a report from the robert koch institute , the federal government 's disease control center , 1,164 people were infected in the first half of 2005 with the virus .
the institute said the hiv risk for males was roughly 7.5 times greater than for women and that most of the new infections were in males between the ages of 25 and 45 .
german cities such as berlin , hamburg , cologne and frankfurt have the highest risk of new infection , the report said .
gays ' hiv risk climbing about 40 million people worldwide are infected with hiv / aids , and africa is the hardest hit region with 25 million .
in the eu , infections are on the rise .
in germany , the infection rate was stable for years , remaining under 2,000 annually in a population of 82 million .
but in 2004 , the infection rate topped 2,000 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drug advances appear to cause people to be less concerned about hiv / aids woman make up about half of the number of the infected worldwide .
the most significant hiv risk factor for women in germany is sexual contact with males from other high-risk groups : men from countries with a high prevalence of hiv / aids , intravenous drug users and men who have had homosexual contact .
almost 60 percent of the new infections were among homosexual men , and the risk of infection among this group is almost twice as high as it was 12 years ago .
the head of the robert koch institute , reinhard kurth , said the news was worrying and that more attempts needed to be made to communicate to the populace that aids , despite improved therapies , is still an incurable disease .
he added that the new drug cocktails , that have proven effective in treating the symptoms of aids , have led to many taking the consequences of infection less seriously .
" more efforts must be made to explain and inform people that despite an improvement in therapy , there is no cure for this disease , " he said in a statement . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german aids foundation thinks positive when the german aids foundation presented its annual report in bonn on friday , it revealed that even in germany , one common side-effect of hiv infection is poverty .

make sure you are where you say you are in their coalition talks , the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have agreed to get tough on abuse of germany 's reformed unemployment regulations , known as hartz iv . the cost of germany 's labor market reform is almost double the amount originally planned - 26 billion instead of the estimated 14 billion euros .
spd head franz müntefering said the hike could partly be attributed to the fact that local authorities transferred more of the old system 's welfare recipients into the new hartz iv unemployment benefit scheme than expected .
but politicians are also lashing out at benefit cheats , announcing plans to step up controls on fraudulent claims .
the discussion has taken on a virulent tone , with a report posted on the economics and labor ministry 's web site indirectly comparing welfare recipients to parasites .
the report contains a detailed list of real life examples of benefit cheats , referring to them as " freeloaders " and " spongers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement 's ministry indirectly compared people on benefit to parasites peter clever , the deputy head of the board of directors for the federal labor office told broadcaster deutschlandfunk that , in random telephone checks since july on 390,000 hartz iv recipients , 170,000 could not be reached , despite 10 phone calls being made at different times of the day and different days of the week .
" you 'd have to be really naïve to believe that all 170,000 people happened to be in job interviews at the time , " clever said . the economics and labor ministry said it intends to step up telephone checks as well as other forms of control in the future .
a spokeswoman from the ministry said that welfare recipients have a duty to cooperate with their local authorities and must be available for consultation . housing benefit open to fraud bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : state subsidized housing has been identified as a major area open to abuse experts say that subsidized housing under hartz iv is one of the biggest sources of welfare abuse .
a long-term unemployed person on welfare support can have an " appropriate " apartment -lrb- for example , up to 50 square meters of living space for a single person or 70 square meters for two people -rrb- including heat and electricity , completely paid for by the state . the problem is that many welfare recipients are moving into these " appropriate " apartments on paper only .
for that reason , housing benefit should only be paid to young adults living alone if their parents ' income is insufficient , the director of the german association of local authorities , gerd landsberg , told the osnabrücker zeitung .
young people who qualify as long-term unemployed should be required to prove that they need their own apartment in order to take up job training or other qualification measures , landsberg said . politicians are now calling for further reforms to hartz iv in order to cut back on the number of households claiming state-subsidized housing . interest groups , charities outraged an internet forum for the unemployed -lrb- erwerbslosen forum deutschland -rrb- has reacted angrily to the accusations made by the labor ministry , claiming it is looking for a scapegoat to draw attention away from its past failure to clamp down on welfare fraud . germany 's main social and charitable organizations also protested against accusations of welfare abuse , saying the cost of labor market reform was set at an unreasonably low level to begin with . " it 's an attempt to lay the blame for persistent labor market misery at the door of those affected by it , " said georg cremer , general secretary of the german caritas association . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de looking abroad for reform models while what worked in other countries is n't a guarantee for success , many believe looking beyond germany 's borders could provide the inspiration needed to reform europe 's largest economy .

"
he said it " gives romania the chance to join the eu on january 1 , 2007 . " " the report should not lead us to rejoicing or sadness .
we must remain vigilant , ready to meet what is required for joining in 2007 , " basescu said . he said romania would " feel the benefits of joining the eu only when it is a full member " and that " up until this moment romanians must pay the price of joining . " basescu called on legal officials and police to fight corruption , as the eu demands .
he said they should have " zero tolerance " for corruption . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ivaylo kalfin assured the eu that bulgaria would do what was needed .
in sofia , bulgarian foreign minister ivaylo kalfin said : " both countries fully understand our responsibility in the months left ahead of our accession into the eu .
we accept the report as a partner 's assessment and will fully focus on implementing what has been negotiated , " kalfin said . progress needed to ensure accession the two former communist states are on track to join the eu as planned in 2007 , the eu 's executive announced on tuesday , but warned the eastern european states to make further progress on reforms . the two balkan states are doing too little to fight corruption , the european commission said , in annual progress reports on their eu membership suitability , amid speculation that their entry could be delayed by a year . the reports stated that there were " serious concerns " in areas accounting for around ten percent of eu legislation , where " unless immediate action is taken the countries will not be ready for accession " .
brussels is also concerned about administrative capacity , where the commission said " overall reform of administrative structures " needs to be stepped up in order for both romania and bulgaria to be able to absorb eu funds .
other areas which needed to be addressed were the shortcomings in the veterinary field , which may " put at risk food safety " in the eu , and the level of corruption in the two countries " particularly at a high level " .
commission threatens year-long delays bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olli rehn said the eu would not hesitate to implement delays .
before the talks , european enlargement commissioner olli rehn said the commission would not hesitate to delay the scheduled accession if reform efforts in the key areas fail .
romania and bulgaria signed their accession treaties on april 25 this year , but these treaties contain a unique clause which gives the european commission the option to delay the 2007 entry date until 2008 if entry preparations are insufficient .
rehn added that brussels would " not hesitate " to make use of the option in its recommendation on the entry date to eu member states .
" we may recommend , if needed , to postpone accession by one year " , he said .
" the possibility of being ready in 2007 is not lost , but making it will require a lot of work . ” the commission is due to meet to discuss the two countries ’ entry date in may or april next year .
bulgaria slips from lead in race with neighbor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traian basescu 's romania has " caught up impressively . "
these warnings , known in accession speak as " yellow cards " , come as a particular blow to bulgaria .
it has been widely accepted that the bulgarians have always been ahead of their neighbor romania in their eu preparation , but a close general election result in june plunged the country in a reform deadlock .
the commission said that bulgaria was " working energetically " after it had " lost the momentum somewhat " , but it was romania who had " caught up impressively " , particularly in the areas of competition policy , justice , state aid and overall alignment with eu law . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de romania , bulgaria sign eu entry pact romania and bulgaria signed an accession treaty with the european union monday , paving the way to join the bloc in january 2007 in what they hailed as an " historic " step for their ex-communist nations .

he told the bbc that contracts giving control of major national enterprises to people close to the president should be re-examined .
if these contracts are found to have involved corrupt practices , he said , the enterprises should be re-privatised according to the law .
mr tuyakbai is one of 11 candidates for kazakhstan 's presidential elections , scheduled for 4 december .
he represents a movement named for a just kazakhstan , an alliance of the country 's main opposition parties .
it is unclear just how much popular backing the alliance has , but the country 's weak opposition groups have always struggled for support among a post-soviet population which is still largely apolitical .
anti-corruption mr tuyakbai will be running against the current president , nursultan nazarbayev , who has led kazakhstan since before its independence from the collapsing soviet union .
most of the other candidates are relatively unknown figures .
mr tuyakbai 's call for a re-examination of privatisation deals echoes moves by opposition groups who have come to power in ukraine and kyrgyzstan , following the overthrow of incumbent presidents in those two post-soviet republics .
" the money from the sale of natural resources today , or stolen by officials close to the president 's family - that money does n't go into the national budget , " said mr tuyakbai .
" what 's more , contracts for resource industries were often the result of corrupt deals , and these deals have damaged our national interests . "
" those contracts should be re-examined to determine how legal they were , " he added .
accusations of corrupt business dealings by members of president nazarbayev 's family and inner circle are among the most politically damaging charges against the head of state .
kazakhstan is rich in oil , minerals , land and other natural resources .
but analysts say that many of the most profitable enterprises have fallen into the hands of a small number of people in the ruling elite .
mr tuyakbai also contends that kazakhstan 's political system must be changed to reduce what he says is an excessive concentration of power in the hands of the president .
" we need a change of political system , " he said , " a change from an all-powerful president to a parliamentary-presidential system , where parliament will have the role it deserves , and where parliament will form the government and control the government 's activity by overseeing the law and the budget . "
looking west the presidents of all the post-soviet republics of central asia increased their own powers considerably through the 1990s , reducing their parliaments to little more than rubber stamps . "
we should look to greater integration with europe .
that 's the most appropriate for kazakhstan " zharmakhan tuyakbai in neighbouring kyrgyzstan , opposition leaders who came to power there in march have also said they want to give greater powers to the kyrgyz parliament .
the new kyrgyz government however , has yet to put forward a definite plan for constitutional change .
as moscow , washington and increasingly beijing vie for influence in central asia , another lively political debate is which way kazakhstan should look for its future development .
historically russia has been the dominant power in the region , but the opposition candidate says moscow can not provide a stable lead when its own political direction is now so unclear .
china and the muslim countries of the middle east are culturally too different from kazakhstan , so mr tuyakbai thinks his country should look to the west .
and since the united states has its own geopolitical interests , europe provides the best example for a way forward .
" europe has never declared its interests and tried to exert pressure or influence in this region , " he said .
" but it brings to this country the ideas and principles that we 're seeking - equality , freedom , democracy and the example of the dignity of its own people .
" we should look to greater integration with europe .
that 's the most appropriate for kazakhstan . "
formidable opponent during the election campaign , which officially gets underway on tuesday , mr tuyakbai will have a difficult battle on his hands .
among the president 's challengers , mr tuyakbai certainly has the strongest credentials .
until last year he was speaker of the kazakh parliament and deputy chairman of the president 's own party , otan -lrb- fatherland -rrb- .
but following parliamentary elections a year ago , mr tuyakbai surprised the country by publishing an open letter in an opposition newspaper in which he said they had been rigged .
in the letter he alleged that media bias and pressure from local government officials had unfairly ensured otan 's sweeping victory , and he challenged president nazarbayev to overturn the official results .
mr tuyakbai resigned from as speaker and also quit otan , before resurfacing as a contender for the president 's job himself .
he says the campaign system is skewed against the opposition since most local election committees back the president .
but apart from that , mr tuyakbai 's real challenge is that he is standing against a president who , after 14 years in power , is still broadly popular .
mr nazarbayev has a solid record of leading kazakhstan from a very uncertain independence to a position where its economy is growing strongly and where life , for most people , is getting better .
he will not be easily beaten .

mr tuyakbai is one of 11 candidates for kazakhstan 's presidential elections , scheduled for 4 december .
he represents a movement named for a just kazakhstan , an alliance of the country 's main opposition parties .
it is unclear just how much popular backing the alliance has , but the country 's weak opposition groups have always struggled for support among a post-soviet population which is still largely apolitical .
anti-corruption mr tuyakbai will be running against the current president , nursultan nazarbayev , who has led kazakhstan since before its independence from the collapsing soviet union .
most of the other candidates are relatively unknown figures .
mr tuyakbai 's call for a re-examination of privatisation deals echoes moves by opposition groups who have come to power in ukraine and kyrgyzstan , following the overthrow of incumbent presidents in those two post-soviet republics .
" the money from the sale of natural resources today , or stolen by officials close to the president 's family - that money does n't go into the national budget , " said mr tuyakbai .
kazakhstan is rich in oil , but only an elite few are said to benefit " what 's more , contracts for resource industries were often the result of corrupt deals , and these deals have damaged our national interests . "
" those contracts should be re-examined to determine how legal they were , " he added .
accusations of corrupt business dealings by members of president nazarbayev 's family and inner circle are among the most politically damaging charges against the head of state .
kazakhstan is rich in oil , minerals , land and other natural resources .
but analysts say that many of the most profitable enterprises have fallen into the hands of a small number of people in the ruling elite .
mr tuyakbai also contends that kazakhstan 's political system must be changed to reduce what he says is an excessive concentration of power in the hands of the president .
" we need a change of political system , " he said , " a change from an all-powerful president to a parliamentary-presidential system , where parliament will have the role it deserves , and where parliament will form the government and control the government 's activity by overseeing the law and the budget . "
looking west the presidents of all the post-soviet republics of central asia increased their own powers considerably through the 1990s , reducing their parliaments to little more than rubber stamps .
we should look to greater integration with europe .
that 's the most appropriate for kazakhstan zharmakhan tuyakbai in neighbouring kyrgyzstan , opposition leaders who came to power there in march have also said they want to give greater powers to the kyrgyz parliament .
the new kyrgyz government however , has yet to put forward a definite plan for constitutional change .
as moscow , washington and increasingly beijing vie for influence in central asia , another lively political debate is which way kazakhstan should look for its future development .
historically russia has been the dominant power in the region , but the opposition candidate says moscow can not provide a stable lead when its own political direction is now so unclear .
china and the muslim countries of the middle east are culturally too different from kazakhstan , so mr tuyakbai thinks his country should look to the west .
and since the united states has its own geopolitical interests , europe provides the best example for a way forward .
" europe has never declared its interests and tried to exert pressure or influence in this region , " he said .
" but it brings to this country the ideas and principles that we 're seeking - equality , freedom , democracy and the example of the dignity of its own people .
" we should look to greater integration with europe .
that 's the most appropriate for kazakhstan . "
formidable opponent during the election campaign , which officially gets underway on tuesday , mr tuyakbai will have a difficult battle on his hands .
among the president 's challengers , mr tuyakbai certainly has the strongest credentials .
until last year he was speaker of the kazakh parliament and deputy chairman of the president 's own party , otan -lrb- fatherland -rrb- .
but following parliamentary elections a year ago , mr tuyakbai surprised the country by publishing an open letter in an opposition newspaper in which he said they had been rigged .
president nazarbayev has been in power for 14 years in the letter he alleged that media bias and pressure from local government officials had unfairly ensured otan 's sweeping victory , and he challenged president nazarbayev to overturn the official results .
mr tuyakbai resigned from as speaker and also quit otan , before resurfacing as a contender for the president 's job himself .
he says the campaign system is skewed against the opposition since most local election committees back the president .
but apart from that , mr tuyakbai 's real challenge is that he is standing against a president who , after 14 years in power , is still broadly popular .
mr nazarbayev has a solid record of leading kazakhstan from a very uncertain independence to a position where its economy is growing strongly and where life , for most people , is getting better .
he will not be easily beaten .

mr tuyakbai 's call for a re-examination of privatisation deals echoes moves by opposition groups who have come to power in ukraine and kyrgyzstan , following the overthrow of incumbent presidents in those two post-soviet republics .
" the money from the sale of natural resources today , or stolen by officials close to the president 's family - that money does n't go into the national budget , " said mr tuyakbai .
kazakhstan is rich in oil , but only an elite few are said to benefit " what 's more , contracts for resource industries were often the result of corrupt deals , and these deals have damaged our national interests . "
" those contracts should be re-examined to determine how legal they were , " he added .
accusations of corrupt business dealings by members of president nazarbayev 's family and inner circle are among the most politically damaging charges against the head of state .
kazakhstan is rich in oil , minerals , land and other natural resources .
but analysts say that many of the most profitable enterprises have fallen into the hands of a small number of people in the ruling elite .
mr tuyakbai also contends that kazakhstan 's political system must be changed to reduce what he says is an excessive concentration of power in the hands of the president .
" we need a change of political system , " he said , " a change from an all-powerful president to a parliamentary-presidential system , where parliament will have the role it deserves , and where parliament will form the government and control the government 's activity by overseeing the law and the budget . "
looking west the presidents of all the post-soviet republics of central asia increased their own powers considerably through the 1990s , reducing their parliaments to little more than rubber stamps .
we should look to greater integration with europe .
that 's the most appropriate for kazakhstan zharmakhan tuyakbai in neighbouring kyrgyzstan , opposition leaders who came to power there in march have also said they want to give greater powers to the kyrgyz parliament .
the new kyrgyz government however , has yet to put forward a definite plan for constitutional change .
as moscow , washington and increasingly beijing vie for influence in central asia , another lively political debate is which way kazakhstan should look for its future development .
historically russia has been the dominant power in the region , but the opposition candidate says moscow can not provide a stable lead when its own political direction is now so unclear .
china and the muslim countries of the middle east are culturally too different from kazakhstan , so mr tuyakbai thinks his country should look to the west .
and since the united states has its own geopolitical interests , europe provides the best example for a way forward .
" europe has never declared its interests and tried to exert pressure or influence in this region , " he said .
" but it brings to this country the ideas and principles that we 're seeking - equality , freedom , democracy and the example of the dignity of its own people .
" we should look to greater integration with europe .
that 's the most appropriate for kazakhstan . "
formidable opponent during the election campaign , which officially gets underway on tuesday , mr tuyakbai will have a difficult battle on his hands .
among the president 's challengers , mr tuyakbai certainly has the strongest credentials .
until last year he was speaker of the kazakh parliament and deputy chairman of the president 's own party , otan -lrb- fatherland -rrb- .
but following parliamentary elections a year ago , mr tuyakbai surprised the country by publishing an open letter in an opposition newspaper in which he said they had been rigged .
president nazarbayev has been in power for 14 years in the letter he alleged that media bias and pressure from local government officials had unfairly ensured otan 's sweeping victory , and he challenged president nazarbayev to overturn the official results .
mr tuyakbai resigned from as speaker and also quit otan , before resurfacing as a contender for the president 's job himself .
he says the campaign system is skewed against the opposition since most local election committees back the president .
but apart from that , mr tuyakbai 's real challenge is that he is standing against a president who , after 14 years in power , is still broadly popular .
mr nazarbayev has a solid record of leading kazakhstan from a very uncertain independence to a position where its economy is growing strongly and where life , for most people , is getting better .
he will not be easily beaten .

screwed to a fence which they placed behind it , mr randall said the sign had had a positive reaction .
the friends ' film of its construction won an award at the festival .
" the people we spoke to at the film festival thought it was a good idea , " he said .
" like the hill hollywood is on , we thought everyone in the town would be able to see the machynlleth sign .

" start healthy , stay healthy , " focuses on nutrition from pregnancy through to childhood , looking at breastfeeding , weaning and food safety issues .
organised by the health promotion agency -lrb- hpa -rrb- , it is the first of its kind to be held in northern ireland .
dr brian gaffney of the hpa said good maternal and child nutrition was vital to improving the health of families .
" making good choices , such as eating well during pregnancy , choosing to breastfeed and weaning from six months of age , all help to provide a good foundation for developing good eating habits in early childhood , " he said .
" this conference is unique in that it deals with nutrition from pregnancy right through to childhood and looks at ways to help parents give their children the best nutritional start in life and to encourage them to start healthy and stay healthy . "
the conference will look at food habits the conference will be attended by over 200 health professionals , school teachers and academics .
dr andrew hill , a chartered psychologist at leeds university school of medicine and former chairman of the uk association for the study of obesity , will address the conference .
he said : " parents ' own motivations and concerns about food are vital to understanding children 's eating behaviour .
" a present or past eating disorder , for example , can spill over into ways that mothers interact with young children at meal times .
" likewise , maternal shape and weight concerns have been associated with overly restrictive child-feeding practices , particularly with girls .
" recognising that both parental and child weight issues can impact on parent-child interactions in relation to food and eating is necessary in the context of increasing obesity levels and ongoing efforts to tackle this . "
he said the conference would result in parents getting help and advice .

council bosses are now considering using public cash to maintain vital services in kendal used by the elderly , school children and less well-off .
stagecoach says it faces axing several routes in the town after losing almost a third of its passengers .
cumbria county council is considering spending £ 44,000 to maintain some threatened services until march 2006 .
a county council spokesman agreed that stagecoach had experienced losses on several routes .
' increased congestion ' he said : " these losses have increased particularly since 2002 and coincided with a reduction in patronage .
" other economic factors in kendal will have contributed to this fall , and recent fuel cost rises have further adversely affected stagecoach 's financial position .
" bus services are disproportionately used by the elderly , young and less well-off , and the withdrawal of these services will disproportionately , adversely affect those sectors of the population .
" there are almost 400,000 passengers carried by them in a year , and the consequences of the services ceasing would be significant in terms of increased congestion , and the accessibility of town centre facilities for those who rely on the services . "
earlier this year , cumbria county council subsidised a fares cut experiment in kendal in an effort to tempt people back onto public transport .

unicef 's executive director ann veneman said children were the " invisible face " of a very visible disease and were missing out on the help that adults received .

despite experiencing hallucinations as part of their condition , schizophrenic volunteers to a study were better able to spot " real " visions than others .
the current biology work could help shed light on the brain mechanisms involved in schizophrenia , the university college london authors say .
it might be down to a difficulty dealing with context , they believe .
their vision can be more accurate than non-sufferers researcher dr steven dakin for example , people with schizophrenia tend to take less account of the circumstances and conditions that surround a situation or event that often help us to interpret it .
this could explain why some people with schizophrenia might mis-attribute people 's actions or feel persecuted .
it could also explain why they perform better on visual illusion tests , says dr steven dakin , of ucl 's institute of ophthalmology .
" we often think of people with schizophrenia as not seeing the world the way it really is .
but we have shown that sometimes their vision can be more accurate than non-sufferers . "
the visual illusion used in the study the people with schizophrenia were better at spotting that the true match for the central target disc was the peripheral disc at 6 o 'clock , while others often mistook the peripheral disc at 10 o 'clock as the best match his team used an illusion where a failure to use context worked to the advantage of people with schizophrenia .
he said this was critical because people can perform poorly for lots of reasons , but superior performance tends to be for a specific reason and is more revealing of the underlying cause .
the participants were asked to select which of one of eight peripheral patterned discs was the best match for a central patterned disc that was located within the middle of a larger " distracting " patterned circle .
the illusion works because normal visual perception leads the individual to believe that the central disc is of lower contrast than it actually is because it is set against a higher-contrast background - the distracting circle .
better performance of the 15 volunteers with chronic schizophrenia , 12 were found to make more accurate judgements than the most accurate person in the control group of 33 non-schizophrenic volunteers .
dr dakin said : " our findings may shed some light on the brain mechanisms involved in schizophrenia .
" normally , contextual processes in the brain help us to focus on what 's relevant and stop our brains being overwhelmed with information .
" this process seems to be less effective in the schizophrenic brain , possibly due to insufficient inhibition - that is , the process by which cells in the brain switch each other off . "
paul corry , of the charity rethink , said : " we welcome any new research or progress into understanding the causes of schizophrenia , but it would need to be checked before it would make a difference to the thousands of people living with severe mental illness in the uk .
" in the meantime , reaching people early with the right care and treatment is the best way of recovering a meaningful and fulfilling life . "

in broadway , tickets to monty python musical spamalot recently rose to a record $ 111.25 -lrb- £ 63.60 -rrb- , suggesting that prices on both sides of the atlantic continue to creep upwards .
producers cite escalating production costs , but spamalot has paid back its initial investment after six and a half months on broadway , and guys and dolls , starring ewan mcgregor , recouped £ 3m investment costs in just 17 weeks .
some industry observers believe pricing london 's top shows has become an exercise in exclusivity . "
the bottom line about a theatre is the expense , or lack of expense , of its tickets " samuel west , artistic director of sheffield theatres " the bottom line about a theatre is the expense , or lack of expense , of its tickets , " says samuel west , new artistic director of the sheffield theatres .
" the west end does n't allow you to try because tickets are £ 55 .
then you have to take a taxi and pay the baby-sitter , and there is no change out of £ 200 .
" if we charge £ 10 , or on our public dress rehearsals , £ 1 - you might not like it , but at least you can afford to come back next week . "
nonetheless , theatre attendance is on the increase .
in august , the society of london theatre reported that shows in the west end now play to an average of 250,000 people every week - a rise of 7 % on last year 's record figures .
kevin spacey , promoting his second season as artistic director at the old vic , said he believed the old vic is attracting " younger and more diverse " theatregoers .
but both the commercial sector and the subsidised sector rely increasingly on ticket incentives and half price ticket booths to boost audience numbers .
indeed some critics maintain that ticket prices only go up to make discounts look more attractive .
tkts , the only official discount ticket operator in london , sell 45,000 theatre tickets each month , 90 % at half price .
with typically 30 productions on offer , predominantly musicals and dramas , tkts sales account for 4 % of all west end ticket sales .
unsurprisingly , tourists account for more than half of all tkts customers , but 25 % of customers are london residents .
first-time bookers the national theatre established the £ 10 travelex season in 2003 , in a bid to attract more young people and fill auditoriums .
under the current scheme - which finished this weekend - roughly two-thirds of the tickets for four productions at the national 's olivier theatre were available at £ 10 .
this year , the third travelex season sold 33,000 tickets to new theatregoers and played to 93 % capacity audiences . "
ticket incentives are very important " rosemary squire the ambassador theatre group -lrb- atg -rrb- - which owns 11 theatres in london 's west end - and 13 regional venues , is also eager to develop new audiences .
" ticket incentives are very important , " says atg 's rosemary squire , citing a cut-price campaign run across the west end this summer to attract new customers to their london playhouses .
" the campaign brought about 2,500 new ticket buyers and £ 75,000 worth of sales .
" more importantly we captured all that information on database so that we can target people who may have only tried theatre once on a cheap deal , to try and persuade them to come back . "
