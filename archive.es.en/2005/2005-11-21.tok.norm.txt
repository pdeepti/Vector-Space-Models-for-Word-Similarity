germany 's new coalition has already set out plans to build on the current policy of a child ’ s right to a non-violent education .
by way of contrast , a new study shows smacking to be widely accepted in germany . in a survey , commissioned by the berliner zeitung newspaper , 36 percent of those asked said they believe that smacking children is justifiable , with a further 28 percent deeming it acceptable to raise a hand in exceptional circumstances .
only one third expressed outright rejection of the practice as an educational tool .
this latest round of controversy , in what is a long-running and ever-evolving issue in many european countries , was sparked by berlin ’ s chief public prosecutor , hansjürgen karge , who recently went down on record as saying : " i am not seeking to introduce corporal punishment , but i won ’ t have anyone stop me from giving an occasional smack . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what is the best way to discipline a child ?
his comment has drawn a sense of general incredulity from both sides of the fence , with child protection agencies damning the practice as humiliating for the child involved and slamming the man who publicly condoned it as misguided , and well-worn parents claiming that an occasional smack is a far cry from violence , and can be incredibly helpful .
" i think a smack on the bottom is okay , but it ’ s important that it is spontaneous and that the children know what it is about and know that they did something very wrong .
it ’ s like with medicine , a few drops can be very effective , but too much is poison , " said mother of two , johanna weske .
violence against children " inadmissible " but the fact is , that since the introduction in 2000 of the outlawing violence in education act , smacking a child is out of bounds .
the law declares corporal punishment , psychological injury and other demeaning forms of educating children as " inadmissible . "
yet that said , enforcement of the legislation is a sketchy business , with charges rarely pressed in anything but extreme cases .
and even then , they are often waived if the family concerned agrees to counseling or other supportive measures .
so if the law is not actively used as a tool to prevent smacking , just how serious is the problem ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : happy days with the parents a comprehensive report published three years after the introduction of the act , indicates that 60 percent of germans think it acceptable to raise a hand to their children every now and then .
and while that figure seems high , barbara ammer , managing director of the alliance for children against violence , says there are definite signs of a shift away from physically abusive parenting .
" society is changing , but the process is slow .
since the law came into force , awareness about a non-violent upbringing has increased and the idea of non-violent education is becoming more important in society , " ammer said .
idealism versus realism but ideals are not always representative of reality and lotte knoller of the child protection centre in berlin says a problem she frequently encounters among the parents she counsels is an grave uncertainty about just how to set about child-rearing .
" when it comes to education , germany is in a gray zone somewhere between a laissez-faire and a rigid attitude .
parents don ’ t know how to earn the respect of their children . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parenting can be a case of fumbling in the dark ammer too , says that while communicative , almost discursive parenting techniques are fine in theory , they don ’ t always provide children with the restrictions they need .
the consequence is unruly behavior with which modern parents are often ill-equipped to deal .
" interestingly , although the birth rate is in decline , sales of education self-helps books is on the increase , " ammer said .
" changing values in our society are making people insecure .
authority has been replaced by communication , and parents are more reluctant to establish boundaries and make rules . "
putting children first society may be changing , but the need among willful young children to know where they stand , is not .
and that is where the act for non-violent education comes back into play .
whatever its restrictions in practical terms , it serves the purpose of raising an awareness of the difference between acceptable and non-acceptable child-rearing , and perhaps more importantly of letting parents know that there is help at hand when the going gets too tough .
as much as anything , it operates like a campaign to make germany , often viewed to be child-unfriendly , realize the value of investing time , effort and warmth into nurturing its younger generation .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what is the best way to discipline a child ?
his comment has drawn a sense of general incredulity from both sides of the fence , with child protection agencies damning the practice as humiliating for the child involved and slamming the man who publicly condoned it as misguided , and well-worn parents claiming that an occasional smack is a far cry from violence , and can be incredibly helpful .
" i think a smack on the bottom is okay , but it ’ s important that it is spontaneous and that the children know what it is about and know that they did something very wrong .
it ’ s like with medicine , a few drops can be very effective , but too much is poison , " said mother of two , johanna weske .
violence against children " inadmissible " but the fact is , that since the introduction in 2000 of the outlawing violence in education act , smacking a child is out of bounds .
the law declares corporal punishment , psychological injury and other demeaning forms of educating children as " inadmissible . "
yet that said , enforcement of the legislation is a sketchy business , with charges rarely pressed in anything but extreme cases .
and even then , they are often waived if the family concerned agrees to counseling or other supportive measures .
so if the law is not actively used as a tool to prevent smacking , just how serious is the problem ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : happy days with the parents a comprehensive report published three years after the introduction of the act , indicates that 60 percent of germans think it acceptable to raise a hand to their children every now and then .
and while that figure seems high , barbara ammer , managing director of the alliance for children against violence , says there are definite signs of a shift away from physically abusive parenting .
" society is changing , but the process is slow .
since the law came into force , awareness about a non-violent upbringing has increased and the idea of non-violent education is becoming more important in society , " ammer said .
idealism versus realism but ideals are not always representative of reality and lotte knoller of the child protection centre in berlin says a problem she frequently encounters among the parents she counsels is an grave uncertainty about just how to set about child-rearing .
" when it comes to education , germany is in a gray zone somewhere between a laissez-faire and a rigid attitude .
parents don ’ t know how to earn the respect of their children . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parenting can be a case of fumbling in the dark ammer too , says that while communicative , almost discursive parenting techniques are fine in theory , they don ’ t always provide children with the restrictions they need .
the consequence is unruly behavior with which modern parents are often ill-equipped to deal .
" interestingly , although the birth rate is in decline , sales of education self-helps books is on the increase , " ammer said .
" changing values in our society are making people insecure .
authority has been replaced by communication , and parents are more reluctant to establish boundaries and make rules . "
putting children first society may be changing , but the need among willful young children to know where they stand , is not .
and that is where the act for non-violent education comes back into play .
whatever its restrictions in practical terms , it serves the purpose of raising an awareness of the difference between acceptable and non-acceptable child-rearing , and perhaps more importantly of letting parents know that there is help at hand when the going gets too tough .
as much as anything , it operates like a campaign to make germany , often viewed to be child-unfriendly , realize the value of investing time , effort and warmth into nurturing its younger generation .
ammer says the ultimate aim is to " encourage people to put children at the center of our society .

but former president khatami encouraged germany to continue its leading role in negotiations . iran has threatened tough retaliation if it is referred to the un security council because of its atomic program .
its conservative-controlled parliament gave preliminary backing to a bill that would oblige the government to " stop voluntary and non-legally binding measures and implement its scientific , research and executive programmes " if the iranian case is taken up in new york . the text does not refer to specific forms of retaliation , but counter-measures could encompass a refusal to adhere to the additional protocol of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty , which gives increased inspection powers to the international atomic energy agency . the protocol , signed by the previous reformist government but not ratified by deputies , is seen as being crucial to an iaea probe into allegations that iran is using an atomic energy drive as a cover for weapons development . the threat of retaliation could also include an end to iran 's freeze of ultra-sensitive uranium enrichment - a process used to make reactor fuel but which can also make the explosive core of a nuclear weapon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gholamreza aghazadeh is vice president and head of iran 's nuclear program top iranian officials , who maintain the nuclear drive is for strictly peaceful purposes only , have already threatened such retaliation if iran is referred to the security council . the move by parliament is seen as a means for iran to reinforce such warnings , and the bill is subject to further debate on tuesday - just two days ahead of the iaea meeting . military site off-limits meanwhile foreign ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi said the iaea would not be let into a suspect military site in tehran unless it provides " concrete proof " to justify an inspection . he also insisted a new report by iaea chief mohamed elbaradei does " not contain any negative points " - even if the text explicitly states that " iran 's full transparency is indispensable and overdue . " one of the iaea 's demands is to return to the lavizan-shian area in tehran , site of a physics research center that was dismantled and the ground razed before iaea inspectors paid an initial visit in june 2004 . under the npt , iran is not obliged to provide access to such sites but has allowed some access as a " confidence-building " measure . " they can not just say we want to talk to this or that person and keep on dragging out the dossier , " asefi argued . concerns the agency has uncovered suspect activity in iran yet no " smoking gun , " but concerns have been raised by tehran 's submission of a document bought on the black market describing how to make what could be the explosive core of an atom bomb . asefi said the significance of the document was being exaggerated , saying " there is no legal and rational reason to send iran 's case to the security council .

" it is not only in the interest of the west or iran , but in that of the whole world , that the nuclear negotiations be continued until a solution is reached , " he told the iranian news agency irna in berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mohammad khatami khatami , who is seen as a moderate , is currently a guest of the hamburg-based körber foundation .

germany 's new coalition has already set out plans to build on the current policy of a child ’ s right to a non-violent education .
by way of contrast , a new study shows smacking to be widely accepted in germany . in a survey , commissioned by the berliner zeitung newspaper , 36 percent of those asked said they believe that smacking children is justifiable , with a further 28 percent deeming it acceptable to raise a hand in exceptional circumstances .
only one third expressed outright rejection of the practice as an educational tool .
this latest round of controversy , in what is a long-running and ever-evolving issue in many european countries , was sparked by berlin ’ s chief public prosecutor , hansjürgen karge , who recently went down on record as saying : " i am not seeking to introduce corporal punishment , but i won ’ t have anyone stop me from giving an occasional smack .

21 , 2005 , the dayton agreement ended the war in bosnia and herzegovina that left 250,000 people dead and 2 million displaced .
but the treaty did n't create a fair peace , according to dw 's fabian schmidt . the dayton agreement was good because it put an end to the human suffering and to the siege of sarajevo .
it was good because it created the basis for the return of refugees , for free elections , for democratic institutions and for economic recovery . it was good because it gave nato the mandate to apply the treaty with force - if necessary .
dayton also made possible the development of inter-ethnic and inter-religious dialogue .
it created the preconditions for coming to terms with the past , particularly through identification of the victims of mass killings and war , and by giving the international war crimes tribunal 's access to the sites where the horrors took place . but dayton was not fair .
it created the basis for an illogical peace .
in contrast to postwar germany , there was no " de-nazification " in bosnia-herzegovina .
dayton was an attempt to build democracy upon the quagmire of national hatred .
the treaty rewarded those who had waged war .
it recognized the republika srpska as an entity with individual statehood , a republic whose very existence was based on rape and mass killings . time for a n ew co n stitutio n dayton created the foundation for parliament and governments to be formed according to ethnic quotas .
it allowed ethnic and religious segregation in schools to become the order of the day .
even today , the nationalistic parties that waged war against each other are still in power in bosnia and herzegovina . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us secretary of state warren christopher -lrb- center -rrb- , bosnia 's izetbegovic -lrb- left -rrb- and croatia 's tudjman in dayton but above all , the dayton agreement gave the country an inefficient administrative structure .
the country with its two entities , 10 cantons , one district and a central government has 14 parliaments and governments for only 4 million inhabitants .
bosnia and herzegovina 's constitution is not the result of self-determination .
it was signed in dayton by two foreign heads of state - serbian and croatian presidents slobodan milosevic and franjo tudjman - and by bosnian president alija izetbegovic . it 's time that bosnia and herzegovina got its own , new constitution that can pave the way to europe and shed the burden of ethnic division .
europe and america are ready to help .
now it 's up to the people of bosnia to recognize the opportunity and take action . fabian schmidt -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu mulls military preparedness eu defense ministers reviewed the bloc 's bosnia mission and discussed whether its forces are sufficiently equipped .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 21.11.2005 to smack or not to smack großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what to do with an uncontrollable screaming child ?
germany 's new coalition has already set out plans to build on the current policy of a child ’ s right to a non-violent education .
by way of contrast , a new study shows smacking to be widely accepted in germany . in a survey , commissioned by the berliner zeitung newspaper , 36 percent of those asked said they believe that smacking children is justifiable , with a further 28 percent deeming it acceptable to raise a hand in exceptional circumstances .
only one third expressed outright rejection of the practice as an educational tool .
this latest round of controversy , in what is a long-running and ever-evolving issue in many european countries , was sparked by berlin ’ s chief public prosecutor , hansjürgen karge , who recently went down on record as saying : " i am not seeking to introduce corporal punishment , but i won ’ t have anyone stop me from giving an occasional smack . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what is the best way to discipline a child ?
his comment has drawn a sense of general incredulity from both sides of the fence , with child protection agencies damning the practice as humiliating for the child involved and slamming the man who publicly condoned it as misguided , and well-worn parents claiming that an occasional smack is a far cry from violence , and can be incredibly helpful .
" i think a smack on the bottom is okay , but it ’ s important that it is spontaneous and that the children know what it is about and know that they did something very wrong .
it ’ s like with medicine , a few drops can be very effective , but too much is poison , " said mother of two , johanna weske .
violence against children " inadmissible " but the fact is , that since the introduction in 2000 of the outlawing violence in education act , smacking a child is out of bounds .
the law declares corporal punishment , psychological injury and other demeaning forms of educating children as " inadmissible . "
yet that said , enforcement of the legislation is a sketchy business , with charges rarely pressed in anything but extreme cases .
and even then , they are often waived if the family concerned agrees to counseling or other supportive measures .
so if the law is not actively used as a tool to prevent smacking , just how serious is the problem ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : happy days with the parents a comprehensive report published three years after the introduction of the act , indicates that 60 percent of germans think it acceptable to raise a hand to their children every now and then .
and while that figure seems high , barbara ammer , managing director of the alliance for children against violence , says there are definite signs of a shift away from physically abusive parenting .
" society is changing , but the process is slow .
since the law came into force , awareness about a non-violent upbringing has increased and the idea of non-violent education is becoming more important in society , " ammer said .
idealism versus realism but ideals are not always representative of reality and lotte knoller of the child protection centre in berlin says a problem she frequently encounters among the parents she counsels is an grave uncertainty about just how to set about child-rearing .
" when it comes to education , germany is in a gray zone somewhere between a laissez-faire and a rigid attitude .
parents don ’ t know how to earn the respect of their children . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parenting can be a case of fumbling in the dark ammer too , says that while communicative , almost discursive parenting techniques are fine in theory , they don ’ t always provide children with the restrictions they need .
the consequence is unruly behavior with which modern parents are often ill-equipped to deal .
" interestingly , although the birth rate is in decline , sales of education self-helps books is on the increase , " ammer said .
" changing values in our society are making people insecure .
authority has been replaced by communication , and parents are more reluctant to establish boundaries and make rules . "
putting children first society may be changing , but the need among willful young children to know where they stand , is not .
and that is where the act for non-violent education comes back into play .
whatever its restrictions in practical terms , it serves the purpose of raising an awareness of the difference between acceptable and non-acceptable child-rearing , and perhaps more importantly of letting parents know that there is help at hand when the going gets too tough .
as much as anything , it operates like a campaign to make germany , often viewed to be child-unfriendly , realize the value of investing time , effort and warmth into nurturing its younger generation .
ammer says the ultimate aim is to " encourage people to put children at the center of our society .

but former president khatami encouraged germany to continue its leading role in negotiations . iran has threatened tough retaliation if it is referred to the un security council because of its atomic program .
its conservative-controlled parliament gave preliminary backing to a bill that would oblige the government to " stop voluntary and non-legally binding measures and implement its scientific , research and executive programmes " if the iranian case is taken up in new york . the text does not refer to specific forms of retaliation , but counter-measures could encompass a refusal to adhere to the additional protocol of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty , which gives increased inspection powers to the international atomic energy agency . the protocol , signed by the previous reformist government but not ratified by deputies , is seen as being crucial to an iaea probe into allegations that iran is using an atomic energy drive as a cover for weapons development . the threat of retaliation could also include an end to iran 's freeze of ultra-sensitive uranium enrichment - a process used to make reactor fuel but which can also make the explosive core of a nuclear weapon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gholamreza aghazadeh is vice president and head of iran 's nuclear program top iranian officials , who maintain the nuclear drive is for strictly peaceful purposes only , have already threatened such retaliation if iran is referred to the security council . the move by parliament is seen as a means for iran to reinforce such warnings , and the bill is subject to further debate on tuesday - just two days ahead of the iaea meeting . military site off-limits meanwhile foreign ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi said the iaea would not be let into a suspect military site in tehran unless it provides " concrete proof " to justify an inspection . he also insisted a new report by iaea chief mohamed elbaradei does " not contain any negative points " - even if the text explicitly states that " iran 's full transparency is indispensable and overdue . " one of the iaea 's demands is to return to the lavizan-shian area in tehran , site of a physics research center that was dismantled and the ground razed before iaea inspectors paid an initial visit in june 2004 . under the npt , iran is not obliged to provide access to such sites but has allowed some access as a " confidence-building " measure . " they can not just say we want to talk to this or that person and keep on dragging out the dossier , " asefi argued . concerns the agency has uncovered suspect activity in iran yet no " smoking gun , " but concerns have been raised by tehran 's submission of a document bought on the black market describing how to make what could be the explosive core of an atom bomb . asefi said the significance of the document was being exaggerated , saying " there is no legal and rational reason to send iran 's case to the security council . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters of an iranian opposition group demonstrate in brussels iran triggered the latest crisis in august when it effectively broke off negotiations with britain , france and germany on a package of incentives for restraining its nuclear plans and resumed uranium conversion activities it had suspended a year ago . appeal to resume talks the former iranian president , mohammad khatami , urged over the weekend germany to resume talks with iran over the nuclear issue . " it is not only in the interest of the west or iran , but in that of the whole world , that the nuclear negotiations be continued until a solution is reached , " he told the iranian news agency irna in berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mohammad khatami khatami , who is seen as a moderate , is currently a guest of the hamburg-based körber foundation .
he met the foreign minister-designate , frank-walter steinmeier , on thursday and german president horst köhler on friday . because of the resumption of iran 's uranium conversion program , the eu negotiation trio cancelled talks with iran that were scheduled to take place this week in moscow . iran also announced it is to stop conversion work for 15 days but added the halt was only for brief maintenance work and not a result of international pressure and the iaea board meeting . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu studies iranian offer to resume nuclear talks the european union said monday it is studying a new iranian offer to resume talks on tehran 's disputed nuclear program , aiming to defuse an increasingly tense standoff with the islamic state .

but former president khatami encouraged germany to continue its leading role in negotiations . iran has threatened tough retaliation if it is referred to the un security council because of its atomic program .
its conservative-controlled parliament gave preliminary backing to a bill that would oblige the government to " stop voluntary and non-legally binding measures and implement its scientific , research and executive programmes " if the iranian case is taken up in new york . the text does not refer to specific forms of retaliation , but counter-measures could encompass a refusal to adhere to the additional protocol of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty , which gives increased inspection powers to the international atomic energy agency . the protocol , signed by the previous reformist government but not ratified by deputies , is seen as being crucial to an iaea probe into allegations that iran is using an atomic energy drive as a cover for weapons development . the threat of retaliation could also include an end to iran 's freeze of ultra-sensitive uranium enrichment - a process used to make reactor fuel but which can also make the explosive core of a nuclear weapon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gholamreza aghazadeh is vice president and head of iran 's nuclear program top iranian officials , who maintain the nuclear drive is for strictly peaceful purposes only , have already threatened such retaliation if iran is referred to the security council . the move by parliament is seen as a means for iran to reinforce such warnings , and the bill is subject to further debate on tuesday - just two days ahead of the iaea meeting . military site off-limits meanwhile foreign ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi said the iaea would not be let into a suspect military site in tehran unless it provides " concrete proof " to justify an inspection . he also insisted a new report by iaea chief mohamed elbaradei does " not contain any negative points " - even if the text explicitly states that " iran 's full transparency is indispensable and overdue . " one of the iaea 's demands is to return to the lavizan-shian area in tehran , site of a physics research center that was dismantled and the ground razed before iaea inspectors paid an initial visit in june 2004 . under the npt , iran is not obliged to provide access to such sites but has allowed some access as a " confidence-building " measure . " they can not just say we want to talk to this or that person and keep on dragging out the dossier , " asefi argued . concerns the agency has uncovered suspect activity in iran yet no " smoking gun , " but concerns have been raised by tehran 's submission of a document bought on the black market describing how to make what could be the explosive core of an atom bomb . asefi said the significance of the document was being exaggerated , saying " there is no legal and rational reason to send iran 's case to the security council . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters of an iranian opposition group demonstrate in brussels iran triggered the latest crisis in august when it effectively broke off negotiations with britain , france and germany on a package of incentives for restraining its nuclear plans and resumed uranium conversion activities it had suspended a year ago . appeal to resume talks the former iranian president , mohammad khatami , urged over the weekend germany to resume talks with iran over the nuclear issue . " it is not only in the interest of the west or iran , but in that of the whole world , that the nuclear negotiations be continued until a solution is reached , " he told the iranian news agency irna in berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mohammad khatami khatami , who is seen as a moderate , is currently a guest of the hamburg-based körber foundation .

she will lead an unwieldy coalition of the left and right whose main task will be getting the german economy moving again . she is not an especially charismatic woman , this former physicist who grew up in communist east germany .
she does n't come across as a natural leader who grabs hold of life with gusto .
in fact , when asked once in an interview how she would spend three days if she could do anything she wanted , she replied she would tidy up her apartment and get her book collection in order . but angela merkel has been underestimated time and time again , and in her political career , she has always emerged on top , often leaving much more experienced , usually male politicians in the dust .
she has skyrocketed to the top of her party in near record time - she only entered politics after the fall of the berlin wall - as a childless , protestant woman from the east in a party dominated by catholic family men from western germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel 's future was in question for a while after sept .
18 she did n't flinch in the difficult weeks after her party 's poor showing in the sept .
18 election , during which there were calls for her to step aside . now , germany is preparing to watch as she is voted by the german parliament , the bundestag , as the country 's first female leader , and its first leader from the east . although she is stepping into the history books tomorrow when she gets the keys to the chancellery , any honeymoon period , if there is one , is not likely to last long .
she has a raft of difficult decisions to make as she takes over from seven years of outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democratic-green government .
many of those decisions are not going to please the public . red-green legacy even as schröder cleans out his desk , judgments are being passed on the legacy of seven years of his " red-green " government , so named because of the colors associated with the coalition 's two parties . it is a mixed report card , with many on the left upset at social welfare reforms that hurt the poor , those on the right and business interests giving him poor marks for his unwillingness to put through far-reaching changes they say are necessary . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder has said he will resign from parliament , even though he 's entitled to a seat over the weekend , in what was schröder 's last public speech as german leader , he said he hoped his time in office would be remembered for his government 's strong foreign policy stance -lrb- he refused to support the us-led war in iraq , severely bruising transatlantic relations -rrb- , and the domestic reforms , which he said struck a balance between oiling the economy and protecting the weakest in society . but merkel is inheriting a germany suffering from high-unemployment , currently at 11.6 percent , a ballooning budget deficit and anemic economic growth , less than 1 percent this year and forecast to be just slightly higher in 2006 .
while germany was once the economic locomotive of europe , today it 's more akin to the caboose . government program in the coalition agreement , the two partners have pledged to enact a multi-billion-euro investment program , to loosen some job protection rules to encourage companies to hire and to increase the vat tax by three percentage points in 2007 to cut down the deficit . on this last point , she has already come under criticism by economists , who question the wisdom of increasing a consumption tax at a time when consumer spending is the achilles ' heel of the german economy . she has to hope that the german populace will be forgiving as she works to enact deeper , and more painful reforms than her predecessor -lrb- although not as deep as she would like to , since she has to govern with the spd -rrb- .
she appears to think they will be understanding if they see that the reforms are cutting the jobless rate and helping them in the long run . " will we ensure that by 2009 people say ' yes , for me personally it 's a bit better than in 2005 ' ? "
merkel said before signing the coalition agreement .
she said the agreement offered germany the chance of achieving that goal . no " iron lady " much has been made , especially abroad , of the fact that merkel is a woman and there have been the inevitable comparisons to the uk 's margaret thatcher , who is credited with aggressively remaking the british economy , although many questioned her methods . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : margaret thatcher had more room to maneuver than merkel does due to constraints placed on her by her coalition partners , it is very unlikely that she will become a sort of " eiserne frau " after the model of the " iron lady , " as thatcher was nicknamed . however , there is at least one factor that could help her get her way .
her coalition enjoys an overwhelming majority in the parliament , 448 of the 614 seats in the lower house .
the two parties also dominate the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , which means that the new government will be able to enact reforms in the federal system , pensions and taxes without fear of a veto . the fact that the upper house was in conservative hands during the schröder era proved to be a major hindrance to that government . convincing the public one of her greatest challenges will be bringing the public around to the idea that change is needed to germany to retain the high standard of living it has enjoyed for decades .
for a german public highly resistant to change , this has been a bitter pill to swallow . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and spd chief matthias platzeck are standing shoulder to shoulder , for now still , she and the new head of the social democrats , matthias platzeck , have presented a united face to the public regarding reforms .
the fact that both of them hail from in the east - platzeck is from potsdam - gives them something of an outsider 's perspective on things , and could prove beneficial since they did not grow up with many of the material benefits of west germany or with a sense of entitlement .
they are both former scientists , analytical and pragmatic and have proven in the past they are not afraid to tell it like it is , even if the news is unpleasant . platzeck won the support of the population of the state of brandenburg with his straight talk about the dire economic situation there .
the population found it refreshing .
merkel and platzeck can only hope that will apply on a national level as well . still , they have a lot of persuading to do .

the two parties also dominate the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , which means that the new government will be able to enact reforms in the federal system , pensions and taxes without fear of a veto . the fact that the upper house was in conservative hands during the schröder era proved to be a major hindrance to that government . convincing the public one of her greatest challenges will be bringing the public around to the idea that change is needed to germany to retain the high standard of living it has enjoyed for decades .
for a german public highly resistant to change , this has been a bitter pill to swallow . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and spd chief matthias platzeck are standing shoulder to shoulder , for now still , she and the new head of the social democrats , matthias platzeck , have presented a united face to the public regarding reforms .
the fact that both of them hail from in the east - platzeck is from potsdam - gives them something of an outsider 's perspective on things , and could prove beneficial since they did not grow up with many of the material benefits of west germany or with a sense of entitlement .
they are both former scientists , analytical and pragmatic and have proven in the past they are not afraid to tell it like it is , even if the news is unpleasant . platzeck won the support of the population of the state of brandenburg with his straight talk about the dire economic situation there .
the population found it refreshing .
merkel and platzeck can only hope that will apply on a national level as well . still , they have a lot of persuading to do .
polls show that a majority of the public does not expect the grand coalition to last for four years . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de experts say merkel will bring change in style , not policy for us germany finally has a coalition deal , paving the way for angela merkel to become chancellor .
experts say foreign policy under her will lead to warmer ties with the us , but it wo n't translate into major policy changes .

with angela merkel about to be sworn in , the web site for the german chancellor is out of date , as the address only implies a male " kanzler . "
but thanks to a forward-thinking young man , she 's got nothing to worry about . lars heitmüller says he 's no feminist - he 's just interested in promoting equality of the sexes .
still , you 've got to hand it to him .
as a 22-year-old student back in 1998 , heitmüller was already thinking of the day when a woman would occupy germany 's top office .
it seemed that , seven years ago , the possibility had n't yet occurred to staffers in charge of the government 's internet presence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what will happen to www.bundeskanzler.de when schröder is gone ?
heitmüller discovered that the web domains for the feminine versions of the german words for " chancellor " and " federal president " were there for the taking , and promptly snapped them up .
today , if you go to www.bundeskanzlerin.de or www.bundespraesidentin.de - the " in " at the end of the words denoting the female - you get a notice from heitmüller informing you that the sites are being kept " in trust " for the first women to occupy these offices . now that angela merkel is about to be confirmed as germany 's first female chancellor , heitmüller intends to relinquish www.bundeskanzlerin.de - for free , of course . " i 'm not trying to make money with this , " heitmüller , now 29 years of age and a public relations consultant in berlin , told der spiegel . merkel defi n itely i n terested nor is he trying to score any political points with his web addresses , though merkel is likely to be a grateful recipient .
after all , she first expressed interest in acquiring the domain ahead of germany 's last general election in 2002 , despite the fact that it was not she , but rather bavarian premier edmund stoiber who was nominated to run for the conservatives that time . heitmüller maintains that purchasing the domains was simply part of his personal engagement to promote more gender equality in germany . " this is also something for men to be concerned with , " he told der spiegel .

angela merkel , however , is not promising a feminist or even a particularly feminine future .

police also cleared a blockade of 160 tractors near the town of klein gusborn on the last leg of the 600-kilometer -lrb- 370-mile -rrb- odyssey , where more than 600 people joined the protest following demonstrations throughout the weekend . in the town of harlingen , police removed 150 activists performing a sit-in on the tracks and detained 23 .
authorities had to forcibly clear the blockade , with more than 70 of the tractors seized and taken to a nearby field .
some 15,000 officers had been mobilized on the german side to secure the passage of the train . the coalition of activists argues that the shipments are dangerous and that their lengthy storage could allow radioactive material to seep into the water supply in the region . " the radioactivity of these 12 containers is two and a half times higher than that of chernobyl , " said thomas breuer , a nuclear expert with environmental watchdog greenpeace .

the waste containers will be loaded onto trucks there and finish the final 20-kilometer -lrb- 12-mile -rrb- stretch of the journey .

the federal government of gerhard schröder , which is leaving office on tuesday , will pick up one-third of the cost . the sale was agreed up on in a secret meeting of the federal security council .
even outgoing foreign minister joschka fischer , a member of the once-pacifist green party , agreed to the sale .
however , he will not sign the agreement himself on monday , but is sending a deputy . germany , which is a staunch supporter of israel , had already given two dolphin submarines to the israeli navy after the gulf war in the early 1990s .

schröder 's government had long been hesitant about selling additional subs to israel , fearing that the country might arm them with nuclear weapons and further threaten middle east stability . i n itial resista n ce the news reports say germany had long resisted supplying the new submarines at a reduced price .
israeli security sources confirmed that questions over the price tag had delayed the sale , according to reuters . the new submarines will be outfitted with fuel cell engines that will allow them to remain submerged for weeks at a time .
they will be constructed in the baltic sea coastal city of kiel . the sale will be the second major and long-delayed arms sale that the schröder government is completing in its final month in office .

the federal government of gerhard schröder , which is leaving office on tuesday , will pick up one-third of the cost . the sale was agreed up on in a secret meeting of the federal security council .
even outgoing foreign minister joschka fischer , a member of the once-pacifist green party , agreed to the sale .
however , he will not sign the agreement himself on monday , but is sending a deputy . germany , which is a staunch supporter of israel , had already given two dolphin submarines to the israeli navy after the gulf war in the early 1990s .
the navy later bought a third at a greatly reduced price .
schröder 's government had long been hesitant about selling additional subs to israel , fearing that the country might arm them with nuclear weapons and further threaten middle east stability . i n itial resista n ce the news reports say germany had long resisted supplying the new submarines at a reduced price .
israeli security sources confirmed that questions over the price tag had delayed the sale , according to reuters . the new submarines will be outfitted with fuel cell engines that will allow them to remain submerged for weeks at a time .
they will be constructed in the baltic sea coastal city of kiel . the sale will be the second major and long-delayed arms sale that the schröder government is completing in its final month in office .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 21.11.2005 to smack or not to smack großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what to do with an uncontrollable screaming child ?
germany 's new coalition has already set out plans to build on the current policy of a child ’ s right to a non-violent education .
by way of contrast , a new study shows smacking to be widely accepted in germany . in a survey , commissioned by the berliner zeitung newspaper , 36 percent of those asked said they believe that smacking children is justifiable , with a further 28 percent deeming it acceptable to raise a hand in exceptional circumstances .
only one third expressed outright rejection of the practice as an educational tool .
this latest round of controversy , in what is a long-running and ever-evolving issue in many european countries , was sparked by berlin ’ s chief public prosecutor , hansjürgen karge , who recently went down on record as saying : " i am not seeking to introduce corporal punishment , but i won ’ t have anyone stop me from giving an occasional smack . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what is the best way to discipline a child ?
his comment has drawn a sense of general incredulity from both sides of the fence , with child protection agencies damning the practice as humiliating for the child involved and slamming the man who publicly condoned it as misguided , and well-worn parents claiming that an occasional smack is a far cry from violence , and can be incredibly helpful .
" i think a smack on the bottom is okay , but it ’ s important that it is spontaneous and that the children know what it is about and know that they did something very wrong .
it ’ s like with medicine , a few drops can be very effective , but too much is poison , " said mother of two , johanna weske .
violence against children " inadmissible " but the fact is , that since the introduction in 2000 of the outlawing violence in education act , smacking a child is out of bounds .
the law declares corporal punishment , psychological injury and other demeaning forms of educating children as " inadmissible . "
yet that said , enforcement of the legislation is a sketchy business , with charges rarely pressed in anything but extreme cases .
and even then , they are often waived if the family concerned agrees to counseling or other supportive measures .
so if the law is not actively used as a tool to prevent smacking , just how serious is the problem ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : happy days with the parents a comprehensive report published three years after the introduction of the act , indicates that 60 percent of germans think it acceptable to raise a hand to their children every now and then .
and while that figure seems high , barbara ammer , managing director of the alliance for children against violence , says there are definite signs of a shift away from physically abusive parenting .
" society is changing , but the process is slow .
since the law came into force , awareness about a non-violent upbringing has increased and the idea of non-violent education is becoming more important in society , " ammer said .
idealism versus realism but ideals are not always representative of reality and lotte knoller of the child protection centre in berlin says a problem she frequently encounters among the parents she counsels is an grave uncertainty about just how to set about child-rearing .
" when it comes to education , germany is in a gray zone somewhere between a laissez-faire and a rigid attitude .
parents don ’ t know how to earn the respect of their children . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parenting can be a case of fumbling in the dark ammer too , says that while communicative , almost discursive parenting techniques are fine in theory , they don ’ t always provide children with the restrictions they need .
the consequence is unruly behavior with which modern parents are often ill-equipped to deal .
" interestingly , although the birth rate is in decline , sales of education self-helps books is on the increase , " ammer said .
" changing values in our society are making people insecure .
authority has been replaced by communication , and parents are more reluctant to establish boundaries and make rules . "
putting children first society may be changing , but the need among willful young children to know where they stand , is not .
and that is where the act for non-violent education comes back into play .
whatever its restrictions in practical terms , it serves the purpose of raising an awareness of the difference between acceptable and non-acceptable child-rearing , and perhaps more importantly of letting parents know that there is help at hand when the going gets too tough .
as much as anything , it operates like a campaign to make germany , often viewed to be child-unfriendly , realize the value of investing time , effort and warmth into nurturing its younger generation .
ammer says the ultimate aim is to " encourage people to put children at the center of our society .

germany 's new coalition has already set out plans to build on the current policy of a child ’ s right to a non-violent education .
by way of contrast , a new study shows smacking to be widely accepted in germany . in a survey , commissioned by the berliner zeitung newspaper , 36 percent of those asked said they believe that smacking children is justifiable , with a further 28 percent deeming it acceptable to raise a hand in exceptional circumstances .
only one third expressed outright rejection of the practice as an educational tool .
this latest round of controversy , in what is a long-running and ever-evolving issue in many european countries , was sparked by berlin ’ s chief public prosecutor , hansjürgen karge , who recently went down on record as saying : " i am not seeking to introduce corporal punishment , but i won ’ t have anyone stop me from giving an occasional smack . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what is the best way to discipline a child ?
his comment has drawn a sense of general incredulity from both sides of the fence , with child protection agencies damning the practice as humiliating for the child involved and slamming the man who publicly condoned it as misguided , and well-worn parents claiming that an occasional smack is a far cry from violence , and can be incredibly helpful .
" i think a smack on the bottom is okay , but it ’ s important that it is spontaneous and that the children know what it is about and know that they did something very wrong .
it ’ s like with medicine , a few drops can be very effective , but too much is poison , " said mother of two , johanna weske .
violence against children " inadmissible " but the fact is , that since the introduction in 2000 of the outlawing violence in education act , smacking a child is out of bounds .
the law declares corporal punishment , psychological injury and other demeaning forms of educating children as " inadmissible . "
yet that said , enforcement of the legislation is a sketchy business , with charges rarely pressed in anything but extreme cases .
and even then , they are often waived if the family concerned agrees to counseling or other supportive measures .
so if the law is not actively used as a tool to prevent smacking , just how serious is the problem ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : happy days with the parents a comprehensive report published three years after the introduction of the act , indicates that 60 percent of germans think it acceptable to raise a hand to their children every now and then .
and while that figure seems high , barbara ammer , managing director of the alliance for children against violence , says there are definite signs of a shift away from physically abusive parenting .
" society is changing , but the process is slow .
since the law came into force , awareness about a non-violent upbringing has increased and the idea of non-violent education is becoming more important in society , " ammer said .
idealism versus realism but ideals are not always representative of reality and lotte knoller of the child protection centre in berlin says a problem she frequently encounters among the parents she counsels is an grave uncertainty about just how to set about child-rearing .
" when it comes to education , germany is in a gray zone somewhere between a laissez-faire and a rigid attitude .
parents don ’ t know how to earn the respect of their children . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parenting can be a case of fumbling in the dark ammer too , says that while communicative , almost discursive parenting techniques are fine in theory , they don ’ t always provide children with the restrictions they need .
the consequence is unruly behavior with which modern parents are often ill-equipped to deal .
" interestingly , although the birth rate is in decline , sales of education self-helps books is on the increase , " ammer said .
" changing values in our society are making people insecure .
authority has been replaced by communication , and parents are more reluctant to establish boundaries and make rules . "
putting children first society may be changing , but the need among willful young children to know where they stand , is not .
and that is where the act for non-violent education comes back into play .
whatever its restrictions in practical terms , it serves the purpose of raising an awareness of the difference between acceptable and non-acceptable child-rearing , and perhaps more importantly of letting parents know that there is help at hand when the going gets too tough .
as much as anything , it operates like a campaign to make germany , often viewed to be child-unfriendly , realize the value of investing time , effort and warmth into nurturing its younger generation .

21 , 2005 , the dayton agreement ended the war in bosnia and herzegovina that left 250,000 people dead and 2 million displaced .

but former president khatami encouraged germany to continue its leading role in negotiations . iran has threatened tough retaliation if it is referred to the un security council because of its atomic program .
its conservative-controlled parliament gave preliminary backing to a bill that would oblige the government to " stop voluntary and non-legally binding measures and implement its scientific , research and executive programmes " if the iranian case is taken up in new york . the text does not refer to specific forms of retaliation , but counter-measures could encompass a refusal to adhere to the additional protocol of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty , which gives increased inspection powers to the international atomic energy agency . the protocol , signed by the previous reformist government but not ratified by deputies , is seen as being crucial to an iaea probe into allegations that iran is using an atomic energy drive as a cover for weapons development . the threat of retaliation could also include an end to iran 's freeze of ultra-sensitive uranium enrichment - a process used to make reactor fuel but which can also make the explosive core of a nuclear weapon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gholamreza aghazadeh is vice president and head of iran 's nuclear program top iranian officials , who maintain the nuclear drive is for strictly peaceful purposes only , have already threatened such retaliation if iran is referred to the security council . the move by parliament is seen as a means for iran to reinforce such warnings , and the bill is subject to further debate on tuesday - just two days ahead of the iaea meeting . military site off-limits meanwhile foreign ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi said the iaea would not be let into a suspect military site in tehran unless it provides " concrete proof " to justify an inspection . he also insisted a new report by iaea chief mohamed elbaradei does " not contain any negative points " - even if the text explicitly states that " iran 's full transparency is indispensable and overdue . " one of the iaea 's demands is to return to the lavizan-shian area in tehran , site of a physics research center that was dismantled and the ground razed before iaea inspectors paid an initial visit in june 2004 . under the npt , iran is not obliged to provide access to such sites but has allowed some access as a " confidence-building " measure . " they can not just say we want to talk to this or that person and keep on dragging out the dossier , " asefi argued . concerns the agency has uncovered suspect activity in iran yet no " smoking gun , " but concerns have been raised by tehran 's submission of a document bought on the black market describing how to make what could be the explosive core of an atom bomb . asefi said the significance of the document was being exaggerated , saying " there is no legal and rational reason to send iran 's case to the security council . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters of an iranian opposition group demonstrate in brussels iran triggered the latest crisis in august when it effectively broke off negotiations with britain , france and germany on a package of incentives for restraining its nuclear plans and resumed uranium conversion activities it had suspended a year ago . appeal to resume talks the former iranian president , mohammad khatami , urged over the weekend germany to resume talks with iran over the nuclear issue . " it is not only in the interest of the west or iran , but in that of the whole world , that the nuclear negotiations be continued until a solution is reached , " he told the iranian news agency irna in berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mohammad khatami khatami , who is seen as a moderate , is currently a guest of the hamburg-based körber foundation .
he met the foreign minister-designate , frank-walter steinmeier , on thursday and german president horst köhler on friday . because of the resumption of iran 's uranium conversion program , the eu negotiation trio cancelled talks with iran that were scheduled to take place this week in moscow . iran also announced it is to stop conversion work for 15 days but added the halt was only for brief maintenance work and not a result of international pressure and the iaea board meeting . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu studies iranian offer to resume nuclear talks the european union said monday it is studying a new iranian offer to resume talks on tehran 's disputed nuclear program , aiming to defuse an increasingly tense standoff with the islamic state .

police also cleared a blockade of 160 tractors near the town of klein gusborn on the last leg of the 600-kilometer -lrb- 370-mile -rrb- odyssey , where more than 600 people joined the protest following demonstrations throughout the weekend . in the town of harlingen , police removed 150 activists performing a sit-in on the tracks and detained 23 .
authorities had to forcibly clear the blockade , with more than 70 of the tractors seized and taken to a nearby field .
some 15,000 officers had been mobilized on the german side to secure the passage of the train . the coalition of activists argues that the shipments are dangerous and that their lengthy storage could allow radioactive material to seep into the water supply in the region .

with angela merkel about to be sworn in , the web site for the german chancellor is out of date , as the address only implies a male " kanzler . "
but thanks to a forward-thinking young man , she 's got nothing to worry about . lars heitmüller says he 's no feminist - he 's just interested in promoting equality of the sexes .
still , you 've got to hand it to him .
as a 22-year-old student back in 1998 , heitmüller was already thinking of the day when a woman would occupy germany 's top office .

heitmüller discovered that the web domains for the feminine versions of the german words for " chancellor " and " federal president " were there for the taking , and promptly snapped them up .
today , if you go to www.bundeskanzlerin.de or www.bundespraesidentin.de - the " in " at the end of the words denoting the female - you get a notice from heitmüller informing you that the sites are being kept " in trust " for the first women to occupy these offices . now that angela merkel is about to be confirmed as germany 's first female chancellor , heitmüller intends to relinquish www.bundeskanzlerin.de - for free , of course . " i 'm not trying to make money with this , " heitmüller , now 29 years of age and a public relations consultant in berlin , told der spiegel . merkel defi n itely i n terested nor is he trying to score any political points with his web addresses , though merkel is likely to be a grateful recipient .
after all , she first expressed interest in acquiring the domain ahead of germany 's last general election in 2002 , despite the fact that it was not she , but rather bavarian premier edmund stoiber who was nominated to run for the conservatives that time . heitmüller maintains that purchasing the domains was simply part of his personal engagement to promote more gender equality in germany . " this is also something for men to be concerned with , " he told der spiegel .

she will lead an unwieldy coalition of the left and right whose main task will be getting the german economy moving again . she is not an especially charismatic woman , this former physicist who grew up in communist east germany .
she does n't come across as a natural leader who grabs hold of life with gusto .
in fact , when asked once in an interview how she would spend three days if she could do anything she wanted , she replied she would tidy up her apartment and get her book collection in order . but angela merkel has been underestimated time and time again , and in her political career , she has always emerged on top , often leaving much more experienced , usually male politicians in the dust .
she has skyrocketed to the top of her party in near record time - she only entered politics after the fall of the berlin wall - as a childless , protestant woman from the east in a party dominated by catholic family men from western germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel 's future was in question for a while after sept .
18 she did n't flinch in the difficult weeks after her party 's poor showing in the sept .
18 election , during which there were calls for her to step aside . now , germany is preparing to watch as she is voted by the german parliament , the bundestag , as the country 's first female leader , and its first leader from the east . although she is stepping into the history books tomorrow when she gets the keys to the chancellery , any honeymoon period , if there is one , is not likely to last long .
she has a raft of difficult decisions to make as she takes over from seven years of outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democratic-green government .
many of those decisions are not going to please the public . red-green legacy even as schröder cleans out his desk , judgments are being passed on the legacy of seven years of his " red-green " government , so named because of the colors associated with the coalition 's two parties . it is a mixed report card , with many on the left upset at social welfare reforms that hurt the poor , those on the right and business interests giving him poor marks for his unwillingness to put through far-reaching changes they say are necessary . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder has said he will resign from parliament , even though he 's entitled to a seat over the weekend , in what was schröder 's last public speech as german leader , he said he hoped his time in office would be remembered for his government 's strong foreign policy stance -lrb- he refused to support the us-led war in iraq , severely bruising transatlantic relations -rrb- , and the domestic reforms , which he said struck a balance between oiling the economy and protecting the weakest in society . but merkel is inheriting a germany suffering from high-unemployment , currently at 11.6 percent , a ballooning budget deficit and anemic economic growth , less than 1 percent this year and forecast to be just slightly higher in 2006 .
while germany was once the economic locomotive of europe , today it 's more akin to the caboose . government program in the coalition agreement , the two partners have pledged to enact a multi-billion-euro investment program , to loosen some job protection rules to encourage companies to hire and to increase the vat tax by three percentage points in 2007 to cut down the deficit . on this last point , she has already come under criticism by economists , who question the wisdom of increasing a consumption tax at a time when consumer spending is the achilles ' heel of the german economy . she has to hope that the german populace will be forgiving as she works to enact deeper , and more painful reforms than her predecessor -lrb- although not as deep as she would like to , since she has to govern with the spd -rrb- .
she appears to think they will be understanding if they see that the reforms are cutting the jobless rate and helping them in the long run . " will we ensure that by 2009 people say ' yes , for me personally it 's a bit better than in 2005 ' ? "
merkel said before signing the coalition agreement .
she said the agreement offered germany the chance of achieving that goal . no " iron lady " much has been made , especially abroad , of the fact that merkel is a woman and there have been the inevitable comparisons to the uk 's margaret thatcher , who is credited with aggressively remaking the british economy , although many questioned her methods . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : margaret thatcher had more room to maneuver than merkel does due to constraints placed on her by her coalition partners , it is very unlikely that she will become a sort of " eiserne frau " after the model of the " iron lady , " as thatcher was nicknamed . however , there is at least one factor that could help her get her way .
her coalition enjoys an overwhelming majority in the parliament , 448 of the 614 seats in the lower house .
the two parties also dominate the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , which means that the new government will be able to enact reforms in the federal system , pensions and taxes without fear of a veto . the fact that the upper house was in conservative hands during the schröder era proved to be a major hindrance to that government . convincing the public one of her greatest challenges will be bringing the public around to the idea that change is needed to germany to retain the high standard of living it has enjoyed for decades .
for a german public highly resistant to change , this has been a bitter pill to swallow . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and spd chief matthias platzeck are standing shoulder to shoulder , for now still , she and the new head of the social democrats , matthias platzeck , have presented a united face to the public regarding reforms .
the fact that both of them hail from in the east - platzeck is from potsdam - gives them something of an outsider 's perspective on things , and could prove beneficial since they did not grow up with many of the material benefits of west germany or with a sense of entitlement .
they are both former scientists , analytical and pragmatic and have proven in the past they are not afraid to tell it like it is , even if the news is unpleasant . platzeck won the support of the population of the state of brandenburg with his straight talk about the dire economic situation there .
the population found it refreshing .
merkel and platzeck can only hope that will apply on a national level as well . still , they have a lot of persuading to do .

she will lead an unwieldy coalition of the left and right whose main task will be getting the german economy moving again . she is not an especially charismatic woman , this former physicist who grew up in communist east germany .
she does n't come across as a natural leader who grabs hold of life with gusto .
in fact , when asked once in an interview how she would spend three days if she could do anything she wanted , she replied she would tidy up her apartment and get her book collection in order . but angela merkel has been underestimated time and time again , and in her political career , she has always emerged on top , often leaving much more experienced , usually male politicians in the dust .
she has skyrocketed to the top of her party in near record time - she only entered politics after the fall of the berlin wall - as a childless , protestant woman from the east in a party dominated by catholic family men from western germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel 's future was in question for a while after sept .
18 she did n't flinch in the difficult weeks after her party 's poor showing in the sept .
18 election , during which there were calls for her to step aside . now , germany is preparing to watch as she is voted by the german parliament , the bundestag , as the country 's first female leader , and its first leader from the east . although she is stepping into the history books tomorrow when she gets the keys to the chancellery , any honeymoon period , if there is one , is not likely to last long .
she has a raft of difficult decisions to make as she takes over from seven years of outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democratic-green government .
many of those decisions are not going to please the public . red-green legacy even as schröder cleans out his desk , judgments are being passed on the legacy of seven years of his " red-green " government , so named because of the colors associated with the coalition 's two parties . it is a mixed report card , with many on the left upset at social welfare reforms that hurt the poor , those on the right and business interests giving him poor marks for his unwillingness to put through far-reaching changes they say are necessary . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder has said he will resign from parliament , even though he 's entitled to a seat over the weekend , in what was schröder 's last public speech as german leader , he said he hoped his time in office would be remembered for his government 's strong foreign policy stance -lrb- he refused to support the us-led war in iraq , severely bruising transatlantic relations -rrb- , and the domestic reforms , which he said struck a balance between oiling the economy and protecting the weakest in society . but merkel is inheriting a germany suffering from high-unemployment , currently at 11.6 percent , a ballooning budget deficit and anemic economic growth , less than 1 percent this year and forecast to be just slightly higher in 2006 .
while germany was once the economic locomotive of europe , today it 's more akin to the caboose . government program in the coalition agreement , the two partners have pledged to enact a multi-billion-euro investment program , to loosen some job protection rules to encourage companies to hire and to increase the vat tax by three percentage points in 2007 to cut down the deficit . on this last point , she has already come under criticism by economists , who question the wisdom of increasing a consumption tax at a time when consumer spending is the achilles ' heel of the german economy . she has to hope that the german populace will be forgiving as she works to enact deeper , and more painful reforms than her predecessor -lrb- although not as deep as she would like to , since she has to govern with the spd -rrb- .
she appears to think they will be understanding if they see that the reforms are cutting the jobless rate and helping them in the long run . " will we ensure that by 2009 people say ' yes , for me personally it 's a bit better than in 2005 ' ? "
merkel said before signing the coalition agreement .
she said the agreement offered germany the chance of achieving that goal . no " iron lady " much has been made , especially abroad , of the fact that merkel is a woman and there have been the inevitable comparisons to the uk 's margaret thatcher , who is credited with aggressively remaking the british economy , although many questioned her methods . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : margaret thatcher had more room to maneuver than merkel does due to constraints placed on her by her coalition partners , it is very unlikely that she will become a sort of " eiserne frau " after the model of the " iron lady , " as thatcher was nicknamed . however , there is at least one factor that could help her get her way .
her coalition enjoys an overwhelming majority in the parliament , 448 of the 614 seats in the lower house .
the two parties also dominate the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , which means that the new government will be able to enact reforms in the federal system , pensions and taxes without fear of a veto . the fact that the upper house was in conservative hands during the schröder era proved to be a major hindrance to that government . convincing the public one of her greatest challenges will be bringing the public around to the idea that change is needed to germany to retain the high standard of living it has enjoyed for decades .
for a german public highly resistant to change , this has been a bitter pill to swallow . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and spd chief matthias platzeck are standing shoulder to shoulder , for now still , she and the new head of the social democrats , matthias platzeck , have presented a united face to the public regarding reforms .
the fact that both of them hail from in the east - platzeck is from potsdam - gives them something of an outsider 's perspective on things , and could prove beneficial since they did not grow up with many of the material benefits of west germany or with a sense of entitlement .
they are both former scientists , analytical and pragmatic and have proven in the past they are not afraid to tell it like it is , even if the news is unpleasant . platzeck won the support of the population of the state of brandenburg with his straight talk about the dire economic situation there .
the population found it refreshing .
merkel and platzeck can only hope that will apply on a national level as well . still , they have a lot of persuading to do .

she will lead an unwieldy coalition of the left and right whose main task will be getting the german economy moving again . she is not an especially charismatic woman , this former physicist who grew up in communist east germany .
she does n't come across as a natural leader who grabs hold of life with gusto .
in fact , when asked once in an interview how she would spend three days if she could do anything she wanted , she replied she would tidy up her apartment and get her book collection in order . but angela merkel has been underestimated time and time again , and in her political career , she has always emerged on top , often leaving much more experienced , usually male politicians in the dust .
she has skyrocketed to the top of her party in near record time - she only entered politics after the fall of the berlin wall - as a childless , protestant woman from the east in a party dominated by catholic family men from western germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel 's future was in question for a while after sept .
18 she did n't flinch in the difficult weeks after her party 's poor showing in the sept .
18 election , during which there were calls for her to step aside . now , germany is preparing to watch as she is voted by the german parliament , the bundestag , as the country 's first female leader , and its first leader from the east . although she is stepping into the history books tomorrow when she gets the keys to the chancellery , any honeymoon period , if there is one , is not likely to last long .
she has a raft of difficult decisions to make as she takes over from seven years of outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democratic-green government .
many of those decisions are not going to please the public . red-green legacy even as schröder cleans out his desk , judgments are being passed on the legacy of seven years of his " red-green " government , so named because of the colors associated with the coalition 's two parties . it is a mixed report card , with many on the left upset at social welfare reforms that hurt the poor , those on the right and business interests giving him poor marks for his unwillingness to put through far-reaching changes they say are necessary . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder has said he will resign from parliament , even though he 's entitled to a seat over the weekend , in what was schröder 's last public speech as german leader , he said he hoped his time in office would be remembered for his government 's strong foreign policy stance -lrb- he refused to support the us-led war in iraq , severely bruising transatlantic relations -rrb- , and the domestic reforms , which he said struck a balance between oiling the economy and protecting the weakest in society . but merkel is inheriting a germany suffering from high-unemployment , currently at 11.6 percent , a ballooning budget deficit and anemic economic growth , less than 1 percent this year and forecast to be just slightly higher in 2006 .
while germany was once the economic locomotive of europe , today it 's more akin to the caboose . government program in the coalition agreement , the two partners have pledged to enact a multi-billion-euro investment program , to loosen some job protection rules to encourage companies to hire and to increase the vat tax by three percentage points in 2007 to cut down the deficit . on this last point , she has already come under criticism by economists , who question the wisdom of increasing a consumption tax at a time when consumer spending is the achilles ' heel of the german economy . she has to hope that the german populace will be forgiving as she works to enact deeper , and more painful reforms than her predecessor -lrb- although not as deep as she would like to , since she has to govern with the spd -rrb- .
she appears to think they will be understanding if they see that the reforms are cutting the jobless rate and helping them in the long run . " will we ensure that by 2009 people say ' yes , for me personally it 's a bit better than in 2005 ' ? "

germany 's new coalition has already set out plans to build on the current policy of a child ’ s right to a non-violent education .
by way of contrast , a new study shows smacking to be widely accepted in germany . in a survey , commissioned by the berliner zeitung newspaper , 36 percent of those asked said they believe that smacking children is justifiable , with a further 28 percent deeming it acceptable to raise a hand in exceptional circumstances .
only one third expressed outright rejection of the practice as an educational tool .
this latest round of controversy , in what is a long-running and ever-evolving issue in many european countries , was sparked by berlin ’ s chief public prosecutor , hansjürgen karge , who recently went down on record as saying : " i am not seeking to introduce corporal punishment , but i won ’ t have anyone stop me from giving an occasional smack . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what is the best way to discipline a child ?
his comment has drawn a sense of general incredulity from both sides of the fence , with child protection agencies damning the practice as humiliating for the child involved and slamming the man who publicly condoned it as misguided , and well-worn parents claiming that an occasional smack is a far cry from violence , and can be incredibly helpful .
" i think a smack on the bottom is okay , but it ’ s important that it is spontaneous and that the children know what it is about and know that they did something very wrong .
it ’ s like with medicine , a few drops can be very effective , but too much is poison , " said mother of two , johanna weske .
violence against children " inadmissible " but the fact is , that since the introduction in 2000 of the outlawing violence in education act , smacking a child is out of bounds .
the law declares corporal punishment , psychological injury and other demeaning forms of educating children as " inadmissible . "
yet that said , enforcement of the legislation is a sketchy business , with charges rarely pressed in anything but extreme cases .
and even then , they are often waived if the family concerned agrees to counseling or other supportive measures .
so if the law is not actively used as a tool to prevent smacking , just how serious is the problem ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : happy days with the parents a comprehensive report published three years after the introduction of the act , indicates that 60 percent of germans think it acceptable to raise a hand to their children every now and then .
and while that figure seems high , barbara ammer , managing director of the alliance for children against violence , says there are definite signs of a shift away from physically abusive parenting .
" society is changing , but the process is slow .
since the law came into force , awareness about a non-violent upbringing has increased and the idea of non-violent education is becoming more important in society , " ammer said .
idealism versus realism but ideals are not always representative of reality and lotte knoller of the child protection centre in berlin says a problem she frequently encounters among the parents she counsels is an grave uncertainty about just how to set about child-rearing .
" when it comes to education , germany is in a gray zone somewhere between a laissez-faire and a rigid attitude .
parents don ’ t know how to earn the respect of their children . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parenting can be a case of fumbling in the dark ammer too , says that while communicative , almost discursive parenting techniques are fine in theory , they don ’ t always provide children with the restrictions they need .
the consequence is unruly behavior with which modern parents are often ill-equipped to deal .
" interestingly , although the birth rate is in decline , sales of education self-helps books is on the increase , " ammer said .
" changing values in our society are making people insecure .
authority has been replaced by communication , and parents are more reluctant to establish boundaries and make rules . "
putting children first society may be changing , but the need among willful young children to know where they stand , is not .
and that is where the act for non-violent education comes back into play .
whatever its restrictions in practical terms , it serves the purpose of raising an awareness of the difference between acceptable and non-acceptable child-rearing , and perhaps more importantly of letting parents know that there is help at hand when the going gets too tough .
as much as anything , it operates like a campaign to make germany , often viewed to be child-unfriendly , realize the value of investing time , effort and warmth into nurturing its younger generation .

germany 's new coalition has already set out plans to build on the current policy of a child ’ s right to a non-violent education .
by way of contrast , a new study shows smacking to be widely accepted in germany . in a survey , commissioned by the berliner zeitung newspaper , 36 percent of those asked said they believe that smacking children is justifiable , with a further 28 percent deeming it acceptable to raise a hand in exceptional circumstances .
only one third expressed outright rejection of the practice as an educational tool .
this latest round of controversy , in what is a long-running and ever-evolving issue in many european countries , was sparked by berlin ’ s chief public prosecutor , hansjürgen karge , who recently went down on record as saying : " i am not seeking to introduce corporal punishment , but i won ’ t have anyone stop me from giving an occasional smack . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what is the best way to discipline a child ?
his comment has drawn a sense of general incredulity from both sides of the fence , with child protection agencies damning the practice as humiliating for the child involved and slamming the man who publicly condoned it as misguided , and well-worn parents claiming that an occasional smack is a far cry from violence , and can be incredibly helpful .
" i think a smack on the bottom is okay , but it ’ s important that it is spontaneous and that the children know what it is about and know that they did something very wrong .
it ’ s like with medicine , a few drops can be very effective , but too much is poison , " said mother of two , johanna weske .
violence against children " inadmissible " but the fact is , that since the introduction in 2000 of the outlawing violence in education act , smacking a child is out of bounds .
the law declares corporal punishment , psychological injury and other demeaning forms of educating children as " inadmissible . "
yet that said , enforcement of the legislation is a sketchy business , with charges rarely pressed in anything but extreme cases .
and even then , they are often waived if the family concerned agrees to counseling or other supportive measures .
so if the law is not actively used as a tool to prevent smacking , just how serious is the problem ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : happy days with the parents a comprehensive report published three years after the introduction of the act , indicates that 60 percent of germans think it acceptable to raise a hand to their children every now and then .
and while that figure seems high , barbara ammer , managing director of the alliance for children against violence , says there are definite signs of a shift away from physically abusive parenting .
" society is changing , but the process is slow .
since the law came into force , awareness about a non-violent upbringing has increased and the idea of non-violent education is becoming more important in society , " ammer said .
idealism versus realism but ideals are not always representative of reality and lotte knoller of the child protection centre in berlin says a problem she frequently encounters among the parents she counsels is an grave uncertainty about just how to set about child-rearing .
" when it comes to education , germany is in a gray zone somewhere between a laissez-faire and a rigid attitude .
parents don ’ t know how to earn the respect of their children . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parenting can be a case of fumbling in the dark ammer too , says that while communicative , almost discursive parenting techniques are fine in theory , they don ’ t always provide children with the restrictions they need .
the consequence is unruly behavior with which modern parents are often ill-equipped to deal .
" interestingly , although the birth rate is in decline , sales of education self-helps books is on the increase , " ammer said .
" changing values in our society are making people insecure .
authority has been replaced by communication , and parents are more reluctant to establish boundaries and make rules . "
putting children first society may be changing , but the need among willful young children to know where they stand , is not .
and that is where the act for non-violent education comes back into play .
whatever its restrictions in practical terms , it serves the purpose of raising an awareness of the difference between acceptable and non-acceptable child-rearing , and perhaps more importantly of letting parents know that there is help at hand when the going gets too tough .
as much as anything , it operates like a campaign to make germany , often viewed to be child-unfriendly , realize the value of investing time , effort and warmth into nurturing its younger generation .
ammer says the ultimate aim is to " encourage people to put children at the center of our society .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 21.11.2005 germany prepares for new era with female chancellor großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel is about to take on the heavy mantle of leadership angela merkel is expected to become german chancellor after a parliamentary vote on tuesday .
she will lead an unwieldy coalition of the left and right whose main task will be getting the german economy moving again . she is not an especially charismatic woman , this former physicist who grew up in communist east germany .
she does n't come across as a natural leader who grabs hold of life with gusto .
in fact , when asked once in an interview how she would spend three days if she could do anything she wanted , she replied she would tidy up her apartment and get her book collection in order . but angela merkel has been underestimated time and time again , and in her political career , she has always emerged on top , often leaving much more experienced , usually male politicians in the dust .
she has skyrocketed to the top of her party in near record time - she only entered politics after the fall of the berlin wall - as a childless , protestant woman from the east in a party dominated by catholic family men from western germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel 's future was in question for a while after sept .
18 she did n't flinch in the difficult weeks after her party 's poor showing in the sept .
18 election , during which there were calls for her to step aside . now , germany is preparing to watch as she is voted by the german parliament , the bundestag , as the country 's first female leader , and its first leader from the east . although she is stepping into the history books tomorrow when she gets the keys to the chancellery , any honeymoon period , if there is one , is not likely to last long .
she has a raft of difficult decisions to make as she takes over from seven years of outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democratic-green government .
many of those decisions are not going to please the public . red-green legacy even as schröder cleans out his desk , judgments are being passed on the legacy of seven years of his " red-green " government , so named because of the colors associated with the coalition 's two parties . it is a mixed report card , with many on the left upset at social welfare reforms that hurt the poor , those on the right and business interests giving him poor marks for his unwillingness to put through far-reaching changes they say are necessary . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder has said he will resign from parliament , even though he 's entitled to a seat over the weekend , in what was schröder 's last public speech as german leader , he said he hoped his time in office would be remembered for his government 's strong foreign policy stance -lrb- he refused to support the us-led war in iraq , severely bruising transatlantic relations -rrb- , and the domestic reforms , which he said struck a balance between oiling the economy and protecting the weakest in society . but merkel is inheriting a germany suffering from high-unemployment , currently at 11.6 percent , a ballooning budget deficit and anemic economic growth , less than 1 percent this year and forecast to be just slightly higher in 2006 .
while germany was once the economic locomotive of europe , today it 's more akin to the caboose . government program in the coalition agreement , the two partners have pledged to enact a multi-billion-euro investment program , to loosen some job protection rules to encourage companies to hire and to increase the vat tax by three percentage points in 2007 to cut down the deficit . on this last point , she has already come under criticism by economists , who question the wisdom of increasing a consumption tax at a time when consumer spending is the achilles ' heel of the german economy . she has to hope that the german populace will be forgiving as she works to enact deeper , and more painful reforms than her predecessor -lrb- although not as deep as she would like to , since she has to govern with the spd -rrb- .
she appears to think they will be understanding if they see that the reforms are cutting the jobless rate and helping them in the long run . " will we ensure that by 2009 people say ' yes , for me personally it 's a bit better than in 2005 ' ? "
merkel said before signing the coalition agreement .
she said the agreement offered germany the chance of achieving that goal . no " iron lady " much has been made , especially abroad , of the fact that merkel is a woman and there have been the inevitable comparisons to the uk 's margaret thatcher , who is credited with aggressively remaking the british economy , although many questioned her methods . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : margaret thatcher had more room to maneuver than merkel does due to constraints placed on her by her coalition partners , it is very unlikely that she will become a sort of " eiserne frau " after the model of the " iron lady , " as thatcher was nicknamed . however , there is at least one factor that could help her get her way .
her coalition enjoys an overwhelming majority in the parliament , 448 of the 614 seats in the lower house .
the two parties also dominate the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , which means that the new government will be able to enact reforms in the federal system , pensions and taxes without fear of a veto . the fact that the upper house was in conservative hands during the schröder era proved to be a major hindrance to that government . convincing the public one of her greatest challenges will be bringing the public around to the idea that change is needed to germany to retain the high standard of living it has enjoyed for decades .
for a german public highly resistant to change , this has been a bitter pill to swallow . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and spd chief matthias platzeck are standing shoulder to shoulder , for now still , she and the new head of the social democrats , matthias platzeck , have presented a united face to the public regarding reforms .
the fact that both of them hail from in the east - platzeck is from potsdam - gives them something of an outsider 's perspective on things , and could prove beneficial since they did not grow up with many of the material benefits of west germany or with a sense of entitlement .
they are both former scientists , analytical and pragmatic and have proven in the past they are not afraid to tell it like it is , even if the news is unpleasant . platzeck won the support of the population of the state of brandenburg with his straight talk about the dire economic situation there .
the population found it refreshing .
merkel and platzeck can only hope that will apply on a national level as well . still , they have a lot of persuading to do .
polls show that a majority of the public does not expect the grand coalition to last for four years . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de experts say merkel will bring change in style , not policy for us germany finally has a coalition deal , paving the way for angela merkel to become chancellor .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 21.11.2005 germany prepares for new era with female chancellor großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel is about to take on the heavy mantle of leadership angela merkel is expected to become german chancellor after a parliamentary vote on tuesday .
she will lead an unwieldy coalition of the left and right whose main task will be getting the german economy moving again . she is not an especially charismatic woman , this former physicist who grew up in communist east germany .
she does n't come across as a natural leader who grabs hold of life with gusto .
in fact , when asked once in an interview how she would spend three days if she could do anything she wanted , she replied she would tidy up her apartment and get her book collection in order . but angela merkel has been underestimated time and time again , and in her political career , she has always emerged on top , often leaving much more experienced , usually male politicians in the dust .
she has skyrocketed to the top of her party in near record time - she only entered politics after the fall of the berlin wall - as a childless , protestant woman from the east in a party dominated by catholic family men from western germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel 's future was in question for a while after sept .
18 she did n't flinch in the difficult weeks after her party 's poor showing in the sept .
18 election , during which there were calls for her to step aside . now , germany is preparing to watch as she is voted by the german parliament , the bundestag , as the country 's first female leader , and its first leader from the east . although she is stepping into the history books tomorrow when she gets the keys to the chancellery , any honeymoon period , if there is one , is not likely to last long .
she has a raft of difficult decisions to make as she takes over from seven years of outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democratic-green government .
many of those decisions are not going to please the public . red-green legacy even as schröder cleans out his desk , judgments are being passed on the legacy of seven years of his " red-green " government , so named because of the colors associated with the coalition 's two parties . it is a mixed report card , with many on the left upset at social welfare reforms that hurt the poor , those on the right and business interests giving him poor marks for his unwillingness to put through far-reaching changes they say are necessary . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder has said he will resign from parliament , even though he 's entitled to a seat over the weekend , in what was schröder 's last public speech as german leader , he said he hoped his time in office would be remembered for his government 's strong foreign policy stance -lrb- he refused to support the us-led war in iraq , severely bruising transatlantic relations -rrb- , and the domestic reforms , which he said struck a balance between oiling the economy and protecting the weakest in society . but merkel is inheriting a germany suffering from high-unemployment , currently at 11.6 percent , a ballooning budget deficit and anemic economic growth , less than 1 percent this year and forecast to be just slightly higher in 2006 .
while germany was once the economic locomotive of europe , today it 's more akin to the caboose . government program in the coalition agreement , the two partners have pledged to enact a multi-billion-euro investment program , to loosen some job protection rules to encourage companies to hire and to increase the vat tax by three percentage points in 2007 to cut down the deficit . on this last point , she has already come under criticism by economists , who question the wisdom of increasing a consumption tax at a time when consumer spending is the achilles ' heel of the german economy . she has to hope that the german populace will be forgiving as she works to enact deeper , and more painful reforms than her predecessor -lrb- although not as deep as she would like to , since she has to govern with the spd -rrb- .
she appears to think they will be understanding if they see that the reforms are cutting the jobless rate and helping them in the long run . " will we ensure that by 2009 people say ' yes , for me personally it 's a bit better than in 2005 ' ? "
merkel said before signing the coalition agreement .
she said the agreement offered germany the chance of achieving that goal . no " iron lady " much has been made , especially abroad , of the fact that merkel is a woman and there have been the inevitable comparisons to the uk 's margaret thatcher , who is credited with aggressively remaking the british economy , although many questioned her methods . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : margaret thatcher had more room to maneuver than merkel does due to constraints placed on her by her coalition partners , it is very unlikely that she will become a sort of " eiserne frau " after the model of the " iron lady , " as thatcher was nicknamed . however , there is at least one factor that could help her get her way .

coca-cola 's decision has not only riled the ok but also soccer 's world governing body fifa which has praised germany over its commitment to green projects including improved public transportation and energy saving incentives .
fifa is expected to rule against the us company 's intended use of plastic receptacles over biodegradable paper cups at a meeting at the start of 2006 . the coca-cola group , however , seems unlikely to budge . " we place great value on the bottles " said a group spokesperson in a statement which did not deal with the stand-off directly . the german government 's environment ministry is also reported to be dismayed by the possible use of throwaway plastic bottles , saying that the use of such drink containers at the world cup next summer could turn the showpiece tournament into a " garbage orgy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the environment ministry could kick the " green goal " initiative into touch .
the ministry is also threatening to distance itself from the " green goal " initiative if coca-cola is allowed to sell plastic bottles at the world cup . a question of security has also been raised .
full bottles could be thrown or used to transport liquids other than the intended coke into the stadiums . coca-cola has responded to such fears by saying that its plastic bottles would be sold without lids inside the grounds only .
opponents of the plan believe the security aspect alone is enough for fifa to refuse coca-cola 's proposal . most bundesliga stadiums in germany already operate an environmentally friendly system where drinking receptacles are either made from reinforced paper or are designed to be re-used . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de soccer world cup aims to cut emissions world cup organizers have stressed that the 2006 tournament in germany will be eco-friendly .

police also cleared a blockade of 160 tractors near the town of klein gusborn on the last leg of the 600-kilometer -lrb- 370-mile -rrb- odyssey , where more than 600 people joined the protest following demonstrations throughout the weekend . in the town of harlingen , police removed 150 activists performing a sit-in on the tracks and detained 23 .
authorities had to forcibly clear the blockade , with more than 70 of the tractors seized and taken to a nearby field .
some 15,000 officers had been mobilized on the german side to secure the passage of the train . the coalition of activists argues that the shipments are dangerous and that their lengthy storage could allow radioactive material to seep into the water supply in the region .

21 , 2005 , the dayton agreement ended the war in bosnia and herzegovina that left 250,000 people dead and 2 million displaced .
but the treaty did n't create a fair peace , according to dw 's fabian schmidt . the dayton agreement was good because it put an end to the human suffering and to the siege of sarajevo .
it was good because it created the basis for the return of refugees , for free elections , for democratic institutions and for economic recovery . it was good because it gave nato the mandate to apply the treaty with force - if necessary .
dayton also made possible the development of inter-ethnic and inter-religious dialogue .
it created the preconditions for coming to terms with the past , particularly through identification of the victims of mass killings and war , and by giving the international war crimes tribunal 's access to the sites where the horrors took place . but dayton was not fair .
it created the basis for an illogical peace .
in contrast to postwar germany , there was no " de-nazification " in bosnia-herzegovina .
dayton was an attempt to build democracy upon the quagmire of national hatred .
the treaty rewarded those who had waged war .
it recognized the republika srpska as an entity with individual statehood , a republic whose very existence was based on rape and mass killings . time for a n ew co n stitutio n dayton created the foundation for parliament and governments to be formed according to ethnic quotas .
it allowed ethnic and religious segregation in schools to become the order of the day .
even today , the nationalistic parties that waged war against each other are still in power in bosnia and herzegovina . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us secretary of state warren christopher -lrb- center -rrb- , bosnia 's izetbegovic -lrb- left -rrb- and croatia 's tudjman in dayton but above all , the dayton agreement gave the country an inefficient administrative structure .
the country with its two entities , 10 cantons , one district and a central government has 14 parliaments and governments for only 4 million inhabitants .
bosnia and herzegovina 's constitution is not the result of self-determination .
it was signed in dayton by two foreign heads of state - serbian and croatian presidents slobodan milosevic and franjo tudjman - and by bosnian president alija izetbegovic . it 's time that bosnia and herzegovina got its own , new constitution that can pave the way to europe and shed the burden of ethnic division .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 21.11.2005 germany prepares for new era with female chancellor großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel is about to take on the heavy mantle of leadership angela merkel is expected to become german chancellor after a parliamentary vote on tuesday .
she will lead an unwieldy coalition of the left and right whose main task will be getting the german economy moving again . she is not an especially charismatic woman , this former physicist who grew up in communist east germany .
she does n't come across as a natural leader who grabs hold of life with gusto .
in fact , when asked once in an interview how she would spend three days if she could do anything she wanted , she replied she would tidy up her apartment and get her book collection in order . but angela merkel has been underestimated time and time again , and in her political career , she has always emerged on top , often leaving much more experienced , usually male politicians in the dust .
she has skyrocketed to the top of her party in near record time - she only entered politics after the fall of the berlin wall - as a childless , protestant woman from the east in a party dominated by catholic family men from western germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel 's future was in question for a while after sept .
18 she did n't flinch in the difficult weeks after her party 's poor showing in the sept .
18 election , during which there were calls for her to step aside . now , germany is preparing to watch as she is voted by the german parliament , the bundestag , as the country 's first female leader , and its first leader from the east . although she is stepping into the history books tomorrow when she gets the keys to the chancellery , any honeymoon period , if there is one , is not likely to last long .
she has a raft of difficult decisions to make as she takes over from seven years of outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democratic-green government .
many of those decisions are not going to please the public . red-green legacy even as schröder cleans out his desk , judgments are being passed on the legacy of seven years of his " red-green " government , so named because of the colors associated with the coalition 's two parties . it is a mixed report card , with many on the left upset at social welfare reforms that hurt the poor , those on the right and business interests giving him poor marks for his unwillingness to put through far-reaching changes they say are necessary . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder has said he will resign from parliament , even though he 's entitled to a seat over the weekend , in what was schröder 's last public speech as german leader , he said he hoped his time in office would be remembered for his government 's strong foreign policy stance -lrb- he refused to support the us-led war in iraq , severely bruising transatlantic relations -rrb- , and the domestic reforms , which he said struck a balance between oiling the economy and protecting the weakest in society . but merkel is inheriting a germany suffering from high-unemployment , currently at 11.6 percent , a ballooning budget deficit and anemic economic growth , less than 1 percent this year and forecast to be just slightly higher in 2006 .
while germany was once the economic locomotive of europe , today it 's more akin to the caboose . government program in the coalition agreement , the two partners have pledged to enact a multi-billion-euro investment program , to loosen some job protection rules to encourage companies to hire and to increase the vat tax by three percentage points in 2007 to cut down the deficit . on this last point , she has already come under criticism by economists , who question the wisdom of increasing a consumption tax at a time when consumer spending is the achilles ' heel of the german economy . she has to hope that the german populace will be forgiving as she works to enact deeper , and more painful reforms than her predecessor -lrb- although not as deep as she would like to , since she has to govern with the spd -rrb- .
she appears to think they will be understanding if they see that the reforms are cutting the jobless rate and helping them in the long run . " will we ensure that by 2009 people say ' yes , for me personally it 's a bit better than in 2005 ' ? "
merkel said before signing the coalition agreement .
she said the agreement offered germany the chance of achieving that goal . no " iron lady " much has been made , especially abroad , of the fact that merkel is a woman and there have been the inevitable comparisons to the uk 's margaret thatcher , who is credited with aggressively remaking the british economy , although many questioned her methods . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : margaret thatcher had more room to maneuver than merkel does due to constraints placed on her by her coalition partners , it is very unlikely that she will become a sort of " eiserne frau " after the model of the " iron lady , " as thatcher was nicknamed . however , there is at least one factor that could help her get her way .
her coalition enjoys an overwhelming majority in the parliament , 448 of the 614 seats in the lower house .
the two parties also dominate the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , which means that the new government will be able to enact reforms in the federal system , pensions and taxes without fear of a veto . the fact that the upper house was in conservative hands during the schröder era proved to be a major hindrance to that government . convincing the public one of her greatest challenges will be bringing the public around to the idea that change is needed to germany to retain the high standard of living it has enjoyed for decades .
for a german public highly resistant to change , this has been a bitter pill to swallow . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and spd chief matthias platzeck are standing shoulder to shoulder , for now still , she and the new head of the social democrats , matthias platzeck , have presented a united face to the public regarding reforms .
the fact that both of them hail from in the east - platzeck is from potsdam - gives them something of an outsider 's perspective on things , and could prove beneficial since they did not grow up with many of the material benefits of west germany or with a sense of entitlement .
they are both former scientists , analytical and pragmatic and have proven in the past they are not afraid to tell it like it is , even if the news is unpleasant . platzeck won the support of the population of the state of brandenburg with his straight talk about the dire economic situation there .
the population found it refreshing .
merkel and platzeck can only hope that will apply on a national level as well . still , they have a lot of persuading to do .

the federal government of gerhard schröder , which is leaving office on tuesday , will pick up one-third of the cost . the sale was agreed up on in a secret meeting of the federal security council .
even outgoing foreign minister joschka fischer , a member of the once-pacifist green party , agreed to the sale .
however , he will not sign the agreement himself on monday , but is sending a deputy . germany , which is a staunch supporter of israel , had already given two dolphin submarines to the israeli navy after the gulf war in the early 1990s .
the navy later bought a third at a greatly reduced price .
schröder 's government had long been hesitant about selling additional subs to israel , fearing that the country might arm them with nuclear weapons and further threaten middle east stability . i n itial resista n ce the news reports say germany had long resisted supplying the new submarines at a reduced price .
israeli security sources confirmed that questions over the price tag had delayed the sale , according to reuters . the new submarines will be outfitted with fuel cell engines that will allow them to remain submerged for weeks at a time .
they will be constructed in the baltic sea coastal city of kiel . the sale will be the second major and long-delayed arms sale that the schröder government is completing in its final month in office .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 21.11.2005 iran talks tough ahead of un nuclear meeting großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's president has said the nuclear program will go ahead ahead of a meeting of the un 's atomic agency , iran is refusing to bow to demands for more transparency in its nuclear program .
but former president khatami encouraged germany to continue its leading role in negotiations . iran has threatened tough retaliation if it is referred to the un security council because of its atomic program .
its conservative-controlled parliament gave preliminary backing to a bill that would oblige the government to " stop voluntary and non-legally binding measures and implement its scientific , research and executive programmes " if the iranian case is taken up in new york . the text does not refer to specific forms of retaliation , but counter-measures could encompass a refusal to adhere to the additional protocol of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty , which gives increased inspection powers to the international atomic energy agency . the protocol , signed by the previous reformist government but not ratified by deputies , is seen as being crucial to an iaea probe into allegations that iran is using an atomic energy drive as a cover for weapons development . the threat of retaliation could also include an end to iran 's freeze of ultra-sensitive uranium enrichment - a process used to make reactor fuel but which can also make the explosive core of a nuclear weapon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gholamreza aghazadeh is vice president and head of iran 's nuclear program top iranian officials , who maintain the nuclear drive is for strictly peaceful purposes only , have already threatened such retaliation if iran is referred to the security council . the move by parliament is seen as a means for iran to reinforce such warnings , and the bill is subject to further debate on tuesday - just two days ahead of the iaea meeting . military site off-limits meanwhile foreign ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi said the iaea would not be let into a suspect military site in tehran unless it provides " concrete proof " to justify an inspection . he also insisted a new report by iaea chief mohamed elbaradei does " not contain any negative points " - even if the text explicitly states that " iran 's full transparency is indispensable and overdue . " one of the iaea 's demands is to return to the lavizan-shian area in tehran , site of a physics research center that was dismantled and the ground razed before iaea inspectors paid an initial visit in june 2004 . under the npt , iran is not obliged to provide access to such sites but has allowed some access as a " confidence-building " measure . " they can not just say we want to talk to this or that person and keep on dragging out the dossier , " asefi argued . concerns the agency has uncovered suspect activity in iran yet no " smoking gun , " but concerns have been raised by tehran 's submission of a document bought on the black market describing how to make what could be the explosive core of an atom bomb . asefi said the significance of the document was being exaggerated , saying " there is no legal and rational reason to send iran 's case to the security council . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters of an iranian opposition group demonstrate in brussels iran triggered the latest crisis in august when it effectively broke off negotiations with britain , france and germany on a package of incentives for restraining its nuclear plans and resumed uranium conversion activities it had suspended a year ago . appeal to resume talks the former iranian president , mohammad khatami , urged over the weekend germany to resume talks with iran over the nuclear issue . " it is not only in the interest of the west or iran , but in that of the whole world , that the nuclear negotiations be continued until a solution is reached , " he told the iranian news agency irna in berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mohammad khatami khatami , who is seen as a moderate , is currently a guest of the hamburg-based körber foundation .
he met the foreign minister-designate , frank-walter steinmeier , on thursday and german president horst köhler on friday . because of the resumption of iran 's uranium conversion program , the eu negotiation trio cancelled talks with iran that were scheduled to take place this week in moscow . iran also announced it is to stop conversion work for 15 days but added the halt was only for brief maintenance work and not a result of international pressure and the iaea board meeting . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu studies iranian offer to resume nuclear talks the european union said monday it is studying a new iranian offer to resume talks on tehran 's disputed nuclear program , aiming to defuse an increasingly tense standoff with the islamic state .

21 , 2005 , the dayton agreement ended the war in bosnia and herzegovina that left 250,000 people dead and 2 million displaced .
but the treaty did n't create a fair peace , according to dw 's fabian schmidt . the dayton agreement was good because it put an end to the human suffering and to the siege of sarajevo .
it was good because it created the basis for the return of refugees , for free elections , for democratic institutions and for economic recovery . it was good because it gave nato the mandate to apply the treaty with force - if necessary .
dayton also made possible the development of inter-ethnic and inter-religious dialogue .
it created the preconditions for coming to terms with the past , particularly through identification of the victims of mass killings and war , and by giving the international war crimes tribunal 's access to the sites where the horrors took place . but dayton was not fair .
it created the basis for an illogical peace .
in contrast to postwar germany , there was no " de-nazification " in bosnia-herzegovina .
dayton was an attempt to build democracy upon the quagmire of national hatred .

21 , 2005 , the dayton agreement ended the war in bosnia and herzegovina that left 250,000 people dead and 2 million displaced .
but the treaty did n't create a fair peace , according to dw 's fabian schmidt . the dayton agreement was good because it put an end to the human suffering and to the siege of sarajevo .
it was good because it created the basis for the return of refugees , for free elections , for democratic institutions and for economic recovery . it was good because it gave nato the mandate to apply the treaty with force - if necessary .
dayton also made possible the development of inter-ethnic and inter-religious dialogue .
it created the preconditions for coming to terms with the past , particularly through identification of the victims of mass killings and war , and by giving the international war crimes tribunal 's access to the sites where the horrors took place . but dayton was not fair .
it created the basis for an illogical peace .
in contrast to postwar germany , there was no " de-nazification " in bosnia-herzegovina .
dayton was an attempt to build democracy upon the quagmire of national hatred .
the treaty rewarded those who had waged war .

coca-cola 's decision has not only riled the ok but also soccer 's world governing body fifa which has praised germany over its commitment to green projects including improved public transportation and energy saving incentives .
fifa is expected to rule against the us company 's intended use of plastic receptacles over biodegradable paper cups at a meeting at the start of 2006 . the coca-cola group , however , seems unlikely to budge . " we place great value on the bottles " said a group spokesperson in a statement which did not deal with the stand-off directly . the german government 's environment ministry is also reported to be dismayed by the possible use of throwaway plastic bottles , saying that the use of such drink containers at the world cup next summer could turn the showpiece tournament into a " garbage orgy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the environment ministry could kick the " green goal " initiative into touch .
the ministry is also threatening to distance itself from the " green goal " initiative if coca-cola is allowed to sell plastic bottles at the world cup . a question of security has also been raised .
full bottles could be thrown or used to transport liquids other than the intended coke into the stadiums . coca-cola has responded to such fears by saying that its plastic bottles would be sold without lids inside the grounds only .
opponents of the plan believe the security aspect alone is enough for fifa to refuse coca-cola 's proposal . most bundesliga stadiums in germany already operate an environmentally friendly system where drinking receptacles are either made from reinforced paper or are designed to be re-used . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de soccer world cup aims to cut emissions world cup organizers have stressed that the 2006 tournament in germany will be eco-friendly .

fifa is expected to rule against the us company 's intended use of plastic receptacles over biodegradable paper cups at a meeting at the start of 2006 . the coca-cola group , however , seems unlikely to budge . " we place great value on the bottles " said a group spokesperson in a statement which did not deal with the stand-off directly . the german government 's environment ministry is also reported to be dismayed by the possible use of throwaway plastic bottles , saying that the use of such drink containers at the world cup next summer could turn the showpiece tournament into a " garbage orgy .

full bottles could be thrown or used to transport liquids other than the intended coke into the stadiums . coca-cola has responded to such fears by saying that its plastic bottles would be sold without lids inside the grounds only .

germany 's new coalition has already set out plans to build on the current policy of a child ’ s right to a non-violent education .
by way of contrast , a new study shows smacking to be widely accepted in germany . in a survey , commissioned by the berliner zeitung newspaper , 36 percent of those asked said they believe that smacking children is justifiable , with a further 28 percent deeming it acceptable to raise a hand in exceptional circumstances .
only one third expressed outright rejection of the practice as an educational tool .
this latest round of controversy , in what is a long-running and ever-evolving issue in many european countries , was sparked by berlin ’ s chief public prosecutor , hansjürgen karge , who recently went down on record as saying : " i am not seeking to introduce corporal punishment , but i won ’ t have anyone stop me from giving an occasional smack . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what is the best way to discipline a child ?
his comment has drawn a sense of general incredulity from both sides of the fence , with child protection agencies damning the practice as humiliating for the child involved and slamming the man who publicly condoned it as misguided , and well-worn parents claiming that an occasional smack is a far cry from violence , and can be incredibly helpful .
" i think a smack on the bottom is okay , but it ’ s important that it is spontaneous and that the children know what it is about and know that they did something very wrong .
it ’ s like with medicine , a few drops can be very effective , but too much is poison , " said mother of two , johanna weske .
violence against children " inadmissible " but the fact is , that since the introduction in 2000 of the outlawing violence in education act , smacking a child is out of bounds .
the law declares corporal punishment , psychological injury and other demeaning forms of educating children as " inadmissible . "
yet that said , enforcement of the legislation is a sketchy business , with charges rarely pressed in anything but extreme cases .
and even then , they are often waived if the family concerned agrees to counseling or other supportive measures .
so if the law is not actively used as a tool to prevent smacking , just how serious is the problem ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : happy days with the parents a comprehensive report published three years after the introduction of the act , indicates that 60 percent of germans think it acceptable to raise a hand to their children every now and then .
and while that figure seems high , barbara ammer , managing director of the alliance for children against violence , says there are definite signs of a shift away from physically abusive parenting .
" society is changing , but the process is slow .
since the law came into force , awareness about a non-violent upbringing has increased and the idea of non-violent education is becoming more important in society , " ammer said .
idealism versus realism but ideals are not always representative of reality and lotte knoller of the child protection centre in berlin says a problem she frequently encounters among the parents she counsels is an grave uncertainty about just how to set about child-rearing .
" when it comes to education , germany is in a gray zone somewhere between a laissez-faire and a rigid attitude .
parents don ’ t know how to earn the respect of their children . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parenting can be a case of fumbling in the dark ammer too , says that while communicative , almost discursive parenting techniques are fine in theory , they don ’ t always provide children with the restrictions they need .
the consequence is unruly behavior with which modern parents are often ill-equipped to deal .
" interestingly , although the birth rate is in decline , sales of education self-helps books is on the increase , " ammer said .
" changing values in our society are making people insecure .
authority has been replaced by communication , and parents are more reluctant to establish boundaries and make rules . "
putting children first society may be changing , but the need among willful young children to know where they stand , is not .
and that is where the act for non-violent education comes back into play .
whatever its restrictions in practical terms , it serves the purpose of raising an awareness of the difference between acceptable and non-acceptable child-rearing , and perhaps more importantly of letting parents know that there is help at hand when the going gets too tough .
as much as anything , it operates like a campaign to make germany , often viewed to be child-unfriendly , realize the value of investing time , effort and warmth into nurturing its younger generation .
ammer says the ultimate aim is to " encourage people to put children at the center of our society .

germany 's new coalition has already set out plans to build on the current policy of a child ’ s right to a non-violent education .
by way of contrast , a new study shows smacking to be widely accepted in germany . in a survey , commissioned by the berliner zeitung newspaper , 36 percent of those asked said they believe that smacking children is justifiable , with a further 28 percent deeming it acceptable to raise a hand in exceptional circumstances .
only one third expressed outright rejection of the practice as an educational tool .
this latest round of controversy , in what is a long-running and ever-evolving issue in many european countries , was sparked by berlin ’ s chief public prosecutor , hansjürgen karge , who recently went down on record as saying : " i am not seeking to introduce corporal punishment , but i won ’ t have anyone stop me from giving an occasional smack . "

his comment has drawn a sense of general incredulity from both sides of the fence , with child protection agencies damning the practice as humiliating for the child involved and slamming the man who publicly condoned it as misguided , and well-worn parents claiming that an occasional smack is a far cry from violence , and can be incredibly helpful .
" i think a smack on the bottom is okay , but it ’ s important that it is spontaneous and that the children know what it is about and know that they did something very wrong .

the federal government of gerhard schröder , which is leaving office on tuesday , will pick up one-third of the cost . the sale was agreed up on in a secret meeting of the federal security council .
even outgoing foreign minister joschka fischer , a member of the once-pacifist green party , agreed to the sale .
however , he will not sign the agreement himself on monday , but is sending a deputy . germany , which is a staunch supporter of israel , had already given two dolphin submarines to the israeli navy after the gulf war in the early 1990s .
the navy later bought a third at a greatly reduced price .
schröder 's government had long been hesitant about selling additional subs to israel , fearing that the country might arm them with nuclear weapons and further threaten middle east stability . i n itial resista n ce the news reports say germany had long resisted supplying the new submarines at a reduced price .
israeli security sources confirmed that questions over the price tag had delayed the sale , according to reuters . the new submarines will be outfitted with fuel cell engines that will allow them to remain submerged for weeks at a time .
they will be constructed in the baltic sea coastal city of kiel . the sale will be the second major and long-delayed arms sale that the schröder government is completing in its final month in office .
two weeks ago , it agreed to sell 298 surplus leopard 2 battle tanks to turkey . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hu meets merkel as germany reaffirms eu arms ban chinese president hu jintao held talks friday with germany 's incoming chancellor angela merkel after members of her cabinet said they would not support chinese demands to lift an eu arms embargo .

police also cleared a blockade of 160 tractors near the town of klein gusborn on the last leg of the 600-kilometer -lrb- 370-mile -rrb- odyssey , where more than 600 people joined the protest following demonstrations throughout the weekend . in the town of harlingen , police removed 150 activists performing a sit-in on the tracks and detained 23 .
authorities had to forcibly clear the blockade , with more than 70 of the tractors seized and taken to a nearby field .
some 15,000 officers had been mobilized on the german side to secure the passage of the train . the coalition of activists argues that the shipments are dangerous and that their lengthy storage could allow radioactive material to seep into the water supply in the region . " the radioactivity of these 12 containers is two and a half times higher than that of chernobyl , " said thomas breuer , a nuclear expert with environmental watchdog greenpeace .

coca-cola 's decision has not only riled the ok but also soccer 's world governing body fifa which has praised germany over its commitment to green projects including improved public transportation and energy saving incentives .
fifa is expected to rule against the us company 's intended use of plastic receptacles over biodegradable paper cups at a meeting at the start of 2006 . the coca-cola group , however , seems unlikely to budge . " we place great value on the bottles " said a group spokesperson in a statement which did not deal with the stand-off directly . the german government 's environment ministry is also reported to be dismayed by the possible use of throwaway plastic bottles , saying that the use of such drink containers at the world cup next summer could turn the showpiece tournament into a " garbage orgy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the environment ministry could kick the " green goal " initiative into touch .
the ministry is also threatening to distance itself from the " green goal " initiative if coca-cola is allowed to sell plastic bottles at the world cup . a question of security has also been raised .
full bottles could be thrown or used to transport liquids other than the intended coke into the stadiums . coca-cola has responded to such fears by saying that its plastic bottles would be sold without lids inside the grounds only .
opponents of the plan believe the security aspect alone is enough for fifa to refuse coca-cola 's proposal . most bundesliga stadiums in germany already operate an environmentally friendly system where drinking receptacles are either made from reinforced paper or are designed to be re-used . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de soccer world cup aims to cut emissions world cup organizers have stressed that the 2006 tournament in germany will be eco-friendly .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 21.11.2005 to smack or not to smack großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what to do with an uncontrollable screaming child ?
germany 's new coalition has already set out plans to build on the current policy of a child ’ s right to a non-violent education .
by way of contrast , a new study shows smacking to be widely accepted in germany . in a survey , commissioned by the berliner zeitung newspaper , 36 percent of those asked said they believe that smacking children is justifiable , with a further 28 percent deeming it acceptable to raise a hand in exceptional circumstances .
only one third expressed outright rejection of the practice as an educational tool .
this latest round of controversy , in what is a long-running and ever-evolving issue in many european countries , was sparked by berlin ’ s chief public prosecutor , hansjürgen karge , who recently went down on record as saying : " i am not seeking to introduce corporal punishment , but i won ’ t have anyone stop me from giving an occasional smack . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what is the best way to discipline a child ?
his comment has drawn a sense of general incredulity from both sides of the fence , with child protection agencies damning the practice as humiliating for the child involved and slamming the man who publicly condoned it as misguided , and well-worn parents claiming that an occasional smack is a far cry from violence , and can be incredibly helpful .
" i think a smack on the bottom is okay , but it ’ s important that it is spontaneous and that the children know what it is about and know that they did something very wrong .
it ’ s like with medicine , a few drops can be very effective , but too much is poison , " said mother of two , johanna weske .
violence against children " inadmissible " but the fact is , that since the introduction in 2000 of the outlawing violence in education act , smacking a child is out of bounds .
the law declares corporal punishment , psychological injury and other demeaning forms of educating children as " inadmissible . "
yet that said , enforcement of the legislation is a sketchy business , with charges rarely pressed in anything but extreme cases .
and even then , they are often waived if the family concerned agrees to counseling or other supportive measures .
so if the law is not actively used as a tool to prevent smacking , just how serious is the problem ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : happy days with the parents a comprehensive report published three years after the introduction of the act , indicates that 60 percent of germans think it acceptable to raise a hand to their children every now and then .
and while that figure seems high , barbara ammer , managing director of the alliance for children against violence , says there are definite signs of a shift away from physically abusive parenting .
" society is changing , but the process is slow .
since the law came into force , awareness about a non-violent upbringing has increased and the idea of non-violent education is becoming more important in society , " ammer said .
idealism versus realism but ideals are not always representative of reality and lotte knoller of the child protection centre in berlin says a problem she frequently encounters among the parents she counsels is an grave uncertainty about just how to set about child-rearing .
" when it comes to education , germany is in a gray zone somewhere between a laissez-faire and a rigid attitude .
parents don ’ t know how to earn the respect of their children . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parenting can be a case of fumbling in the dark ammer too , says that while communicative , almost discursive parenting techniques are fine in theory , they don ’ t always provide children with the restrictions they need .
the consequence is unruly behavior with which modern parents are often ill-equipped to deal .
" interestingly , although the birth rate is in decline , sales of education self-helps books is on the increase , " ammer said .
" changing values in our society are making people insecure .
authority has been replaced by communication , and parents are more reluctant to establish boundaries and make rules . "
putting children first society may be changing , but the need among willful young children to know where they stand , is not .
and that is where the act for non-violent education comes back into play .
whatever its restrictions in practical terms , it serves the purpose of raising an awareness of the difference between acceptable and non-acceptable child-rearing , and perhaps more importantly of letting parents know that there is help at hand when the going gets too tough .
as much as anything , it operates like a campaign to make germany , often viewed to be child-unfriendly , realize the value of investing time , effort and warmth into nurturing its younger generation .
ammer says the ultimate aim is to " encourage people to put children at the center of our society .

21 , 2005 , the dayton agreement ended the war in bosnia and herzegovina that left 250,000 people dead and 2 million displaced .
but the treaty did n't create a fair peace , according to dw 's fabian schmidt . the dayton agreement was good because it put an end to the human suffering and to the siege of sarajevo .
it was good because it created the basis for the return of refugees , for free elections , for democratic institutions and for economic recovery . it was good because it gave nato the mandate to apply the treaty with force - if necessary .
dayton also made possible the development of inter-ethnic and inter-religious dialogue .
it created the preconditions for coming to terms with the past , particularly through identification of the victims of mass killings and war , and by giving the international war crimes tribunal 's access to the sites where the horrors took place . but dayton was not fair .
it created the basis for an illogical peace .
in contrast to postwar germany , there was no " de-nazification " in bosnia-herzegovina .
dayton was an attempt to build democracy upon the quagmire of national hatred .
the treaty rewarded those who had waged war .
it recognized the republika srpska as an entity with individual statehood , a republic whose very existence was based on rape and mass killings . time for a n ew co n stitutio n dayton created the foundation for parliament and governments to be formed according to ethnic quotas .
it allowed ethnic and religious segregation in schools to become the order of the day .
even today , the nationalistic parties that waged war against each other are still in power in bosnia and herzegovina . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us secretary of state warren christopher -lrb- center -rrb- , bosnia 's izetbegovic -lrb- left -rrb- and croatia 's tudjman in dayton but above all , the dayton agreement gave the country an inefficient administrative structure .
the country with its two entities , 10 cantons , one district and a central government has 14 parliaments and governments for only 4 million inhabitants .
bosnia and herzegovina 's constitution is not the result of self-determination .
it was signed in dayton by two foreign heads of state - serbian and croatian presidents slobodan milosevic and franjo tudjman - and by bosnian president alija izetbegovic . it 's time that bosnia and herzegovina got its own , new constitution that can pave the way to europe and shed the burden of ethnic division .
europe and america are ready to help .
now it 's up to the people of bosnia to recognize the opportunity and take action . fabian schmidt -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu mulls military preparedness eu defense ministers reviewed the bloc 's bosnia mission and discussed whether its forces are sufficiently equipped .

police also cleared a blockade of 160 tractors near the town of klein gusborn on the last leg of the 600-kilometer -lrb- 370-mile -rrb- odyssey , where more than 600 people joined the protest following demonstrations throughout the weekend . in the town of harlingen , police removed 150 activists performing a sit-in on the tracks and detained 23 .
authorities had to forcibly clear the blockade , with more than 70 of the tractors seized and taken to a nearby field .
some 15,000 officers had been mobilized on the german side to secure the passage of the train . the coalition of activists argues that the shipments are dangerous and that their lengthy storage could allow radioactive material to seep into the water supply in the region . " the radioactivity of these 12 containers is two and a half times higher than that of chernobyl , " said thomas breuer , a nuclear expert with environmental watchdog greenpeace .

the waste containers will be loaded onto trucks there and finish the final 20-kilometer -lrb- 12-mile -rrb- stretch of the journey .
the shipment , the ninth since 1996 , is due tuesday morning in gorleben , where there are already 56 containers of radioactive waste stored . the transports were interrupted in 1998 following a scandal over radioactive contamination on the surface of the containers .
they resumed in 2001 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers check the train carrying 12 containers of nuclear waste to germany during the last such shipment to germany in november 2004 , a french anti-nuclear activist was killed when he was run over by a train in the eastern french city of nancy . the nuclear waste is produced in power plants in germany , but sent to france because the country has no waste re-processing plants .

fifa is expected to rule against the us company 's intended use of plastic receptacles over biodegradable paper cups at a meeting at the start of 2006 . the coca-cola group , however , seems unlikely to budge . " we place great value on the bottles " said a group spokesperson in a statement which did not deal with the stand-off directly . the german government 's environment ministry is also reported to be dismayed by the possible use of throwaway plastic bottles , saying that the use of such drink containers at the world cup next summer could turn the showpiece tournament into a " garbage orgy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the environment ministry could kick the " green goal " initiative into touch .
the ministry is also threatening to distance itself from the " green goal " initiative if coca-cola is allowed to sell plastic bottles at the world cup . a question of security has also been raised .
full bottles could be thrown or used to transport liquids other than the intended coke into the stadiums . coca-cola has responded to such fears by saying that its plastic bottles would be sold without lids inside the grounds only .
opponents of the plan believe the security aspect alone is enough for fifa to refuse coca-cola 's proposal . most bundesliga stadiums in germany already operate an environmentally friendly system where drinking receptacles are either made from reinforced paper or are designed to be re-used . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de soccer world cup aims to cut emissions world cup organizers have stressed that the 2006 tournament in germany will be eco-friendly .

police also cleared a blockade of 160 tractors near the town of klein gusborn on the last leg of the 600-kilometer -lrb- 370-mile -rrb- odyssey , where more than 600 people joined the protest following demonstrations throughout the weekend . in the town of harlingen , police removed 150 activists performing a sit-in on the tracks and detained 23 .
authorities had to forcibly clear the blockade , with more than 70 of the tractors seized and taken to a nearby field .
some 15,000 officers had been mobilized on the german side to secure the passage of the train . the coalition of activists argues that the shipments are dangerous and that their lengthy storage could allow radioactive material to seep into the water supply in the region . " the radioactivity of these 12 containers is two and a half times higher than that of chernobyl , " said thomas breuer , a nuclear expert with environmental watchdog greenpeace .

the waste containers will be loaded onto trucks there and finish the final 20-kilometer -lrb- 12-mile -rrb- stretch of the journey .
the shipment , the ninth since 1996 , is due tuesday morning in gorleben , where there are already 56 containers of radioactive waste stored . the transports were interrupted in 1998 following a scandal over radioactive contamination on the surface of the containers .
they resumed in 2001 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers check the train carrying 12 containers of nuclear waste to germany during the last such shipment to germany in november 2004 , a french anti-nuclear activist was killed when he was run over by a train in the eastern french city of nancy . the nuclear waste is produced in power plants in germany , but sent to france because the country has no waste re-processing plants .

police also cleared a blockade of 160 tractors near the town of klein gusborn on the last leg of the 600-kilometer -lrb- 370-mile -rrb- odyssey , where more than 600 people joined the protest following demonstrations throughout the weekend . in the town of harlingen , police removed 150 activists performing a sit-in on the tracks and detained 23 .
authorities had to forcibly clear the blockade , with more than 70 of the tractors seized and taken to a nearby field .
some 15,000 officers had been mobilized on the german side to secure the passage of the train . the coalition of activists argues that the shipments are dangerous and that their lengthy storage could allow radioactive material to seep into the water supply in the region . " the radioactivity of these 12 containers is two and a half times higher than that of chernobyl , " said thomas breuer , a nuclear expert with environmental watchdog greenpeace .

the federal government of gerhard schröder , which is leaving office on tuesday , will pick up one-third of the cost . the sale was agreed up on in a secret meeting of the federal security council .
even outgoing foreign minister joschka fischer , a member of the once-pacifist green party , agreed to the sale .
however , he will not sign the agreement himself on monday , but is sending a deputy . germany , which is a staunch supporter of israel , had already given two dolphin submarines to the israeli navy after the gulf war in the early 1990s .
the navy later bought a third at a greatly reduced price .
schröder 's government had long been hesitant about selling additional subs to israel , fearing that the country might arm them with nuclear weapons and further threaten middle east stability . i n itial resista n ce the news reports say germany had long resisted supplying the new submarines at a reduced price .
israeli security sources confirmed that questions over the price tag had delayed the sale , according to reuters . the new submarines will be outfitted with fuel cell engines that will allow them to remain submerged for weeks at a time .
they will be constructed in the baltic sea coastal city of kiel . the sale will be the second major and long-delayed arms sale that the schröder government is completing in its final month in office .

germany 's new coalition has already set out plans to build on the current policy of a child ’ s right to a non-violent education .
by way of contrast , a new study shows smacking to be widely accepted in germany . in a survey , commissioned by the berliner zeitung newspaper , 36 percent of those asked said they believe that smacking children is justifiable , with a further 28 percent deeming it acceptable to raise a hand in exceptional circumstances .
only one third expressed outright rejection of the practice as an educational tool .
this latest round of controversy , in what is a long-running and ever-evolving issue in many european countries , was sparked by berlin ’ s chief public prosecutor , hansjürgen karge , who recently went down on record as saying : " i am not seeking to introduce corporal punishment , but i won ’ t have anyone stop me from giving an occasional smack . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what is the best way to discipline a child ?
his comment has drawn a sense of general incredulity from both sides of the fence , with child protection agencies damning the practice as humiliating for the child involved and slamming the man who publicly condoned it as misguided , and well-worn parents claiming that an occasional smack is a far cry from violence , and can be incredibly helpful .
" i think a smack on the bottom is okay , but it ’ s important that it is spontaneous and that the children know what it is about and know that they did something very wrong .
it ’ s like with medicine , a few drops can be very effective , but too much is poison , " said mother of two , johanna weske .
violence against children " inadmissible " but the fact is , that since the introduction in 2000 of the outlawing violence in education act , smacking a child is out of bounds .
the law declares corporal punishment , psychological injury and other demeaning forms of educating children as " inadmissible . "
yet that said , enforcement of the legislation is a sketchy business , with charges rarely pressed in anything but extreme cases .
and even then , they are often waived if the family concerned agrees to counseling or other supportive measures .
so if the law is not actively used as a tool to prevent smacking , just how serious is the problem ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : happy days with the parents a comprehensive report published three years after the introduction of the act , indicates that 60 percent of germans think it acceptable to raise a hand to their children every now and then .
and while that figure seems high , barbara ammer , managing director of the alliance for children against violence , says there are definite signs of a shift away from physically abusive parenting .
" society is changing , but the process is slow .
since the law came into force , awareness about a non-violent upbringing has increased and the idea of non-violent education is becoming more important in society , " ammer said .
idealism versus realism but ideals are not always representative of reality and lotte knoller of the child protection centre in berlin says a problem she frequently encounters among the parents she counsels is an grave uncertainty about just how to set about child-rearing .
" when it comes to education , germany is in a gray zone somewhere between a laissez-faire and a rigid attitude .
parents don ’ t know how to earn the respect of their children . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parenting can be a case of fumbling in the dark ammer too , says that while communicative , almost discursive parenting techniques are fine in theory , they don ’ t always provide children with the restrictions they need .
the consequence is unruly behavior with which modern parents are often ill-equipped to deal .
" interestingly , although the birth rate is in decline , sales of education self-helps books is on the increase , " ammer said .
" changing values in our society are making people insecure .
authority has been replaced by communication , and parents are more reluctant to establish boundaries and make rules . "
putting children first society may be changing , but the need among willful young children to know where they stand , is not .
and that is where the act for non-violent education comes back into play .
whatever its restrictions in practical terms , it serves the purpose of raising an awareness of the difference between acceptable and non-acceptable child-rearing , and perhaps more importantly of letting parents know that there is help at hand when the going gets too tough .
as much as anything , it operates like a campaign to make germany , often viewed to be child-unfriendly , realize the value of investing time , effort and warmth into nurturing its younger generation .

germany 's new coalition has already set out plans to build on the current policy of a child ’ s right to a non-violent education .
by way of contrast , a new study shows smacking to be widely accepted in germany . in a survey , commissioned by the berliner zeitung newspaper , 36 percent of those asked said they believe that smacking children is justifiable , with a further 28 percent deeming it acceptable to raise a hand in exceptional circumstances .
only one third expressed outright rejection of the practice as an educational tool .
this latest round of controversy , in what is a long-running and ever-evolving issue in many european countries , was sparked by berlin ’ s chief public prosecutor , hansjürgen karge , who recently went down on record as saying : " i am not seeking to introduce corporal punishment , but i won ’ t have anyone stop me from giving an occasional smack . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what is the best way to discipline a child ?
his comment has drawn a sense of general incredulity from both sides of the fence , with child protection agencies damning the practice as humiliating for the child involved and slamming the man who publicly condoned it as misguided , and well-worn parents claiming that an occasional smack is a far cry from violence , and can be incredibly helpful .
" i think a smack on the bottom is okay , but it ’ s important that it is spontaneous and that the children know what it is about and know that they did something very wrong .
it ’ s like with medicine , a few drops can be very effective , but too much is poison , " said mother of two , johanna weske .
violence against children " inadmissible " but the fact is , that since the introduction in 2000 of the outlawing violence in education act , smacking a child is out of bounds .
the law declares corporal punishment , psychological injury and other demeaning forms of educating children as " inadmissible . "
yet that said , enforcement of the legislation is a sketchy business , with charges rarely pressed in anything but extreme cases .
and even then , they are often waived if the family concerned agrees to counseling or other supportive measures .
so if the law is not actively used as a tool to prevent smacking , just how serious is the problem ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : happy days with the parents a comprehensive report published three years after the introduction of the act , indicates that 60 percent of germans think it acceptable to raise a hand to their children every now and then .
and while that figure seems high , barbara ammer , managing director of the alliance for children against violence , says there are definite signs of a shift away from physically abusive parenting .
" society is changing , but the process is slow .
since the law came into force , awareness about a non-violent upbringing has increased and the idea of non-violent education is becoming more important in society , " ammer said .
idealism versus realism but ideals are not always representative of reality and lotte knoller of the child protection centre in berlin says a problem she frequently encounters among the parents she counsels is an grave uncertainty about just how to set about child-rearing .
" when it comes to education , germany is in a gray zone somewhere between a laissez-faire and a rigid attitude .
parents don ’ t know how to earn the respect of their children . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parenting can be a case of fumbling in the dark ammer too , says that while communicative , almost discursive parenting techniques are fine in theory , they don ’ t always provide children with the restrictions they need .
the consequence is unruly behavior with which modern parents are often ill-equipped to deal .
" interestingly , although the birth rate is in decline , sales of education self-helps books is on the increase , " ammer said .
" changing values in our society are making people insecure .
authority has been replaced by communication , and parents are more reluctant to establish boundaries and make rules . "
putting children first society may be changing , but the need among willful young children to know where they stand , is not .
and that is where the act for non-violent education comes back into play .
whatever its restrictions in practical terms , it serves the purpose of raising an awareness of the difference between acceptable and non-acceptable child-rearing , and perhaps more importantly of letting parents know that there is help at hand when the going gets too tough .
as much as anything , it operates like a campaign to make germany , often viewed to be child-unfriendly , realize the value of investing time , effort and warmth into nurturing its younger generation .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 21.11.2005 to smack or not to smack großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what to do with an uncontrollable screaming child ?
germany 's new coalition has already set out plans to build on the current policy of a child ’ s right to a non-violent education .
by way of contrast , a new study shows smacking to be widely accepted in germany . in a survey , commissioned by the berliner zeitung newspaper , 36 percent of those asked said they believe that smacking children is justifiable , with a further 28 percent deeming it acceptable to raise a hand in exceptional circumstances .
only one third expressed outright rejection of the practice as an educational tool .
this latest round of controversy , in what is a long-running and ever-evolving issue in many european countries , was sparked by berlin ’ s chief public prosecutor , hansjürgen karge , who recently went down on record as saying : " i am not seeking to introduce corporal punishment , but i won ’ t have anyone stop me from giving an occasional smack . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what is the best way to discipline a child ?
his comment has drawn a sense of general incredulity from both sides of the fence , with child protection agencies damning the practice as humiliating for the child involved and slamming the man who publicly condoned it as misguided , and well-worn parents claiming that an occasional smack is a far cry from violence , and can be incredibly helpful .
" i think a smack on the bottom is okay , but it ’ s important that it is spontaneous and that the children know what it is about and know that they did something very wrong .
it ’ s like with medicine , a few drops can be very effective , but too much is poison , " said mother of two , johanna weske .
violence against children " inadmissible " but the fact is , that since the introduction in 2000 of the outlawing violence in education act , smacking a child is out of bounds .
the law declares corporal punishment , psychological injury and other demeaning forms of educating children as " inadmissible . "
yet that said , enforcement of the legislation is a sketchy business , with charges rarely pressed in anything but extreme cases .
and even then , they are often waived if the family concerned agrees to counseling or other supportive measures .
so if the law is not actively used as a tool to prevent smacking , just how serious is the problem ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : happy days with the parents a comprehensive report published three years after the introduction of the act , indicates that 60 percent of germans think it acceptable to raise a hand to their children every now and then .
and while that figure seems high , barbara ammer , managing director of the alliance for children against violence , says there are definite signs of a shift away from physically abusive parenting .
" society is changing , but the process is slow .
since the law came into force , awareness about a non-violent upbringing has increased and the idea of non-violent education is becoming more important in society , " ammer said .
idealism versus realism but ideals are not always representative of reality and lotte knoller of the child protection centre in berlin says a problem she frequently encounters among the parents she counsels is an grave uncertainty about just how to set about child-rearing .
" when it comes to education , germany is in a gray zone somewhere between a laissez-faire and a rigid attitude .
parents don ’ t know how to earn the respect of their children . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parenting can be a case of fumbling in the dark ammer too , says that while communicative , almost discursive parenting techniques are fine in theory , they don ’ t always provide children with the restrictions they need .
the consequence is unruly behavior with which modern parents are often ill-equipped to deal .
" interestingly , although the birth rate is in decline , sales of education self-helps books is on the increase , " ammer said .
" changing values in our society are making people insecure .
authority has been replaced by communication , and parents are more reluctant to establish boundaries and make rules . "
putting children first society may be changing , but the need among willful young children to know where they stand , is not .
and that is where the act for non-violent education comes back into play .
whatever its restrictions in practical terms , it serves the purpose of raising an awareness of the difference between acceptable and non-acceptable child-rearing , and perhaps more importantly of letting parents know that there is help at hand when the going gets too tough .
as much as anything , it operates like a campaign to make germany , often viewed to be child-unfriendly , realize the value of investing time , effort and warmth into nurturing its younger generation .
ammer says the ultimate aim is to " encourage people to put children at the center of our society .

the federal government of gerhard schröder , which is leaving office on tuesday , will pick up one-third of the cost . the sale was agreed up on in a secret meeting of the federal security council .
even outgoing foreign minister joschka fischer , a member of the once-pacifist green party , agreed to the sale .
however , he will not sign the agreement himself on monday , but is sending a deputy . germany , which is a staunch supporter of israel , had already given two dolphin submarines to the israeli navy after the gulf war in the early 1990s .
the navy later bought a third at a greatly reduced price .
schröder 's government had long been hesitant about selling additional subs to israel , fearing that the country might arm them with nuclear weapons and further threaten middle east stability . i n itial resista n ce the news reports say germany had long resisted supplying the new submarines at a reduced price .
israeli security sources confirmed that questions over the price tag had delayed the sale , according to reuters . the new submarines will be outfitted with fuel cell engines that will allow them to remain submerged for weeks at a time .
they will be constructed in the baltic sea coastal city of kiel . the sale will be the second major and long-delayed arms sale that the schröder government is completing in its final month in office .

21 , 2005 , the dayton agreement ended the war in bosnia and herzegovina that left 250,000 people dead and 2 million displaced .
but the treaty did n't create a fair peace , according to dw 's fabian schmidt . the dayton agreement was good because it put an end to the human suffering and to the siege of sarajevo .
it was good because it created the basis for the return of refugees , for free elections , for democratic institutions and for economic recovery . it was good because it gave nato the mandate to apply the treaty with force - if necessary .
dayton also made possible the development of inter-ethnic and inter-religious dialogue .
it created the preconditions for coming to terms with the past , particularly through identification of the victims of mass killings and war , and by giving the international war crimes tribunal 's access to the sites where the horrors took place . but dayton was not fair .
it created the basis for an illogical peace .
in contrast to postwar germany , there was no " de-nazification " in bosnia-herzegovina .
dayton was an attempt to build democracy upon the quagmire of national hatred .
the treaty rewarded those who had waged war .
it recognized the republika srpska as an entity with individual statehood , a republic whose very existence was based on rape and mass killings . time for a n ew co n stitutio n dayton created the foundation for parliament and governments to be formed according to ethnic quotas .
it allowed ethnic and religious segregation in schools to become the order of the day .
even today , the nationalistic parties that waged war against each other are still in power in bosnia and herzegovina . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us secretary of state warren christopher -lrb- center -rrb- , bosnia 's izetbegovic -lrb- left -rrb- and croatia 's tudjman in dayton but above all , the dayton agreement gave the country an inefficient administrative structure .
the country with its two entities , 10 cantons , one district and a central government has 14 parliaments and governments for only 4 million inhabitants .
bosnia and herzegovina 's constitution is not the result of self-determination .
it was signed in dayton by two foreign heads of state - serbian and croatian presidents slobodan milosevic and franjo tudjman - and by bosnian president alija izetbegovic . it 's time that bosnia and herzegovina got its own , new constitution that can pave the way to europe and shed the burden of ethnic division .

police also cleared a blockade of 160 tractors near the town of klein gusborn on the last leg of the 600-kilometer -lrb- 370-mile -rrb- odyssey , where more than 600 people joined the protest following demonstrations throughout the weekend . in the town of harlingen , police removed 150 activists performing a sit-in on the tracks and detained 23 .
authorities had to forcibly clear the blockade , with more than 70 of the tractors seized and taken to a nearby field .
some 15,000 officers had been mobilized on the german side to secure the passage of the train . the coalition of activists argues that the shipments are dangerous and that their lengthy storage could allow radioactive material to seep into the water supply in the region . " the radioactivity of these 12 containers is two and a half times higher than that of chernobyl , " said thomas breuer , a nuclear expert with environmental watchdog greenpeace .

coca-cola 's decision has not only riled the ok but also soccer 's world governing body fifa which has praised germany over its commitment to green projects including improved public transportation and energy saving incentives .
fifa is expected to rule against the us company 's intended use of plastic receptacles over biodegradable paper cups at a meeting at the start of 2006 . the coca-cola group , however , seems unlikely to budge . " we place great value on the bottles " said a group spokesperson in a statement which did not deal with the stand-off directly . the german government 's environment ministry is also reported to be dismayed by the possible use of throwaway plastic bottles , saying that the use of such drink containers at the world cup next summer could turn the showpiece tournament into a " garbage orgy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the environment ministry could kick the " green goal " initiative into touch .
the ministry is also threatening to distance itself from the " green goal " initiative if coca-cola is allowed to sell plastic bottles at the world cup . a question of security has also been raised .
full bottles could be thrown or used to transport liquids other than the intended coke into the stadiums . coca-cola has responded to such fears by saying that its plastic bottles would be sold without lids inside the grounds only .
opponents of the plan believe the security aspect alone is enough for fifa to refuse coca-cola 's proposal . most bundesliga stadiums in germany already operate an environmentally friendly system where drinking receptacles are either made from reinforced paper or are designed to be re-used . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de soccer world cup aims to cut emissions world cup organizers have stressed that the 2006 tournament in germany will be eco-friendly .

with angela merkel about to be sworn in , the web site for the german chancellor is out of date , as the address only implies a male " kanzler . "
but thanks to a forward-thinking young man , she 's got nothing to worry about . lars heitmüller says he 's no feminist - he 's just interested in promoting equality of the sexes .
still , you 've got to hand it to him .
as a 22-year-old student back in 1998 , heitmüller was already thinking of the day when a woman would occupy germany 's top office .
it seemed that , seven years ago , the possibility had n't yet occurred to staffers in charge of the government 's internet presence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what will happen to www.bundeskanzler.de when schröder is gone ?
heitmüller discovered that the web domains for the feminine versions of the german words for " chancellor " and " federal president " were there for the taking , and promptly snapped them up .
today , if you go to www.bundeskanzlerin.de or www.bundespraesidentin.de - the " in " at the end of the words denoting the female - you get a notice from heitmüller informing you that the sites are being kept " in trust " for the first women to occupy these offices . now that angela merkel is about to be confirmed as germany 's first female chancellor , heitmüller intends to relinquish www.bundeskanzlerin.de - for free , of course . " i 'm not trying to make money with this , " heitmüller , now 29 years of age and a public relations consultant in berlin , told der spiegel . merkel defi n itely i n terested nor is he trying to score any political points with his web addresses , though merkel is likely to be a grateful recipient .
after all , she first expressed interest in acquiring the domain ahead of germany 's last general election in 2002 , despite the fact that it was not she , but rather bavarian premier edmund stoiber who was nominated to run for the conservatives that time . heitmüller maintains that purchasing the domains was simply part of his personal engagement to promote more gender equality in germany . " this is also something for men to be concerned with , " he told der spiegel .
" i would like to see women be active in all areas of society . " dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de make way barbie , angie 's coming !

angela merkel , however , is not promising a feminist or even a particularly feminine future .

she will lead an unwieldy coalition of the left and right whose main task will be getting the german economy moving again . she is not an especially charismatic woman , this former physicist who grew up in communist east germany .
she does n't come across as a natural leader who grabs hold of life with gusto .
in fact , when asked once in an interview how she would spend three days if she could do anything she wanted , she replied she would tidy up her apartment and get her book collection in order . but angela merkel has been underestimated time and time again , and in her political career , she has always emerged on top , often leaving much more experienced , usually male politicians in the dust .
she has skyrocketed to the top of her party in near record time - she only entered politics after the fall of the berlin wall - as a childless , protestant woman from the east in a party dominated by catholic family men from western germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel 's future was in question for a while after sept .
18 she did n't flinch in the difficult weeks after her party 's poor showing in the sept .
18 election , during which there were calls for her to step aside . now , germany is preparing to watch as she is voted by the german parliament , the bundestag , as the country 's first female leader , and its first leader from the east . although she is stepping into the history books tomorrow when she gets the keys to the chancellery , any honeymoon period , if there is one , is not likely to last long .
she has a raft of difficult decisions to make as she takes over from seven years of outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democratic-green government .
many of those decisions are not going to please the public . red-green legacy even as schröder cleans out his desk , judgments are being passed on the legacy of seven years of his " red-green " government , so named because of the colors associated with the coalition 's two parties . it is a mixed report card , with many on the left upset at social welfare reforms that hurt the poor , those on the right and business interests giving him poor marks for his unwillingness to put through far-reaching changes they say are necessary . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder has said he will resign from parliament , even though he 's entitled to a seat over the weekend , in what was schröder 's last public speech as german leader , he said he hoped his time in office would be remembered for his government 's strong foreign policy stance -lrb- he refused to support the us-led war in iraq , severely bruising transatlantic relations -rrb- , and the domestic reforms , which he said struck a balance between oiling the economy and protecting the weakest in society . but merkel is inheriting a germany suffering from high-unemployment , currently at 11.6 percent , a ballooning budget deficit and anemic economic growth , less than 1 percent this year and forecast to be just slightly higher in 2006 .
while germany was once the economic locomotive of europe , today it 's more akin to the caboose . government program in the coalition agreement , the two partners have pledged to enact a multi-billion-euro investment program , to loosen some job protection rules to encourage companies to hire and to increase the vat tax by three percentage points in 2007 to cut down the deficit . on this last point , she has already come under criticism by economists , who question the wisdom of increasing a consumption tax at a time when consumer spending is the achilles ' heel of the german economy . she has to hope that the german populace will be forgiving as she works to enact deeper , and more painful reforms than her predecessor -lrb- although not as deep as she would like to , since she has to govern with the spd -rrb- .
she appears to think they will be understanding if they see that the reforms are cutting the jobless rate and helping them in the long run . " will we ensure that by 2009 people say ' yes , for me personally it 's a bit better than in 2005 ' ? "
merkel said before signing the coalition agreement .
she said the agreement offered germany the chance of achieving that goal . no " iron lady " much has been made , especially abroad , of the fact that merkel is a woman and there have been the inevitable comparisons to the uk 's margaret thatcher , who is credited with aggressively remaking the british economy , although many questioned her methods . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : margaret thatcher had more room to maneuver than merkel does due to constraints placed on her by her coalition partners , it is very unlikely that she will become a sort of " eiserne frau " after the model of the " iron lady , " as thatcher was nicknamed . however , there is at least one factor that could help her get her way .
her coalition enjoys an overwhelming majority in the parliament , 448 of the 614 seats in the lower house .
the two parties also dominate the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , which means that the new government will be able to enact reforms in the federal system , pensions and taxes without fear of a veto . the fact that the upper house was in conservative hands during the schröder era proved to be a major hindrance to that government . convincing the public one of her greatest challenges will be bringing the public around to the idea that change is needed to germany to retain the high standard of living it has enjoyed for decades .
for a german public highly resistant to change , this has been a bitter pill to swallow . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and spd chief matthias platzeck are standing shoulder to shoulder , for now still , she and the new head of the social democrats , matthias platzeck , have presented a united face to the public regarding reforms .
the fact that both of them hail from in the east - platzeck is from potsdam - gives them something of an outsider 's perspective on things , and could prove beneficial since they did not grow up with many of the material benefits of west germany or with a sense of entitlement .
they are both former scientists , analytical and pragmatic and have proven in the past they are not afraid to tell it like it is , even if the news is unpleasant . platzeck won the support of the population of the state of brandenburg with his straight talk about the dire economic situation there .

she will lead an unwieldy coalition of the left and right whose main task will be getting the german economy moving again . she is not an especially charismatic woman , this former physicist who grew up in communist east germany .
she does n't come across as a natural leader who grabs hold of life with gusto .
in fact , when asked once in an interview how she would spend three days if she could do anything she wanted , she replied she would tidy up her apartment and get her book collection in order . but angela merkel has been underestimated time and time again , and in her political career , she has always emerged on top , often leaving much more experienced , usually male politicians in the dust .
she has skyrocketed to the top of her party in near record time - she only entered politics after the fall of the berlin wall - as a childless , protestant woman from the east in a party dominated by catholic family men from western germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel 's future was in question for a while after sept .
18 she did n't flinch in the difficult weeks after her party 's poor showing in the sept .
18 election , during which there were calls for her to step aside . now , germany is preparing to watch as she is voted by the german parliament , the bundestag , as the country 's first female leader , and its first leader from the east . although she is stepping into the history books tomorrow when she gets the keys to the chancellery , any honeymoon period , if there is one , is not likely to last long .
she has a raft of difficult decisions to make as she takes over from seven years of outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democratic-green government .
many of those decisions are not going to please the public . red-green legacy even as schröder cleans out his desk , judgments are being passed on the legacy of seven years of his " red-green " government , so named because of the colors associated with the coalition 's two parties . it is a mixed report card , with many on the left upset at social welfare reforms that hurt the poor , those on the right and business interests giving him poor marks for his unwillingness to put through far-reaching changes they say are necessary . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder has said he will resign from parliament , even though he 's entitled to a seat over the weekend , in what was schröder 's last public speech as german leader , he said he hoped his time in office would be remembered for his government 's strong foreign policy stance -lrb- he refused to support the us-led war in iraq , severely bruising transatlantic relations -rrb- , and the domestic reforms , which he said struck a balance between oiling the economy and protecting the weakest in society . but merkel is inheriting a germany suffering from high-unemployment , currently at 11.6 percent , a ballooning budget deficit and anemic economic growth , less than 1 percent this year and forecast to be just slightly higher in 2006 .
while germany was once the economic locomotive of europe , today it 's more akin to the caboose . government program in the coalition agreement , the two partners have pledged to enact a multi-billion-euro investment program , to loosen some job protection rules to encourage companies to hire and to increase the vat tax by three percentage points in 2007 to cut down the deficit . on this last point , she has already come under criticism by economists , who question the wisdom of increasing a consumption tax at a time when consumer spending is the achilles ' heel of the german economy . she has to hope that the german populace will be forgiving as she works to enact deeper , and more painful reforms than her predecessor -lrb- although not as deep as she would like to , since she has to govern with the spd -rrb- .
she appears to think they will be understanding if they see that the reforms are cutting the jobless rate and helping them in the long run . " will we ensure that by 2009 people say ' yes , for me personally it 's a bit better than in 2005 ' ? "
merkel said before signing the coalition agreement .
she said the agreement offered germany the chance of achieving that goal . no " iron lady " much has been made , especially abroad , of the fact that merkel is a woman and there have been the inevitable comparisons to the uk 's margaret thatcher , who is credited with aggressively remaking the british economy , although many questioned her methods . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : margaret thatcher had more room to maneuver than merkel does due to constraints placed on her by her coalition partners , it is very unlikely that she will become a sort of " eiserne frau " after the model of the " iron lady , " as thatcher was nicknamed . however , there is at least one factor that could help her get her way .
her coalition enjoys an overwhelming majority in the parliament , 448 of the 614 seats in the lower house .
the two parties also dominate the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , which means that the new government will be able to enact reforms in the federal system , pensions and taxes without fear of a veto . the fact that the upper house was in conservative hands during the schröder era proved to be a major hindrance to that government . convincing the public one of her greatest challenges will be bringing the public around to the idea that change is needed to germany to retain the high standard of living it has enjoyed for decades .
for a german public highly resistant to change , this has been a bitter pill to swallow . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and spd chief matthias platzeck are standing shoulder to shoulder , for now still , she and the new head of the social democrats , matthias platzeck , have presented a united face to the public regarding reforms .
the fact that both of them hail from in the east - platzeck is from potsdam - gives them something of an outsider 's perspective on things , and could prove beneficial since they did not grow up with many of the material benefits of west germany or with a sense of entitlement .
they are both former scientists , analytical and pragmatic and have proven in the past they are not afraid to tell it like it is , even if the news is unpleasant . platzeck won the support of the population of the state of brandenburg with his straight talk about the dire economic situation there .
the population found it refreshing .
merkel and platzeck can only hope that will apply on a national level as well . still , they have a lot of persuading to do .
polls show that a majority of the public does not expect the grand coalition to last for four years . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de experts say merkel will bring change in style , not policy for us germany finally has a coalition deal , paving the way for angela merkel to become chancellor .

coca-cola 's decision has not only riled the ok but also soccer 's world governing body fifa which has praised germany over its commitment to green projects including improved public transportation and energy saving incentives .
fifa is expected to rule against the us company 's intended use of plastic receptacles over biodegradable paper cups at a meeting at the start of 2006 . the coca-cola group , however , seems unlikely to budge . " we place great value on the bottles " said a group spokesperson in a statement which did not deal with the stand-off directly . the german government 's environment ministry is also reported to be dismayed by the possible use of throwaway plastic bottles , saying that the use of such drink containers at the world cup next summer could turn the showpiece tournament into a " garbage orgy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the environment ministry could kick the " green goal " initiative into touch .
the ministry is also threatening to distance itself from the " green goal " initiative if coca-cola is allowed to sell plastic bottles at the world cup . a question of security has also been raised .
full bottles could be thrown or used to transport liquids other than the intended coke into the stadiums . coca-cola has responded to such fears by saying that its plastic bottles would be sold without lids inside the grounds only .
opponents of the plan believe the security aspect alone is enough for fifa to refuse coca-cola 's proposal . most bundesliga stadiums in germany already operate an environmentally friendly system where drinking receptacles are either made from reinforced paper or are designed to be re-used . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de soccer world cup aims to cut emissions world cup organizers have stressed that the 2006 tournament in germany will be eco-friendly .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 21.11.2005 opinion : 10 years after dayton , an unfair peace großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us and eu brokered the peace after three and a half years of war on nov .
21 , 2005 , the dayton agreement ended the war in bosnia and herzegovina that left 250,000 people dead and 2 million displaced .
but the treaty did n't create a fair peace , according to dw 's fabian schmidt . the dayton agreement was good because it put an end to the human suffering and to the siege of sarajevo .
it was good because it created the basis for the return of refugees , for free elections , for democratic institutions and for economic recovery . it was good because it gave nato the mandate to apply the treaty with force - if necessary .
dayton also made possible the development of inter-ethnic and inter-religious dialogue .
it created the preconditions for coming to terms with the past , particularly through identification of the victims of mass killings and war , and by giving the international war crimes tribunal 's access to the sites where the horrors took place . but dayton was not fair .
it created the basis for an illogical peace .
in contrast to postwar germany , there was no " de-nazification " in bosnia-herzegovina .
dayton was an attempt to build democracy upon the quagmire of national hatred .
the treaty rewarded those who had waged war .
it recognized the republika srpska as an entity with individual statehood , a republic whose very existence was based on rape and mass killings . time for a n ew co n stitutio n dayton created the foundation for parliament and governments to be formed according to ethnic quotas .
it allowed ethnic and religious segregation in schools to become the order of the day .
even today , the nationalistic parties that waged war against each other are still in power in bosnia and herzegovina . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us secretary of state warren christopher -lrb- center -rrb- , bosnia 's izetbegovic -lrb- left -rrb- and croatia 's tudjman in dayton but above all , the dayton agreement gave the country an inefficient administrative structure .
the country with its two entities , 10 cantons , one district and a central government has 14 parliaments and governments for only 4 million inhabitants .
bosnia and herzegovina 's constitution is not the result of self-determination .
it was signed in dayton by two foreign heads of state - serbian and croatian presidents slobodan milosevic and franjo tudjman - and by bosnian president alija izetbegovic . it 's time that bosnia and herzegovina got its own , new constitution that can pave the way to europe and shed the burden of ethnic division .
europe and america are ready to help .
now it 's up to the people of bosnia to recognize the opportunity and take action . fabian schmidt -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu mulls military preparedness eu defense ministers reviewed the bloc 's bosnia mission and discussed whether its forces are sufficiently equipped .

police also cleared a blockade of 160 tractors near the town of klein gusborn on the last leg of the 600-kilometer -lrb- 370-mile -rrb- odyssey , where more than 600 people joined the protest following demonstrations throughout the weekend . in the town of harlingen , police removed 150 activists performing a sit-in on the tracks and detained 23 .
authorities had to forcibly clear the blockade , with more than 70 of the tractors seized and taken to a nearby field .
some 15,000 officers had been mobilized on the german side to secure the passage of the train . the coalition of activists argues that the shipments are dangerous and that their lengthy storage could allow radioactive material to seep into the water supply in the region .

21 , 2005 , the dayton agreement ended the war in bosnia and herzegovina that left 250,000 people dead and 2 million displaced .
but the treaty did n't create a fair peace , according to dw 's fabian schmidt . the dayton agreement was good because it put an end to the human suffering and to the siege of sarajevo .
it was good because it created the basis for the return of refugees , for free elections , for democratic institutions and for economic recovery . it was good because it gave nato the mandate to apply the treaty with force - if necessary .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 21.11.2005 to smack or not to smack großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what to do with an uncontrollable screaming child ?
germany 's new coalition has already set out plans to build on the current policy of a child ’ s right to a non-violent education .
by way of contrast , a new study shows smacking to be widely accepted in germany . in a survey , commissioned by the berliner zeitung newspaper , 36 percent of those asked said they believe that smacking children is justifiable , with a further 28 percent deeming it acceptable to raise a hand in exceptional circumstances .
only one third expressed outright rejection of the practice as an educational tool .
this latest round of controversy , in what is a long-running and ever-evolving issue in many european countries , was sparked by berlin ’ s chief public prosecutor , hansjürgen karge , who recently went down on record as saying : " i am not seeking to introduce corporal punishment , but i won ’ t have anyone stop me from giving an occasional smack . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what is the best way to discipline a child ?
his comment has drawn a sense of general incredulity from both sides of the fence , with child protection agencies damning the practice as humiliating for the child involved and slamming the man who publicly condoned it as misguided , and well-worn parents claiming that an occasional smack is a far cry from violence , and can be incredibly helpful .
" i think a smack on the bottom is okay , but it ’ s important that it is spontaneous and that the children know what it is about and know that they did something very wrong .
it ’ s like with medicine , a few drops can be very effective , but too much is poison , " said mother of two , johanna weske .
violence against children " inadmissible " but the fact is , that since the introduction in 2000 of the outlawing violence in education act , smacking a child is out of bounds .
the law declares corporal punishment , psychological injury and other demeaning forms of educating children as " inadmissible . "
yet that said , enforcement of the legislation is a sketchy business , with charges rarely pressed in anything but extreme cases .
and even then , they are often waived if the family concerned agrees to counseling or other supportive measures .
so if the law is not actively used as a tool to prevent smacking , just how serious is the problem ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : happy days with the parents a comprehensive report published three years after the introduction of the act , indicates that 60 percent of germans think it acceptable to raise a hand to their children every now and then .
and while that figure seems high , barbara ammer , managing director of the alliance for children against violence , says there are definite signs of a shift away from physically abusive parenting .
" society is changing , but the process is slow .
since the law came into force , awareness about a non-violent upbringing has increased and the idea of non-violent education is becoming more important in society , " ammer said .
idealism versus realism but ideals are not always representative of reality and lotte knoller of the child protection centre in berlin says a problem she frequently encounters among the parents she counsels is an grave uncertainty about just how to set about child-rearing .

germany 's new coalition has already set out plans to build on the current policy of a child ’ s right to a non-violent education .
by way of contrast , a new study shows smacking to be widely accepted in germany . in a survey , commissioned by the berliner zeitung newspaper , 36 percent of those asked said they believe that smacking children is justifiable , with a further 28 percent deeming it acceptable to raise a hand in exceptional circumstances .
only one third expressed outright rejection of the practice as an educational tool .
this latest round of controversy , in what is a long-running and ever-evolving issue in many european countries , was sparked by berlin ’ s chief public prosecutor , hansjürgen karge , who recently went down on record as saying : " i am not seeking to introduce corporal punishment , but i won ’ t have anyone stop me from giving an occasional smack . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what is the best way to discipline a child ?
his comment has drawn a sense of general incredulity from both sides of the fence , with child protection agencies damning the practice as humiliating for the child involved and slamming the man who publicly condoned it as misguided , and well-worn parents claiming that an occasional smack is a far cry from violence , and can be incredibly helpful .
" i think a smack on the bottom is okay , but it ’ s important that it is spontaneous and that the children know what it is about and know that they did something very wrong .
it ’ s like with medicine , a few drops can be very effective , but too much is poison , " said mother of two , johanna weske .
violence against children " inadmissible " but the fact is , that since the introduction in 2000 of the outlawing violence in education act , smacking a child is out of bounds .
the law declares corporal punishment , psychological injury and other demeaning forms of educating children as " inadmissible . "
yet that said , enforcement of the legislation is a sketchy business , with charges rarely pressed in anything but extreme cases .
and even then , they are often waived if the family concerned agrees to counseling or other supportive measures .
so if the law is not actively used as a tool to prevent smacking , just how serious is the problem ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : happy days with the parents a comprehensive report published three years after the introduction of the act , indicates that 60 percent of germans think it acceptable to raise a hand to their children every now and then .
and while that figure seems high , barbara ammer , managing director of the alliance for children against violence , says there are definite signs of a shift away from physically abusive parenting .
" society is changing , but the process is slow .
since the law came into force , awareness about a non-violent upbringing has increased and the idea of non-violent education is becoming more important in society , " ammer said .
idealism versus realism but ideals are not always representative of reality and lotte knoller of the child protection centre in berlin says a problem she frequently encounters among the parents she counsels is an grave uncertainty about just how to set about child-rearing .

police also cleared a blockade of 160 tractors near the town of klein gusborn on the last leg of the 600-kilometer -lrb- 370-mile -rrb- odyssey , where more than 600 people joined the protest following demonstrations throughout the weekend . in the town of harlingen , police removed 150 activists performing a sit-in on the tracks and detained 23 .
authorities had to forcibly clear the blockade , with more than 70 of the tractors seized and taken to a nearby field .
some 15,000 officers had been mobilized on the german side to secure the passage of the train . the coalition of activists argues that the shipments are dangerous and that their lengthy storage could allow radioactive material to seep into the water supply in the region . " the radioactivity of these 12 containers is two and a half times higher than that of chernobyl , " said thomas breuer , a nuclear expert with environmental watchdog greenpeace .

the waste containers will be loaded onto trucks there and finish the final 20-kilometer -lrb- 12-mile -rrb- stretch of the journey .
the shipment , the ninth since 1996 , is due tuesday morning in gorleben , where there are already 56 containers of radioactive waste stored . the transports were interrupted in 1998 following a scandal over radioactive contamination on the surface of the containers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 21.11.2005 to smack or not to smack großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what to do with an uncontrollable screaming child ?
germany 's new coalition has already set out plans to build on the current policy of a child ’ s right to a non-violent education .
by way of contrast , a new study shows smacking to be widely accepted in germany . in a survey , commissioned by the berliner zeitung newspaper , 36 percent of those asked said they believe that smacking children is justifiable , with a further 28 percent deeming it acceptable to raise a hand in exceptional circumstances .
only one third expressed outright rejection of the practice as an educational tool .
this latest round of controversy , in what is a long-running and ever-evolving issue in many european countries , was sparked by berlin ’ s chief public prosecutor , hansjürgen karge , who recently went down on record as saying : " i am not seeking to introduce corporal punishment , but i won ’ t have anyone stop me from giving an occasional smack . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what is the best way to discipline a child ?
his comment has drawn a sense of general incredulity from both sides of the fence , with child protection agencies damning the practice as humiliating for the child involved and slamming the man who publicly condoned it as misguided , and well-worn parents claiming that an occasional smack is a far cry from violence , and can be incredibly helpful .
" i think a smack on the bottom is okay , but it ’ s important that it is spontaneous and that the children know what it is about and know that they did something very wrong .
it ’ s like with medicine , a few drops can be very effective , but too much is poison , " said mother of two , johanna weske .
violence against children " inadmissible " but the fact is , that since the introduction in 2000 of the outlawing violence in education act , smacking a child is out of bounds .
the law declares corporal punishment , psychological injury and other demeaning forms of educating children as " inadmissible . "
yet that said , enforcement of the legislation is a sketchy business , with charges rarely pressed in anything but extreme cases .
and even then , they are often waived if the family concerned agrees to counseling or other supportive measures .
so if the law is not actively used as a tool to prevent smacking , just how serious is the problem ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : happy days with the parents a comprehensive report published three years after the introduction of the act , indicates that 60 percent of germans think it acceptable to raise a hand to their children every now and then .
and while that figure seems high , barbara ammer , managing director of the alliance for children against violence , says there are definite signs of a shift away from physically abusive parenting .
" society is changing , but the process is slow .
since the law came into force , awareness about a non-violent upbringing has increased and the idea of non-violent education is becoming more important in society , " ammer said .
idealism versus realism but ideals are not always representative of reality and lotte knoller of the child protection centre in berlin says a problem she frequently encounters among the parents she counsels is an grave uncertainty about just how to set about child-rearing .
" when it comes to education , germany is in a gray zone somewhere between a laissez-faire and a rigid attitude .
parents don ’ t know how to earn the respect of their children . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parenting can be a case of fumbling in the dark ammer too , says that while communicative , almost discursive parenting techniques are fine in theory , they don ’ t always provide children with the restrictions they need .
the consequence is unruly behavior with which modern parents are often ill-equipped to deal .
" interestingly , although the birth rate is in decline , sales of education self-helps books is on the increase , " ammer said .
" changing values in our society are making people insecure .
authority has been replaced by communication , and parents are more reluctant to establish boundaries and make rules . "
putting children first society may be changing , but the need among willful young children to know where they stand , is not .
and that is where the act for non-violent education comes back into play .
whatever its restrictions in practical terms , it serves the purpose of raising an awareness of the difference between acceptable and non-acceptable child-rearing , and perhaps more importantly of letting parents know that there is help at hand when the going gets too tough .
as much as anything , it operates like a campaign to make germany , often viewed to be child-unfriendly , realize the value of investing time , effort and warmth into nurturing its younger generation .
ammer says the ultimate aim is to " encourage people to put children at the center of our society .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 21.11.2005 to smack or not to smack großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what to do with an uncontrollable screaming child ?
germany 's new coalition has already set out plans to build on the current policy of a child ’ s right to a non-violent education .
by way of contrast , a new study shows smacking to be widely accepted in germany . in a survey , commissioned by the berliner zeitung newspaper , 36 percent of those asked said they believe that smacking children is justifiable , with a further 28 percent deeming it acceptable to raise a hand in exceptional circumstances .
only one third expressed outright rejection of the practice as an educational tool .
this latest round of controversy , in what is a long-running and ever-evolving issue in many european countries , was sparked by berlin ’ s chief public prosecutor , hansjürgen karge , who recently went down on record as saying : " i am not seeking to introduce corporal punishment , but i won ’ t have anyone stop me from giving an occasional smack . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what is the best way to discipline a child ?
his comment has drawn a sense of general incredulity from both sides of the fence , with child protection agencies damning the practice as humiliating for the child involved and slamming the man who publicly condoned it as misguided , and well-worn parents claiming that an occasional smack is a far cry from violence , and can be incredibly helpful .
" i think a smack on the bottom is okay , but it ’ s important that it is spontaneous and that the children know what it is about and know that they did something very wrong .
it ’ s like with medicine , a few drops can be very effective , but too much is poison , " said mother of two , johanna weske .
violence against children " inadmissible " but the fact is , that since the introduction in 2000 of the outlawing violence in education act , smacking a child is out of bounds .
the law declares corporal punishment , psychological injury and other demeaning forms of educating children as " inadmissible . "
yet that said , enforcement of the legislation is a sketchy business , with charges rarely pressed in anything but extreme cases .
and even then , they are often waived if the family concerned agrees to counseling or other supportive measures .
so if the law is not actively used as a tool to prevent smacking , just how serious is the problem ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : happy days with the parents a comprehensive report published three years after the introduction of the act , indicates that 60 percent of germans think it acceptable to raise a hand to their children every now and then .
and while that figure seems high , barbara ammer , managing director of the alliance for children against violence , says there are definite signs of a shift away from physically abusive parenting .
" society is changing , but the process is slow .
since the law came into force , awareness about a non-violent upbringing has increased and the idea of non-violent education is becoming more important in society , " ammer said .
idealism versus realism but ideals are not always representative of reality and lotte knoller of the child protection centre in berlin says a problem she frequently encounters among the parents she counsels is an grave uncertainty about just how to set about child-rearing .
" when it comes to education , germany is in a gray zone somewhere between a laissez-faire and a rigid attitude .
parents don ’ t know how to earn the respect of their children . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parenting can be a case of fumbling in the dark ammer too , says that while communicative , almost discursive parenting techniques are fine in theory , they don ’ t always provide children with the restrictions they need .
the consequence is unruly behavior with which modern parents are often ill-equipped to deal .
" interestingly , although the birth rate is in decline , sales of education self-helps books is on the increase , " ammer said .
" changing values in our society are making people insecure .
authority has been replaced by communication , and parents are more reluctant to establish boundaries and make rules . "
putting children first society may be changing , but the need among willful young children to know where they stand , is not .
and that is where the act for non-violent education comes back into play .
whatever its restrictions in practical terms , it serves the purpose of raising an awareness of the difference between acceptable and non-acceptable child-rearing , and perhaps more importantly of letting parents know that there is help at hand when the going gets too tough .
as much as anything , it operates like a campaign to make germany , often viewed to be child-unfriendly , realize the value of investing time , effort and warmth into nurturing its younger generation .
ammer says the ultimate aim is to " encourage people to put children at the center of our society .

but former president khatami encouraged germany to continue its leading role in negotiations . iran has threatened tough retaliation if it is referred to the un security council because of its atomic program .
its conservative-controlled parliament gave preliminary backing to a bill that would oblige the government to " stop voluntary and non-legally binding measures and implement its scientific , research and executive programmes " if the iranian case is taken up in new york . the text does not refer to specific forms of retaliation , but counter-measures could encompass a refusal to adhere to the additional protocol of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty , which gives increased inspection powers to the international atomic energy agency . the protocol , signed by the previous reformist government but not ratified by deputies , is seen as being crucial to an iaea probe into allegations that iran is using an atomic energy drive as a cover for weapons development . the threat of retaliation could also include an end to iran 's freeze of ultra-sensitive uranium enrichment - a process used to make reactor fuel but which can also make the explosive core of a nuclear weapon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gholamreza aghazadeh is vice president and head of iran 's nuclear program top iranian officials , who maintain the nuclear drive is for strictly peaceful purposes only , have already threatened such retaliation if iran is referred to the security council . the move by parliament is seen as a means for iran to reinforce such warnings , and the bill is subject to further debate on tuesday - just two days ahead of the iaea meeting . military site off-limits meanwhile foreign ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi said the iaea would not be let into a suspect military site in tehran unless it provides " concrete proof " to justify an inspection . he also insisted a new report by iaea chief mohamed elbaradei does " not contain any negative points " - even if the text explicitly states that " iran 's full transparency is indispensable and overdue . " one of the iaea 's demands is to return to the lavizan-shian area in tehran , site of a physics research center that was dismantled and the ground razed before iaea inspectors paid an initial visit in june 2004 . under the npt , iran is not obliged to provide access to such sites but has allowed some access as a " confidence-building " measure . " they can not just say we want to talk to this or that person and keep on dragging out the dossier , " asefi argued . concerns the agency has uncovered suspect activity in iran yet no " smoking gun , " but concerns have been raised by tehran 's submission of a document bought on the black market describing how to make what could be the explosive core of an atom bomb . asefi said the significance of the document was being exaggerated , saying " there is no legal and rational reason to send iran 's case to the security council .

" it is not only in the interest of the west or iran , but in that of the whole world , that the nuclear negotiations be continued until a solution is reached , " he told the iranian news agency irna in berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mohammad khatami khatami , who is seen as a moderate , is currently a guest of the hamburg-based körber foundation .

she will lead an unwieldy coalition of the left and right whose main task will be getting the german economy moving again . she is not an especially charismatic woman , this former physicist who grew up in communist east germany .
she does n't come across as a natural leader who grabs hold of life with gusto .
in fact , when asked once in an interview how she would spend three days if she could do anything she wanted , she replied she would tidy up her apartment and get her book collection in order . but angela merkel has been underestimated time and time again , and in her political career , she has always emerged on top , often leaving much more experienced , usually male politicians in the dust .
she has skyrocketed to the top of her party in near record time - she only entered politics after the fall of the berlin wall - as a childless , protestant woman from the east in a party dominated by catholic family men from western germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel 's future was in question for a while after sept .
18 she did n't flinch in the difficult weeks after her party 's poor showing in the sept .
18 election , during which there were calls for her to step aside . now , germany is preparing to watch as she is voted by the german parliament , the bundestag , as the country 's first female leader , and its first leader from the east . although she is stepping into the history books tomorrow when she gets the keys to the chancellery , any honeymoon period , if there is one , is not likely to last long .
she has a raft of difficult decisions to make as she takes over from seven years of outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democratic-green government .
many of those decisions are not going to please the public . red-green legacy even as schröder cleans out his desk , judgments are being passed on the legacy of seven years of his " red-green " government , so named because of the colors associated with the coalition 's two parties . it is a mixed report card , with many on the left upset at social welfare reforms that hurt the poor , those on the right and business interests giving him poor marks for his unwillingness to put through far-reaching changes they say are necessary . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder has said he will resign from parliament , even though he 's entitled to a seat over the weekend , in what was schröder 's last public speech as german leader , he said he hoped his time in office would be remembered for his government 's strong foreign policy stance -lrb- he refused to support the us-led war in iraq , severely bruising transatlantic relations -rrb- , and the domestic reforms , which he said struck a balance between oiling the economy and protecting the weakest in society . but merkel is inheriting a germany suffering from high-unemployment , currently at 11.6 percent , a ballooning budget deficit and anemic economic growth , less than 1 percent this year and forecast to be just slightly higher in 2006 .
while germany was once the economic locomotive of europe , today it 's more akin to the caboose . government program in the coalition agreement , the two partners have pledged to enact a multi-billion-euro investment program , to loosen some job protection rules to encourage companies to hire and to increase the vat tax by three percentage points in 2007 to cut down the deficit . on this last point , she has already come under criticism by economists , who question the wisdom of increasing a consumption tax at a time when consumer spending is the achilles ' heel of the german economy . she has to hope that the german populace will be forgiving as she works to enact deeper , and more painful reforms than her predecessor -lrb- although not as deep as she would like to , since she has to govern with the spd -rrb- .
she appears to think they will be understanding if they see that the reforms are cutting the jobless rate and helping them in the long run . " will we ensure that by 2009 people say ' yes , for me personally it 's a bit better than in 2005 ' ? "
merkel said before signing the coalition agreement .
she said the agreement offered germany the chance of achieving that goal . no " iron lady " much has been made , especially abroad , of the fact that merkel is a woman and there have been the inevitable comparisons to the uk 's margaret thatcher , who is credited with aggressively remaking the british economy , although many questioned her methods . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : margaret thatcher had more room to maneuver than merkel does due to constraints placed on her by her coalition partners , it is very unlikely that she will become a sort of " eiserne frau " after the model of the " iron lady , " as thatcher was nicknamed . however , there is at least one factor that could help her get her way .
her coalition enjoys an overwhelming majority in the parliament , 448 of the 614 seats in the lower house .
the two parties also dominate the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , which means that the new government will be able to enact reforms in the federal system , pensions and taxes without fear of a veto . the fact that the upper house was in conservative hands during the schröder era proved to be a major hindrance to that government . convincing the public one of her greatest challenges will be bringing the public around to the idea that change is needed to germany to retain the high standard of living it has enjoyed for decades .
for a german public highly resistant to change , this has been a bitter pill to swallow . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and spd chief matthias platzeck are standing shoulder to shoulder , for now still , she and the new head of the social democrats , matthias platzeck , have presented a united face to the public regarding reforms .
the fact that both of them hail from in the east - platzeck is from potsdam - gives them something of an outsider 's perspective on things , and could prove beneficial since they did not grow up with many of the material benefits of west germany or with a sense of entitlement .
they are both former scientists , analytical and pragmatic and have proven in the past they are not afraid to tell it like it is , even if the news is unpleasant . platzeck won the support of the population of the state of brandenburg with his straight talk about the dire economic situation there .
the population found it refreshing .
merkel and platzeck can only hope that will apply on a national level as well . still , they have a lot of persuading to do .

coca-cola 's decision has not only riled the ok but also soccer 's world governing body fifa which has praised germany over its commitment to green projects including improved public transportation and energy saving incentives .
fifa is expected to rule against the us company 's intended use of plastic receptacles over biodegradable paper cups at a meeting at the start of 2006 . the coca-cola group , however , seems unlikely to budge . " we place great value on the bottles " said a group spokesperson in a statement which did not deal with the stand-off directly . the german government 's environment ministry is also reported to be dismayed by the possible use of throwaway plastic bottles , saying that the use of such drink containers at the world cup next summer could turn the showpiece tournament into a " garbage orgy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 21.11.2005 opinion : 10 years after dayton , an unfair peace großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us and eu brokered the peace after three and a half years of war on nov .
21 , 2005 , the dayton agreement ended the war in bosnia and herzegovina that left 250,000 people dead and 2 million displaced .
but the treaty did n't create a fair peace , according to dw 's fabian schmidt . the dayton agreement was good because it put an end to the human suffering and to the siege of sarajevo .
it was good because it created the basis for the return of refugees , for free elections , for democratic institutions and for economic recovery . it was good because it gave nato the mandate to apply the treaty with force - if necessary .
dayton also made possible the development of inter-ethnic and inter-religious dialogue .
it created the preconditions for coming to terms with the past , particularly through identification of the victims of mass killings and war , and by giving the international war crimes tribunal 's access to the sites where the horrors took place . but dayton was not fair .
it created the basis for an illogical peace .
in contrast to postwar germany , there was no " de-nazification " in bosnia-herzegovina .
dayton was an attempt to build democracy upon the quagmire of national hatred .
the treaty rewarded those who had waged war .
it recognized the republika srpska as an entity with individual statehood , a republic whose very existence was based on rape and mass killings . time for a n ew co n stitutio n dayton created the foundation for parliament and governments to be formed according to ethnic quotas .
it allowed ethnic and religious segregation in schools to become the order of the day .
even today , the nationalistic parties that waged war against each other are still in power in bosnia and herzegovina . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us secretary of state warren christopher -lrb- center -rrb- , bosnia 's izetbegovic -lrb- left -rrb- and croatia 's tudjman in dayton but above all , the dayton agreement gave the country an inefficient administrative structure .
the country with its two entities , 10 cantons , one district and a central government has 14 parliaments and governments for only 4 million inhabitants .
bosnia and herzegovina 's constitution is not the result of self-determination .
it was signed in dayton by two foreign heads of state - serbian and croatian presidents slobodan milosevic and franjo tudjman - and by bosnian president alija izetbegovic . it 's time that bosnia and herzegovina got its own , new constitution that can pave the way to europe and shed the burden of ethnic division .
europe and america are ready to help .
now it 's up to the people of bosnia to recognize the opportunity and take action . fabian schmidt -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu mulls military preparedness eu defense ministers reviewed the bloc 's bosnia mission and discussed whether its forces are sufficiently equipped .

21 , 2005 , the dayton agreement ended the war in bosnia and herzegovina that left 250,000 people dead and 2 million displaced .
but the treaty did n't create a fair peace , according to dw 's fabian schmidt . the dayton agreement was good because it put an end to the human suffering and to the siege of sarajevo .
it was good because it created the basis for the return of refugees , for free elections , for democratic institutions and for economic recovery . it was good because it gave nato the mandate to apply the treaty with force - if necessary .
dayton also made possible the development of inter-ethnic and inter-religious dialogue .
it created the preconditions for coming to terms with the past , particularly through identification of the victims of mass killings and war , and by giving the international war crimes tribunal 's access to the sites where the horrors took place . but dayton was not fair .
it created the basis for an illogical peace .
in contrast to postwar germany , there was no " de-nazification " in bosnia-herzegovina .
dayton was an attempt to build democracy upon the quagmire of national hatred .
the treaty rewarded those who had waged war .
it recognized the republika srpska as an entity with individual statehood , a republic whose very existence was based on rape and mass killings . time for a n ew co n stitutio n dayton created the foundation for parliament and governments to be formed according to ethnic quotas .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 21.11.2005 to smack or not to smack großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what to do with an uncontrollable screaming child ?
germany 's new coalition has already set out plans to build on the current policy of a child ’ s right to a non-violent education .
by way of contrast , a new study shows smacking to be widely accepted in germany . in a survey , commissioned by the berliner zeitung newspaper , 36 percent of those asked said they believe that smacking children is justifiable , with a further 28 percent deeming it acceptable to raise a hand in exceptional circumstances .
only one third expressed outright rejection of the practice as an educational tool .
this latest round of controversy , in what is a long-running and ever-evolving issue in many european countries , was sparked by berlin ’ s chief public prosecutor , hansjürgen karge , who recently went down on record as saying : " i am not seeking to introduce corporal punishment , but i won ’ t have anyone stop me from giving an occasional smack . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what is the best way to discipline a child ?
his comment has drawn a sense of general incredulity from both sides of the fence , with child protection agencies damning the practice as humiliating for the child involved and slamming the man who publicly condoned it as misguided , and well-worn parents claiming that an occasional smack is a far cry from violence , and can be incredibly helpful .
" i think a smack on the bottom is okay , but it ’ s important that it is spontaneous and that the children know what it is about and know that they did something very wrong .
it ’ s like with medicine , a few drops can be very effective , but too much is poison , " said mother of two , johanna weske .
violence against children " inadmissible " but the fact is , that since the introduction in 2000 of the outlawing violence in education act , smacking a child is out of bounds .
the law declares corporal punishment , psychological injury and other demeaning forms of educating children as " inadmissible . "
yet that said , enforcement of the legislation is a sketchy business , with charges rarely pressed in anything but extreme cases .
and even then , they are often waived if the family concerned agrees to counseling or other supportive measures .
so if the law is not actively used as a tool to prevent smacking , just how serious is the problem ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : happy days with the parents a comprehensive report published three years after the introduction of the act , indicates that 60 percent of germans think it acceptable to raise a hand to their children every now and then .
and while that figure seems high , barbara ammer , managing director of the alliance for children against violence , says there are definite signs of a shift away from physically abusive parenting .
" society is changing , but the process is slow .
since the law came into force , awareness about a non-violent upbringing has increased and the idea of non-violent education is becoming more important in society , " ammer said .
idealism versus realism but ideals are not always representative of reality and lotte knoller of the child protection centre in berlin says a problem she frequently encounters among the parents she counsels is an grave uncertainty about just how to set about child-rearing .
" when it comes to education , germany is in a gray zone somewhere between a laissez-faire and a rigid attitude .
parents don ’ t know how to earn the respect of their children . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parenting can be a case of fumbling in the dark ammer too , says that while communicative , almost discursive parenting techniques are fine in theory , they don ’ t always provide children with the restrictions they need .
the consequence is unruly behavior with which modern parents are often ill-equipped to deal .
" interestingly , although the birth rate is in decline , sales of education self-helps books is on the increase , " ammer said .
" changing values in our society are making people insecure .
authority has been replaced by communication , and parents are more reluctant to establish boundaries and make rules . "
putting children first society may be changing , but the need among willful young children to know where they stand , is not .
and that is where the act for non-violent education comes back into play .
whatever its restrictions in practical terms , it serves the purpose of raising an awareness of the difference between acceptable and non-acceptable child-rearing , and perhaps more importantly of letting parents know that there is help at hand when the going gets too tough .
as much as anything , it operates like a campaign to make germany , often viewed to be child-unfriendly , realize the value of investing time , effort and warmth into nurturing its younger generation .
ammer says the ultimate aim is to " encourage people to put children at the center of our society .

speaking in tokyo , he said the pipeline would bring oil supplies to the entire asia-pacific region , including japan .
tokyo is competing with china over the route of the pipeline , which is already in the first stage of construction .
mr putin is in japan to boost the two nations ' rapidly expanding economic ties , but little progress is expected over a 60-year-old territorial dispute .
he later held talks with japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi .
" we plan to build the pipeline to the pacific coast with eventual supplies to the asia-pacific region including japan , " mr putin told a meeting of russian and japanese business leaders in tokyo .
tokyo has been lobbying for the second stage to be constructed to the pacific coast .
beijing wants it to head south , to the industrial cities of northern china .
no date has yet been set for the second stage of construction .
" i 'm confident that the implementation of this project will significantly strengthen the energy infrastructure of the entire region , " mr putin said .
' deep gulf ' relations between russia and japan have been strained by the long-running dispute over four small islands off japan 's coast .
the islands , known as the southern kurils in russia and the northern territories in japan , were occupied by the soviet union after wwii .
russia has said it may surrender two of the islands , but japan wants all four returned .
because of the dispute , the two countries have never signed a peace treaty to formally end the war .
ahead of mr putin 's visit , mr koizumi admitted there was a " deep gulf " over the issue , and warned an agreement was unlikely to be reached in his talks with the russian leader .
mr putin has also warned that he would not discuss giving up control of the islands .
but he told the meeting that stronger economic relations between the two countries would improve their overall ties .
" i 'm confident that building stable , pragmatic long-term economic ties is being supported by politicians ' efforts to build a constructive partnership , " he said .
" this dialogue will contribute to more openness and confidence between our business communities . "
during mr putin 's three-day visit , the japanese government is expected to sign an agreement endorsing russia 's bid to join the world trade organisation .
for its part moscow has made sympathetic noises about japan 's own ambitions to become a permanent member of the un security council .

if left untreated , obstructive sleep apnoea could lead to potentially fatal road accidents , according to experts .
sufferers can experience obstructions of their airway during sleep , resulting in " fragmented " rest and excessive daytime drowsiness , they say .
the respironics study , to be featured on bbc1 's real story , looked at more than 900 drivers in england and wales .

birds flutter in the winter breeze and land on the dilapidated roof of the " white house " .
a peaceful scene .
but 13 years ago , this place , and especially the white house , witnessed some of the most horrific acts of the bosnian war .
" there was a roll-call at night and the men were taken out , " says muharem murselovic , 58 , a muslim businessman who spent more than two months at omarska , a former iron ore mine , in the summer of 1992 .
" they were beaten and tortured .
in the morning their bodies would be lying all around here on the grass . "
like hundreds of other muslims and croats from the area around the town of prijedor he was rounded up by bosnian serb soldiers at the start of the war and sent to the omarska camp .
" how could they do this ? "
muharem asks .
" neighbours , former school friends and work colleagues .
i do n't understand . "
but on the 10th anniversary of the dayton peace deal which ended the war , there are glimmers of hope here at omarska .
proof of change a memorial is to be built to the victims of the camp .
but what is different about this memorial is that , for the first time , members of all three communities - muslims , croats and serbs - are involved in the design of the project .
" this is a mainly serb area , but young serbs have got involved in the project , " says the reverend donald reeves , from soul of europe , a british charity that has been encouraging the reconciliation process in bosnia .
" they say we have to deal with this because our future is here .
they do n't want to be driven out and feel that this place has no soul to it , no spirit , no heart .
they feel justice has to be done . "
zoran ergarac , a local serb teacher who has been involved in the memorial designs , says it is time to face the past .
" there were many people who said bosnia will remain divided and that we are doomed to our ethnic clans and divisions , but this memorial site will prove that we are able to put our differences aside , " he says .
hopeful sign not everyone is happy with the memorial plans .
one worker at the iron mine told me it was not an appropriate place for a memorial because it was a working environment .
he described the plans as a " provocation " .
but the iron ore mine at omarska is working again , recently bought by the world 's biggest steel company mittal steel .
in a few months construction of the memorial , which will be based in and around the white house , should begin .
the fact that the project has got this far , and with the involvement of local serbs , shows how much bosnia-hercegovina has moved on from those dark days .
a decade after the war ended there is peace in bosnia .
many refugees have returned home , there is freedom of movement across the country and the international community has done much to bring former foes together .
some of those accused of crimes at omarska , and other camps , have been jailed .
milomir stakic , the former mayor of prijedor , was jailed for life for organising the setting up of detention centres in the region .
other cases are pending .
full reconciliation is a long way off - but what is being achieved at omarska is a sign of what can be done .

birds flutter in the winter breeze and land on the dilapidated roof of the " white house " .
a peaceful scene .
but 13 years ago , this place , and especially the white house , witnessed some of the most horrific acts of the bosnian war .
" there was a roll-call at night and the men were taken out , " says muharem murselovic , 58 , a muslim businessman who spent more than two months at omarska , a former iron ore mine , in the summer of 1992 .
" they were beaten and tortured .
in the morning their bodies would be lying all around here on the grass . "
like hundreds of other muslims and croats from the area around the town of prijedor he was rounded up by bosnian serb soldiers at the start of the war and sent to the omarska camp .
" how could they do this ? "
muharem asks .
" neighbours , former school friends and work colleagues .
i do n't understand . "
but on the 10th anniversary of the dayton peace deal which ended the war , there are glimmers of hope here at omarska .
proof of change before and after images of the bosnian war in pictures a memorial is to be built to the victims of the camp .
but what is different about this memorial is that , for the first time , members of all three communities - muslims , croats and serbs - are involved in the design of the project .
" this is a mainly serb area , but young serbs have got involved in the project , " says the reverend donald reeves , from soul of europe , a british charity that has been encouraging the reconciliation process in bosnia .
" they say we have to deal with this because our future is here .
they do n't want to be driven out and feel that this place has no soul to it , no spirit , no heart .
they feel justice has to be done . "
zoran ergarac , a local serb teacher who has been involved in the memorial designs , says it is time to face the past .
" there were many people who said bosnia will remain divided and that we are doomed to our ethnic clans and divisions , but this memorial site will prove that we are able to put our differences aside , " he says .
hopeful sign not everyone is happy with the memorial plans .
one worker at the iron mine told me it was not an appropriate place for a memorial because it was a working environment .
he described the plans as a " provocation " .
but the iron ore mine at omarska is working again , recently bought by the world 's biggest steel company mittal steel .
muharem murselovic is haunted by chilling memories in a few months construction of the memorial , which will be based in and around the white house , should begin .
the fact that the project has got this far , and with the involvement of local serbs , shows how much bosnia-hercegovina has moved on from those dark days .
a decade after the war ended there is peace in bosnia .
many refugees have returned home , there is freedom of movement across the country and the international community has done much to bring former foes together .
some of those accused of crimes at omarska , and other camps , have been jailed .
milomir stakic , the former mayor of prijedor , was jailed for life for organising the setting up of detention centres in the region .
other cases are pending .
full reconciliation is a long way off - but what is being achieved at omarska is a sign of what can be done .

the government wants a new commission for equality and human rights -lrb- cehr -rrb- to take responsibility for gender , race and disability discrimination .
but ken livingstone fears losing the commisson for racial equality -lrb- cre -rrb- could mean less money for race issues .
and he wants changes to the equality bill to ensure the commission has black and asian members .
mr livingstone said black and asian londoners should raise concerns with their mps , who will be voting on the bill next week .
' not acceptable ' he said disabled people had successfully lobbied for a disabled commissioner , and a disability committee at the cehr - and this should be extended to others represented by the commission .
" as lord ouseley has pointed out , the current proposals could end up creating an equality commission where all the commissioners are white men .
this is not acceptable , " he said .
the cre was the only one of the three current equality watchdogs to oppose the first plans for the cehr , which the government said would strengthen existing bodies .
but chairman trevor phillips later welcomed " improvements " made to the original white paper proposals .
the equal opportunities commission and the disability rights commission are expected to be merged into the cehr when it is formed in 2007 .
however , it is believed the cre will continue in its current form until 2009 .
ministers have said the creation of one equality body is an important part of a vision of a " more equal and cohesive society " and would , for the first time , provide institutional support for human rights .

the former bbc director general is employed as a " blue skies thinker " in the prime minister 's strategy unit .
but a commons committee has accused him of hampering its probe into strategic thinking and planning in government by refusing to answer its questions .
there was " resistance " from number 10 for advisers to appear despite earlier assurances they would do so , it said .
' ideally placed ' the bbc 's sean curran said the public administration select committee had wanted to know how mr blair identifies issues he wants to concentrate on and what happens as a result .
however , the cabinet office , on receiving the request for lord birt to appear , said the prime minister felt stephen aldridge , acting head of the strategy unit , was " best placed " to answer mps ' questions .
committee chairman tony wright then wrote to lord birt suggesting he was " ideally placed " to help the inquiry .
the peer had conducted a newspaper interview and an edinburgh television festival lecture , he noted .
" we would very much value your insight on how good strategy is made , " the labour mp wrote .
" i hope , therefore , we can now look forward to receiving a prompt , and positive , reply to our invitation . "
' strong resistance ' however lord birt , who had refused to appear before a transport committee two years ago despite being the prime minister 's transport adviser at the time , declined .
he replied : " as the acting director of the strategy unit , stephen is ideally placed to explain how strategic thinking is undertaken at the centre of government . "
the committee 's report said : " this is hampering , unnecessarily , the ability of parliament to undertake effective scrutiny .
" it is clear that there is strong resistance to the appearance of special advisers from number 10 downing street .
" we are disappointed that the prime minister appears to feel that there is no presumption that his own key advisers will appear before select committees when they are requested to do so , notwithstanding the general undertakings that have recently been given to select committees on this matter . "
cabinet minister peter hain has previously said there is a " presumption " that special advisers would give evidence to committees if asked .
this assurance came after the prime minister had promised to see what could be done .

the office will work to raise money for conservation programmes and improved facilities for visitors .
ex-army brigadier david innes , 52 , has been appointed to lead the office .
he said the cathedral was first and foremost a church , but was also a world heritage site and a major visitor attraction which needed looking after .
global appeal " it gets no government or state funding at all .
it gets no funding from english heritage , and therefore it has to be totally self sufficient in looking after itself , and that is quite a challenge , " he said .
mr innes said the cathedral raised enough money from visitor charges to fund the day-to-day maintenance .
however , it could not fund major conservation projects and the immediate priority was to replace the roof .
mr innes said he would be setting in place a major fundraising campaign which would be a global appeal .

phytophthora ramorum , known as " sudden oak death " , affects a variety of species and has been found at mount edgcumbe .
cases of the fungus-like pathogen were found in heligan in 2004 .
mount edgcumbe park manager ian berry said they were taking the disease outbreak very seriously .
susceptible plants mr berry said : " the infection was found in rhododendrons in woodlands after a defra inspection in september .
" the plants affected were cut out and burnt .
plants nearby are being removed and burnt on site to prevent its spread . "
he stressed that none of the park 's trees were affected .
he also added that no restrictions were being put on visitors to the park .
mr berry said : " we feel we can contain it without any need to impose restrictions like those during the 2001 foot-and-mouth outbreak . "
advanced symptoms the department for environment , food and rural affairs -lrb- defra -rrb- said it was concerned about any outbreak of the disease because it was responsible for the death of thousands of trees in coastal california .
defra said the disease had been found at 526 sites in england and wales .
the first confirmed outbreak of the disease in the uk was in april 2002 , but the native english oak is strangely not susceptible to the disease ; although other popular trees like beeches , conifers , spruces and firs are .
dying leaves are a classic sign of sudden oak death , but more advanced symptoms include the blistering of the trunk .
in the uk , it has mainly been found on rhododendron , viburnum and camellia plants , causing infection of shoots and leaves .
