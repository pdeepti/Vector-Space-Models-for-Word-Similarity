but just as the country remains divided socially and economically between east and west , german soccer is also split along similar lines . when the world cup kicks off in germany next summer , the eyes of the world will turn to the host nation . if everything goes to plan , the fifa 2006 world cup in germany will be more than just a spectacle of soccer ; it will be seen as an example of germany 's organizational prowess and a message to the world of what the once-divided nation can achieve now that east and west have been reunited . beyond the fanfares and flags , however , there 's another reality .
germany 's eastern and western regions are still far apart socially and economically and in some eyes , soccer has become a metaphor for the failure of the united germany . just as eastern business and industry have suffered since the fall of the berlin wall , so have the region 's soccer clubs .
east can not match west .
in the unified germany , where money governs professional sports , eastern teams have sunk without sponsors and investment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when hansa rostock was relegated on the final day of last season , it left the bundesliga ’ s top flight without any eastern representation .
in the first full domestic season after unification , hansa and dynamo dresden were launched into the top league of the bundesliga and six others into the second division .
things have changed radically since the 1991 campaign .
there are now no eastern teams in the first division and only four in the second . financial woes cause mediocrity once a proud and dominant team in the gdr , dynamo dresden has since dropped out of the professional game and those teams who survive find their finances slashed , unable to attract top-quality players .
the tv budget for the bundesliga has been slashed by 60 percent and the majority of the money generated gets shared out among the top clubs - all from the west - in the first division .
the rest is thrown like scraps to the teams in the second division .
beyond that , it 's every team for itself . just as unification led to a mass exodus of workers from the east to the west in the early 1990 's , many soccer players from the gdr headed for the more fashionable and lucrative western clubs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias sammer was the first player from the former gdr to play for the unified germany team .
the gdr production line , built on intensive technical and physical training , was so proficient that after unification , some 500 players joined western clubs .
by the mid-1990s , players like matthias sammer -lrb- photo , right -rrb- , jens jeremies , carsten jancker and alexander zickler had formed the backbone of the national team . " soccer was a great tool for celebrating the successes of eastern-bloc politics back in the days of the gdr , " said kirk schmidt , author of " ostkurve , " a study on the history of soccer in east germany . " the state ensured that the young players were given the best training possible in the hope that their successes would bring glory , " he said .
" this backfired when the communist regime fell .
the east had all these great players who then headed for the west and when the clubs found themselves losing money , they cashed in on anyone just to stay afloat . " state-supported training programs left to decay but now the well of sought-after soccer players in the east is now running dry .
that is not due to any lack of talent but rather because of a lack of financial support for youth programs and sports schools that , under the old communist regime , ensured talented youngsters would train twice a day , two hours at a time , and play regularly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's kevin kuranyi , michael ballack and bernd schneider , from left .
" the funding just dried up after 1990 , " schmidt said .

as a result , out of the 12 host cities featuring games during the championships , only two of those are in the east of the country - berlin and leipzig .
that is despite attempts " to keep a geographical balance , " according to david noemi from germany ’ s world cup organizing committee . fifteen years after reunification , questions are still being asked whether germany is working as a unified country or not .

germans still waiting for a new - or old - chancellor were left hanging once again when party leaders announced that any deal concerning the leadership of germany would not be completed before the weekend . many were expecting a result in the chancellery stand-off by late thursday evening after christian democrat -lrb- cdu -rrb- leader angela merkel , her bavarian ally edmund stoiber , head of the cdu 's sister party the christian social union , chancellor gerhard schröder and social democrat chief franz müntefering concluded their meeting scheduled for 19:00 utc . but earlier in the day , merkel announced that a deal would not be reached until the weekend , with more talks planned before sunday .
" i have informed -lrb- the party executive -rrb- there will be further decisions made in the leadership talks and also said there will probably not be decisions from these talks before sunday evening , " she told reporters after a meeting of cdu leaders . both she and spd leader franz müntefering said no further announcements were planned before the completion of talks , but they were confident a deal would be reached . müntefering said a decision on the chancellery would not be known until monday , when he would submit the outcome of the talks to the spd leadership .
" on monday we can say definitively who will be the next chancellor , " he said . cdu expects stubborn schröder to stand down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the conservatives expect schröder to eventually concede to merkel in their stand-off over who will head a new government . " we are a few hours away from a concession that will see angela merkel become the first woman to be german chancellor , " wolfgang bosbach , the deputy leader of the cdu parliamentary group , told national radio . günther beckstein , the interior minister of the conservative-run southern state of bavaria , said it was time for schröder 's party to accept that it had lost the election .
" either we have a woman chancellor or the talks fail , " he said . schröder has shown a stubbornness in the weeks following the sept .
18 election that suggest he will not go without a fight .
the chancellor has refused to concede defeat , even though the conservatives won four more seats in parliament . however , earlier this week schröder hinted he may give up the post he has held since 1998 , saying he would not stop the creation of a stable government . in a statement of support , spd chief müntefering said it was still the party 's aim to keep schröder in the chancellery but his tone was less belligerent than that used by the social democrats in recent days .
" the party wants him as chancellor .
we 'll fight for that and argue for it and hold talks , " he said . opposition to merkel waning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many attending the meeting of party leaders during the day on thursday said that previously strong spd objections to supporting merkel as chancellor were softening .
merkel 's most ardent critic in the social democrats , ludwig stiegler , deputy head of the parliamentary party , was being isolated in the discussions , sources told reuters . despite the stalemate over who will lead germany , it looks increasingly likely that the two main parties will find consensus to form a grand coalition .
neither merkel 's conservatives nor schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- won a majority with their preferred allies in the election . grand coalition getting closer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two parties have softened their tone in reference to the possibility of a red-black coalition in recent days with comments hinting at a closing of the gap between their differences .
both the cdu and spd appear to agree on the need to bring germany 's escalating deficit back under eu limits , unravel the mess of conflicting state and federal powers and simplify germany 's notoriously complex tax code . news that a working government may finally soon be in place is good news for both the euro and german shares .
the european union has been on tenterhooks over germany 's power struggle with the knock-on effect affecting the single currency .
financial markets have also banked on a new government tackling economic reforms and will be relieved to hear that this goal will be one shared by whoever takes the reins . transition to new government to be far from smooth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but barriers remain .
the social democrats are still refusing to give in to the conservatives on plans to ease hiring and firing rules , loosen the system of sector-wide pay deals and on reforms to health insurance funding .
whatever deals are struck over the coming days , the transition to a new government will be far from smooth . " i 'm afraid the negotiations are more likely to last three weeks than two , " said christian wulff , conservative state premier of lower saxony , " but if they 're good negotiations with a good result , then the old rule applies : thoroughness before speed .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 06.10.2005 divisions in soccer mirror germany 's ills großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : since east beat west 1-0 in 1974 , germany 's soccer divide has grown germany is presenting a united front as host nation for soccer 's world cup .
but just as the country remains divided socially and economically between east and west , german soccer is also split along similar lines . when the world cup kicks off in germany next summer , the eyes of the world will turn to the host nation . if everything goes to plan , the fifa 2006 world cup in germany will be more than just a spectacle of soccer ; it will be seen as an example of germany 's organizational prowess and a message to the world of what the once-divided nation can achieve now that east and west have been reunited . beyond the fanfares and flags , however , there 's another reality .
germany 's eastern and western regions are still far apart socially and economically and in some eyes , soccer has become a metaphor for the failure of the united germany . just as eastern business and industry have suffered since the fall of the berlin wall , so have the region 's soccer clubs .
east can not match west .
in the unified germany , where money governs professional sports , eastern teams have sunk without sponsors and investment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when hansa rostock was relegated on the final day of last season , it left the bundesliga ’ s top flight without any eastern representation .
in the first full domestic season after unification , hansa and dynamo dresden were launched into the top league of the bundesliga and six others into the second division .
things have changed radically since the 1991 campaign .
there are now no eastern teams in the first division and only four in the second . financial woes cause mediocrity once a proud and dominant team in the gdr , dynamo dresden has since dropped out of the professional game and those teams who survive find their finances slashed , unable to attract top-quality players .
the tv budget for the bundesliga has been slashed by 60 percent and the majority of the money generated gets shared out among the top clubs - all from the west - in the first division .
the rest is thrown like scraps to the teams in the second division .
beyond that , it 's every team for itself . just as unification led to a mass exodus of workers from the east to the west in the early 1990 's , many soccer players from the gdr headed for the more fashionable and lucrative western clubs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias sammer was the first player from the former gdr to play for the unified germany team .
the gdr production line , built on intensive technical and physical training , was so proficient that after unification , some 500 players joined western clubs .
by the mid-1990s , players like matthias sammer -lrb- photo , right -rrb- , jens jeremies , carsten jancker and alexander zickler had formed the backbone of the national team . " soccer was a great tool for celebrating the successes of eastern-bloc politics back in the days of the gdr , " said kirk schmidt , author of " ostkurve , " a study on the history of soccer in east germany . " the state ensured that the young players were given the best training possible in the hope that their successes would bring glory , " he said .
" this backfired when the communist regime fell .
the east had all these great players who then headed for the west and when the clubs found themselves losing money , they cashed in on anyone just to stay afloat . " state-supported training programs left to decay but now the well of sought-after soccer players in the east is now running dry .
that is not due to any lack of talent but rather because of a lack of financial support for youth programs and sports schools that , under the old communist regime , ensured talented youngsters would train twice a day , two hours at a time , and play regularly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's kevin kuranyi , michael ballack and bernd schneider , from left .
" the funding just dried up after 1990 , " schmidt said .
" that 's why the bundesliga and the national team have so few prominent eastern players .
people like -lrb- bayern munich 's -rrb- michael ballack and -lrb- bayer leverkusen 's -rrb- bernd schneider were already on their way by then .
others were n't so lucky .
the old gdr education system was allowed to decay . " economic stagnation rules out cities from showpiece bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leipzig will have a new stadium for the 2006 world cup after coming up with the necessary money to be awarded host city status .
such is the poor condition of some eastern cities ' finances that some - including dresden , the state capital of saxony - which applied for world cup 2006 host city status failed to conform to world cup directives set out by fifa , world soccer 's governing body , in areas such as transport facilities and overall infrastructure .
as a result , out of the 12 host cities featuring games during the championships , only two of those are in the east of the country - berlin and leipzig .
that is despite attempts " to keep a geographical balance , " according to david noemi from germany ’ s world cup organizing committee . fifteen years after reunification , questions are still being asked whether germany is working as a unified country or not .
in german soccer the answer is fairly clear .
there may be no physical walls between them anymore but a divide certainly remains between east and west when it comes to all aspects of the beautiful game . nick amies , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de east germany 's star quality in question bfc dynamo berlin were once the top soccer team in east germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 06.10.2005 divisions in soccer mirror germany 's ills großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : since east beat west 1-0 in 1974 , germany 's soccer divide has grown germany is presenting a united front as host nation for soccer 's world cup .
but just as the country remains divided socially and economically between east and west , german soccer is also split along similar lines . when the world cup kicks off in germany next summer , the eyes of the world will turn to the host nation . if everything goes to plan , the fifa 2006 world cup in germany will be more than just a spectacle of soccer ; it will be seen as an example of germany 's organizational prowess and a message to the world of what the once-divided nation can achieve now that east and west have been reunited . beyond the fanfares and flags , however , there 's another reality .
germany 's eastern and western regions are still far apart socially and economically and in some eyes , soccer has become a metaphor for the failure of the united germany . just as eastern business and industry have suffered since the fall of the berlin wall , so have the region 's soccer clubs .
east can not match west .
in the unified germany , where money governs professional sports , eastern teams have sunk without sponsors and investment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when hansa rostock was relegated on the final day of last season , it left the bundesliga ’ s top flight without any eastern representation .
in the first full domestic season after unification , hansa and dynamo dresden were launched into the top league of the bundesliga and six others into the second division .
things have changed radically since the 1991 campaign .
there are now no eastern teams in the first division and only four in the second . financial woes cause mediocrity once a proud and dominant team in the gdr , dynamo dresden has since dropped out of the professional game and those teams who survive find their finances slashed , unable to attract top-quality players .
the tv budget for the bundesliga has been slashed by 60 percent and the majority of the money generated gets shared out among the top clubs - all from the west - in the first division .
the rest is thrown like scraps to the teams in the second division .
beyond that , it 's every team for itself . just as unification led to a mass exodus of workers from the east to the west in the early 1990 's , many soccer players from the gdr headed for the more fashionable and lucrative western clubs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias sammer was the first player from the former gdr to play for the unified germany team .
the gdr production line , built on intensive technical and physical training , was so proficient that after unification , some 500 players joined western clubs .
by the mid-1990s , players like matthias sammer -lrb- photo , right -rrb- , jens jeremies , carsten jancker and alexander zickler had formed the backbone of the national team . " soccer was a great tool for celebrating the successes of eastern-bloc politics back in the days of the gdr , " said kirk schmidt , author of " ostkurve , " a study on the history of soccer in east germany . " the state ensured that the young players were given the best training possible in the hope that their successes would bring glory , " he said .
" this backfired when the communist regime fell .
the east had all these great players who then headed for the west and when the clubs found themselves losing money , they cashed in on anyone just to stay afloat . " state-supported training programs left to decay but now the well of sought-after soccer players in the east is now running dry .
that is not due to any lack of talent but rather because of a lack of financial support for youth programs and sports schools that , under the old communist regime , ensured talented youngsters would train twice a day , two hours at a time , and play regularly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's kevin kuranyi , michael ballack and bernd schneider , from left .
" the funding just dried up after 1990 , " schmidt said .
" that 's why the bundesliga and the national team have so few prominent eastern players .
people like -lrb- bayern munich 's -rrb- michael ballack and -lrb- bayer leverkusen 's -rrb- bernd schneider were already on their way by then .
others were n't so lucky .
the old gdr education system was allowed to decay . " economic stagnation rules out cities from showpiece bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leipzig will have a new stadium for the 2006 world cup after coming up with the necessary money to be awarded host city status .
such is the poor condition of some eastern cities ' finances that some - including dresden , the state capital of saxony - which applied for world cup 2006 host city status failed to conform to world cup directives set out by fifa , world soccer 's governing body , in areas such as transport facilities and overall infrastructure .
as a result , out of the 12 host cities featuring games during the championships , only two of those are in the east of the country - berlin and leipzig .
that is despite attempts " to keep a geographical balance , " according to david noemi from germany ’ s world cup organizing committee . fifteen years after reunification , questions are still being asked whether germany is working as a unified country or not .
in german soccer the answer is fairly clear .
there may be no physical walls between them anymore but a divide certainly remains between east and west when it comes to all aspects of the beautiful game . nick amies , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de east germany 's star quality in question bfc dynamo berlin were once the top soccer team in east germany .
now they want to be honored appropriately for its success .
yet the club 's demands raise a few questions about fairness - both on and off the field .

germans still waiting for a new - or old - chancellor were left hanging once again when party leaders announced that any deal concerning the leadership of germany would not be completed before the weekend . many were expecting a result in the chancellery stand-off by late thursday evening after christian democrat -lrb- cdu -rrb- leader angela merkel , her bavarian ally edmund stoiber , head of the cdu 's sister party the christian social union , chancellor gerhard schröder and social democrat chief franz müntefering concluded their meeting scheduled for 19:00 utc . but earlier in the day , merkel announced that a deal would not be reached until the weekend , with more talks planned before sunday .
" i have informed -lrb- the party executive -rrb- there will be further decisions made in the leadership talks and also said there will probably not be decisions from these talks before sunday evening , " she told reporters after a meeting of cdu leaders . both she and spd leader franz müntefering said no further announcements were planned before the completion of talks , but they were confident a deal would be reached . müntefering said a decision on the chancellery would not be known until monday , when he would submit the outcome of the talks to the spd leadership .
" on monday we can say definitively who will be the next chancellor , " he said . cdu expects stubborn schröder to stand down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the conservatives expect schröder to eventually concede to merkel in their stand-off over who will head a new government . " we are a few hours away from a concession that will see angela merkel become the first woman to be german chancellor , " wolfgang bosbach , the deputy leader of the cdu parliamentary group , told national radio . günther beckstein , the interior minister of the conservative-run southern state of bavaria , said it was time for schröder 's party to accept that it had lost the election .
" either we have a woman chancellor or the talks fail , " he said . schröder has shown a stubbornness in the weeks following the sept .
18 election that suggest he will not go without a fight .
the chancellor has refused to concede defeat , even though the conservatives won four more seats in parliament . however , earlier this week schröder hinted he may give up the post he has held since 1998 , saying he would not stop the creation of a stable government . in a statement of support , spd chief müntefering said it was still the party 's aim to keep schröder in the chancellery but his tone was less belligerent than that used by the social democrats in recent days .
" the party wants him as chancellor .
we 'll fight for that and argue for it and hold talks , " he said . opposition to merkel waning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many attending the meeting of party leaders during the day on thursday said that previously strong spd objections to supporting merkel as chancellor were softening .
merkel 's most ardent critic in the social democrats , ludwig stiegler , deputy head of the parliamentary party , was being isolated in the discussions , sources told reuters . despite the stalemate over who will lead germany , it looks increasingly likely that the two main parties will find consensus to form a grand coalition .
neither merkel 's conservatives nor schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- won a majority with their preferred allies in the election . grand coalition getting closer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two parties have softened their tone in reference to the possibility of a red-black coalition in recent days with comments hinting at a closing of the gap between their differences .
both the cdu and spd appear to agree on the need to bring germany 's escalating deficit back under eu limits , unravel the mess of conflicting state and federal powers and simplify germany 's notoriously complex tax code . news that a working government may finally soon be in place is good news for both the euro and german shares .
the european union has been on tenterhooks over germany 's power struggle with the knock-on effect affecting the single currency .
financial markets have also banked on a new government tackling economic reforms and will be relieved to hear that this goal will be one shared by whoever takes the reins . transition to new government to be far from smooth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but barriers remain .
the social democrats are still refusing to give in to the conservatives on plans to ease hiring and firing rules , loosen the system of sector-wide pay deals and on reforms to health insurance funding .
whatever deals are struck over the coming days , the transition to a new government will be far from smooth . " i 'm afraid the negotiations are more likely to last three weeks than two , " said christian wulff , conservative state premier of lower saxony , " but if they 're good negotiations with a good result , then the old rule applies : thoroughness before speed . " dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rivals to tackle chancellor issue thursday germany 's two main parties will meet on thursday to thrash out who will lead a coalition government to break germany 's political deadlock following inconclusive elections , party sources said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 06.10.2005 divisions in soccer mirror germany 's ills großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : since east beat west 1-0 in 1974 , germany 's soccer divide has grown germany is presenting a united front as host nation for soccer 's world cup .
but just as the country remains divided socially and economically between east and west , german soccer is also split along similar lines . when the world cup kicks off in germany next summer , the eyes of the world will turn to the host nation . if everything goes to plan , the fifa 2006 world cup in germany will be more than just a spectacle of soccer ; it will be seen as an example of germany 's organizational prowess and a message to the world of what the once-divided nation can achieve now that east and west have been reunited . beyond the fanfares and flags , however , there 's another reality .
germany 's eastern and western regions are still far apart socially and economically and in some eyes , soccer has become a metaphor for the failure of the united germany . just as eastern business and industry have suffered since the fall of the berlin wall , so have the region 's soccer clubs .
east can not match west .
in the unified germany , where money governs professional sports , eastern teams have sunk without sponsors and investment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when hansa rostock was relegated on the final day of last season , it left the bundesliga ’ s top flight without any eastern representation .
in the first full domestic season after unification , hansa and dynamo dresden were launched into the top league of the bundesliga and six others into the second division .
things have changed radically since the 1991 campaign .
there are now no eastern teams in the first division and only four in the second . financial woes cause mediocrity once a proud and dominant team in the gdr , dynamo dresden has since dropped out of the professional game and those teams who survive find their finances slashed , unable to attract top-quality players .
the tv budget for the bundesliga has been slashed by 60 percent and the majority of the money generated gets shared out among the top clubs - all from the west - in the first division .
the rest is thrown like scraps to the teams in the second division .
beyond that , it 's every team for itself . just as unification led to a mass exodus of workers from the east to the west in the early 1990 's , many soccer players from the gdr headed for the more fashionable and lucrative western clubs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias sammer was the first player from the former gdr to play for the unified germany team .
the gdr production line , built on intensive technical and physical training , was so proficient that after unification , some 500 players joined western clubs .
by the mid-1990s , players like matthias sammer -lrb- photo , right -rrb- , jens jeremies , carsten jancker and alexander zickler had formed the backbone of the national team . " soccer was a great tool for celebrating the successes of eastern-bloc politics back in the days of the gdr , " said kirk schmidt , author of " ostkurve , " a study on the history of soccer in east germany . " the state ensured that the young players were given the best training possible in the hope that their successes would bring glory , " he said .
" this backfired when the communist regime fell .
the east had all these great players who then headed for the west and when the clubs found themselves losing money , they cashed in on anyone just to stay afloat . " state-supported training programs left to decay but now the well of sought-after soccer players in the east is now running dry .
that is not due to any lack of talent but rather because of a lack of financial support for youth programs and sports schools that , under the old communist regime , ensured talented youngsters would train twice a day , two hours at a time , and play regularly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's kevin kuranyi , michael ballack and bernd schneider , from left .
" the funding just dried up after 1990 , " schmidt said .
" that 's why the bundesliga and the national team have so few prominent eastern players .
people like -lrb- bayern munich 's -rrb- michael ballack and -lrb- bayer leverkusen 's -rrb- bernd schneider were already on their way by then .
others were n't so lucky .
the old gdr education system was allowed to decay . " economic stagnation rules out cities from showpiece bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leipzig will have a new stadium for the 2006 world cup after coming up with the necessary money to be awarded host city status .
such is the poor condition of some eastern cities ' finances that some - including dresden , the state capital of saxony - which applied for world cup 2006 host city status failed to conform to world cup directives set out by fifa , world soccer 's governing body , in areas such as transport facilities and overall infrastructure .
as a result , out of the 12 host cities featuring games during the championships , only two of those are in the east of the country - berlin and leipzig .
that is despite attempts " to keep a geographical balance , " according to david noemi from germany ’ s world cup organizing committee . fifteen years after reunification , questions are still being asked whether germany is working as a unified country or not .
in german soccer the answer is fairly clear .
there may be no physical walls between them anymore but a divide certainly remains between east and west when it comes to all aspects of the beautiful game . nick amies , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de east germany 's star quality in question bfc dynamo berlin were once the top soccer team in east germany .

germans still waiting for a new - or old - chancellor were left hanging once again when party leaders announced that any deal concerning the leadership of germany would not be completed before the weekend . many were expecting a result in the chancellery stand-off by late thursday evening after christian democrat -lrb- cdu -rrb- leader angela merkel , her bavarian ally edmund stoiber , head of the cdu 's sister party the christian social union , chancellor gerhard schröder and social democrat chief franz müntefering concluded their meeting scheduled for 19:00 utc . but earlier in the day , merkel announced that a deal would not be reached until the weekend , with more talks planned before sunday .
" i have informed -lrb- the party executive -rrb- there will be further decisions made in the leadership talks and also said there will probably not be decisions from these talks before sunday evening , " she told reporters after a meeting of cdu leaders . both she and spd leader franz müntefering said no further announcements were planned before the completion of talks , but they were confident a deal would be reached . müntefering said a decision on the chancellery would not be known until monday , when he would submit the outcome of the talks to the spd leadership .
" on monday we can say definitively who will be the next chancellor , " he said . cdu expects stubborn schröder to stand down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the conservatives expect schröder to eventually concede to merkel in their stand-off over who will head a new government . " we are a few hours away from a concession that will see angela merkel become the first woman to be german chancellor , " wolfgang bosbach , the deputy leader of the cdu parliamentary group , told national radio . günther beckstein , the interior minister of the conservative-run southern state of bavaria , said it was time for schröder 's party to accept that it had lost the election .
" either we have a woman chancellor or the talks fail , " he said . schröder has shown a stubbornness in the weeks following the sept .
18 election that suggest he will not go without a fight .
the chancellor has refused to concede defeat , even though the conservatives won four more seats in parliament . however , earlier this week schröder hinted he may give up the post he has held since 1998 , saying he would not stop the creation of a stable government . in a statement of support , spd chief müntefering said it was still the party 's aim to keep schröder in the chancellery but his tone was less belligerent than that used by the social democrats in recent days .
" the party wants him as chancellor .
we 'll fight for that and argue for it and hold talks , " he said . opposition to merkel waning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many attending the meeting of party leaders during the day on thursday said that previously strong spd objections to supporting merkel as chancellor were softening .
merkel 's most ardent critic in the social democrats , ludwig stiegler , deputy head of the parliamentary party , was being isolated in the discussions , sources told reuters . despite the stalemate over who will lead germany , it looks increasingly likely that the two main parties will find consensus to form a grand coalition .
neither merkel 's conservatives nor schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- won a majority with their preferred allies in the election . grand coalition getting closer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two parties have softened their tone in reference to the possibility of a red-black coalition in recent days with comments hinting at a closing of the gap between their differences .
both the cdu and spd appear to agree on the need to bring germany 's escalating deficit back under eu limits , unravel the mess of conflicting state and federal powers and simplify germany 's notoriously complex tax code . news that a working government may finally soon be in place is good news for both the euro and german shares .
the european union has been on tenterhooks over germany 's power struggle with the knock-on effect affecting the single currency .
financial markets have also banked on a new government tackling economic reforms and will be relieved to hear that this goal will be one shared by whoever takes the reins . transition to new government to be far from smooth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but barriers remain .
the social democrats are still refusing to give in to the conservatives on plans to ease hiring and firing rules , loosen the system of sector-wide pay deals and on reforms to health insurance funding .
whatever deals are struck over the coming days , the transition to a new government will be far from smooth . " i 'm afraid the negotiations are more likely to last three weeks than two , " said christian wulff , conservative state premier of lower saxony , " but if they 're good negotiations with a good result , then the old rule applies : thoroughness before speed .

but just as the country remains divided socially and economically between east and west , german soccer is also split along similar lines . when the world cup kicks off in germany next summer , the eyes of the world will turn to the host nation . if everything goes to plan , the fifa 2006 world cup in germany will be more than just a spectacle of soccer ; it will be seen as an example of germany 's organizational prowess and a message to the world of what the once-divided nation can achieve now that east and west have been reunited . beyond the fanfares and flags , however , there 's another reality .
germany 's eastern and western regions are still far apart socially and economically and in some eyes , soccer has become a metaphor for the failure of the united germany . just as eastern business and industry have suffered since the fall of the berlin wall , so have the region 's soccer clubs .
east can not match west .
in the unified germany , where money governs professional sports , eastern teams have sunk without sponsors and investment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when hansa rostock was relegated on the final day of last season , it left the bundesliga ’ s top flight without any eastern representation .
in the first full domestic season after unification , hansa and dynamo dresden were launched into the top league of the bundesliga and six others into the second division .
things have changed radically since the 1991 campaign .
there are now no eastern teams in the first division and only four in the second . financial woes cause mediocrity once a proud and dominant team in the gdr , dynamo dresden has since dropped out of the professional game and those teams who survive find their finances slashed , unable to attract top-quality players .
the tv budget for the bundesliga has been slashed by 60 percent and the majority of the money generated gets shared out among the top clubs - all from the west - in the first division .
the rest is thrown like scraps to the teams in the second division .
beyond that , it 's every team for itself . just as unification led to a mass exodus of workers from the east to the west in the early 1990 's , many soccer players from the gdr headed for the more fashionable and lucrative western clubs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias sammer was the first player from the former gdr to play for the unified germany team .
the gdr production line , built on intensive technical and physical training , was so proficient that after unification , some 500 players joined western clubs .
by the mid-1990s , players like matthias sammer -lrb- photo , right -rrb- , jens jeremies , carsten jancker and alexander zickler had formed the backbone of the national team . " soccer was a great tool for celebrating the successes of eastern-bloc politics back in the days of the gdr , " said kirk schmidt , author of " ostkurve , " a study on the history of soccer in east germany . " the state ensured that the young players were given the best training possible in the hope that their successes would bring glory , " he said .
" this backfired when the communist regime fell .
the east had all these great players who then headed for the west and when the clubs found themselves losing money , they cashed in on anyone just to stay afloat . " state-supported training programs left to decay but now the well of sought-after soccer players in the east is now running dry .
that is not due to any lack of talent but rather because of a lack of financial support for youth programs and sports schools that , under the old communist regime , ensured talented youngsters would train twice a day , two hours at a time , and play regularly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's kevin kuranyi , michael ballack and bernd schneider , from left .
" the funding just dried up after 1990 , " schmidt said .
" that 's why the bundesliga and the national team have so few prominent eastern players .
people like -lrb- bayern munich 's -rrb- michael ballack and -lrb- bayer leverkusen 's -rrb- bernd schneider were already on their way by then .
others were n't so lucky .
the old gdr education system was allowed to decay . " economic stagnation rules out cities from showpiece bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leipzig will have a new stadium for the 2006 world cup after coming up with the necessary money to be awarded host city status .
such is the poor condition of some eastern cities ' finances that some - including dresden , the state capital of saxony - which applied for world cup 2006 host city status failed to conform to world cup directives set out by fifa , world soccer 's governing body , in areas such as transport facilities and overall infrastructure .
as a result , out of the 12 host cities featuring games during the championships , only two of those are in the east of the country - berlin and leipzig .
that is despite attempts " to keep a geographical balance , " according to david noemi from germany ’ s world cup organizing committee . fifteen years after reunification , questions are still being asked whether germany is working as a unified country or not .
in german soccer the answer is fairly clear .
there may be no physical walls between them anymore but a divide certainly remains between east and west when it comes to all aspects of the beautiful game . nick amies , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de east germany 's star quality in question bfc dynamo berlin were once the top soccer team in east germany .
now they want to be honored appropriately for its success .

but just as the country remains divided socially and economically between east and west , german soccer is also split along similar lines . when the world cup kicks off in germany next summer , the eyes of the world will turn to the host nation . if everything goes to plan , the fifa 2006 world cup in germany will be more than just a spectacle of soccer ; it will be seen as an example of germany 's organizational prowess and a message to the world of what the once-divided nation can achieve now that east and west have been reunited . beyond the fanfares and flags , however , there 's another reality .
germany 's eastern and western regions are still far apart socially and economically and in some eyes , soccer has become a metaphor for the failure of the united germany . just as eastern business and industry have suffered since the fall of the berlin wall , so have the region 's soccer clubs .
east can not match west .
in the unified germany , where money governs professional sports , eastern teams have sunk without sponsors and investment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when hansa rostock was relegated on the final day of last season , it left the bundesliga ’ s top flight without any eastern representation .
in the first full domestic season after unification , hansa and dynamo dresden were launched into the top league of the bundesliga and six others into the second division .
things have changed radically since the 1991 campaign .
there are now no eastern teams in the first division and only four in the second . financial woes cause mediocrity once a proud and dominant team in the gdr , dynamo dresden has since dropped out of the professional game and those teams who survive find their finances slashed , unable to attract top-quality players .
the tv budget for the bundesliga has been slashed by 60 percent and the majority of the money generated gets shared out among the top clubs - all from the west - in the first division .
the rest is thrown like scraps to the teams in the second division .
beyond that , it 's every team for itself . just as unification led to a mass exodus of workers from the east to the west in the early 1990 's , many soccer players from the gdr headed for the more fashionable and lucrative western clubs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias sammer was the first player from the former gdr to play for the unified germany team .
the gdr production line , built on intensive technical and physical training , was so proficient that after unification , some 500 players joined western clubs .
by the mid-1990s , players like matthias sammer -lrb- photo , right -rrb- , jens jeremies , carsten jancker and alexander zickler had formed the backbone of the national team . " soccer was a great tool for celebrating the successes of eastern-bloc politics back in the days of the gdr , " said kirk schmidt , author of " ostkurve , " a study on the history of soccer in east germany . " the state ensured that the young players were given the best training possible in the hope that their successes would bring glory , " he said .
" this backfired when the communist regime fell .
the east had all these great players who then headed for the west and when the clubs found themselves losing money , they cashed in on anyone just to stay afloat . " state-supported training programs left to decay but now the well of sought-after soccer players in the east is now running dry .
that is not due to any lack of talent but rather because of a lack of financial support for youth programs and sports schools that , under the old communist regime , ensured talented youngsters would train twice a day , two hours at a time , and play regularly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's kevin kuranyi , michael ballack and bernd schneider , from left .
" the funding just dried up after 1990 , " schmidt said .
" that 's why the bundesliga and the national team have so few prominent eastern players .
people like -lrb- bayern munich 's -rrb- michael ballack and -lrb- bayer leverkusen 's -rrb- bernd schneider were already on their way by then .
others were n't so lucky .
the old gdr education system was allowed to decay . " economic stagnation rules out cities from showpiece bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leipzig will have a new stadium for the 2006 world cup after coming up with the necessary money to be awarded host city status .
such is the poor condition of some eastern cities ' finances that some - including dresden , the state capital of saxony - which applied for world cup 2006 host city status failed to conform to world cup directives set out by fifa , world soccer 's governing body , in areas such as transport facilities and overall infrastructure .
as a result , out of the 12 host cities featuring games during the championships , only two of those are in the east of the country - berlin and leipzig .
that is despite attempts " to keep a geographical balance , " according to david noemi from germany ’ s world cup organizing committee . fifteen years after reunification , questions are still being asked whether germany is working as a unified country or not .
in german soccer the answer is fairly clear .
there may be no physical walls between them anymore but a divide certainly remains between east and west when it comes to all aspects of the beautiful game . nick amies , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de east germany 's star quality in question bfc dynamo berlin were once the top soccer team in east germany .

hours later , up to 1,500 mounted a fresh attempt to push through the border . " in the coming days , probably tomorrow , it is possible that there will be a repatriation of illegal immigrants -lrb- to morocco -rrb- , " said deputy prime minister maria teresa fernandez de la vega .
" this is an exceptional decision because it will be a first . " in the coming days we will work to begin reactivating the 1992 accord between spain and morocco on the control of migration , which has never been applied , " she added in a public statement . just a few hours after the comments were made up to 1,500 would-be immigrants mounted a fresh assault on spain 's north african enclave of melilla early thursday morning . but none of them were successful breaking through spain 's defenses , according to the police . " there 's been an assault which has been repelled by moroccan and spanish forces , " a police spokesman told reuters .
" no one got in . " sharp i n crease recent months have seen a sharp increase of such incidents in the spanish enclaves of melilla and ceuta , involving people from many african countries determined to escape poverty and start a new life in europe . the latest assault took place in the pinares de rostrogordo zone where the perimeter fence has yet to be raised from three to six meters -lrb- 10 to 20 feet -rrb- high , as is the case around the rest of the enclave , according to private spanish radio cadena ser . bildunterschrift : illegal immigrants in front of the melilla police station after they attempted to jump over the border fence medics in the zone treated many immigrants for cuts and bruises , and two were still under observation , police said , adding that two police members had also been injured .
about 15 immigrants had to have plaster casts applied . fernandez de la vega planned to travel to melilla late wednesday and then on to ceuta on thursday .
earlier wednesday , she met the conservative local government chiefs of melilla and ceuta , who have strongly criticized the administration 's management of the crisis .
they urged zapatero to reaffirm madrid 's sovereignty in the two enclaves .
seve n would-be immigra n ts dead the latest immigrant invasion took place before dawn , the day after local melilla government official jose fernandez charcon announced that a third metal barrier would be set up to reinforce the border with morocco . eu justice and security commissioner franco frattini on tuesday said the bloc would shortly be sending a technical mission to investigate the worsening situation on the southern coast of the mediterranean .
bildunterschrift : spanish soldiers leave the rostrogordo area of the border between spain and morocco in spanish enclave of melilla seven african would-be immigrants have died since the beginning of the summer during similar assaults , including five in ceuta last thursday .
on monday , 135 people were injured when around 650 stormed melilla .
some 300 people broke into the same enclave in two mass stormings of the barrier , involving about 1,000 people , in a similar incident . spain has recently been accelerating plans to raise the border fence , equipped with infrared cameras and movement detectors , while morocco is increasing police operations in forests bordering the enclaves .
the earlier decision to beef up the barriers is believed to be behind the heavy immigrant influx recently . after wednesday 's incident , moroccan police arrested 85 immigrants , including 13 women , bringing the total number of such arrests since the beginning of the year to 6,167 . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a german amnesty for illegal immigrants ?

" i never , under any circumstances , talk about sources , neither with editors , nor with prosecutors , nor with judges , " schirra told reuters .

the gdr production line , built on intensive technical and physical training , was so proficient that after unification , some 500 players joined western clubs .

" soccer was a great tool for celebrating the successes of eastern-bloc politics back in the days of the gdr , " said kirk schmidt , author of " ostkurve , " a study on the history of soccer in east germany . " the state ensured that the young players were given the best training possible in the hope that their successes would bring glory , " he said .
" this backfired when the communist regime fell .
the east had all these great players who then headed for the west and when the clubs found themselves losing money , they cashed in on anyone just to stay afloat . " state-supported training programs left to decay but now the well of sought-after soccer players in the east is now running dry .
that is not due to any lack of talent but rather because of a lack of financial support for youth programs and sports schools that , under the old communist regime , ensured talented youngsters would train twice a day , two hours at a time , and play regularly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's kevin kuranyi , michael ballack and bernd schneider , from left .

but just as the country remains divided socially and economically between east and west , german soccer is also split along similar lines . when the world cup kicks off in germany next summer , the eyes of the world will turn to the host nation . if everything goes to plan , the fifa 2006 world cup in germany will be more than just a spectacle of soccer ; it will be seen as an example of germany 's organizational prowess and a message to the world of what the once-divided nation can achieve now that east and west have been reunited . beyond the fanfares and flags , however , there 's another reality .
germany 's eastern and western regions are still far apart socially and economically and in some eyes , soccer has become a metaphor for the failure of the united germany . just as eastern business and industry have suffered since the fall of the berlin wall , so have the region 's soccer clubs .
east can not match west .
in the unified germany , where money governs professional sports , eastern teams have sunk without sponsors and investment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when hansa rostock was relegated on the final day of last season , it left the bundesliga ’ s top flight without any eastern representation .
in the first full domestic season after unification , hansa and dynamo dresden were launched into the top league of the bundesliga and six others into the second division .
things have changed radically since the 1991 campaign .
there are now no eastern teams in the first division and only four in the second . financial woes cause mediocrity once a proud and dominant team in the gdr , dynamo dresden has since dropped out of the professional game and those teams who survive find their finances slashed , unable to attract top-quality players .

" in the 21st century , one of our most important challenges is to find ways to manage migration for the benefit of all - of sending countries , receiving countries , transit countries and migrants themselves , " un secretary general kofi annan said at the launch of the report .
" i agree with the commission that we are not rising to the challenge yet .
but i am convinced we must do so , " reuters quoted annan as saying . after the united states and russia , germany had the third greatest number of migrants , 7.3 million , 4.2 percent of the world 's migrants , in 2000 .

germany 's interior minister has been asked to explain why police searched a journalist 's home and his magazine 's office in raids .
the incident has sparked a debate over press freedom . german interior minister otto schily will appear before parliament 's home affairs committee , his office said , in a hearing expected to take place next week . the opposition liberal free democrats demanded the hearing .
their parliamentary business manager jürgen koppelin described the police raids last month as " politically questionable and constitutionally dubious .

" i never , under any circumstances , talk about sources , neither with editors , nor with prosecutors , nor with judges , " schirra told reuters . " with a very flimsy pretext , the state broke into my house and emtied it , " he added .
" i call that gagging press freedom .

" the security council is expected to take up the issue in the second half of this month . impleme n ti n g democratic sta n dards since he was appointed un secretary general 's special envoy to kosovo in june , ambassador kai eide of norway has had extensive consultations in serbia and kosovo , as well as with key member states and regional organizations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un special envoy to kosovo , kai eide , has promised an objective report eide 's report focused on progress made in implementing democratic standards in the un-run province . the standards , whose implementation is being sought by the international community , cover targets to foster trust between majority albanians and minority serbs in such areas as building democratic institutions , enforcing minority rights , creating a functioning economy and establishing an impartial legal system . status before sta n dards ? in february , annan 's special representative for kosovo , soren jessen-petersen , told the security council there were good chances that the process leading to final status talks could begin in the second half of this year although none of the necessary standards for such a move had then yet been fulfilled . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : head of the un mission in kosovo , soren jessen petersen , does not deny that there are defficiencies in the process of democratization in july , jessen-petersen said there had recently been a slowdown in the implementation of some of the standards . he stressed the need for a stronger commitment by kosovo albanian leaders to move forward on the return of serbs who fled their homes , on freedom of movement and decentralization , and the need for serbia 's leaders to encourage kosovo serbs to participate in the province 's political process . " co n ditio n al i n depe n de n ce " meanwhile , albania said monday that " conditional independence " was the only solution to guarantee kosovo 's stability and that talks on its final status should begin by year-end . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : final status talks will also concern the length of the un mission - involving german police officers , among others - in kosovo .
" conditional independence could make it possible for the international community to specify how long it will need to stay in kosovo to oversee the implementation of democratic standards , " said albanian foreign minister besnik mustafaj .
" the conditional independence of kosovo is the only solution that can give kosovo the status that can ensure the calm and peace needed to guarantee stability in the region .

according to un resolution 1244 , kosovo is still technically part of serbia , but it has been administered by the united nations since a nato bombing campaign ended the serbian crackdown on separatists in 1999 . sandra raskovic-ivic , president of the serbian coordination center for kosovo - the government body in charge of negotiating the final settlement - said on wednesday that the serbian government will use " all its powers to prevent kosovo from becoming independent . " " we have the un resolution 1244 , which guarantees our state sovereignty .
we are ready for compromises , but no conditional or unconditional independence of kosovo will come into question , " raskovic-ivic said . bos n ia n serbs get closer to eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians in banja luka , the capital of republika srpska , are taking increasingly pro-european measures in a separate development , the bosnian serb parliament on wednesday adopted a key police reform aimed at unifying the country 's ethnically divided police force , bringing the country closer to joining the european union . the bill - which has been rejected twice by the parliament of bosnia 's serb-run entity this year - was endorsed by 55 deputies in the 83-seat parliament .
five lawmakers voted against and 15 abstained . the reforms involve merging the police forces of the republika srpska entity with those of the muslim-croat federation , transferring their budgets to a central , state level and creating cross-boundary policing districts . the european commission hailed bosnian serbs for adopting the bill . " we welcome the decision by the bosnian serb parliament to adopt the bill which is meeting the principles set by the commission - state-level control over police , its regional organization and excluding political pressures , " a european commission spokesman in bosnia said . republika srpska and the muslim-croat federation are semi-independent and have their own police forces . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report : un mission in kosovo a " farce " the united nations democracy-building mission in kosovo is a " facade " which is sowing the seeds of renewed instability in the flashpoint serbian province , a think-tank said friday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 06.10.2005 germany 's solar explosion großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german solar ipo 's are making big waves on frankfurt 's dax q-cells ag , a maker of solar cells , became the latest alternative energy company to make its debut on the german stock exchange on wednesday , with its shares showing warm gains on their first day of trading . q-cells , the third german solar energy company to be listed on stock exchange this year , saw its shares shoot up to 49 euros -lrb- $ 59.4 -rrb- within the first few hours of trading , way above the issue price of 38 euros .
the initial public offering -lrb- ipo -rrb- was oversubscribed nearly 40-times according to a q-cells spokesman , meaning that investors had applied for 40 times more shares than were actually on offer .
the success of the float is viewed by many as direct proof that the " clean technologies " and the renewable energy sectors have come of age .
strong interest in renewable energy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anton milner , left , ceo of german solar cell producer q.cells , poses with cfo hartmut schuening , right , during the initial puplic offeromh at the stock exchange in frankfurt , germany , wednesday , oct .
5 , 2005 .
investor interest in solar energy has soared thus far in 2005 after oil prices rose to record highs , increasing the attractiveness of renewable energy sources .
solarworld ag based in bonn has seen their market value more than double to 1.4 billion euros , making it germany 's biggest solar-cell manufacturer .
likewise , q-cells , based in thalheim , has doubled sales to 117 million euros in the first half of the year and has already sold its complete 2005 production of solar cells .
net income also more than doubled to 15.3 million euros in the first six months , according to q-cells reports .
christian reitberger , a member of q-cells ' board , said " our view is that clean tech investing is not only something for the ecologically minded idealists , but an activity that can make substantial returns .
the fact that it can also be ecologically beneficial makes it a particularly appealing combination . "
government subsidies pushing growth germany is one of the largest european markets for solar power , with state financing helping to support the sector by making roof-top solar panels affordable for households via subsidies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 55.4 cents per kilowatt hour .
popularity of solar energy is growing in germany .
according to federal government statsistics , subsidies for alternative energy sources are expected to double the share of renewable power in germany by 2010 .
currently , companies and individuals who install solar panels pay approximately 57.4 cents per kilowatt-hour for electricity .
compare that with the 1 to 6 cents it costs to generate that amount using conventional power plants .
subsidies : here today , gone tomorrow ?
as far as subsidies for solar power are concerned some investors are quietly raising there hand from the back of the room to ask the obvious question : will this state support continue ?
there are risks involved , since any legislation supporting the drive for new sources of energy may be changed or even overturned at whim if , say , there is a change in government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : non-traditional energy sources often find themselves beholden to the whim of politics this was demonstrated recently in germany , with the conservative cdu / csu parties threatening to reverse , at least partially , legislation drawn up under the current administration of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens to phase out nuclear power within a specified period of time .
making it work in germany despite what many analysts perceive to be " un-naturally high " share prices , the funding that german solar companies are now enjoying from a flurry of successful ipo 's can be funnelled back into both r & d and production — a fact which could position germany as the unrivalled king of the solar power industry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a photographer takes photos from solar fields of the world 's largest solar power station in espenhain south of leipzig .
the 33,500 solar modules generate five megawatts of electrical power .
in addition to q-cell 's public offering on wednesday , ersol -lrb- based in erfurt -rrb- made a debut last week , while the smaller sunline is planning an ipo for late october and dresden-based solarwatt may float in the fourth quarter .
with the exception of sunline , all these firms are based in eastern germany , where local governments are eager to roll out the red carpet to attract new industry for the economically troubled region . dw staff -lrb- aal -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de renewable sector wary of cdu promises should the conservatives win september 's election , the renewable energy sector , which boomed under the green party 's influence , will be hit by changes .
opinions are clashing over what 's best for germany 's economy .

popularity of solar energy is growing in germany .
according to federal government statsistics , subsidies for alternative energy sources are expected to double the share of renewable power in germany by 2010 .

a german company - in an ultimate act of retro defiance - has announced its plans to produce nicotine-laced beer .
bars and restaurants may soon see decreasing levels of nervous finger-tapping and panicky lip-biting . in many countries , smoking bans in bars and restaurants are turning heavy smokers into an army of forlorn neurotics .
forced to separate their alcohol and nicotine addictions and ostracized from their favorite bars , smokers are nowadays congregating on the streets .
there , they expose their feeble - though defiant - bodies to the cruelty of the elements as well as the despising , self-righteous looks of the ubiquitous health freaks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barred from smoking inside a bar .
no matter how many times they tug their ears , fiddle with their keys , pull their sleeves or check the time on their cell phone - which , incidentally , they tend to forget immediately , so that they have to keep checking , continuously and indefinitely - smokers are banging their heads against the " no smoking " signs all over the world and asking the same question : why , oh why , does life have to be so unfair ? but all that may soon be history . a glimmer of hope drinking and smoking - a match , apparently , made in heaven , but not heavily advertised by world religions - is about to experience a new , post-prohibitive reincarnation in the shape of nicoshot , a nicotine-laced beer . a german beer producer , nautilus , has announced that it is currently testing nicoshot , a beer containing 6.3 percent alcohol and three milligrams of nicotine per bottle . " many countries have a smoking ban in bars and restaurants , " a nautilus spokesperson said .
" with our beer , you wo n't have to go outside for a quickie . " addictio n s u n ite hosanna , nautilus !
smokers all over the world will be grateful .
but is n't nicotine addictive ?
wo n't stuffing nicotine down the beer drinkers ' throats simply encourage a new generation of smokers to trade yellow teeth for beer bellies and bad hangovers ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicotine may find its way back into no-smoking bars , albeit in a liquid form the german company would beg to differ .
in fact , it is hoping that nicoshot will help people smoke less . " while nicoshot can lessen cravings , it is not a ' cure ' for smoking , " the nautilus spokesperson said .
" but it can help you make changes in your lifestyle without having to walk out of the bar for a quick smoke to deal with sudden withdrawal symptoms . " if all goes according to the plan and the nicotine beer takes off , smokers will experience dramatic improvements in the quality of their booze-bonding - somewhere between the devil and the deep spew . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the best of " from the fringe " click here for a selection of best stories from dw-world 's series " and finally ...

but just as the country remains divided socially and economically between east and west , german soccer is also split along similar lines . when the world cup kicks off in germany next summer , the eyes of the world will turn to the host nation . if everything goes to plan , the fifa 2006 world cup in germany will be more than just a spectacle of soccer ; it will be seen as an example of germany 's organizational prowess and a message to the world of what the once-divided nation can achieve now that east and west have been reunited . beyond the fanfares and flags , however , there 's another reality .
germany 's eastern and western regions are still far apart socially and economically and in some eyes , soccer has become a metaphor for the failure of the united germany . just as eastern business and industry have suffered since the fall of the berlin wall , so have the region 's soccer clubs .
east can not match west .
in the unified germany , where money governs professional sports , eastern teams have sunk without sponsors and investment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when hansa rostock was relegated on the final day of last season , it left the bundesliga ’ s top flight without any eastern representation .
in the first full domestic season after unification , hansa and dynamo dresden were launched into the top league of the bundesliga and six others into the second division .
things have changed radically since the 1991 campaign .
there are now no eastern teams in the first division and only four in the second . financial woes cause mediocrity once a proud and dominant team in the gdr , dynamo dresden has since dropped out of the professional game and those teams who survive find their finances slashed , unable to attract top-quality players .
the tv budget for the bundesliga has been slashed by 60 percent and the majority of the money generated gets shared out among the top clubs - all from the west - in the first division .
the rest is thrown like scraps to the teams in the second division .
beyond that , it 's every team for itself . just as unification led to a mass exodus of workers from the east to the west in the early 1990 's , many soccer players from the gdr headed for the more fashionable and lucrative western clubs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias sammer was the first player from the former gdr to play for the unified germany team .
the gdr production line , built on intensive technical and physical training , was so proficient that after unification , some 500 players joined western clubs .
by the mid-1990s , players like matthias sammer -lrb- photo , right -rrb- , jens jeremies , carsten jancker and alexander zickler had formed the backbone of the national team . " soccer was a great tool for celebrating the successes of eastern-bloc politics back in the days of the gdr , " said kirk schmidt , author of " ostkurve , " a study on the history of soccer in east germany . " the state ensured that the young players were given the best training possible in the hope that their successes would bring glory , " he said .
" this backfired when the communist regime fell .
the east had all these great players who then headed for the west and when the clubs found themselves losing money , they cashed in on anyone just to stay afloat . " state-supported training programs left to decay but now the well of sought-after soccer players in the east is now running dry .
that is not due to any lack of talent but rather because of a lack of financial support for youth programs and sports schools that , under the old communist regime , ensured talented youngsters would train twice a day , two hours at a time , and play regularly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's kevin kuranyi , michael ballack and bernd schneider , from left .
" the funding just dried up after 1990 , " schmidt said .
" that 's why the bundesliga and the national team have so few prominent eastern players .
people like -lrb- bayern munich 's -rrb- michael ballack and -lrb- bayer leverkusen 's -rrb- bernd schneider were already on their way by then .
others were n't so lucky .
the old gdr education system was allowed to decay . " economic stagnation rules out cities from showpiece bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leipzig will have a new stadium for the 2006 world cup after coming up with the necessary money to be awarded host city status .
such is the poor condition of some eastern cities ' finances that some - including dresden , the state capital of saxony - which applied for world cup 2006 host city status failed to conform to world cup directives set out by fifa , world soccer 's governing body , in areas such as transport facilities and overall infrastructure .
as a result , out of the 12 host cities featuring games during the championships , only two of those are in the east of the country - berlin and leipzig .
that is despite attempts " to keep a geographical balance , " according to david noemi from germany ’ s world cup organizing committee . fifteen years after reunification , questions are still being asked whether germany is working as a unified country or not .
in german soccer the answer is fairly clear .
there may be no physical walls between them anymore but a divide certainly remains between east and west when it comes to all aspects of the beautiful game . nick amies , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de east germany 's star quality in question bfc dynamo berlin were once the top soccer team in east germany .

germans still waiting for a new - or old - chancellor were left hanging once again when party leaders announced that any deal concerning the leadership of germany would not be completed before the weekend . many were expecting a result in the chancellery stand-off by late thursday evening after christian democrat -lrb- cdu -rrb- leader angela merkel , her bavarian ally edmund stoiber , head of the cdu 's sister party the christian social union , chancellor gerhard schröder and social democrat chief franz müntefering concluded their meeting scheduled for 19:00 utc . but earlier in the day , merkel announced that a deal would not be reached until the weekend , with more talks planned before sunday .
" i have informed -lrb- the party executive -rrb- there will be further decisions made in the leadership talks and also said there will probably not be decisions from these talks before sunday evening , " she told reporters after a meeting of cdu leaders . both she and spd leader franz müntefering said no further announcements were planned before the completion of talks , but they were confident a deal would be reached . müntefering said a decision on the chancellery would not be known until monday , when he would submit the outcome of the talks to the spd leadership .
" on monday we can say definitively who will be the next chancellor , " he said . cdu expects stubborn schröder to stand down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the conservatives expect schröder to eventually concede to merkel in their stand-off over who will head a new government . " we are a few hours away from a concession that will see angela merkel become the first woman to be german chancellor , " wolfgang bosbach , the deputy leader of the cdu parliamentary group , told national radio . günther beckstein , the interior minister of the conservative-run southern state of bavaria , said it was time for schröder 's party to accept that it had lost the election .
" either we have a woman chancellor or the talks fail , " he said . schröder has shown a stubbornness in the weeks following the sept .
18 election that suggest he will not go without a fight .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 06.10.2005 migrants spur economic growth in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without migrants , industrialized countries ' economies would suffer migrants contribute over $ 2 trillion -lrb- 1.67 trillion euros -rrb- to their host countries ' economies each year but are often mistreated , a study released wednesday said .
as a top destination , germany benefits from them too . the roughly 200 million migrants worldwide were an important force for the world economy , the un-backed study by the global commission on international migration , a 19-member independent panel , showed .
in addition to the trillions they spent in their host countries , they sent remittances of around $ 150 billion home , three times the amount the world officially devotes to developmental aid .
an additional $ 300 billion may be transferred informally , the report added . " in the 21st century , one of our most important challenges is to find ways to manage migration for the benefit of all - of sending countries , receiving countries , transit countries and migrants themselves , " un secretary general kofi annan said at the launch of the report .
" i agree with the commission that we are not rising to the challenge yet .
but i am convinced we must do so , " reuters quoted annan as saying . after the united states and russia , germany had the third greatest number of migrants , 7.3 million , 4.2 percent of the world 's migrants , in 2000 .
along with belgium and switzerland , the country also ranked third in the amount of remittances migrants send home : $ 8 billion in 2001 .
the same year germany spent $ 5.68 billion on developmental aid .
combatting xenophobia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : northern european countries , in particular , rely on migrants to fill health service jobs although the commission criticized the manner in which states treat migrants , it gave few detailed examples .
it did though point out that the economies of industrial countries would collapse without foreign nurses , computer engineers or farm workers . " if information percolated throughout economies , people would stop moaning about migrants taking away work , " mamphela ramphele , a south african member of the commission and former senior world bank official , said . over the past 35 years , the number of migrants worldwide has grown from 72 million to 200 million , around 10 million of whom are refugees .
from 1990 to 2000 , international migration accounted for 56 percent of population growth in the developed world , compared with 3 percent in developing nations , the report noted .
and the numbers continue to grow . " the expansion in the scale and scope of migration seems certain to continue for the foreseeable future and may well accelerate , due to the growing developmental , demographic and democratic disparities that exist between different regions of the world , " the report said .
" migration is driven by some powerful economic , social and political forces , and states must acknowledge its reality . " " the international community has failed to realize the full potential of international migration and has not risen to the many opportunities and challenges it represents , " the report said .
it called for a " comprehensive , coherent and global action framework " for un member nations ' migration policies .
harsh approaches to illegal immigration the study also estimated that 2.5 to 4 million people move to other countries illegally each year .
though the report recognized the right of states to set rules to deal with illegal immigration , the authors were critical .
" a purely restrictive approach to irregular migration is neither desirable nor feasible and may jeopardize the rights of migrants and refugees , " they said . bildunterschrift : an african immigrant with a bandaged hand queues with other african immigrants as they wait for food at a holding facility in the spanish enclave of melilla , thursday , sept .

spain ordered troops to its two enclaves in northern morocco thursday after five africans died and about 50 others were injured when hundreds of migrants charged a razor-wire fence in an attempt to cross into one of the enclaves , officials said .
-lrb- ap photo / jasper juinen -rrb- the report pressed for improved cooperation among governments trying to tackle illegal immigration , combined with efforts to ensure legal migrants are " effectively integrated " in the countries where they settle . " the role of migrants in promoting economic growth , development and poverty reduction should be recognized and reinforced , " the report added .
" migration must become an integral part of global development strategies . " the commission was created in 2003 by un head kofi annan to study policies worldwide , spurred by brazil , morocco , the philippines , sweden and switzerland .
its members include sweden 's former migration minister , jan karlsson . the report was based on statistics from the un , the world bank and the international monetary fund . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spain set to repatriate moroccan illegals spain said it would probably begin repatriating on thursday illegal immigrants , who have flooded into spanish enclaves in morocco recently .

as a top destination , germany benefits from them too . the roughly 200 million migrants worldwide were an important force for the world economy , the un-backed study by the global commission on international migration , a 19-member independent panel , showed .
in addition to the trillions they spent in their host countries , they sent remittances of around $ 150 billion home , three times the amount the world officially devotes to developmental aid .
an additional $ 300 billion may be transferred informally , the report added . " in the 21st century , one of our most important challenges is to find ways to manage migration for the benefit of all - of sending countries , receiving countries , transit countries and migrants themselves , " un secretary general kofi annan said at the launch of the report .
" i agree with the commission that we are not rising to the challenge yet .
but i am convinced we must do so , " reuters quoted annan as saying . after the united states and russia , germany had the third greatest number of migrants , 7.3 million , 4.2 percent of the world 's migrants , in 2000 .
along with belgium and switzerland , the country also ranked third in the amount of remittances migrants send home : $ 8 billion in 2001 .
the same year germany spent $ 5.68 billion on developmental aid .

it did though point out that the economies of industrial countries would collapse without foreign nurses , computer engineers or farm workers . " if information percolated throughout economies , people would stop moaning about migrants taking away work , " mamphela ramphele , a south african member of the commission and former senior world bank official , said . over the past 35 years , the number of migrants worldwide has grown from 72 million to 200 million , around 10 million of whom are refugees .
from 1990 to 2000 , international migration accounted for 56 percent of population growth in the developed world , compared with 3 percent in developing nations , the report noted .
and the numbers continue to grow . " the expansion in the scale and scope of migration seems certain to continue for the foreseeable future and may well accelerate , due to the growing developmental , demographic and democratic disparities that exist between different regions of the world , " the report said .
" migration is driven by some powerful economic , social and political forces , and states must acknowledge its reality . " " the international community has failed to realize the full potential of international migration and has not risen to the many opportunities and challenges it represents , " the report said .
it called for a " comprehensive , coherent and global action framework " for un member nations ' migration policies .
harsh approaches to illegal immigration the study also estimated that 2.5 to 4 million people move to other countries illegally each year .
though the report recognized the right of states to set rules to deal with illegal immigration , the authors were critical .
" a purely restrictive approach to irregular migration is neither desirable nor feasible and may jeopardize the rights of migrants and refugees , " they said . bildunterschrift : an african immigrant with a bandaged hand queues with other african immigrants as they wait for food at a holding facility in the spanish enclave of melilla , thursday , sept .

spain ordered troops to its two enclaves in northern morocco thursday after five africans died and about 50 others were injured when hundreds of migrants charged a razor-wire fence in an attempt to cross into one of the enclaves , officials said .
-lrb- ap photo / jasper juinen -rrb- the report pressed for improved cooperation among governments trying to tackle illegal immigration , combined with efforts to ensure legal migrants are " effectively integrated " in the countries where they settle . " the role of migrants in promoting economic growth , development and poverty reduction should be recognized and reinforced , " the report added .
" migration must become an integral part of global development strategies . " the commission was created in 2003 by un head kofi annan to study policies worldwide , spurred by brazil , morocco , the philippines , sweden and switzerland .
its members include sweden 's former migration minister , jan karlsson . the report was based on statistics from the un , the world bank and the international monetary fund . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spain set to repatriate moroccan illegals spain said it would probably begin repatriating on thursday illegal immigrants , who have flooded into spanish enclaves in morocco recently .

investor interest in solar energy has soared thus far in 2005 after oil prices rose to record highs , increasing the attractiveness of renewable energy sources .
solarworld ag based in bonn has seen their market value more than double to 1.4 billion euros , making it germany 's biggest solar-cell manufacturer .
likewise , q-cells , based in thalheim , has doubled sales to 117 million euros in the first half of the year and has already sold its complete 2005 production of solar cells .
net income also more than doubled to 15.3 million euros in the first six months , according to q-cells reports .
christian reitberger , a member of q-cells ' board , said " our view is that clean tech investing is not only something for the ecologically minded idealists , but an activity that can make substantial returns .
the fact that it can also be ecologically beneficial makes it a particularly appealing combination . "

popularity of solar energy is growing in germany .
according to federal government statsistics , subsidies for alternative energy sources are expected to double the share of renewable power in germany by 2010 .
currently , companies and individuals who install solar panels pay approximately 57.4 cents per kilowatt-hour for electricity .
compare that with the 1 to 6 cents it costs to generate that amount using conventional power plants .
subsidies : here today , gone tomorrow ?
as far as subsidies for solar power are concerned some investors are quietly raising there hand from the back of the room to ask the obvious question : will this state support continue ?
there are risks involved , since any legislation supporting the drive for new sources of energy may be changed or even overturned at whim if , say , there is a change in government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : non-traditional energy sources often find themselves beholden to the whim of politics this was demonstrated recently in germany , with the conservative cdu / csu parties threatening to reverse , at least partially , legislation drawn up under the current administration of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens to phase out nuclear power within a specified period of time .
making it work in germany despite what many analysts perceive to be " un-naturally high " share prices , the funding that german solar companies are now enjoying from a flurry of successful ipo 's can be funnelled back into both r & d and production — a fact which could position germany as the unrivalled king of the solar power industry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a photographer takes photos from solar fields of the world 's largest solar power station in espenhain south of leipzig .
the 33,500 solar modules generate five megawatts of electrical power .
in addition to q-cell 's public offering on wednesday , ersol -lrb- based in erfurt -rrb- made a debut last week , while the smaller sunline is planning an ipo for late october and dresden-based solarwatt may float in the fourth quarter .
with the exception of sunline , all these firms are based in eastern germany , where local governments are eager to roll out the red carpet to attract new industry for the economically troubled region . dw staff -lrb- aal -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de renewable sector wary of cdu promises should the conservatives win september 's election , the renewable energy sector , which boomed under the green party 's influence , will be hit by changes .

the initial public offering -lrb- ipo -rrb- was oversubscribed nearly 40-times according to a q-cells spokesman , meaning that investors had applied for 40 times more shares than were actually on offer .
the success of the float is viewed by many as direct proof that the " clean technologies " and the renewable energy sectors have come of age .
strong interest in renewable energy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anton milner , left , ceo of german solar cell producer q.cells , poses with cfo hartmut schuening , right , during the initial puplic offeromh at the stock exchange in frankfurt , germany , wednesday , oct .
5 , 2005 .
investor interest in solar energy has soared thus far in 2005 after oil prices rose to record highs , increasing the attractiveness of renewable energy sources .
solarworld ag based in bonn has seen their market value more than double to 1.4 billion euros , making it germany 's biggest solar-cell manufacturer .
likewise , q-cells , based in thalheim , has doubled sales to 117 million euros in the first half of the year and has already sold its complete 2005 production of solar cells .
net income also more than doubled to 15.3 million euros in the first six months , according to q-cells reports .
christian reitberger , a member of q-cells ' board , said " our view is that clean tech investing is not only something for the ecologically minded idealists , but an activity that can make substantial returns .
the fact that it can also be ecologically beneficial makes it a particularly appealing combination . "
government subsidies pushing growth germany is one of the largest european markets for solar power , with state financing helping to support the sector by making roof-top solar panels affordable for households via subsidies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 55.4 cents per kilowatt hour .
popularity of solar energy is growing in germany .
according to federal government statsistics , subsidies for alternative energy sources are expected to double the share of renewable power in germany by 2010 .
currently , companies and individuals who install solar panels pay approximately 57.4 cents per kilowatt-hour for electricity .
compare that with the 1 to 6 cents it costs to generate that amount using conventional power plants .
subsidies : here today , gone tomorrow ?
as far as subsidies for solar power are concerned some investors are quietly raising there hand from the back of the room to ask the obvious question : will this state support continue ?
there are risks involved , since any legislation supporting the drive for new sources of energy may be changed or even overturned at whim if , say , there is a change in government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : non-traditional energy sources often find themselves beholden to the whim of politics this was demonstrated recently in germany , with the conservative cdu / csu parties threatening to reverse , at least partially , legislation drawn up under the current administration of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens to phase out nuclear power within a specified period of time .
making it work in germany despite what many analysts perceive to be " un-naturally high " share prices , the funding that german solar companies are now enjoying from a flurry of successful ipo 's can be funnelled back into both r & d and production — a fact which could position germany as the unrivalled king of the solar power industry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a photographer takes photos from solar fields of the world 's largest solar power station in espenhain south of leipzig .
the 33,500 solar modules generate five megawatts of electrical power .
in addition to q-cell 's public offering on wednesday , ersol -lrb- based in erfurt -rrb- made a debut last week , while the smaller sunline is planning an ipo for late october and dresden-based solarwatt may float in the fourth quarter .
with the exception of sunline , all these firms are based in eastern germany , where local governments are eager to roll out the red carpet to attract new industry for the economically troubled region . dw staff -lrb- aal -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de renewable sector wary of cdu promises should the conservatives win september 's election , the renewable energy sector , which boomed under the green party 's influence , will be hit by changes .

" with our beer , you wo n't have to go outside for a quickie . " addictio n s u n ite hosanna , nautilus !
smokers all over the world will be grateful .
but is n't nicotine addictive ?
wo n't stuffing nicotine down the beer drinkers ' throats simply encourage a new generation of smokers to trade yellow teeth for beer bellies and bad hangovers ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicotine may find its way back into no-smoking bars , albeit in a liquid form the german company would beg to differ .
in fact , it is hoping that nicoshot will help people smoke less . " while nicoshot can lessen cravings , it is not a ' cure ' for smoking , " the nautilus spokesperson said .
" but it can help you make changes in your lifestyle without having to walk out of the bar for a quick smoke to deal with sudden withdrawal symptoms . " if all goes according to the plan and the nicotine beer takes off , smokers will experience dramatic improvements in the quality of their booze-bonding - somewhere between the devil and the deep spew . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the best of " from the fringe " click here for a selection of best stories from dw-world 's series " and finally ...

merkel 's most ardent critic in the social democrats , ludwig stiegler , deputy head of the parliamentary party , was being isolated in the discussions , sources told reuters . despite the stalemate over who will lead germany , it looks increasingly likely that the two main parties will find consensus to form a grand coalition .
neither merkel 's conservatives nor schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- won a majority with their preferred allies in the election . grand coalition getting closer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two parties have softened their tone in reference to the possibility of a red-black coalition in recent days with comments hinting at a closing of the gap between their differences .
both the cdu and spd appear to agree on the need to bring germany 's escalating deficit back under eu limits , unravel the mess of conflicting state and federal powers and simplify germany 's notoriously complex tax code . news that a working government may finally soon be in place is good news for both the euro and german shares .
the european union has been on tenterhooks over germany 's power struggle with the knock-on effect affecting the single currency .
financial markets have also banked on a new government tackling economic reforms and will be relieved to hear that this goal will be one shared by whoever takes the reins . transition to new government to be far from smooth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but barriers remain .
the social democrats are still refusing to give in to the conservatives on plans to ease hiring and firing rules , loosen the system of sector-wide pay deals and on reforms to health insurance funding .
whatever deals are struck over the coming days , the transition to a new government will be far from smooth . " i 'm afraid the negotiations are more likely to last three weeks than two , " said christian wulff , conservative state premier of lower saxony , " but if they 're good negotiations with a good result , then the old rule applies : thoroughness before speed .

a german company - in an ultimate act of retro defiance - has announced its plans to produce nicotine-laced beer .
bars and restaurants may soon see decreasing levels of nervous finger-tapping and panicky lip-biting . in many countries , smoking bans in bars and restaurants are turning heavy smokers into an army of forlorn neurotics .
forced to separate their alcohol and nicotine addictions and ostracized from their favorite bars , smokers are nowadays congregating on the streets .
there , they expose their feeble - though defiant - bodies to the cruelty of the elements as well as the despising , self-righteous looks of the ubiquitous health freaks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barred from smoking inside a bar .
no matter how many times they tug their ears , fiddle with their keys , pull their sleeves or check the time on their cell phone - which , incidentally , they tend to forget immediately , so that they have to keep checking , continuously and indefinitely - smokers are banging their heads against the " no smoking " signs all over the world and asking the same question : why , oh why , does life have to be so unfair ? but all that may soon be history . a glimmer of hope drinking and smoking - a match , apparently , made in heaven , but not heavily advertised by world religions - is about to experience a new , post-prohibitive reincarnation in the shape of nicoshot , a nicotine-laced beer . a german beer producer , nautilus , has announced that it is currently testing nicoshot , a beer containing 6.3 percent alcohol and three milligrams of nicotine per bottle . " many countries have a smoking ban in bars and restaurants , " a nautilus spokesperson said .
" with our beer , you wo n't have to go outside for a quickie . " addictio n s u n ite hosanna , nautilus !
smokers all over the world will be grateful .
but is n't nicotine addictive ?
wo n't stuffing nicotine down the beer drinkers ' throats simply encourage a new generation of smokers to trade yellow teeth for beer bellies and bad hangovers ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicotine may find its way back into no-smoking bars , albeit in a liquid form the german company would beg to differ .
in fact , it is hoping that nicoshot will help people smoke less . " while nicoshot can lessen cravings , it is not a ' cure ' for smoking , " the nautilus spokesperson said .
" but it can help you make changes in your lifestyle without having to walk out of the bar for a quick smoke to deal with sudden withdrawal symptoms . " if all goes according to the plan and the nicotine beer takes off , smokers will experience dramatic improvements in the quality of their booze-bonding - somewhere between the devil and the deep spew . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the best of " from the fringe " click here for a selection of best stories from dw-world 's series " and finally ...

germany 's interior minister has been asked to explain why police searched a journalist 's home and his magazine 's office in raids .

" i never , under any circumstances , talk about sources , neither with editors , nor with prosecutors , nor with judges , " schirra told reuters .

investor interest in solar energy has soared thus far in 2005 after oil prices rose to record highs , increasing the attractiveness of renewable energy sources .
solarworld ag based in bonn has seen their market value more than double to 1.4 billion euros , making it germany 's biggest solar-cell manufacturer .

popularity of solar energy is growing in germany .
according to federal government statsistics , subsidies for alternative energy sources are expected to double the share of renewable power in germany by 2010 .
currently , companies and individuals who install solar panels pay approximately 57.4 cents per kilowatt-hour for electricity .
compare that with the 1 to 6 cents it costs to generate that amount using conventional power plants .
subsidies : here today , gone tomorrow ?
as far as subsidies for solar power are concerned some investors are quietly raising there hand from the back of the room to ask the obvious question : will this state support continue ?
there are risks involved , since any legislation supporting the drive for new sources of energy may be changed or even overturned at whim if , say , there is a change in government .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 06.10.2005 divisions in soccer mirror germany 's ills großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : since east beat west 1-0 in 1974 , germany 's soccer divide has grown germany is presenting a united front as host nation for soccer 's world cup .
but just as the country remains divided socially and economically between east and west , german soccer is also split along similar lines . when the world cup kicks off in germany next summer , the eyes of the world will turn to the host nation . if everything goes to plan , the fifa 2006 world cup in germany will be more than just a spectacle of soccer ; it will be seen as an example of germany 's organizational prowess and a message to the world of what the once-divided nation can achieve now that east and west have been reunited . beyond the fanfares and flags , however , there 's another reality .
germany 's eastern and western regions are still far apart socially and economically and in some eyes , soccer has become a metaphor for the failure of the united germany . just as eastern business and industry have suffered since the fall of the berlin wall , so have the region 's soccer clubs .
east can not match west .
in the unified germany , where money governs professional sports , eastern teams have sunk without sponsors and investment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when hansa rostock was relegated on the final day of last season , it left the bundesliga ’ s top flight without any eastern representation .
in the first full domestic season after unification , hansa and dynamo dresden were launched into the top league of the bundesliga and six others into the second division .
things have changed radically since the 1991 campaign .
there are now no eastern teams in the first division and only four in the second . financial woes cause mediocrity once a proud and dominant team in the gdr , dynamo dresden has since dropped out of the professional game and those teams who survive find their finances slashed , unable to attract top-quality players .
the tv budget for the bundesliga has been slashed by 60 percent and the majority of the money generated gets shared out among the top clubs - all from the west - in the first division .
the rest is thrown like scraps to the teams in the second division .
beyond that , it 's every team for itself . just as unification led to a mass exodus of workers from the east to the west in the early 1990 's , many soccer players from the gdr headed for the more fashionable and lucrative western clubs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias sammer was the first player from the former gdr to play for the unified germany team .
the gdr production line , built on intensive technical and physical training , was so proficient that after unification , some 500 players joined western clubs .
by the mid-1990s , players like matthias sammer -lrb- photo , right -rrb- , jens jeremies , carsten jancker and alexander zickler had formed the backbone of the national team . " soccer was a great tool for celebrating the successes of eastern-bloc politics back in the days of the gdr , " said kirk schmidt , author of " ostkurve , " a study on the history of soccer in east germany . " the state ensured that the young players were given the best training possible in the hope that their successes would bring glory , " he said .
" this backfired when the communist regime fell .
the east had all these great players who then headed for the west and when the clubs found themselves losing money , they cashed in on anyone just to stay afloat . " state-supported training programs left to decay but now the well of sought-after soccer players in the east is now running dry .
that is not due to any lack of talent but rather because of a lack of financial support for youth programs and sports schools that , under the old communist regime , ensured talented youngsters would train twice a day , two hours at a time , and play regularly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's kevin kuranyi , michael ballack and bernd schneider , from left .
" the funding just dried up after 1990 , " schmidt said .
" that 's why the bundesliga and the national team have so few prominent eastern players .
people like -lrb- bayern munich 's -rrb- michael ballack and -lrb- bayer leverkusen 's -rrb- bernd schneider were already on their way by then .
others were n't so lucky .
the old gdr education system was allowed to decay . " economic stagnation rules out cities from showpiece bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leipzig will have a new stadium for the 2006 world cup after coming up with the necessary money to be awarded host city status .
such is the poor condition of some eastern cities ' finances that some - including dresden , the state capital of saxony - which applied for world cup 2006 host city status failed to conform to world cup directives set out by fifa , world soccer 's governing body , in areas such as transport facilities and overall infrastructure .
as a result , out of the 12 host cities featuring games during the championships , only two of those are in the east of the country - berlin and leipzig .

but just as the country remains divided socially and economically between east and west , german soccer is also split along similar lines . when the world cup kicks off in germany next summer , the eyes of the world will turn to the host nation . if everything goes to plan , the fifa 2006 world cup in germany will be more than just a spectacle of soccer ; it will be seen as an example of germany 's organizational prowess and a message to the world of what the once-divided nation can achieve now that east and west have been reunited . beyond the fanfares and flags , however , there 's another reality .
germany 's eastern and western regions are still far apart socially and economically and in some eyes , soccer has become a metaphor for the failure of the united germany . just as eastern business and industry have suffered since the fall of the berlin wall , so have the region 's soccer clubs .
east can not match west .
in the unified germany , where money governs professional sports , eastern teams have sunk without sponsors and investment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when hansa rostock was relegated on the final day of last season , it left the bundesliga ’ s top flight without any eastern representation .
in the first full domestic season after unification , hansa and dynamo dresden were launched into the top league of the bundesliga and six others into the second division .
things have changed radically since the 1991 campaign .
there are now no eastern teams in the first division and only four in the second . financial woes cause mediocrity once a proud and dominant team in the gdr , dynamo dresden has since dropped out of the professional game and those teams who survive find their finances slashed , unable to attract top-quality players .
the tv budget for the bundesliga has been slashed by 60 percent and the majority of the money generated gets shared out among the top clubs - all from the west - in the first division .
the rest is thrown like scraps to the teams in the second division .
beyond that , it 's every team for itself . just as unification led to a mass exodus of workers from the east to the west in the early 1990 's , many soccer players from the gdr headed for the more fashionable and lucrative western clubs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias sammer was the first player from the former gdr to play for the unified germany team .
the gdr production line , built on intensive technical and physical training , was so proficient that after unification , some 500 players joined western clubs .
by the mid-1990s , players like matthias sammer -lrb- photo , right -rrb- , jens jeremies , carsten jancker and alexander zickler had formed the backbone of the national team . " soccer was a great tool for celebrating the successes of eastern-bloc politics back in the days of the gdr , " said kirk schmidt , author of " ostkurve , " a study on the history of soccer in east germany . " the state ensured that the young players were given the best training possible in the hope that their successes would bring glory , " he said .
" this backfired when the communist regime fell .
the east had all these great players who then headed for the west and when the clubs found themselves losing money , they cashed in on anyone just to stay afloat . " state-supported training programs left to decay but now the well of sought-after soccer players in the east is now running dry .
that is not due to any lack of talent but rather because of a lack of financial support for youth programs and sports schools that , under the old communist regime , ensured talented youngsters would train twice a day , two hours at a time , and play regularly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's kevin kuranyi , michael ballack and bernd schneider , from left .

hours later , up to 1,500 mounted a fresh attempt to push through the border . " in the coming days , probably tomorrow , it is possible that there will be a repatriation of illegal immigrants -lrb- to morocco -rrb- , " said deputy prime minister maria teresa fernandez de la vega .
" this is an exceptional decision because it will be a first . " in the coming days we will work to begin reactivating the 1992 accord between spain and morocco on the control of migration , which has never been applied , " she added in a public statement . just a few hours after the comments were made up to 1,500 would-be immigrants mounted a fresh assault on spain 's north african enclave of melilla early thursday morning . but none of them were successful breaking through spain 's defenses , according to the police . " there 's been an assault which has been repelled by moroccan and spanish forces , " a police spokesman told reuters .
" no one got in . " sharp i n crease recent months have seen a sharp increase of such incidents in the spanish enclaves of melilla and ceuta , involving people from many african countries determined to escape poverty and start a new life in europe . the latest assault took place in the pinares de rostrogordo zone where the perimeter fence has yet to be raised from three to six meters -lrb- 10 to 20 feet -rrb- high , as is the case around the rest of the enclave , according to private spanish radio cadena ser . bildunterschrift : illegal immigrants in front of the melilla police station after they attempted to jump over the border fence medics in the zone treated many immigrants for cuts and bruises , and two were still under observation , police said , adding that two police members had also been injured .
about 15 immigrants had to have plaster casts applied . fernandez de la vega planned to travel to melilla late wednesday and then on to ceuta on thursday .
earlier wednesday , she met the conservative local government chiefs of melilla and ceuta , who have strongly criticized the administration 's management of the crisis .
they urged zapatero to reaffirm madrid 's sovereignty in the two enclaves .
seve n would-be immigra n ts dead the latest immigrant invasion took place before dawn , the day after local melilla government official jose fernandez charcon announced that a third metal barrier would be set up to reinforce the border with morocco . eu justice and security commissioner franco frattini on tuesday said the bloc would shortly be sending a technical mission to investigate the worsening situation on the southern coast of the mediterranean .
bildunterschrift : spanish soldiers leave the rostrogordo area of the border between spain and morocco in spanish enclave of melilla seven african would-be immigrants have died since the beginning of the summer during similar assaults , including five in ceuta last thursday .
on monday , 135 people were injured when around 650 stormed melilla .
some 300 people broke into the same enclave in two mass stormings of the barrier , involving about 1,000 people , in a similar incident . spain has recently been accelerating plans to raise the border fence , equipped with infrared cameras and movement detectors , while morocco is increasing police operations in forests bordering the enclaves .
the earlier decision to beef up the barriers is believed to be behind the heavy immigrant influx recently . after wednesday 's incident , moroccan police arrested 85 immigrants , including 13 women , bringing the total number of such arrests since the beginning of the year to 6,167 . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a german amnesty for illegal immigrants ?

germans still waiting for a new - or old - chancellor were left hanging once again when party leaders announced that any deal concerning the leadership of germany would not be completed before the weekend . many were expecting a result in the chancellery stand-off by late thursday evening after christian democrat -lrb- cdu -rrb- leader angela merkel , her bavarian ally edmund stoiber , head of the cdu 's sister party the christian social union , chancellor gerhard schröder and social democrat chief franz müntefering concluded their meeting scheduled for 19:00 utc . but earlier in the day , merkel announced that a deal would not be reached until the weekend , with more talks planned before sunday .
" i have informed -lrb- the party executive -rrb- there will be further decisions made in the leadership talks and also said there will probably not be decisions from these talks before sunday evening , " she told reporters after a meeting of cdu leaders . both she and spd leader franz müntefering said no further announcements were planned before the completion of talks , but they were confident a deal would be reached . müntefering said a decision on the chancellery would not be known until monday , when he would submit the outcome of the talks to the spd leadership .

the chancellor has refused to concede defeat , even though the conservatives won four more seats in parliament . however , earlier this week schröder hinted he may give up the post he has held since 1998 , saying he would not stop the creation of a stable government . in a statement of support , spd chief müntefering said it was still the party 's aim to keep schröder in the chancellery but his tone was less belligerent than that used by the social democrats in recent days .

germans still waiting for a new - or old - chancellor were left hanging once again when party leaders announced that any deal concerning the leadership of germany would not be completed before the weekend . many were expecting a result in the chancellery stand-off by late thursday evening after christian democrat -lrb- cdu -rrb- leader angela merkel , her bavarian ally edmund stoiber , head of the cdu 's sister party the christian social union , chancellor gerhard schröder and social democrat chief franz müntefering concluded their meeting scheduled for 19:00 utc . but earlier in the day , merkel announced that a deal would not be reached until the weekend , with more talks planned before sunday .
" i have informed -lrb- the party executive -rrb- there will be further decisions made in the leadership talks and also said there will probably not be decisions from these talks before sunday evening , " she told reporters after a meeting of cdu leaders . both she and spd leader franz müntefering said no further announcements were planned before the completion of talks , but they were confident a deal would be reached . müntefering said a decision on the chancellery would not be known until monday , when he would submit the outcome of the talks to the spd leadership .

the chancellor has refused to concede defeat , even though the conservatives won four more seats in parliament . however , earlier this week schröder hinted he may give up the post he has held since 1998 , saying he would not stop the creation of a stable government . in a statement of support , spd chief müntefering said it was still the party 's aim to keep schröder in the chancellery but his tone was less belligerent than that used by the social democrats in recent days .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 06.10.2005 divisions in soccer mirror germany 's ills großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : since east beat west 1-0 in 1974 , germany 's soccer divide has grown germany is presenting a united front as host nation for soccer 's world cup .
but just as the country remains divided socially and economically between east and west , german soccer is also split along similar lines . when the world cup kicks off in germany next summer , the eyes of the world will turn to the host nation . if everything goes to plan , the fifa 2006 world cup in germany will be more than just a spectacle of soccer ; it will be seen as an example of germany 's organizational prowess and a message to the world of what the once-divided nation can achieve now that east and west have been reunited . beyond the fanfares and flags , however , there 's another reality .
germany 's eastern and western regions are still far apart socially and economically and in some eyes , soccer has become a metaphor for the failure of the united germany . just as eastern business and industry have suffered since the fall of the berlin wall , so have the region 's soccer clubs .
east can not match west .
in the unified germany , where money governs professional sports , eastern teams have sunk without sponsors and investment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when hansa rostock was relegated on the final day of last season , it left the bundesliga ’ s top flight without any eastern representation .
in the first full domestic season after unification , hansa and dynamo dresden were launched into the top league of the bundesliga and six others into the second division .
things have changed radically since the 1991 campaign .
there are now no eastern teams in the first division and only four in the second . financial woes cause mediocrity once a proud and dominant team in the gdr , dynamo dresden has since dropped out of the professional game and those teams who survive find their finances slashed , unable to attract top-quality players .
the tv budget for the bundesliga has been slashed by 60 percent and the majority of the money generated gets shared out among the top clubs - all from the west - in the first division .
the rest is thrown like scraps to the teams in the second division .
beyond that , it 's every team for itself . just as unification led to a mass exodus of workers from the east to the west in the early 1990 's , many soccer players from the gdr headed for the more fashionable and lucrative western clubs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias sammer was the first player from the former gdr to play for the unified germany team .
the gdr production line , built on intensive technical and physical training , was so proficient that after unification , some 500 players joined western clubs .
by the mid-1990s , players like matthias sammer -lrb- photo , right -rrb- , jens jeremies , carsten jancker and alexander zickler had formed the backbone of the national team . " soccer was a great tool for celebrating the successes of eastern-bloc politics back in the days of the gdr , " said kirk schmidt , author of " ostkurve , " a study on the history of soccer in east germany . " the state ensured that the young players were given the best training possible in the hope that their successes would bring glory , " he said .
" this backfired when the communist regime fell .
the east had all these great players who then headed for the west and when the clubs found themselves losing money , they cashed in on anyone just to stay afloat . " state-supported training programs left to decay but now the well of sought-after soccer players in the east is now running dry .
that is not due to any lack of talent but rather because of a lack of financial support for youth programs and sports schools that , under the old communist regime , ensured talented youngsters would train twice a day , two hours at a time , and play regularly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's kevin kuranyi , michael ballack and bernd schneider , from left .
" the funding just dried up after 1990 , " schmidt said .
" that 's why the bundesliga and the national team have so few prominent eastern players .
people like -lrb- bayern munich 's -rrb- michael ballack and -lrb- bayer leverkusen 's -rrb- bernd schneider were already on their way by then .
others were n't so lucky .
the old gdr education system was allowed to decay . " economic stagnation rules out cities from showpiece bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leipzig will have a new stadium for the 2006 world cup after coming up with the necessary money to be awarded host city status .
such is the poor condition of some eastern cities ' finances that some - including dresden , the state capital of saxony - which applied for world cup 2006 host city status failed to conform to world cup directives set out by fifa , world soccer 's governing body , in areas such as transport facilities and overall infrastructure .
as a result , out of the 12 host cities featuring games during the championships , only two of those are in the east of the country - berlin and leipzig .
that is despite attempts " to keep a geographical balance , " according to david noemi from germany ’ s world cup organizing committee . fifteen years after reunification , questions are still being asked whether germany is working as a unified country or not .
in german soccer the answer is fairly clear .
there may be no physical walls between them anymore but a divide certainly remains between east and west when it comes to all aspects of the beautiful game . nick amies , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de east germany 's star quality in question bfc dynamo berlin were once the top soccer team in east germany .
now they want to be honored appropriately for its success .

hours later , up to 1,500 mounted a fresh attempt to push through the border . " in the coming days , probably tomorrow , it is possible that there will be a repatriation of illegal immigrants -lrb- to morocco -rrb- , " said deputy prime minister maria teresa fernandez de la vega .
" this is an exceptional decision because it will be a first . " in the coming days we will work to begin reactivating the 1992 accord between spain and morocco on the control of migration , which has never been applied , " she added in a public statement . just a few hours after the comments were made up to 1,500 would-be immigrants mounted a fresh assault on spain 's north african enclave of melilla early thursday morning . but none of them were successful breaking through spain 's defenses , according to the police . " there 's been an assault which has been repelled by moroccan and spanish forces , " a police spokesman told reuters .
" no one got in . " sharp i n crease recent months have seen a sharp increase of such incidents in the spanish enclaves of melilla and ceuta , involving people from many african countries determined to escape poverty and start a new life in europe . the latest assault took place in the pinares de rostrogordo zone where the perimeter fence has yet to be raised from three to six meters -lrb- 10 to 20 feet -rrb- high , as is the case around the rest of the enclave , according to private spanish radio cadena ser . bildunterschrift : illegal immigrants in front of the melilla police station after they attempted to jump over the border fence medics in the zone treated many immigrants for cuts and bruises , and two were still under observation , police said , adding that two police members had also been injured .
about 15 immigrants had to have plaster casts applied . fernandez de la vega planned to travel to melilla late wednesday and then on to ceuta on thursday .
earlier wednesday , she met the conservative local government chiefs of melilla and ceuta , who have strongly criticized the administration 's management of the crisis .
they urged zapatero to reaffirm madrid 's sovereignty in the two enclaves .
seve n would-be immigra n ts dead the latest immigrant invasion took place before dawn , the day after local melilla government official jose fernandez charcon announced that a third metal barrier would be set up to reinforce the border with morocco . eu justice and security commissioner franco frattini on tuesday said the bloc would shortly be sending a technical mission to investigate the worsening situation on the southern coast of the mediterranean .
bildunterschrift : spanish soldiers leave the rostrogordo area of the border between spain and morocco in spanish enclave of melilla seven african would-be immigrants have died since the beginning of the summer during similar assaults , including five in ceuta last thursday .
on monday , 135 people were injured when around 650 stormed melilla .
some 300 people broke into the same enclave in two mass stormings of the barrier , involving about 1,000 people , in a similar incident . spain has recently been accelerating plans to raise the border fence , equipped with infrared cameras and movement detectors , while morocco is increasing police operations in forests bordering the enclaves .
the earlier decision to beef up the barriers is believed to be behind the heavy immigrant influx recently . after wednesday 's incident , moroccan police arrested 85 immigrants , including 13 women , bringing the total number of such arrests since the beginning of the year to 6,167 . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a german amnesty for illegal immigrants ?

as a top destination , germany benefits from them too . the roughly 200 million migrants worldwide were an important force for the world economy , the un-backed study by the global commission on international migration , a 19-member independent panel , showed .
in addition to the trillions they spent in their host countries , they sent remittances of around $ 150 billion home , three times the amount the world officially devotes to developmental aid .
an additional $ 300 billion may be transferred informally , the report added . " in the 21st century , one of our most important challenges is to find ways to manage migration for the benefit of all - of sending countries , receiving countries , transit countries and migrants themselves , " un secretary general kofi annan said at the launch of the report .
" i agree with the commission that we are not rising to the challenge yet .
but i am convinced we must do so , " reuters quoted annan as saying . after the united states and russia , germany had the third greatest number of migrants , 7.3 million , 4.2 percent of the world 's migrants , in 2000 .
along with belgium and switzerland , the country also ranked third in the amount of remittances migrants send home : $ 8 billion in 2001 .
the same year germany spent $ 5.68 billion on developmental aid .

it did though point out that the economies of industrial countries would collapse without foreign nurses , computer engineers or farm workers . " if information percolated throughout economies , people would stop moaning about migrants taking away work , " mamphela ramphele , a south african member of the commission and former senior world bank official , said . over the past 35 years , the number of migrants worldwide has grown from 72 million to 200 million , around 10 million of whom are refugees .
from 1990 to 2000 , international migration accounted for 56 percent of population growth in the developed world , compared with 3 percent in developing nations , the report noted .
and the numbers continue to grow . " the expansion in the scale and scope of migration seems certain to continue for the foreseeable future and may well accelerate , due to the growing developmental , demographic and democratic disparities that exist between different regions of the world , " the report said .
" migration is driven by some powerful economic , social and political forces , and states must acknowledge its reality . " " the international community has failed to realize the full potential of international migration and has not risen to the many opportunities and challenges it represents , " the report said .
it called for a " comprehensive , coherent and global action framework " for un member nations ' migration policies .
harsh approaches to illegal immigration the study also estimated that 2.5 to 4 million people move to other countries illegally each year .
though the report recognized the right of states to set rules to deal with illegal immigration , the authors were critical .
" a purely restrictive approach to irregular migration is neither desirable nor feasible and may jeopardize the rights of migrants and refugees , " they said . bildunterschrift : an african immigrant with a bandaged hand queues with other african immigrants as they wait for food at a holding facility in the spanish enclave of melilla , thursday , sept .

-lrb- ap photo / jasper juinen -rrb- the report pressed for improved cooperation among governments trying to tackle illegal immigration , combined with efforts to ensure legal migrants are " effectively integrated " in the countries where they settle . " the role of migrants in promoting economic growth , development and poverty reduction should be recognized and reinforced , " the report added .
" migration must become an integral part of global development strategies . " the commission was created in 2003 by un head kofi annan to study policies worldwide , spurred by brazil , morocco , the philippines , sweden and switzerland .
its members include sweden 's former migration minister , jan karlsson . the report was based on statistics from the un , the world bank and the international monetary fund . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spain set to repatriate moroccan illegals spain said it would probably begin repatriating on thursday illegal immigrants , who have flooded into spanish enclaves in morocco recently .

in addition to the trillions they spent in their host countries , they sent remittances of around $ 150 billion home , three times the amount the world officially devotes to developmental aid .
an additional $ 300 billion may be transferred informally , the report added . " in the 21st century , one of our most important challenges is to find ways to manage migration for the benefit of all - of sending countries , receiving countries , transit countries and migrants themselves , " un secretary general kofi annan said at the launch of the report .
" i agree with the commission that we are not rising to the challenge yet .
but i am convinced we must do so , " reuters quoted annan as saying . after the united states and russia , germany had the third greatest number of migrants , 7.3 million , 4.2 percent of the world 's migrants , in 2000 .
along with belgium and switzerland , the country also ranked third in the amount of remittances migrants send home : $ 8 billion in 2001 .
the same year germany spent $ 5.68 billion on developmental aid .

it did though point out that the economies of industrial countries would collapse without foreign nurses , computer engineers or farm workers . " if information percolated throughout economies , people would stop moaning about migrants taking away work , " mamphela ramphele , a south african member of the commission and former senior world bank official , said . over the past 35 years , the number of migrants worldwide has grown from 72 million to 200 million , around 10 million of whom are refugees .
from 1990 to 2000 , international migration accounted for 56 percent of population growth in the developed world , compared with 3 percent in developing nations , the report noted .
and the numbers continue to grow . " the expansion in the scale and scope of migration seems certain to continue for the foreseeable future and may well accelerate , due to the growing developmental , demographic and democratic disparities that exist between different regions of the world , " the report said .
" migration is driven by some powerful economic , social and political forces , and states must acknowledge its reality . " " the international community has failed to realize the full potential of international migration and has not risen to the many opportunities and challenges it represents , " the report said .
it called for a " comprehensive , coherent and global action framework " for un member nations ' migration policies .
harsh approaches to illegal immigration the study also estimated that 2.5 to 4 million people move to other countries illegally each year .
though the report recognized the right of states to set rules to deal with illegal immigration , the authors were critical .
" a purely restrictive approach to irregular migration is neither desirable nor feasible and may jeopardize the rights of migrants and refugees , " they said . bildunterschrift : an african immigrant with a bandaged hand queues with other african immigrants as they wait for food at a holding facility in the spanish enclave of melilla , thursday , sept .

-lrb- ap photo / jasper juinen -rrb- the report pressed for improved cooperation among governments trying to tackle illegal immigration , combined with efforts to ensure legal migrants are " effectively integrated " in the countries where they settle . " the role of migrants in promoting economic growth , development and poverty reduction should be recognized and reinforced , " the report added .
" migration must become an integral part of global development strategies . " the commission was created in 2003 by un head kofi annan to study policies worldwide , spurred by brazil , morocco , the philippines , sweden and switzerland .
its members include sweden 's former migration minister , jan karlsson . the report was based on statistics from the un , the world bank and the international monetary fund . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spain set to repatriate moroccan illegals spain said it would probably begin repatriating on thursday illegal immigrants , who have flooded into spanish enclaves in morocco recently .

investor interest in solar energy has soared thus far in 2005 after oil prices rose to record highs , increasing the attractiveness of renewable energy sources .
solarworld ag based in bonn has seen their market value more than double to 1.4 billion euros , making it germany 's biggest solar-cell manufacturer .

as far as subsidies for solar power are concerned some investors are quietly raising there hand from the back of the room to ask the obvious question : will this state support continue ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 06.10.2005 divisions in soccer mirror germany 's ills großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : since east beat west 1-0 in 1974 , germany 's soccer divide has grown germany is presenting a united front as host nation for soccer 's world cup .
but just as the country remains divided socially and economically between east and west , german soccer is also split along similar lines . when the world cup kicks off in germany next summer , the eyes of the world will turn to the host nation . if everything goes to plan , the fifa 2006 world cup in germany will be more than just a spectacle of soccer ; it will be seen as an example of germany 's organizational prowess and a message to the world of what the once-divided nation can achieve now that east and west have been reunited . beyond the fanfares and flags , however , there 's another reality .
germany 's eastern and western regions are still far apart socially and economically and in some eyes , soccer has become a metaphor for the failure of the united germany . just as eastern business and industry have suffered since the fall of the berlin wall , so have the region 's soccer clubs .
east can not match west .
in the unified germany , where money governs professional sports , eastern teams have sunk without sponsors and investment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when hansa rostock was relegated on the final day of last season , it left the bundesliga ’ s top flight without any eastern representation .
in the first full domestic season after unification , hansa and dynamo dresden were launched into the top league of the bundesliga and six others into the second division .
things have changed radically since the 1991 campaign .
there are now no eastern teams in the first division and only four in the second . financial woes cause mediocrity once a proud and dominant team in the gdr , dynamo dresden has since dropped out of the professional game and those teams who survive find their finances slashed , unable to attract top-quality players .
the tv budget for the bundesliga has been slashed by 60 percent and the majority of the money generated gets shared out among the top clubs - all from the west - in the first division .
the rest is thrown like scraps to the teams in the second division .
beyond that , it 's every team for itself . just as unification led to a mass exodus of workers from the east to the west in the early 1990 's , many soccer players from the gdr headed for the more fashionable and lucrative western clubs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias sammer was the first player from the former gdr to play for the unified germany team .
the gdr production line , built on intensive technical and physical training , was so proficient that after unification , some 500 players joined western clubs .
by the mid-1990s , players like matthias sammer -lrb- photo , right -rrb- , jens jeremies , carsten jancker and alexander zickler had formed the backbone of the national team . " soccer was a great tool for celebrating the successes of eastern-bloc politics back in the days of the gdr , " said kirk schmidt , author of " ostkurve , " a study on the history of soccer in east germany . " the state ensured that the young players were given the best training possible in the hope that their successes would bring glory , " he said .
" this backfired when the communist regime fell .
the east had all these great players who then headed for the west and when the clubs found themselves losing money , they cashed in on anyone just to stay afloat . " state-supported training programs left to decay but now the well of sought-after soccer players in the east is now running dry .
that is not due to any lack of talent but rather because of a lack of financial support for youth programs and sports schools that , under the old communist regime , ensured talented youngsters would train twice a day , two hours at a time , and play regularly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's kevin kuranyi , michael ballack and bernd schneider , from left .
" the funding just dried up after 1990 , " schmidt said .
" that 's why the bundesliga and the national team have so few prominent eastern players .
people like -lrb- bayern munich 's -rrb- michael ballack and -lrb- bayer leverkusen 's -rrb- bernd schneider were already on their way by then .
others were n't so lucky .
the old gdr education system was allowed to decay . " economic stagnation rules out cities from showpiece bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leipzig will have a new stadium for the 2006 world cup after coming up with the necessary money to be awarded host city status .
such is the poor condition of some eastern cities ' finances that some - including dresden , the state capital of saxony - which applied for world cup 2006 host city status failed to conform to world cup directives set out by fifa , world soccer 's governing body , in areas such as transport facilities and overall infrastructure .
as a result , out of the 12 host cities featuring games during the championships , only two of those are in the east of the country - berlin and leipzig .
that is despite attempts " to keep a geographical balance , " according to david noemi from germany ’ s world cup organizing committee . fifteen years after reunification , questions are still being asked whether germany is working as a unified country or not .
in german soccer the answer is fairly clear .
there may be no physical walls between them anymore but a divide certainly remains between east and west when it comes to all aspects of the beautiful game . nick amies , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de east germany 's star quality in question bfc dynamo berlin were once the top soccer team in east germany .

germany 's interior minister has been asked to explain why police searched a journalist 's home and his magazine 's office in raids .
the incident has sparked a debate over press freedom . german interior minister otto schily will appear before parliament 's home affairs committee , his office said , in a hearing expected to take place next week . the opposition liberal free democrats demanded the hearing .
their parliamentary business manager jürgen koppelin described the police raids last month as " politically questionable and constitutionally dubious . " police searched the offices of the monthly political magazine cicero and the home of journalist bruno schirra in an investigation launched by the federal police agency regarding the leak of a confidential document on al qaeda 's leader in iraq , abu musab al-zarqawi . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cicero said in its latest edition that they copied the editor 's hard drive and removed 15 boxes of documents from the home of schirra , an investigative journalist who specializes in the middle east and was attending a security conference in israel at the time . schirra , 47 , had used the leaked police document as one of his sources for a story on zarqawi in april . outraged cicero quoted him as saying he was outraged at the raids and would resist pressure to divulge his sources . " i never , under any circumstances , talk about sources , neither with editors , nor with prosecutors , nor with judges , " schirra told reuters . " with a very flimsy pretext , the state broke into my house and emtied it , " he added .
" i call that gagging press freedom .

hours later , up to 1,500 mounted a fresh attempt to push through the border . " in the coming days , probably tomorrow , it is possible that there will be a repatriation of illegal immigrants -lrb- to morocco -rrb- , " said deputy prime minister maria teresa fernandez de la vega .
" this is an exceptional decision because it will be a first . " in the coming days we will work to begin reactivating the 1992 accord between spain and morocco on the control of migration , which has never been applied , " she added in a public statement . just a few hours after the comments were made up to 1,500 would-be immigrants mounted a fresh assault on spain 's north african enclave of melilla early thursday morning . but none of them were successful breaking through spain 's defenses , according to the police . " there 's been an assault which has been repelled by moroccan and spanish forces , " a police spokesman told reuters .
" no one got in . " sharp i n crease recent months have seen a sharp increase of such incidents in the spanish enclaves of melilla and ceuta , involving people from many african countries determined to escape poverty and start a new life in europe . the latest assault took place in the pinares de rostrogordo zone where the perimeter fence has yet to be raised from three to six meters -lrb- 10 to 20 feet -rrb- high , as is the case around the rest of the enclave , according to private spanish radio cadena ser . bildunterschrift : illegal immigrants in front of the melilla police station after they attempted to jump over the border fence medics in the zone treated many immigrants for cuts and bruises , and two were still under observation , police said , adding that two police members had also been injured .
about 15 immigrants had to have plaster casts applied . fernandez de la vega planned to travel to melilla late wednesday and then on to ceuta on thursday .
earlier wednesday , she met the conservative local government chiefs of melilla and ceuta , who have strongly criticized the administration 's management of the crisis .
they urged zapatero to reaffirm madrid 's sovereignty in the two enclaves .
seve n would-be immigra n ts dead the latest immigrant invasion took place before dawn , the day after local melilla government official jose fernandez charcon announced that a third metal barrier would be set up to reinforce the border with morocco . eu justice and security commissioner franco frattini on tuesday said the bloc would shortly be sending a technical mission to investigate the worsening situation on the southern coast of the mediterranean .
bildunterschrift : spanish soldiers leave the rostrogordo area of the border between spain and morocco in spanish enclave of melilla seven african would-be immigrants have died since the beginning of the summer during similar assaults , including five in ceuta last thursday .
on monday , 135 people were injured when around 650 stormed melilla .
some 300 people broke into the same enclave in two mass stormings of the barrier , involving about 1,000 people , in a similar incident . spain has recently been accelerating plans to raise the border fence , equipped with infrared cameras and movement detectors , while morocco is increasing police operations in forests bordering the enclaves .
the earlier decision to beef up the barriers is believed to be behind the heavy immigrant influx recently . after wednesday 's incident , moroccan police arrested 85 immigrants , including 13 women , bringing the total number of such arrests since the beginning of the year to 6,167 . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a german amnesty for illegal immigrants ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 06.10.2005 divisions in soccer mirror germany 's ills großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : since east beat west 1-0 in 1974 , germany 's soccer divide has grown germany is presenting a united front as host nation for soccer 's world cup .
but just as the country remains divided socially and economically between east and west , german soccer is also split along similar lines . when the world cup kicks off in germany next summer , the eyes of the world will turn to the host nation . if everything goes to plan , the fifa 2006 world cup in germany will be more than just a spectacle of soccer ; it will be seen as an example of germany 's organizational prowess and a message to the world of what the once-divided nation can achieve now that east and west have been reunited . beyond the fanfares and flags , however , there 's another reality .
germany 's eastern and western regions are still far apart socially and economically and in some eyes , soccer has become a metaphor for the failure of the united germany . just as eastern business and industry have suffered since the fall of the berlin wall , so have the region 's soccer clubs .
east can not match west .
in the unified germany , where money governs professional sports , eastern teams have sunk without sponsors and investment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when hansa rostock was relegated on the final day of last season , it left the bundesliga ’ s top flight without any eastern representation .
in the first full domestic season after unification , hansa and dynamo dresden were launched into the top league of the bundesliga and six others into the second division .
things have changed radically since the 1991 campaign .
there are now no eastern teams in the first division and only four in the second . financial woes cause mediocrity once a proud and dominant team in the gdr , dynamo dresden has since dropped out of the professional game and those teams who survive find their finances slashed , unable to attract top-quality players .
the tv budget for the bundesliga has been slashed by 60 percent and the majority of the money generated gets shared out among the top clubs - all from the west - in the first division .
the rest is thrown like scraps to the teams in the second division .
beyond that , it 's every team for itself . just as unification led to a mass exodus of workers from the east to the west in the early 1990 's , many soccer players from the gdr headed for the more fashionable and lucrative western clubs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias sammer was the first player from the former gdr to play for the unified germany team .
the gdr production line , built on intensive technical and physical training , was so proficient that after unification , some 500 players joined western clubs .
by the mid-1990s , players like matthias sammer -lrb- photo , right -rrb- , jens jeremies , carsten jancker and alexander zickler had formed the backbone of the national team . " soccer was a great tool for celebrating the successes of eastern-bloc politics back in the days of the gdr , " said kirk schmidt , author of " ostkurve , " a study on the history of soccer in east germany . " the state ensured that the young players were given the best training possible in the hope that their successes would bring glory , " he said .
" this backfired when the communist regime fell .
the east had all these great players who then headed for the west and when the clubs found themselves losing money , they cashed in on anyone just to stay afloat . " state-supported training programs left to decay but now the well of sought-after soccer players in the east is now running dry .
that is not due to any lack of talent but rather because of a lack of financial support for youth programs and sports schools that , under the old communist regime , ensured talented youngsters would train twice a day , two hours at a time , and play regularly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's kevin kuranyi , michael ballack and bernd schneider , from left .
" the funding just dried up after 1990 , " schmidt said .
" that 's why the bundesliga and the national team have so few prominent eastern players .
people like -lrb- bayern munich 's -rrb- michael ballack and -lrb- bayer leverkusen 's -rrb- bernd schneider were already on their way by then .
others were n't so lucky .
the old gdr education system was allowed to decay . " economic stagnation rules out cities from showpiece bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leipzig will have a new stadium for the 2006 world cup after coming up with the necessary money to be awarded host city status .
such is the poor condition of some eastern cities ' finances that some - including dresden , the state capital of saxony - which applied for world cup 2006 host city status failed to conform to world cup directives set out by fifa , world soccer 's governing body , in areas such as transport facilities and overall infrastructure .
as a result , out of the 12 host cities featuring games during the championships , only two of those are in the east of the country - berlin and leipzig .
that is despite attempts " to keep a geographical balance , " according to david noemi from germany ’ s world cup organizing committee . fifteen years after reunification , questions are still being asked whether germany is working as a unified country or not .
in german soccer the answer is fairly clear .
there may be no physical walls between them anymore but a divide certainly remains between east and west when it comes to all aspects of the beautiful game . nick amies , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de east germany 's star quality in question bfc dynamo berlin were once the top soccer team in east germany .
now they want to be honored appropriately for its success .

a german company - in an ultimate act of retro defiance - has announced its plans to produce nicotine-laced beer .
bars and restaurants may soon see decreasing levels of nervous finger-tapping and panicky lip-biting . in many countries , smoking bans in bars and restaurants are turning heavy smokers into an army of forlorn neurotics .
forced to separate their alcohol and nicotine addictions and ostracized from their favorite bars , smokers are nowadays congregating on the streets .
there , they expose their feeble - though defiant - bodies to the cruelty of the elements as well as the despising , self-righteous looks of the ubiquitous health freaks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barred from smoking inside a bar .
no matter how many times they tug their ears , fiddle with their keys , pull their sleeves or check the time on their cell phone - which , incidentally , they tend to forget immediately , so that they have to keep checking , continuously and indefinitely - smokers are banging their heads against the " no smoking " signs all over the world and asking the same question : why , oh why , does life have to be so unfair ? but all that may soon be history . a glimmer of hope drinking and smoking - a match , apparently , made in heaven , but not heavily advertised by world religions - is about to experience a new , post-prohibitive reincarnation in the shape of nicoshot , a nicotine-laced beer . a german beer producer , nautilus , has announced that it is currently testing nicoshot , a beer containing 6.3 percent alcohol and three milligrams of nicotine per bottle . " many countries have a smoking ban in bars and restaurants , " a nautilus spokesperson said .
" with our beer , you wo n't have to go outside for a quickie . " addictio n s u n ite hosanna , nautilus !
smokers all over the world will be grateful .
but is n't nicotine addictive ?
wo n't stuffing nicotine down the beer drinkers ' throats simply encourage a new generation of smokers to trade yellow teeth for beer bellies and bad hangovers ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicotine may find its way back into no-smoking bars , albeit in a liquid form the german company would beg to differ .
in fact , it is hoping that nicoshot will help people smoke less . " while nicoshot can lessen cravings , it is not a ' cure ' for smoking , " the nautilus spokesperson said .
" but it can help you make changes in your lifestyle without having to walk out of the bar for a quick smoke to deal with sudden withdrawal symptoms . " if all goes according to the plan and the nicotine beer takes off , smokers will experience dramatic improvements in the quality of their booze-bonding - somewhere between the devil and the deep spew . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the best of " from the fringe " click here for a selection of best stories from dw-world 's series " and finally ...

but just as the country remains divided socially and economically between east and west , german soccer is also split along similar lines . when the world cup kicks off in germany next summer , the eyes of the world will turn to the host nation . if everything goes to plan , the fifa 2006 world cup in germany will be more than just a spectacle of soccer ; it will be seen as an example of germany 's organizational prowess and a message to the world of what the once-divided nation can achieve now that east and west have been reunited . beyond the fanfares and flags , however , there 's another reality .
germany 's eastern and western regions are still far apart socially and economically and in some eyes , soccer has become a metaphor for the failure of the united germany . just as eastern business and industry have suffered since the fall of the berlin wall , so have the region 's soccer clubs .
east can not match west .
in the unified germany , where money governs professional sports , eastern teams have sunk without sponsors and investment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when hansa rostock was relegated on the final day of last season , it left the bundesliga ’ s top flight without any eastern representation .
in the first full domestic season after unification , hansa and dynamo dresden were launched into the top league of the bundesliga and six others into the second division .
things have changed radically since the 1991 campaign .
there are now no eastern teams in the first division and only four in the second . financial woes cause mediocrity once a proud and dominant team in the gdr , dynamo dresden has since dropped out of the professional game and those teams who survive find their finances slashed , unable to attract top-quality players .
the tv budget for the bundesliga has been slashed by 60 percent and the majority of the money generated gets shared out among the top clubs - all from the west - in the first division .
the rest is thrown like scraps to the teams in the second division .
beyond that , it 's every team for itself . just as unification led to a mass exodus of workers from the east to the west in the early 1990 's , many soccer players from the gdr headed for the more fashionable and lucrative western clubs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias sammer was the first player from the former gdr to play for the unified germany team .
the gdr production line , built on intensive technical and physical training , was so proficient that after unification , some 500 players joined western clubs .
by the mid-1990s , players like matthias sammer -lrb- photo , right -rrb- , jens jeremies , carsten jancker and alexander zickler had formed the backbone of the national team . " soccer was a great tool for celebrating the successes of eastern-bloc politics back in the days of the gdr , " said kirk schmidt , author of " ostkurve , " a study on the history of soccer in east germany . " the state ensured that the young players were given the best training possible in the hope that their successes would bring glory , " he said .
" this backfired when the communist regime fell .
the east had all these great players who then headed for the west and when the clubs found themselves losing money , they cashed in on anyone just to stay afloat . " state-supported training programs left to decay but now the well of sought-after soccer players in the east is now running dry .
that is not due to any lack of talent but rather because of a lack of financial support for youth programs and sports schools that , under the old communist regime , ensured talented youngsters would train twice a day , two hours at a time , and play regularly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's kevin kuranyi , michael ballack and bernd schneider , from left .
" the funding just dried up after 1990 , " schmidt said .
" that 's why the bundesliga and the national team have so few prominent eastern players .
people like -lrb- bayern munich 's -rrb- michael ballack and -lrb- bayer leverkusen 's -rrb- bernd schneider were already on their way by then .
others were n't so lucky .
the old gdr education system was allowed to decay . " economic stagnation rules out cities from showpiece bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leipzig will have a new stadium for the 2006 world cup after coming up with the necessary money to be awarded host city status .
such is the poor condition of some eastern cities ' finances that some - including dresden , the state capital of saxony - which applied for world cup 2006 host city status failed to conform to world cup directives set out by fifa , world soccer 's governing body , in areas such as transport facilities and overall infrastructure .
as a result , out of the 12 host cities featuring games during the championships , only two of those are in the east of the country - berlin and leipzig .
that is despite attempts " to keep a geographical balance , " according to david noemi from germany ’ s world cup organizing committee . fifteen years after reunification , questions are still being asked whether germany is working as a unified country or not .
in german soccer the answer is fairly clear .
there may be no physical walls between them anymore but a divide certainly remains between east and west when it comes to all aspects of the beautiful game . nick amies , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de east germany 's star quality in question bfc dynamo berlin were once the top soccer team in east germany .
now they want to be honored appropriately for its success .
yet the club 's demands raise a few questions about fairness - both on and off the field .

germans still waiting for a new - or old - chancellor were left hanging once again when party leaders announced that any deal concerning the leadership of germany would not be completed before the weekend . many were expecting a result in the chancellery stand-off by late thursday evening after christian democrat -lrb- cdu -rrb- leader angela merkel , her bavarian ally edmund stoiber , head of the cdu 's sister party the christian social union , chancellor gerhard schröder and social democrat chief franz müntefering concluded their meeting scheduled for 19:00 utc . but earlier in the day , merkel announced that a deal would not be reached until the weekend , with more talks planned before sunday .
" i have informed -lrb- the party executive -rrb- there will be further decisions made in the leadership talks and also said there will probably not be decisions from these talks before sunday evening , " she told reporters after a meeting of cdu leaders . both she and spd leader franz müntefering said no further announcements were planned before the completion of talks , but they were confident a deal would be reached . müntefering said a decision on the chancellery would not be known until monday , when he would submit the outcome of the talks to the spd leadership .

the chancellor has refused to concede defeat , even though the conservatives won four more seats in parliament . however , earlier this week schröder hinted he may give up the post he has held since 1998 , saying he would not stop the creation of a stable government . in a statement of support , spd chief müntefering said it was still the party 's aim to keep schröder in the chancellery but his tone was less belligerent than that used by the social democrats in recent days .
" the party wants him as chancellor .
we 'll fight for that and argue for it and hold talks , " he said . opposition to merkel waning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many attending the meeting of party leaders during the day on thursday said that previously strong spd objections to supporting merkel as chancellor were softening .

germans still waiting for a new - or old - chancellor were left hanging once again when party leaders announced that any deal concerning the leadership of germany would not be completed before the weekend . many were expecting a result in the chancellery stand-off by late thursday evening after christian democrat -lrb- cdu -rrb- leader angela merkel , her bavarian ally edmund stoiber , head of the cdu 's sister party the christian social union , chancellor gerhard schröder and social democrat chief franz müntefering concluded their meeting scheduled for 19:00 utc . but earlier in the day , merkel announced that a deal would not be reached until the weekend , with more talks planned before sunday .
" i have informed -lrb- the party executive -rrb- there will be further decisions made in the leadership talks and also said there will probably not be decisions from these talks before sunday evening , " she told reporters after a meeting of cdu leaders . both she and spd leader franz müntefering said no further announcements were planned before the completion of talks , but they were confident a deal would be reached . müntefering said a decision on the chancellery would not be known until monday , when he would submit the outcome of the talks to the spd leadership .

the chancellor has refused to concede defeat , even though the conservatives won four more seats in parliament . however , earlier this week schröder hinted he may give up the post he has held since 1998 , saying he would not stop the creation of a stable government . in a statement of support , spd chief müntefering said it was still the party 's aim to keep schröder in the chancellery but his tone was less belligerent than that used by the social democrats in recent days .
" the party wants him as chancellor .

as a top destination , germany benefits from them too . the roughly 200 million migrants worldwide were an important force for the world economy , the un-backed study by the global commission on international migration , a 19-member independent panel , showed .
in addition to the trillions they spent in their host countries , they sent remittances of around $ 150 billion home , three times the amount the world officially devotes to developmental aid .
an additional $ 300 billion may be transferred informally , the report added . " in the 21st century , one of our most important challenges is to find ways to manage migration for the benefit of all - of sending countries , receiving countries , transit countries and migrants themselves , " un secretary general kofi annan said at the launch of the report .
" i agree with the commission that we are not rising to the challenge yet .
but i am convinced we must do so , " reuters quoted annan as saying . after the united states and russia , germany had the third greatest number of migrants , 7.3 million , 4.2 percent of the world 's migrants , in 2000 .
along with belgium and switzerland , the country also ranked third in the amount of remittances migrants send home : $ 8 billion in 2001 .
the same year germany spent $ 5.68 billion on developmental aid .

it did though point out that the economies of industrial countries would collapse without foreign nurses , computer engineers or farm workers . " if information percolated throughout economies , people would stop moaning about migrants taking away work , " mamphela ramphele , a south african member of the commission and former senior world bank official , said . over the past 35 years , the number of migrants worldwide has grown from 72 million to 200 million , around 10 million of whom are refugees .
from 1990 to 2000 , international migration accounted for 56 percent of population growth in the developed world , compared with 3 percent in developing nations , the report noted .
and the numbers continue to grow . " the expansion in the scale and scope of migration seems certain to continue for the foreseeable future and may well accelerate , due to the growing developmental , demographic and democratic disparities that exist between different regions of the world , " the report said .
" migration is driven by some powerful economic , social and political forces , and states must acknowledge its reality . " " the international community has failed to realize the full potential of international migration and has not risen to the many opportunities and challenges it represents , " the report said .
it called for a " comprehensive , coherent and global action framework " for un member nations ' migration policies .
harsh approaches to illegal immigration the study also estimated that 2.5 to 4 million people move to other countries illegally each year .
though the report recognized the right of states to set rules to deal with illegal immigration , the authors were critical .
" a purely restrictive approach to irregular migration is neither desirable nor feasible and may jeopardize the rights of migrants and refugees , " they said . bildunterschrift : an african immigrant with a bandaged hand queues with other african immigrants as they wait for food at a holding facility in the spanish enclave of melilla , thursday , sept .

-lrb- ap photo / jasper juinen -rrb- the report pressed for improved cooperation among governments trying to tackle illegal immigration , combined with efforts to ensure legal migrants are " effectively integrated " in the countries where they settle . " the role of migrants in promoting economic growth , development and poverty reduction should be recognized and reinforced , " the report added .
" migration must become an integral part of global development strategies . " the commission was created in 2003 by un head kofi annan to study policies worldwide , spurred by brazil , morocco , the philippines , sweden and switzerland .

" on monday we can say definitively who will be the next chancellor , " he said . cdu expects stubborn schröder to stand down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the conservatives expect schröder to eventually concede to merkel in their stand-off over who will head a new government . " we are a few hours away from a concession that will see angela merkel become the first woman to be german chancellor , " wolfgang bosbach , the deputy leader of the cdu parliamentary group , told national radio . günther beckstein , the interior minister of the conservative-run southern state of bavaria , said it was time for schröder 's party to accept that it had lost the election .

the chancellor has refused to concede defeat , even though the conservatives won four more seats in parliament . however , earlier this week schröder hinted he may give up the post he has held since 1998 , saying he would not stop the creation of a stable government . in a statement of support , spd chief müntefering said it was still the party 's aim to keep schröder in the chancellery but his tone was less belligerent than that used by the social democrats in recent days .

but just as the country remains divided socially and economically between east and west , german soccer is also split along similar lines . when the world cup kicks off in germany next summer , the eyes of the world will turn to the host nation . if everything goes to plan , the fifa 2006 world cup in germany will be more than just a spectacle of soccer ; it will be seen as an example of germany 's organizational prowess and a message to the world of what the once-divided nation can achieve now that east and west have been reunited . beyond the fanfares and flags , however , there 's another reality .
germany 's eastern and western regions are still far apart socially and economically and in some eyes , soccer has become a metaphor for the failure of the united germany . just as eastern business and industry have suffered since the fall of the berlin wall , so have the region 's soccer clubs .
east can not match west .
in the unified germany , where money governs professional sports , eastern teams have sunk without sponsors and investment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when hansa rostock was relegated on the final day of last season , it left the bundesliga ’ s top flight without any eastern representation .
in the first full domestic season after unification , hansa and dynamo dresden were launched into the top league of the bundesliga and six others into the second division .
things have changed radically since the 1991 campaign .
there are now no eastern teams in the first division and only four in the second . financial woes cause mediocrity once a proud and dominant team in the gdr , dynamo dresden has since dropped out of the professional game and those teams who survive find their finances slashed , unable to attract top-quality players .
the tv budget for the bundesliga has been slashed by 60 percent and the majority of the money generated gets shared out among the top clubs - all from the west - in the first division .
the rest is thrown like scraps to the teams in the second division .
beyond that , it 's every team for itself . just as unification led to a mass exodus of workers from the east to the west in the early 1990 's , many soccer players from the gdr headed for the more fashionable and lucrative western clubs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias sammer was the first player from the former gdr to play for the unified germany team .
the gdr production line , built on intensive technical and physical training , was so proficient that after unification , some 500 players joined western clubs .
by the mid-1990s , players like matthias sammer -lrb- photo , right -rrb- , jens jeremies , carsten jancker and alexander zickler had formed the backbone of the national team . " soccer was a great tool for celebrating the successes of eastern-bloc politics back in the days of the gdr , " said kirk schmidt , author of " ostkurve , " a study on the history of soccer in east germany . " the state ensured that the young players were given the best training possible in the hope that their successes would bring glory , " he said .
" this backfired when the communist regime fell .
the east had all these great players who then headed for the west and when the clubs found themselves losing money , they cashed in on anyone just to stay afloat . " state-supported training programs left to decay but now the well of sought-after soccer players in the east is now running dry .
that is not due to any lack of talent but rather because of a lack of financial support for youth programs and sports schools that , under the old communist regime , ensured talented youngsters would train twice a day , two hours at a time , and play regularly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's kevin kuranyi , michael ballack and bernd schneider , from left .
" the funding just dried up after 1990 , " schmidt said .
" that 's why the bundesliga and the national team have so few prominent eastern players .
people like -lrb- bayern munich 's -rrb- michael ballack and -lrb- bayer leverkusen 's -rrb- bernd schneider were already on their way by then .
others were n't so lucky .
the old gdr education system was allowed to decay . " economic stagnation rules out cities from showpiece bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leipzig will have a new stadium for the 2006 world cup after coming up with the necessary money to be awarded host city status .
such is the poor condition of some eastern cities ' finances that some - including dresden , the state capital of saxony - which applied for world cup 2006 host city status failed to conform to world cup directives set out by fifa , world soccer 's governing body , in areas such as transport facilities and overall infrastructure .
as a result , out of the 12 host cities featuring games during the championships , only two of those are in the east of the country - berlin and leipzig .
that is despite attempts " to keep a geographical balance , " according to david noemi from germany ’ s world cup organizing committee . fifteen years after reunification , questions are still being asked whether germany is working as a unified country or not .
in german soccer the answer is fairly clear .
there may be no physical walls between them anymore but a divide certainly remains between east and west when it comes to all aspects of the beautiful game . nick amies , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de east germany 's star quality in question bfc dynamo berlin were once the top soccer team in east germany .

but just as the country remains divided socially and economically between east and west , german soccer is also split along similar lines . when the world cup kicks off in germany next summer , the eyes of the world will turn to the host nation . if everything goes to plan , the fifa 2006 world cup in germany will be more than just a spectacle of soccer ; it will be seen as an example of germany 's organizational prowess and a message to the world of what the once-divided nation can achieve now that east and west have been reunited . beyond the fanfares and flags , however , there 's another reality .
germany 's eastern and western regions are still far apart socially and economically and in some eyes , soccer has become a metaphor for the failure of the united germany . just as eastern business and industry have suffered since the fall of the berlin wall , so have the region 's soccer clubs .
east can not match west .
in the unified germany , where money governs professional sports , eastern teams have sunk without sponsors and investment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when hansa rostock was relegated on the final day of last season , it left the bundesliga ’ s top flight without any eastern representation .
in the first full domestic season after unification , hansa and dynamo dresden were launched into the top league of the bundesliga and six others into the second division .
things have changed radically since the 1991 campaign .
there are now no eastern teams in the first division and only four in the second . financial woes cause mediocrity once a proud and dominant team in the gdr , dynamo dresden has since dropped out of the professional game and those teams who survive find their finances slashed , unable to attract top-quality players .
the tv budget for the bundesliga has been slashed by 60 percent and the majority of the money generated gets shared out among the top clubs - all from the west - in the first division .
the rest is thrown like scraps to the teams in the second division .
beyond that , it 's every team for itself . just as unification led to a mass exodus of workers from the east to the west in the early 1990 's , many soccer players from the gdr headed for the more fashionable and lucrative western clubs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias sammer was the first player from the former gdr to play for the unified germany team .
the gdr production line , built on intensive technical and physical training , was so proficient that after unification , some 500 players joined western clubs .
by the mid-1990s , players like matthias sammer -lrb- photo , right -rrb- , jens jeremies , carsten jancker and alexander zickler had formed the backbone of the national team . " soccer was a great tool for celebrating the successes of eastern-bloc politics back in the days of the gdr , " said kirk schmidt , author of " ostkurve , " a study on the history of soccer in east germany . " the state ensured that the young players were given the best training possible in the hope that their successes would bring glory , " he said .
" this backfired when the communist regime fell .
the east had all these great players who then headed for the west and when the clubs found themselves losing money , they cashed in on anyone just to stay afloat . " state-supported training programs left to decay but now the well of sought-after soccer players in the east is now running dry .
that is not due to any lack of talent but rather because of a lack of financial support for youth programs and sports schools that , under the old communist regime , ensured talented youngsters would train twice a day , two hours at a time , and play regularly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's kevin kuranyi , michael ballack and bernd schneider , from left .
" the funding just dried up after 1990 , " schmidt said .
" that 's why the bundesliga and the national team have so few prominent eastern players .
people like -lrb- bayern munich 's -rrb- michael ballack and -lrb- bayer leverkusen 's -rrb- bernd schneider were already on their way by then .
others were n't so lucky .
the old gdr education system was allowed to decay . " economic stagnation rules out cities from showpiece bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leipzig will have a new stadium for the 2006 world cup after coming up with the necessary money to be awarded host city status .
such is the poor condition of some eastern cities ' finances that some - including dresden , the state capital of saxony - which applied for world cup 2006 host city status failed to conform to world cup directives set out by fifa , world soccer 's governing body , in areas such as transport facilities and overall infrastructure .
as a result , out of the 12 host cities featuring games during the championships , only two of those are in the east of the country - berlin and leipzig .
that is despite attempts " to keep a geographical balance , " according to david noemi from germany ’ s world cup organizing committee . fifteen years after reunification , questions are still being asked whether germany is working as a unified country or not .
in german soccer the answer is fairly clear .
there may be no physical walls between them anymore but a divide certainly remains between east and west when it comes to all aspects of the beautiful game . nick amies , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de east germany 's star quality in question bfc dynamo berlin were once the top soccer team in east germany .
now they want to be honored appropriately for its success .
yet the club 's demands raise a few questions about fairness - both on and off the field .

germans still waiting for a new - or old - chancellor were left hanging once again when party leaders announced that any deal concerning the leadership of germany would not be completed before the weekend . many were expecting a result in the chancellery stand-off by late thursday evening after christian democrat -lrb- cdu -rrb- leader angela merkel , her bavarian ally edmund stoiber , head of the cdu 's sister party the christian social union , chancellor gerhard schröder and social democrat chief franz müntefering concluded their meeting scheduled for 19:00 utc . but earlier in the day , merkel announced that a deal would not be reached until the weekend , with more talks planned before sunday .
" i have informed -lrb- the party executive -rrb- there will be further decisions made in the leadership talks and also said there will probably not be decisions from these talks before sunday evening , " she told reporters after a meeting of cdu leaders . both she and spd leader franz müntefering said no further announcements were planned before the completion of talks , but they were confident a deal would be reached . müntefering said a decision on the chancellery would not be known until monday , when he would submit the outcome of the talks to the spd leadership .
" on monday we can say definitively who will be the next chancellor , " he said . cdu expects stubborn schröder to stand down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the conservatives expect schröder to eventually concede to merkel in their stand-off over who will head a new government . " we are a few hours away from a concession that will see angela merkel become the first woman to be german chancellor , " wolfgang bosbach , the deputy leader of the cdu parliamentary group , told national radio . günther beckstein , the interior minister of the conservative-run southern state of bavaria , said it was time for schröder 's party to accept that it had lost the election .

the chancellor has refused to concede defeat , even though the conservatives won four more seats in parliament . however , earlier this week schröder hinted he may give up the post he has held since 1998 , saying he would not stop the creation of a stable government . in a statement of support , spd chief müntefering said it was still the party 's aim to keep schröder in the chancellery but his tone was less belligerent than that used by the social democrats in recent days .
" the party wants him as chancellor .

germans still waiting for a new - or old - chancellor were left hanging once again when party leaders announced that any deal concerning the leadership of germany would not be completed before the weekend . many were expecting a result in the chancellery stand-off by late thursday evening after christian democrat -lrb- cdu -rrb- leader angela merkel , her bavarian ally edmund stoiber , head of the cdu 's sister party the christian social union , chancellor gerhard schröder and social democrat chief franz müntefering concluded their meeting scheduled for 19:00 utc . but earlier in the day , merkel announced that a deal would not be reached until the weekend , with more talks planned before sunday .
" i have informed -lrb- the party executive -rrb- there will be further decisions made in the leadership talks and also said there will probably not be decisions from these talks before sunday evening , " she told reporters after a meeting of cdu leaders . both she and spd leader franz müntefering said no further announcements were planned before the completion of talks , but they were confident a deal would be reached . müntefering said a decision on the chancellery would not be known until monday , when he would submit the outcome of the talks to the spd leadership .
" on monday we can say definitively who will be the next chancellor , " he said . cdu expects stubborn schröder to stand down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the conservatives expect schröder to eventually concede to merkel in their stand-off over who will head a new government . " we are a few hours away from a concession that will see angela merkel become the first woman to be german chancellor , " wolfgang bosbach , the deputy leader of the cdu parliamentary group , told national radio . günther beckstein , the interior minister of the conservative-run southern state of bavaria , said it was time for schröder 's party to accept that it had lost the election .
" either we have a woman chancellor or the talks fail , " he said . schröder has shown a stubbornness in the weeks following the sept .
18 election that suggest he will not go without a fight .
the chancellor has refused to concede defeat , even though the conservatives won four more seats in parliament . however , earlier this week schröder hinted he may give up the post he has held since 1998 , saying he would not stop the creation of a stable government . in a statement of support , spd chief müntefering said it was still the party 's aim to keep schröder in the chancellery but his tone was less belligerent than that used by the social democrats in recent days .
" the party wants him as chancellor .
we 'll fight for that and argue for it and hold talks , " he said . opposition to merkel waning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many attending the meeting of party leaders during the day on thursday said that previously strong spd objections to supporting merkel as chancellor were softening .
merkel 's most ardent critic in the social democrats , ludwig stiegler , deputy head of the parliamentary party , was being isolated in the discussions , sources told reuters . despite the stalemate over who will lead germany , it looks increasingly likely that the two main parties will find consensus to form a grand coalition .
neither merkel 's conservatives nor schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- won a majority with their preferred allies in the election . grand coalition getting closer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two parties have softened their tone in reference to the possibility of a red-black coalition in recent days with comments hinting at a closing of the gap between their differences .
both the cdu and spd appear to agree on the need to bring germany 's escalating deficit back under eu limits , unravel the mess of conflicting state and federal powers and simplify germany 's notoriously complex tax code . news that a working government may finally soon be in place is good news for both the euro and german shares .
the european union has been on tenterhooks over germany 's power struggle with the knock-on effect affecting the single currency .
financial markets have also banked on a new government tackling economic reforms and will be relieved to hear that this goal will be one shared by whoever takes the reins . transition to new government to be far from smooth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but barriers remain .
the social democrats are still refusing to give in to the conservatives on plans to ease hiring and firing rules , loosen the system of sector-wide pay deals and on reforms to health insurance funding .
whatever deals are struck over the coming days , the transition to a new government will be far from smooth . " i 'm afraid the negotiations are more likely to last three weeks than two , " said christian wulff , conservative state premier of lower saxony , " but if they 're good negotiations with a good result , then the old rule applies : thoroughness before speed . " dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rivals to tackle chancellor issue thursday germany 's two main parties will meet on thursday to thrash out who will lead a coalition government to break germany 's political deadlock following inconclusive elections , party sources said .

5 , 2005 -rrb- schröder hints he could bow out chancellor gerhard schröder said on monday that he would be prepared to step aside in the interest of forming a stable coalition with the conservatives .

with just a one-point lead over chancellor gerhard schröder 's spd , angela merkel 's cdu finds itself in a difficult position while the battle to determine the next german leader heats up .

a german company - in an ultimate act of retro defiance - has announced its plans to produce nicotine-laced beer .
bars and restaurants may soon see decreasing levels of nervous finger-tapping and panicky lip-biting . in many countries , smoking bans in bars and restaurants are turning heavy smokers into an army of forlorn neurotics .
forced to separate their alcohol and nicotine addictions and ostracized from their favorite bars , smokers are nowadays congregating on the streets .
there , they expose their feeble - though defiant - bodies to the cruelty of the elements as well as the despising , self-righteous looks of the ubiquitous health freaks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barred from smoking inside a bar .
no matter how many times they tug their ears , fiddle with their keys , pull their sleeves or check the time on their cell phone - which , incidentally , they tend to forget immediately , so that they have to keep checking , continuously and indefinitely - smokers are banging their heads against the " no smoking " signs all over the world and asking the same question : why , oh why , does life have to be so unfair ? but all that may soon be history . a glimmer of hope drinking and smoking - a match , apparently , made in heaven , but not heavily advertised by world religions - is about to experience a new , post-prohibitive reincarnation in the shape of nicoshot , a nicotine-laced beer . a german beer producer , nautilus , has announced that it is currently testing nicoshot , a beer containing 6.3 percent alcohol and three milligrams of nicotine per bottle . " many countries have a smoking ban in bars and restaurants , " a nautilus spokesperson said .
" with our beer , you wo n't have to go outside for a quickie . " addictio n s u n ite hosanna , nautilus !

investor interest in solar energy has soared thus far in 2005 after oil prices rose to record highs , increasing the attractiveness of renewable energy sources .
solarworld ag based in bonn has seen their market value more than double to 1.4 billion euros , making it germany 's biggest solar-cell manufacturer .
likewise , q-cells , based in thalheim , has doubled sales to 117 million euros in the first half of the year and has already sold its complete 2005 production of solar cells .
net income also more than doubled to 15.3 million euros in the first six months , according to q-cells reports .
christian reitberger , a member of q-cells ' board , said " our view is that clean tech investing is not only something for the ecologically minded idealists , but an activity that can make substantial returns .
the fact that it can also be ecologically beneficial makes it a particularly appealing combination . "
government subsidies pushing growth germany is one of the largest european markets for solar power , with state financing helping to support the sector by making roof-top solar panels affordable for households via subsidies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 55.4 cents per kilowatt hour .
popularity of solar energy is growing in germany .
according to federal government statsistics , subsidies for alternative energy sources are expected to double the share of renewable power in germany by 2010 .
currently , companies and individuals who install solar panels pay approximately 57.4 cents per kilowatt-hour for electricity .
compare that with the 1 to 6 cents it costs to generate that amount using conventional power plants .
subsidies : here today , gone tomorrow ?
as far as subsidies for solar power are concerned some investors are quietly raising there hand from the back of the room to ask the obvious question : will this state support continue ?
there are risks involved , since any legislation supporting the drive for new sources of energy may be changed or even overturned at whim if , say , there is a change in government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : non-traditional energy sources often find themselves beholden to the whim of politics this was demonstrated recently in germany , with the conservative cdu / csu parties threatening to reverse , at least partially , legislation drawn up under the current administration of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens to phase out nuclear power within a specified period of time .
making it work in germany despite what many analysts perceive to be " un-naturally high " share prices , the funding that german solar companies are now enjoying from a flurry of successful ipo 's can be funnelled back into both r & d and production — a fact which could position germany as the unrivalled king of the solar power industry .

solarworld ag based in bonn has seen their market value more than double to 1.4 billion euros , making it germany 's biggest solar-cell manufacturer .
likewise , q-cells , based in thalheim , has doubled sales to 117 million euros in the first half of the year and has already sold its complete 2005 production of solar cells .
net income also more than doubled to 15.3 million euros in the first six months , according to q-cells reports .
christian reitberger , a member of q-cells ' board , said " our view is that clean tech investing is not only something for the ecologically minded idealists , but an activity that can make substantial returns .
the fact that it can also be ecologically beneficial makes it a particularly appealing combination . "

a german company - in an ultimate act of retro defiance - has announced its plans to produce nicotine-laced beer .
bars and restaurants may soon see decreasing levels of nervous finger-tapping and panicky lip-biting . in many countries , smoking bans in bars and restaurants are turning heavy smokers into an army of forlorn neurotics .
forced to separate their alcohol and nicotine addictions and ostracized from their favorite bars , smokers are nowadays congregating on the streets .
there , they expose their feeble - though defiant - bodies to the cruelty of the elements as well as the despising , self-righteous looks of the ubiquitous health freaks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barred from smoking inside a bar .
no matter how many times they tug their ears , fiddle with their keys , pull their sleeves or check the time on their cell phone - which , incidentally , they tend to forget immediately , so that they have to keep checking , continuously and indefinitely - smokers are banging their heads against the " no smoking " signs all over the world and asking the same question : why , oh why , does life have to be so unfair ? but all that may soon be history . a glimmer of hope drinking and smoking - a match , apparently , made in heaven , but not heavily advertised by world religions - is about to experience a new , post-prohibitive reincarnation in the shape of nicoshot , a nicotine-laced beer . a german beer producer , nautilus , has announced that it is currently testing nicoshot , a beer containing 6.3 percent alcohol and three milligrams of nicotine per bottle . " many countries have a smoking ban in bars and restaurants , " a nautilus spokesperson said .
" with our beer , you wo n't have to go outside for a quickie . " addictio n s u n ite hosanna , nautilus !
smokers all over the world will be grateful .

hours later , up to 1,500 mounted a fresh attempt to push through the border . " in the coming days , probably tomorrow , it is possible that there will be a repatriation of illegal immigrants -lrb- to morocco -rrb- , " said deputy prime minister maria teresa fernandez de la vega .
" this is an exceptional decision because it will be a first . " in the coming days we will work to begin reactivating the 1992 accord between spain and morocco on the control of migration , which has never been applied , " she added in a public statement . just a few hours after the comments were made up to 1,500 would-be immigrants mounted a fresh assault on spain 's north african enclave of melilla early thursday morning . but none of them were successful breaking through spain 's defenses , according to the police . " there 's been an assault which has been repelled by moroccan and spanish forces , " a police spokesman told reuters .
" no one got in . " sharp i n crease recent months have seen a sharp increase of such incidents in the spanish enclaves of melilla and ceuta , involving people from many african countries determined to escape poverty and start a new life in europe . the latest assault took place in the pinares de rostrogordo zone where the perimeter fence has yet to be raised from three to six meters -lrb- 10 to 20 feet -rrb- high , as is the case around the rest of the enclave , according to private spanish radio cadena ser . bildunterschrift : illegal immigrants in front of the melilla police station after they attempted to jump over the border fence medics in the zone treated many immigrants for cuts and bruises , and two were still under observation , police said , adding that two police members had also been injured .
about 15 immigrants had to have plaster casts applied . fernandez de la vega planned to travel to melilla late wednesday and then on to ceuta on thursday .
earlier wednesday , she met the conservative local government chiefs of melilla and ceuta , who have strongly criticized the administration 's management of the crisis .
they urged zapatero to reaffirm madrid 's sovereignty in the two enclaves .
seve n would-be immigra n ts dead the latest immigrant invasion took place before dawn , the day after local melilla government official jose fernandez charcon announced that a third metal barrier would be set up to reinforce the border with morocco . eu justice and security commissioner franco frattini on tuesday said the bloc would shortly be sending a technical mission to investigate the worsening situation on the southern coast of the mediterranean .
bildunterschrift : spanish soldiers leave the rostrogordo area of the border between spain and morocco in spanish enclave of melilla seven african would-be immigrants have died since the beginning of the summer during similar assaults , including five in ceuta last thursday .
on monday , 135 people were injured when around 650 stormed melilla .
some 300 people broke into the same enclave in two mass stormings of the barrier , involving about 1,000 people , in a similar incident . spain has recently been accelerating plans to raise the border fence , equipped with infrared cameras and movement detectors , while morocco is increasing police operations in forests bordering the enclaves .
the earlier decision to beef up the barriers is believed to be behind the heavy immigrant influx recently . after wednesday 's incident , moroccan police arrested 85 immigrants , including 13 women , bringing the total number of such arrests since the beginning of the year to 6,167 . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : a german amnesty for illegal immigrants ?

bryntirion comprehensive in bridgend , is one of the first schools in the uk to try out the technology .
children place their finger on a scanner , which reads their print and records their attendance on a computer .
it is hoped the system , which would replace the traditional reading of the register , could help prevent truancy .
it takes away a lot of the headache head teacher alwyn thomas pupils in the sixth form are acting as the guinea pigs in the trial .
if a child fails to register at the beginning of the day a text alert can be sent immediately to a parent 's mobile phone - making it difficult for pupils to skip classes without someone knowing .
the information can also be sent to education welfare officers who can then use it to track down truants .
head teacher alwyn thomas said the trial had gone well so far .
" it 's a very efficient way of using school registration - from our point of view it takes away a lot of the headache , " he said .
" it allows us with a piece of software that 's been included with the package to alert parents if their children are not in school . "
many pupils at bryntirion have found that fingerprint registration gives them more time when they arrive at school .
sixth-former emily boobyer told bbc wales today : " it just means we can socialise a bit more in the morning .
i think it 's better - and so do most of the year group . "
traditional roll calls could be finished for good fellow pupil rhiannon williams said she was not concerned that the school was keeping a record of her fingerprint .
she said : " it 's not actually your fingerprint - it 's a code of it .
you ca n't actually turn it back into your fingerprint once it gets encoded . "
mr thomas said he hoped to be able to introduce the scanners to all the class rooms by the end of the year .
" at the present moment it 's only -lsb- used -rsb- with years 12 and 13 , but within the next few months we intend to use it with the whole school , " he said .

bryntirion comprehensive in bridgend , is one of the first schools in the uk to try out the technology .
children place their finger on a scanner , which reads their print and records their attendance on a computer .
it is hoped the system , which would replace the traditional reading of the register , could help prevent truancy . "
it takes away a lot of the headache " head teacher alwyn thomas pupils in the sixth form are acting as the guinea pigs in the trial .
if a child fails to register at the beginning of the day a text alert can be sent immediately to a parent 's mobile phone - making it difficult for pupils to skip classes without someone knowing .
the information can also be sent to education welfare officers who can then use it to track down truants .
head teacher alwyn thomas said the trial had gone well so far .
" it 's a very efficient way of using school registration - from our point of view it takes away a lot of the headache , " he said .
" it allows us with a piece of software that 's been included with the package to alert parents if their children are not in school . "
many pupils at bryntirion have found that fingerprint registration gives them more time when they arrive at school .
sixth-former emily boobyer told bbc wales today : " it just means we can socialise a bit more in the morning .
i think it 's better - and so do most of the year group . "
fellow pupil rhiannon williams said she was not concerned that the school was keeping a record of her fingerprint .
she said : " it 's not actually your fingerprint - it 's a code of it .
you ca n't actually turn it back into your fingerprint once it gets encoded . "
mr thomas said he hoped to be able to introduce the scanners to all the class rooms by the end of the year .
" at the present moment it 's only -lsb- used -rsb- with years 12 and 13 , but within the next few months we intend to use it with the whole school , " he said .

the trial of founder calisto tanzi is under way in milan , with prosecutors looking to apportion the blame for the firm 's billion-euro bankruptcy .
bbc news looks at the case and the current state of the troubled dairy firm .
what is mr tanzi accused of ?
mr tanzi , who built the firm up from a small , family-run delicatessen in parma , is accused of market rigging , false auditing and misleading investors and stock market regulators .
he is standing trial alongside 15 other people , including former bank of america and parmalat employees , as well as auditors .
parmalat collapsed with a 14bn-euro -lrb- $ 17bn ; £ 9.5bn -rrb- hole in its accounts .
the accused are said to have helped construct a web of complex financial deals , bond sales , offshore accounts and false book-keeping that hid the true state of the company and duped investors into giving it more cash .
mr tanzi argues that he was too far up the management chain to know the daily dealings of this top executives , whom he blames for parmalat 's problems .
the defendants have all denied the charges .
will it be a quick trial ?
unlikely , as italy 's judicial system is notoriously slow .
there also is a separate investigation going on in parma and mr tanzi 's lawyers are expected to argue that the two inquiries should be merged , further slowing down proceedings .
have some people already faced charges ?
in june , a milan judge found 11 people guilty for their roles in the collapse of parmalat , including former chief financial officer fausto tonna .
among the other executives convicted were tonna 's replacements alberto ferraris and luciano del soldato , mr tanzi 's brother and son , and members of an internal audit team .
what state is parmalat in today ?
much better .
mr tanzi was seen as one of italy 's brightest and best businessmen after parmalat filed for bankruptcy , the administrators brought in enrico bondi , a turn-around specialist who is well-respected in italy and abroad .
he immediately set about trying to pare down parmalat , which had ballooned to include firms such as a travel agency , and concentrate on its core dairy business .
the company also has been looking at ways of restructuring and hiving off its massive brazilian business and is in the process of winding up its dairy division in ireland .
as a result , earnings have improved to such an extent that the company is relisting on the italian stock market , swapping 12bn euros of debts for equity .
mr bondi has also decided to go after some of the world 's biggest banks , alleging they colluded to hide parmalat 's problems and seeking billions of euros in damages .
among the banks accused are us giants citigroup and jp morgan , switzerland 's ubs , germany 's deutsche bank and italy 's unicredito .
all of the lenders have denied any wrongdoing .
what is the fallout from parmalat ?
italy 's reputation took a battering , with critics accusing the financial markets of being opaque and of functioning like an " old boys ' club " , where deals took place behind closed doors and problems were overlooked .
the government of prime minister silvio berlusconi promised reforms and an overhaul of the regulatory framework , to ensure that nothing like parmalat would ever happen again .
investor confidence is returning , but it has been repeatedly dented by an underperforming economy and the recent scandal involving bank of italy governor antonio fazio .
analysts have warned that the collapse of parmalat is likely to cast a shadow over italy 's financial markets for more time to come .

in june , a milan judge found 11 people guilty for their roles in the collapse of parmalat , including former chief financial officer fausto tonna .
among the other executives convicted were tonna 's replacements alberto ferraris and luciano del soldato , mr tanzi 's brother and son , and members of an internal audit team .
what state is parmalat in today ?
much better .
after parmalat filed for bankruptcy , the administrators brought in enrico bondi , a turn-around specialist who is well-respected in italy and abroad .
he immediately set about trying to pare down parmalat , which had ballooned to include firms such as a travel agency , and concentrate on its core dairy business .
the company also has been looking at ways of restructuring and hiving off its massive brazilian business and is in the process of winding up its dairy division in ireland .
as a result , earnings have improved to such an extent that the company is relisting on the italian stock market , swapping 12bn euros of debts for equity .
mr bondi has also decided to go after some of the world 's biggest banks , alleging they colluded to hide parmalat 's problems and seeking billions of euros in damages .
among the banks accused are us giants citigroup and jp morgan , switzerland 's ubs , germany 's deutsche bank and italy 's unicredito .
all of the lenders have denied any wrongdoing .
what is the fallout from parmalat ?
italy 's reputation took a battering , with critics accusing the financial markets of being opaque and of functioning like an " old boys ' club " , where deals took place behind closed doors and problems were overlooked .
the government of prime minister silvio berlusconi promised reforms and an overhaul of the regulatory framework , to ensure that nothing like parmalat would ever happen again .
investor confidence is returning , but it has been repeatedly dented by an underperforming economy and the recent scandal involving bank of italy governor antonio fazio .
analysts have warned that the collapse of parmalat is likely to cast a shadow over italy 's financial markets for more time to come .

the centre at monkton priory primary school , pembroke , will also offer adult education courses to members of the gypsy and travelling community .
head william rees said it would equip people with skills for the job market .
the £ 750,000 building will be officially opened on thursday by wales ' education minister jane davidson .
about 20 % of the 244 pupils at monkton priory are members of the gypsy or travelling communities .
mr rees , who received the mbe in 1999 for services to education , said the school provided a vital service for gypsy children . "
we want to give people the skills to access the job market " head teacher william rees he told the bbc news website : " we have children arriving who have never been to school in their lives , aged seven to eight years old .
" and we have children over 11 who have never been to school . "
the community centre - which has been open to pupils since may - will also offer a variety of learning programmes for adults , including courses in reading , computing and gcse maths .
mr rees explained that much of the traditional work done by gypsies does not exist any more , which made learning new skills even more important , while high unemployment in the area has made the problem worse .
" we want to give people the skills to access the job market , " he added .
the head teacher also believes that the mix of pupils at his school has its own benefits .
" if we are going to be a successful multi-cultural society we need diversity , " he said .
" it saddens me greatly to see anyone make political capital out of diversity .
it 's the politics of the gutter - it disgusts me . "
the school began taking gypsy children nine years ago in an initiative set up by pembrokeshire county council called the priory project .
many have then gone onto secondary schools and further education .
the teacher in charge of the service , bev stephens , also organises education for children belonging to circus and fairground families when they pass through west wales .
the centre is funded by pembrokeshire county council , the welsh assembly government , education body elwa and the european union .
it will house classrooms for the mainstream school , a computer suite , staff room and a community meeting hall .

the payment , for past use of the base , will be postponed for at least a year .
the karshi-khanabad base has been an integral part of us military operations in the region for nearly four years .
but in july , tashkent asked the us to leave the base , after it criticised the violent suppression of demonstrations in the town of andijan in may .
" paying our bills is important .
but more important is america 's standing up for itself , avoiding the mis-impression that we overlook massacres and avoiding cash transfers to the treasury of a dictator , " said republican senator john mccain , who sponsored the amendment that will block payment .
us loses key central asian base mr mccain said the actions of uzbek president islam karimov were so alarming that the senate should be considering sanctions against him , " not how to transfer millions of taxpayers ' dollars to his government . "
the airbase at karshi-khanabad -lrb- k-2 -rrb- , in south-eastern uzbekistan , has been an important hub for us operations in neighbouring afghanistan following the 11 september 2001 attacks .
its location in a secure area , a short journey from the afghan border , made it an ideal logistical centre .
but in july the uzbek government gave american troops six months to leave the base - a move which analysts say is linked to american criticism over the bloody suppression of unrest in andijan .
there are still disputed versions of exactly what happened in the incident , when troops fired on a crowd of people .

spy media is aimed at creating a level playing field for mainstream and citizen media producers alike .
the trend to support " citizen journalism " , where anyone can report events as they see them , is growing .
world events , such as the asian tsunami and london terror attacks showed the value of such reporting , through images taken on mobiles and weblog posts .
the site will also provide a commercial exchange market for blog entries , as well as news articles .
tom quinn , co-founder of spy media , told the bbc news website that the site was very much aimed at protecting web users ' rights against companies that syndicate content . "
i clearly recognised there was need to open community that services the world so that you can freely exchange photos and news and so on " tom quinn , spy media what is rss ?
he warned that there could be some troubled legal waters ahead for companies that are creating services using such technologies .
syndication technologies , such as rss -lrb- really simple syndication -rrb- , are becoming increasingly popular ways to keep up with the latest on the web .
they let sites share content , such as news stories , with other sites so that the content is spread around the web .
people can use them to " subscribe " to a website so that the latest content , such as a news story , is sent automatically to them .
" spy media will educate people .
they are going to demand that their material not be sent through rss where people utilise them without permission , " said mr quinn .
google came under fire recently for using such technologies to pull in content for their news search service , from other sources .
in march , news agency agence france-presse -lrb- afp -rrb- filed a lawsuit seeking copyright infringement damages after google put afp headlines , photos , and story summaries on its news search page .
google has now agreed to take down the links to the afp 's content .
in august , adult entertainment company , perfect 10 , filed a copyright infringement action against the search giant for using thumbnails of perfect 10 images on its search site .
" i believe that copyright revolt is going to come to the photo world , " said mr quinn .
" people are going to demand it .
they are very fed up with companies misusing information and material . "
big shift the founders of spy media said there had been a tremendous shift in the business of news .
" spy media was started because of a paradigm shift in the market , " said mr quinn , former president of novell .
" i clearly recognised there was a need for an open community that services the world so that you can freely exchange photos and news and so on . "
an estimated 38.4 million -lrb- 24.4 % -rrb- of households in western europe own a digital camera , according to idc research .
it is also predicted that by 2007 , sales of camera phones will reach 147 million .
the founders of spy media said that this meant there was " enormous potential " for people to make a lot of money as they tapped into the news photo market .
local news , in particular , was an area where citizen journalists could have the biggest impact , he said .
" no one is covering local stories anymore , only the international events , " said mr quinn .
tracking events the service lets people search for images that are relevant to localities .
" it will be like an ebay .
you will be able to type in a zip code / city code and have it so it will search areas and give you up-to-date information about an area or anywhere in the word . "
users of the site can keep track of new photos added that are relevant to that particular area .
the site has a database of seven million cities .
spy media lets people upload their images for $ 1 .
users can recoup that when they sell an image if they wish .
all images are checked for validity and have to be uploaded with a full description and contextual information .
anyone can register and upload their images , and buy them using the paypal online payment system .
users can browse and choose images from every member , or just those that are from " professional " photographers , journalists , citizen reporters , or anyone else , such as people who just blog for fun .

bbc news -pipe- health -pipe- clinic waits ' fuel sex bug rise ' bbc news / health graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- health contents : medical notes thursday , 6 october 2005 , 09:01 gmt 10:01 uk clinic waits ' fuel sex bug rise ' delays in treating people with sexually transmitted infections are fuelling the spread of such diseases , a charity warns .
the terrence higgins trust report says under half of people are seen within two days at clinics in england .
the government has said that by 2008 , everyone who needs an appointment should be seen within 48 hours .
but the tht says many areas are a long way from achieving this target . "
one of the main aims of our sexual health strategy is to relieve the burden on traditional services by providing screening and testing in a range of different settings such as pharmacies and gp surgeries " department of health spokeswoman the government has promised £ 300m to improve sexual health services in england from next year .
however , tht said there would be no stringent checks in place to ensure this money is put into sexual health services .
rates of stis have almost trebled in the last decade and the overall workload for genitourinary-medicine -lrb- gum -rrb- clinics has increased by more than 70 % since 1997 .
in addition , gum clinics are reporting increases in the number and proportion of complicated sti cases .
the tht said around a third of people with stis continue to have sex while they wait for a gum appointment .
sex infections ' spiralling ' the charity cited data from a health protection agency audit , carried out in may this year , which said only 45 % of patients were seen within 48 hours , and 25 % of patients had to wait more than two weeks for an appointment .
the audit showed there had been little change over the last year .
nick partridge , chief executive of terrence higgins trust said " with current waiting times for clinic appointments it 's no wonder sti rates are continuing to rise .
" a quarter of people in england have to wait more than two weeks to be seen .
it is simply not good enough . "
he added : " from 2006 the £ 300 million allocation will begin to be available to the nhs but it 's essential it reaches local frontline sexual health services .
" we now have the worst levels of sexual health since wwii .
we must use this opportunity to turn things around .
" miss it and spiralling sexual health trends will only continue . ¿ a department of health spokeswoman said : " tackling the rise in sexually transmitted infections is a government priority .

dean williams , 42 , of invicta house , margate , was convicted of strangling mary malkin by a jury on wednesday .
the cps said that , in the first case of its kind in kent , evidence about an attempted strangulation from an ex-girlfriend had been used in court .
until december 2004 , any previous misconduct was not allowed as evidence .
but the criminal justice act 2003 introduced new legislation allowing previous convictions or previous bad character evidence relating to the case to be used in court .
' credible evidence ' maidstone crown court heard how williams strangled his amputee girlfriend , who was 40 , on 28 january .
he then slept all night beside her body before eventually dialling 999 and reporting he had found her dead .
the judge gave him a life sentence and ordered he serve a minimum of 20 years .
kent 's chief crown prosecutor elizabeth howe said : " what is particularly unusual about this case is that the previous incident involving the previous partner had never resulted in a prosecution let alone a conviction .
" so in fact it had never been tested in a court at all .
" it was almost like two trials so it could have been found not to be credible evidence . "
ms howe stressed the testimony given by williams ' former girlfriend was not the only evidence submitted and the judge had the final say on whether it could be used .
' no stone unturned ' she added : " by securing this conviction and by using new legislation , the cps has shown we will leave no stone unturned when drawing together a case and reviewing the evidence before us . "
det ch insp lee russell , in charge of the case , said : " mary died at the hands of a violent and abusive partner .
" even when she broke away from the relationship she went back for reasons only known to herself .
she paid the ultimate price for that .
" kent police would encourage anyone suffering domestic violence to report it .
there are agencies that can help and are ready to help . "
