" as afghanistan attemps to reconstruct everything from clinics to wells , the circus is the only organization that fosters the arts among afghan children all over the country .
the project combines a children 's performance group and daily lessons in juggling , mask-making , acrobatics and other performance arts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mmcc children performing in afghanistan when the circus went on it 's first tour , hundreds of thousands of children all over afghanistan saw the first circus of their life . thanks to international funding the mobile mini circus for children will be able to bring a condensed version of their show to audiences in germany and denmark as part of a " kinder culture caravan . " learning about the germans shir khan , a 24-year-old actor stands in front of a map of germany that adorns the wall of a small room in kabul .
he points to the map : " most of the people in germany are christians ; they have a god , too .
there are muslims in germany as well , but not nearly as many as here . "
a group of children sits cross-legged on the ground , attentively following khan 's words .
" what is the capital of germany , bonn or berlin ? " one of them asks .
" what is the most famous place in germany ? " another child wants to know . the children are also shown pictures of forests and half-timbered houses , along with castles such as neuschwanstein .
also included are photos of frankfurt ; with its imposing skyline , and berlin .
some of the children have heard about the berlin wall , but shir khan is not able to answer all of their questions about why the wall was built , how high it was and how long it stood .
" warning : landmines ! "
the circus ' trip to germany is a big adventure .
" the children will do acrobatics , juggling , ride unicycles , walk on stilts and perform as clowns , " says david mason , one of the founding members of the circus . in addition , the group will present excerpts of programs they 've performed in afghanistan .
for example , " the humming mosquito , " in which a boy in a green bodysuit with red paper wings tied to his back plays a malaria-carrying mosquito that trys to bite other performers as well as curious young onlookers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions of un-exploded landmines still litter the afghan countryside most of the performances in afghanistan deal with the grave dangers young people face in their daily lives , such as landmines and diarrhea .
" warning : landmines ! " is the name of another piece , that will be performed in germany .
" we do n't re-enact scenes of death and horrible injury here , " says berit mühlhausen , the circus ' other founding member .
" instead , we put a monkey on stage , who gets hurt badly . "
in reality , children die every day in afghanistan after stepping on landmines .
several million of these deadly weapons are still slumbering just below the surface of the ground .
it is estimated that it would take more than 20 years to clear or destroy them all .
300,000 young viewers and growing the children 's mini circus has been in existence for two and a half years .
today , it provides artistic training for about 80 children , ranging from storytelling and puppet theater to sports and creative radio journalism .
last year , the children 's circus brought laughter into the lives of some 25,000 children and students attending schools in kabul .
nationwide , the circus performed for an estimated 300,000 young viewers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghani students at an all-girls school these shows help children to deal with the trauma of war and the resulting psychological stress .
" when our oldest performers play in rural areas , there is sometimes a mullah or former taliban sitting in the audience , " david mason relates .
" at first , they sit there unsmiling with crossed arms , but , the longer the program goes on , the more the stern faces relax , and at the end they even join in the laughter and applause . " looking to the future under the taliban music and theater performances were banned .
the circus that european audiences will see is a theatrical image of afghan society with performers representing all of major ethnic groups . after 25 years of civil war afghanistan 's uzbek , tajik , hazara and pashtun peoples have relatively little to smile about . still , if the laughter and smiles at their performances are any indication , perhaps the childrens mini circus is a good first step toward building a brighter , funnier future . martin gerner , qantara.de -lrb- aal -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de learning to learn in germany after years of war and unrest , coming to germany was like a dream for a group of afghan students .

a whopping 68 percent are frightened by rising joblessness , a similar number by a declining economy -lrb- 70 percent -rrb- and soaring prices -lrb- 72 percent -rrb- , the survey by r + v insurance company showed .
and 52 percent said they were more fearful about the future in general - twice as high as in 1990 . chancellor gerhard schröder touched on the issue in his only head-to-head televised debate with angela merkel during the election campaign .
merkel portrayed germany as a country weighed down by the burden of unemployment which rose to five million this year and said people were looking over their shoulders worrying that their job may be the next to go . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conservative challenger angela merkel , left , and german chancellor gerhard schröder are pictured on a screen during a television debate from a studio in berlin adlershof , sunday , sept .

schröder hit back : " you talk about germany as if it is a useless country .
it is dangerous to present it like that , not least for our position in international competition . " " the view of us from abroad is far better , " schröder said , adding that germany 's economy compared favorably with those of italy , spain and france .
the chancellor is campaigning to continue a program of controversial labour market reforms he says the country needs to compete in the 21st century . better off than france ? as a german-born member of the british parliament , gisela stuart is ideally placed to gauge the opinion of her country of birth from abroad .

" no one in germany would deny that great progress has been made on competitiveness and labour costs , but in real terms wages have been slashed and that makes consumers unhappy , " he said .

" no one in germany would deny that great progress has been made on competitiveness and labour costs , but in real terms wages have been slashed and that makes consumers unhappy , " he said .

" as afghanistan attemps to reconstruct everything from clinics to wells , the circus is the only organization that fosters the arts among afghan children all over the country .
the project combines a children 's performance group and daily lessons in juggling , mask-making , acrobatics and other performance arts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mmcc children performing in afghanistan when the circus went on it 's first tour , hundreds of thousands of children all over afghanistan saw the first circus of their life . thanks to international funding the mobile mini circus for children will be able to bring a condensed version of their show to audiences in germany and denmark as part of a " kinder culture caravan . " learning about the germans shir khan , a 24-year-old actor stands in front of a map of germany that adorns the wall of a small room in kabul .
he points to the map : " most of the people in germany are christians ; they have a god , too .
there are muslims in germany as well , but not nearly as many as here . "
a group of children sits cross-legged on the ground , attentively following khan 's words .
" what is the capital of germany , bonn or berlin ? " one of them asks .
" what is the most famous place in germany ? " another child wants to know . the children are also shown pictures of forests and half-timbered houses , along with castles such as neuschwanstein .
also included are photos of frankfurt ; with its imposing skyline , and berlin .

a whopping 68 percent are frightened by rising joblessness , a similar number by a declining economy -lrb- 70 percent -rrb- and soaring prices -lrb- 72 percent -rrb- , the survey by r + v insurance company showed .
and 52 percent said they were more fearful about the future in general - twice as high as in 1990 . chancellor gerhard schröder touched on the issue in his only head-to-head televised debate with angela merkel during the election campaign .
merkel portrayed germany as a country weighed down by the burden of unemployment which rose to five million this year and said people were looking over their shoulders worrying that their job may be the next to go . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conservative challenger angela merkel , left , and german chancellor gerhard schröder are pictured on a screen during a television debate from a studio in berlin adlershof , sunday , sept .
4 , 2005 .
schröder hit back : " you talk about germany as if it is a useless country .
it is dangerous to present it like that , not least for our position in international competition . " " the view of us from abroad is far better , " schröder said , adding that germany 's economy compared favorably with those of italy , spain and france .
the chancellor is campaigning to continue a program of controversial labour market reforms he says the country needs to compete in the 21st century . better off than france ? as a german-born member of the british parliament , gisela stuart is ideally placed to gauge the opinion of her country of birth from abroad .
she told the afp news agency that germany had more grounds for optimism than its neighbor france " there is pessimism within germany and they are stagnating quite badly .
individually they are affluent enough , but no one is prepared to bite the bullet on the economy .
but they are beginning to see what they need to do , " she said .
" i am much more worried about the future of france with its centrally planned economy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuart said germany just has to re-discover the liberal underpinnings of its economy that help the country experience an unprecedented boom after the war . according to some observers , germany 's economy still does compete against say , france or italy , partly because of recent reforms , but that is necessarily translating into greater confidence in the general public . holger fahrenkrug , chief economist at ubs bank in frankfurt , said that while the economy may be improving , workers were being hit in the pocket . " no one in germany would deny that great progress has been made on competitiveness and labour costs , but in real terms wages have been slashed and that makes consumers unhappy , " he said .
" the level of wealth in germany is still very favorable , but it is entering a period where it is struggling to keep up with other economies which used to perform worse .

while some said they are ready for a change , others do n't think it will help . together with his wife , roswitha , georg dietrich runs a bed and breakfast on baltrum , the smallest eastern frisian island .
the election campaign is hardly noticeable there as people remain loyal to their party of choice , dietrich said : " we do n't have election posters here , we do n't need them . " dietrich said he has a critical view of what 's going on in berlin right now . " what 's happening there is does n't amount to much right now , " he said , adding that he 's definitely going to vote .
" we need change in germany , we need a different government .
it ca n't go on like this with the unemployment rates .
non-wage labor costs are killing everyone and there 's nothing left at the end of the day . " but dietrich said he believes that a new government will also struggle . " it really does n't matter who governs us right now , " he said .
" they all do n't have their feet on the ground .
they all do n't know how normal people are doing . " bildunterschrift : people walking in the tidal flats near baltrum renate bär is a retiree who lives in neuruppin in the eastern german state of brandenburg .
she 's also highly skeptical of the political process in berlin . " i 'm interested in politics , but what can one say about the developments there ? " she said , adding that she 's disappointed . " but even if you 'd vote for someone else , nothing would change , i think , " she said .
" there wo n't be new jobs .
sometimes i ask myself what the government is really there for .
but not going to vote does n't make things better either . " but she added that she does n't believe a change in government would help . " maybe it would even get worse , " she said , adding that she also does n't see the new left party as an alternative .
" that 's why i 'll probably vote -lrb- for the social democrats -rrb- again . " bildunterschrift : neuruppin 's skyline further south , peter kalus , a teacher in the bavarian town of utting , said he 'd like to tell chancellor gerhard schröder " to go back to where he came from . " " i wish we 'd get a new government , " he said , adding that he also does not want turkey to join the eu . he expects the economy to improve after a change of government , adding that things in bavaria are already much better than elsewhere in germany . " we live on an island of bliss , " he said .
" we have n't been damaged as much by the social democrats and the greens . " but he said he 'd rather see his state 's premier , edmund stoiber , become chancellor instead of conservative candidate angela merkel . bildunterschrift : utting sits on ammersee lake heide lemmerbrock is the mayor of germany 's smallest town , wiedenborstel , in the northernmost state of schleswig-holstein , which has a population of six people . " i 'm hoping that we 'll save more money , that it will be possible to grow and promote innovation in order to lower unemployment , " she said , adding that she wants to see a new government in berlin .
" i hope people 's minds will change .
i hope we 'll manage to shake things up after a change of government . " bildunterschrift : st. trudpert monestary in münstertal stefan geiger is currently doing community service in münstertal , in germany 's southwestern black forest region .
he also plans to head to the polls . " politicians should agree more and fight less , " he said , adding that he sees non-wage labor costs in germany as the biggest problem . " companies leave the country - there should be more incentives to keep them here , " he said .
but geiger is also not certain that a change in government will do much . " quite frankly , i do n't think that anyone can change anything , " he said . alexandra frick -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de election 2005 click here for dw-world 's complete election coverage .

" as afghanistan attemps to reconstruct everything from clinics to wells , the circus is the only organization that fosters the arts among afghan children all over the country .
the project combines a children 's performance group and daily lessons in juggling , mask-making , acrobatics and other performance arts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mmcc children performing in afghanistan when the circus went on it 's first tour , hundreds of thousands of children all over afghanistan saw the first circus of their life . thanks to international funding the mobile mini circus for children will be able to bring a condensed version of their show to audiences in germany and denmark as part of a " kinder culture caravan .

he points to the map : " most of the people in germany are christians ; they have a god , too .

a group of children sits cross-legged on the ground , attentively following khan 's words .
" what is the capital of germany , bonn or berlin ? " one of them asks .
" what is the most famous place in germany ? " another child wants to know . the children are also shown pictures of forests and half-timbered houses , along with castles such as neuschwanstein .
also included are photos of frankfurt ; with its imposing skyline , and berlin .
some of the children have heard about the berlin wall , but shir khan is not able to answer all of their questions about why the wall was built , how high it was and how long it stood .
" warning : landmines ! "
the circus ' trip to germany is a big adventure .
" the children will do acrobatics , juggling , ride unicycles , walk on stilts and perform as clowns , " says david mason , one of the founding members of the circus . in addition , the group will present excerpts of programs they 've performed in afghanistan .
for example , " the humming mosquito , " in which a boy in a green bodysuit with red paper wings tied to his back plays a malaria-carrying mosquito that trys to bite other performers as well as curious young onlookers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions of un-exploded landmines still litter the afghan countryside most of the performances in afghanistan deal with the grave dangers young people face in their daily lives , such as landmines and diarrhea .

" we do n't re-enact scenes of death and horrible injury here , " says berit mühlhausen , the circus ' other founding member .

several million of these deadly weapons are still slumbering just below the surface of the ground .
it is estimated that it would take more than 20 years to clear or destroy them all .

" as afghanistan attemps to reconstruct everything from clinics to wells , the circus is the only organization that fosters the arts among afghan children all over the country .
the project combines a children 's performance group and daily lessons in juggling , mask-making , acrobatics and other performance arts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mmcc children performing in afghanistan when the circus went on it 's first tour , hundreds of thousands of children all over afghanistan saw the first circus of their life . thanks to international funding the mobile mini circus for children will be able to bring a condensed version of their show to audiences in germany and denmark as part of a " kinder culture caravan . " learning about the germans shir khan , a 24-year-old actor stands in front of a map of germany that adorns the wall of a small room in kabul .
he points to the map : " most of the people in germany are christians ; they have a god , too .
there are muslims in germany as well , but not nearly as many as here . "
a group of children sits cross-legged on the ground , attentively following khan 's words .
" what is the capital of germany , bonn or berlin ? " one of them asks .
" what is the most famous place in germany ? " another child wants to know . the children are also shown pictures of forests and half-timbered houses , along with castles such as neuschwanstein .
also included are photos of frankfurt ; with its imposing skyline , and berlin .
some of the children have heard about the berlin wall , but shir khan is not able to answer all of their questions about why the wall was built , how high it was and how long it stood .
" warning : landmines ! "
the circus ' trip to germany is a big adventure .
" the children will do acrobatics , juggling , ride unicycles , walk on stilts and perform as clowns , " says david mason , one of the founding members of the circus . in addition , the group will present excerpts of programs they 've performed in afghanistan .
for example , " the humming mosquito , " in which a boy in a green bodysuit with red paper wings tied to his back plays a malaria-carrying mosquito that trys to bite other performers as well as curious young onlookers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions of un-exploded landmines still litter the afghan countryside most of the performances in afghanistan deal with the grave dangers young people face in their daily lives , such as landmines and diarrhea .
" warning : landmines ! " is the name of another piece , that will be performed in germany .
" we do n't re-enact scenes of death and horrible injury here , " says berit mühlhausen , the circus ' other founding member .
" instead , we put a monkey on stage , who gets hurt badly . "
in reality , children die every day in afghanistan after stepping on landmines .
several million of these deadly weapons are still slumbering just below the surface of the ground .
it is estimated that it would take more than 20 years to clear or destroy them all .
300,000 young viewers and growing the children 's mini circus has been in existence for two and a half years .
today , it provides artistic training for about 80 children , ranging from storytelling and puppet theater to sports and creative radio journalism .
last year , the children 's circus brought laughter into the lives of some 25,000 children and students attending schools in kabul .
nationwide , the circus performed for an estimated 300,000 young viewers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghani students at an all-girls school these shows help children to deal with the trauma of war and the resulting psychological stress .
" when our oldest performers play in rural areas , there is sometimes a mullah or former taliban sitting in the audience , " david mason relates .
" at first , they sit there unsmiling with crossed arms , but , the longer the program goes on , the more the stern faces relax , and at the end they even join in the laughter and applause . " looking to the future under the taliban music and theater performances were banned .
the circus that european audiences will see is a theatrical image of afghan society with performers representing all of major ethnic groups . after 25 years of civil war afghanistan 's uzbek , tajik , hazara and pashtun peoples have relatively little to smile about . still , if the laughter and smiles at their performances are any indication , perhaps the childrens mini circus is a good first step toward building a brighter , funnier future . martin gerner , qantara.de -lrb- aal -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de learning to learn in germany after years of war and unrest , coming to germany was like a dream for a group of afghan students .

a whopping 68 percent are frightened by rising joblessness , a similar number by a declining economy -lrb- 70 percent -rrb- and soaring prices -lrb- 72 percent -rrb- , the survey by r + v insurance company showed .
and 52 percent said they were more fearful about the future in general - twice as high as in 1990 . chancellor gerhard schröder touched on the issue in his only head-to-head televised debate with angela merkel during the election campaign .
merkel portrayed germany as a country weighed down by the burden of unemployment which rose to five million this year and said people were looking over their shoulders worrying that their job may be the next to go . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conservative challenger angela merkel , left , and german chancellor gerhard schröder are pictured on a screen during a television debate from a studio in berlin adlershof , sunday , sept .
4 , 2005 .
schröder hit back : " you talk about germany as if it is a useless country .
it is dangerous to present it like that , not least for our position in international competition . " " the view of us from abroad is far better , " schröder said , adding that germany 's economy compared favorably with those of italy , spain and france .
the chancellor is campaigning to continue a program of controversial labour market reforms he says the country needs to compete in the 21st century . better off than france ? as a german-born member of the british parliament , gisela stuart is ideally placed to gauge the opinion of her country of birth from abroad .
she told the afp news agency that germany had more grounds for optimism than its neighbor france " there is pessimism within germany and they are stagnating quite badly .
individually they are affluent enough , but no one is prepared to bite the bullet on the economy .
but they are beginning to see what they need to do , " she said .
" i am much more worried about the future of france with its centrally planned economy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuart said germany just has to re-discover the liberal underpinnings of its economy that help the country experience an unprecedented boom after the war . according to some observers , germany 's economy still does compete against say , france or italy , partly because of recent reforms , but that is necessarily translating into greater confidence in the general public . holger fahrenkrug , chief economist at ubs bank in frankfurt , said that while the economy may be improving , workers were being hit in the pocket . " no one in germany would deny that great progress has been made on competitiveness and labour costs , but in real terms wages have been slashed and that makes consumers unhappy , " he said .
" the level of wealth in germany is still very favorable , but it is entering a period where it is struggling to keep up with other economies which used to perform worse . " dw staff / afp -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gaging germany 's voters a mere 10 days before the german election , dw-world called voters in all corners of the country to find out how they feel about the future .

a group of children sits cross-legged on the ground , attentively following khan 's words .
" what is the capital of germany , bonn or berlin ? " one of them asks .
" what is the most famous place in germany ? " another child wants to know . the children are also shown pictures of forests and half-timbered houses , along with castles such as neuschwanstein .
also included are photos of frankfurt ; with its imposing skyline , and berlin .
some of the children have heard about the berlin wall , but shir khan is not able to answer all of their questions about why the wall was built , how high it was and how long it stood .
" warning : landmines ! "
the circus ' trip to germany is a big adventure .
" the children will do acrobatics , juggling , ride unicycles , walk on stilts and perform as clowns , " says david mason , one of the founding members of the circus . in addition , the group will present excerpts of programs they 've performed in afghanistan .
for example , " the humming mosquito , " in which a boy in a green bodysuit with red paper wings tied to his back plays a malaria-carrying mosquito that trys to bite other performers as well as curious young onlookers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions of un-exploded landmines still litter the afghan countryside most of the performances in afghanistan deal with the grave dangers young people face in their daily lives , such as landmines and diarrhea .
" warning : landmines ! " is the name of another piece , that will be performed in germany .
" we do n't re-enact scenes of death and horrible injury here , " says berit mühlhausen , the circus ' other founding member .
" instead , we put a monkey on stage , who gets hurt badly . "
in reality , children die every day in afghanistan after stepping on landmines .
several million of these deadly weapons are still slumbering just below the surface of the ground .
it is estimated that it would take more than 20 years to clear or destroy them all .
300,000 young viewers and growing the children 's mini circus has been in existence for two and a half years .
today , it provides artistic training for about 80 children , ranging from storytelling and puppet theater to sports and creative radio journalism .
last year , the children 's circus brought laughter into the lives of some 25,000 children and students attending schools in kabul .
nationwide , the circus performed for an estimated 300,000 young viewers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghani students at an all-girls school these shows help children to deal with the trauma of war and the resulting psychological stress .
" when our oldest performers play in rural areas , there is sometimes a mullah or former taliban sitting in the audience , " david mason relates .
" at first , they sit there unsmiling with crossed arms , but , the longer the program goes on , the more the stern faces relax , and at the end they even join in the laughter and applause . " looking to the future under the taliban music and theater performances were banned .
the circus that european audiences will see is a theatrical image of afghan society with performers representing all of major ethnic groups . after 25 years of civil war afghanistan 's uzbek , tajik , hazara and pashtun peoples have relatively little to smile about . still , if the laughter and smiles at their performances are any indication , perhaps the childrens mini circus is a good first step toward building a brighter , funnier future . martin gerner , qantara.de -lrb- aal -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de learning to learn in germany after years of war and unrest , coming to germany was like a dream for a group of afghan students .

" as afghanistan attemps to reconstruct everything from clinics to wells , the circus is the only organization that fosters the arts among afghan children all over the country .
the project combines a children 's performance group and daily lessons in juggling , mask-making , acrobatics and other performance arts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mmcc children performing in afghanistan when the circus went on it 's first tour , hundreds of thousands of children all over afghanistan saw the first circus of their life . thanks to international funding the mobile mini circus for children will be able to bring a condensed version of their show to audiences in germany and denmark as part of a " kinder culture caravan . " learning about the germans shir khan , a 24-year-old actor stands in front of a map of germany that adorns the wall of a small room in kabul .
he points to the map : " most of the people in germany are christians ; they have a god , too .
there are muslims in germany as well , but not nearly as many as here . "
a group of children sits cross-legged on the ground , attentively following khan 's words .
" what is the capital of germany , bonn or berlin ? " one of them asks .
" what is the most famous place in germany ? " another child wants to know . the children are also shown pictures of forests and half-timbered houses , along with castles such as neuschwanstein .
also included are photos of frankfurt ; with its imposing skyline , and berlin .
some of the children have heard about the berlin wall , but shir khan is not able to answer all of their questions about why the wall was built , how high it was and how long it stood .
" warning : landmines ! "
the circus ' trip to germany is a big adventure .
" the children will do acrobatics , juggling , ride unicycles , walk on stilts and perform as clowns , " says david mason , one of the founding members of the circus . in addition , the group will present excerpts of programs they 've performed in afghanistan .
for example , " the humming mosquito , " in which a boy in a green bodysuit with red paper wings tied to his back plays a malaria-carrying mosquito that trys to bite other performers as well as curious young onlookers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions of un-exploded landmines still litter the afghan countryside most of the performances in afghanistan deal with the grave dangers young people face in their daily lives , such as landmines and diarrhea .
" warning : landmines ! " is the name of another piece , that will be performed in germany .
" we do n't re-enact scenes of death and horrible injury here , " says berit mühlhausen , the circus ' other founding member .
" instead , we put a monkey on stage , who gets hurt badly . "
in reality , children die every day in afghanistan after stepping on landmines .
several million of these deadly weapons are still slumbering just below the surface of the ground .
it is estimated that it would take more than 20 years to clear or destroy them all .
300,000 young viewers and growing the children 's mini circus has been in existence for two and a half years .
today , it provides artistic training for about 80 children , ranging from storytelling and puppet theater to sports and creative radio journalism .
last year , the children 's circus brought laughter into the lives of some 25,000 children and students attending schools in kabul .
nationwide , the circus performed for an estimated 300,000 young viewers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghani students at an all-girls school these shows help children to deal with the trauma of war and the resulting psychological stress .
" when our oldest performers play in rural areas , there is sometimes a mullah or former taliban sitting in the audience , " david mason relates .
" at first , they sit there unsmiling with crossed arms , but , the longer the program goes on , the more the stern faces relax , and at the end they even join in the laughter and applause . " looking to the future under the taliban music and theater performances were banned .
the circus that european audiences will see is a theatrical image of afghan society with performers representing all of major ethnic groups . after 25 years of civil war afghanistan 's uzbek , tajik , hazara and pashtun peoples have relatively little to smile about . still , if the laughter and smiles at their performances are any indication , perhaps the childrens mini circus is a good first step toward building a brighter , funnier future . martin gerner , qantara.de -lrb- aal -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de learning to learn in germany after years of war and unrest , coming to germany was like a dream for a group of afghan students .

a whopping 68 percent are frightened by rising joblessness , a similar number by a declining economy -lrb- 70 percent -rrb- and soaring prices -lrb- 72 percent -rrb- , the survey by r + v insurance company showed .
and 52 percent said they were more fearful about the future in general - twice as high as in 1990 . chancellor gerhard schröder touched on the issue in his only head-to-head televised debate with angela merkel during the election campaign .
merkel portrayed germany as a country weighed down by the burden of unemployment which rose to five million this year and said people were looking over their shoulders worrying that their job may be the next to go . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conservative challenger angela merkel , left , and german chancellor gerhard schröder are pictured on a screen during a television debate from a studio in berlin adlershof , sunday , sept .

it is dangerous to present it like that , not least for our position in international competition . " " the view of us from abroad is far better , " schröder said , adding that germany 's economy compared favorably with those of italy , spain and france .
the chancellor is campaigning to continue a program of controversial labour market reforms he says the country needs to compete in the 21st century . better off than france ? as a german-born member of the british parliament , gisela stuart is ideally placed to gauge the opinion of her country of birth from abroad .

" no one in germany would deny that great progress has been made on competitiveness and labour costs , but in real terms wages have been slashed and that makes consumers unhappy , " he said .

while some said they are ready for a change , others do n't think it will help . together with his wife , roswitha , georg dietrich runs a bed and breakfast on baltrum , the smallest eastern frisian island .
the election campaign is hardly noticeable there as people remain loyal to their party of choice , dietrich said : " we do n't have election posters here , we do n't need them . " dietrich said he has a critical view of what 's going on in berlin right now . " what 's happening there is does n't amount to much right now , " he said , adding that he 's definitely going to vote .
" we need change in germany , we need a different government .
it ca n't go on like this with the unemployment rates .
non-wage labor costs are killing everyone and there 's nothing left at the end of the day . " but dietrich said he believes that a new government will also struggle . " it really does n't matter who governs us right now , " he said .
" they all do n't have their feet on the ground .
they all do n't know how normal people are doing . " bildunterschrift : people walking in the tidal flats near baltrum renate bär is a retiree who lives in neuruppin in the eastern german state of brandenburg .
she 's also highly skeptical of the political process in berlin . " i 'm interested in politics , but what can one say about the developments there ? " she said , adding that she 's disappointed . " but even if you 'd vote for someone else , nothing would change , i think , " she said .
" there wo n't be new jobs .
sometimes i ask myself what the government is really there for .
but not going to vote does n't make things better either . " but she added that she does n't believe a change in government would help . " maybe it would even get worse , " she said , adding that she also does n't see the new left party as an alternative .
" that 's why i 'll probably vote -lrb- for the social democrats -rrb- again . " bildunterschrift : neuruppin 's skyline further south , peter kalus , a teacher in the bavarian town of utting , said he 'd like to tell chancellor gerhard schröder " to go back to where he came from . " " i wish we 'd get a new government , " he said , adding that he also does not want turkey to join the eu . he expects the economy to improve after a change of government , adding that things in bavaria are already much better than elsewhere in germany . " we live on an island of bliss , " he said .

" as afghanistan attemps to reconstruct everything from clinics to wells , the circus is the only organization that fosters the arts among afghan children all over the country .
the project combines a children 's performance group and daily lessons in juggling , mask-making , acrobatics and other performance arts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mmcc children performing in afghanistan when the circus went on it 's first tour , hundreds of thousands of children all over afghanistan saw the first circus of their life . thanks to international funding the mobile mini circus for children will be able to bring a condensed version of their show to audiences in germany and denmark as part of a " kinder culture caravan . " learning about the germans shir khan , a 24-year-old actor stands in front of a map of germany that adorns the wall of a small room in kabul .
he points to the map : " most of the people in germany are christians ; they have a god , too .
there are muslims in germany as well , but not nearly as many as here . "
a group of children sits cross-legged on the ground , attentively following khan 's words .
" what is the capital of germany , bonn or berlin ? " one of them asks .
" what is the most famous place in germany ? " another child wants to know . the children are also shown pictures of forests and half-timbered houses , along with castles such as neuschwanstein .
also included are photos of frankfurt ; with its imposing skyline , and berlin .
some of the children have heard about the berlin wall , but shir khan is not able to answer all of their questions about why the wall was built , how high it was and how long it stood .
" warning : landmines ! "
the circus ' trip to germany is a big adventure .
" the children will do acrobatics , juggling , ride unicycles , walk on stilts and perform as clowns , " says david mason , one of the founding members of the circus . in addition , the group will present excerpts of programs they 've performed in afghanistan .
for example , " the humming mosquito , " in which a boy in a green bodysuit with red paper wings tied to his back plays a malaria-carrying mosquito that trys to bite other performers as well as curious young onlookers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions of un-exploded landmines still litter the afghan countryside most of the performances in afghanistan deal with the grave dangers young people face in their daily lives , such as landmines and diarrhea .
" warning : landmines ! " is the name of another piece , that will be performed in germany .
" we do n't re-enact scenes of death and horrible injury here , " says berit mühlhausen , the circus ' other founding member .
" instead , we put a monkey on stage , who gets hurt badly . "
in reality , children die every day in afghanistan after stepping on landmines .
several million of these deadly weapons are still slumbering just below the surface of the ground .
it is estimated that it would take more than 20 years to clear or destroy them all .
300,000 young viewers and growing the children 's mini circus has been in existence for two and a half years .
today , it provides artistic training for about 80 children , ranging from storytelling and puppet theater to sports and creative radio journalism .
last year , the children 's circus brought laughter into the lives of some 25,000 children and students attending schools in kabul .
nationwide , the circus performed for an estimated 300,000 young viewers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghani students at an all-girls school these shows help children to deal with the trauma of war and the resulting psychological stress .
" when our oldest performers play in rural areas , there is sometimes a mullah or former taliban sitting in the audience , " david mason relates .
" at first , they sit there unsmiling with crossed arms , but , the longer the program goes on , the more the stern faces relax , and at the end they even join in the laughter and applause . " looking to the future under the taliban music and theater performances were banned .
the circus that european audiences will see is a theatrical image of afghan society with performers representing all of major ethnic groups . after 25 years of civil war afghanistan 's uzbek , tajik , hazara and pashtun peoples have relatively little to smile about . still , if the laughter and smiles at their performances are any indication , perhaps the childrens mini circus is a good first step toward building a brighter , funnier future . martin gerner , qantara.de -lrb- aal -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de learning to learn in germany after years of war and unrest , coming to germany was like a dream for a group of afghan students .

while some said they are ready for a change , others do n't think it will help . together with his wife , roswitha , georg dietrich runs a bed and breakfast on baltrum , the smallest eastern frisian island .
the election campaign is hardly noticeable there as people remain loyal to their party of choice , dietrich said : " we do n't have election posters here , we do n't need them . " dietrich said he has a critical view of what 's going on in berlin right now . " what 's happening there is does n't amount to much right now , " he said , adding that he 's definitely going to vote .
" we need change in germany , we need a different government .
it ca n't go on like this with the unemployment rates .
non-wage labor costs are killing everyone and there 's nothing left at the end of the day . " but dietrich said he believes that a new government will also struggle . " it really does n't matter who governs us right now , " he said .
" they all do n't have their feet on the ground .
they all do n't know how normal people are doing . " bildunterschrift : people walking in the tidal flats near baltrum renate bär is a retiree who lives in neuruppin in the eastern german state of brandenburg .
she 's also highly skeptical of the political process in berlin . " i 'm interested in politics , but what can one say about the developments there ? " she said , adding that she 's disappointed . " but even if you 'd vote for someone else , nothing would change , i think , " she said .
" there wo n't be new jobs .
sometimes i ask myself what the government is really there for .
but not going to vote does n't make things better either . " but she added that she does n't believe a change in government would help . " maybe it would even get worse , " she said , adding that she also does n't see the new left party as an alternative .
" that 's why i 'll probably vote -lrb- for the social democrats -rrb- again . " bildunterschrift : neuruppin 's skyline further south , peter kalus , a teacher in the bavarian town of utting , said he 'd like to tell chancellor gerhard schröder " to go back to where he came from .

" we live on an island of bliss , " he said .
" we have n't been damaged as much by the social democrats and the greens . " but he said he 'd rather see his state 's premier , edmund stoiber , become chancellor instead of conservative candidate angela merkel . bildunterschrift : utting sits on ammersee lake heide lemmerbrock is the mayor of germany 's smallest town , wiedenborstel , in the northernmost state of schleswig-holstein , which has a population of six people .

a whopping 68 percent are frightened by rising joblessness , a similar number by a declining economy -lrb- 70 percent -rrb- and soaring prices -lrb- 72 percent -rrb- , the survey by r + v insurance company showed .
and 52 percent said they were more fearful about the future in general - twice as high as in 1990 . chancellor gerhard schröder touched on the issue in his only head-to-head televised debate with angela merkel during the election campaign .
merkel portrayed germany as a country weighed down by the burden of unemployment which rose to five million this year and said people were looking over their shoulders worrying that their job may be the next to go . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conservative challenger angela merkel , left , and german chancellor gerhard schröder are pictured on a screen during a television debate from a studio in berlin adlershof , sunday , sept .
4 , 2005 .
schröder hit back : " you talk about germany as if it is a useless country .
it is dangerous to present it like that , not least for our position in international competition . " " the view of us from abroad is far better , " schröder said , adding that germany 's economy compared favorably with those of italy , spain and france .
the chancellor is campaigning to continue a program of controversial labour market reforms he says the country needs to compete in the 21st century . better off than france ? as a german-born member of the british parliament , gisela stuart is ideally placed to gauge the opinion of her country of birth from abroad .
she told the afp news agency that germany had more grounds for optimism than its neighbor france " there is pessimism within germany and they are stagnating quite badly .
individually they are affluent enough , but no one is prepared to bite the bullet on the economy .
but they are beginning to see what they need to do , " she said .
" i am much more worried about the future of france with its centrally planned economy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuart said germany just has to re-discover the liberal underpinnings of its economy that help the country experience an unprecedented boom after the war . according to some observers , germany 's economy still does compete against say , france or italy , partly because of recent reforms , but that is necessarily translating into greater confidence in the general public . holger fahrenkrug , chief economist at ubs bank in frankfurt , said that while the economy may be improving , workers were being hit in the pocket . " no one in germany would deny that great progress has been made on competitiveness and labour costs , but in real terms wages have been slashed and that makes consumers unhappy , " he said .
" the level of wealth in germany is still very favorable , but it is entering a period where it is struggling to keep up with other economies which used to perform worse .

" as afghanistan attemps to reconstruct everything from clinics to wells , the circus is the only organization that fosters the arts among afghan children all over the country .
the project combines a children 's performance group and daily lessons in juggling , mask-making , acrobatics and other performance arts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mmcc children performing in afghanistan when the circus went on it 's first tour , hundreds of thousands of children all over afghanistan saw the first circus of their life . thanks to international funding the mobile mini circus for children will be able to bring a condensed version of their show to audiences in germany and denmark as part of a " kinder culture caravan . " learning about the germans shir khan , a 24-year-old actor stands in front of a map of germany that adorns the wall of a small room in kabul .
he points to the map : " most of the people in germany are christians ; they have a god , too .
there are muslims in germany as well , but not nearly as many as here . "
a group of children sits cross-legged on the ground , attentively following khan 's words .
" what is the capital of germany , bonn or berlin ? " one of them asks .
" what is the most famous place in germany ? " another child wants to know . the children are also shown pictures of forests and half-timbered houses , along with castles such as neuschwanstein .
also included are photos of frankfurt ; with its imposing skyline , and berlin .
some of the children have heard about the berlin wall , but shir khan is not able to answer all of their questions about why the wall was built , how high it was and how long it stood .
" warning : landmines ! "
the circus ' trip to germany is a big adventure .
" the children will do acrobatics , juggling , ride unicycles , walk on stilts and perform as clowns , " says david mason , one of the founding members of the circus . in addition , the group will present excerpts of programs they 've performed in afghanistan .
for example , " the humming mosquito , " in which a boy in a green bodysuit with red paper wings tied to his back plays a malaria-carrying mosquito that trys to bite other performers as well as curious young onlookers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions of un-exploded landmines still litter the afghan countryside most of the performances in afghanistan deal with the grave dangers young people face in their daily lives , such as landmines and diarrhea .
" warning : landmines ! " is the name of another piece , that will be performed in germany .
" we do n't re-enact scenes of death and horrible injury here , " says berit mühlhausen , the circus ' other founding member .

a whopping 68 percent are frightened by rising joblessness , a similar number by a declining economy -lrb- 70 percent -rrb- and soaring prices -lrb- 72 percent -rrb- , the survey by r + v insurance company showed .
and 52 percent said they were more fearful about the future in general - twice as high as in 1990 . chancellor gerhard schröder touched on the issue in his only head-to-head televised debate with angela merkel during the election campaign .
merkel portrayed germany as a country weighed down by the burden of unemployment which rose to five million this year and said people were looking over their shoulders worrying that their job may be the next to go . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conservative challenger angela merkel , left , and german chancellor gerhard schröder are pictured on a screen during a television debate from a studio in berlin adlershof , sunday , sept .
4 , 2005 .
schröder hit back : " you talk about germany as if it is a useless country .
it is dangerous to present it like that , not least for our position in international competition . " " the view of us from abroad is far better , " schröder said , adding that germany 's economy compared favorably with those of italy , spain and france .
the chancellor is campaigning to continue a program of controversial labour market reforms he says the country needs to compete in the 21st century . better off than france ? as a german-born member of the british parliament , gisela stuart is ideally placed to gauge the opinion of her country of birth from abroad .
she told the afp news agency that germany had more grounds for optimism than its neighbor france " there is pessimism within germany and they are stagnating quite badly .
individually they are affluent enough , but no one is prepared to bite the bullet on the economy .
but they are beginning to see what they need to do , " she said .
" i am much more worried about the future of france with its centrally planned economy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuart said germany just has to re-discover the liberal underpinnings of its economy that help the country experience an unprecedented boom after the war . according to some observers , germany 's economy still does compete against say , france or italy , partly because of recent reforms , but that is necessarily translating into greater confidence in the general public . holger fahrenkrug , chief economist at ubs bank in frankfurt , said that while the economy may be improving , workers were being hit in the pocket . " no one in germany would deny that great progress has been made on competitiveness and labour costs , but in real terms wages have been slashed and that makes consumers unhappy , " he said .
" the level of wealth in germany is still very favorable , but it is entering a period where it is struggling to keep up with other economies which used to perform worse .

while some said they are ready for a change , others do n't think it will help . together with his wife , roswitha , georg dietrich runs a bed and breakfast on baltrum , the smallest eastern frisian island .
the election campaign is hardly noticeable there as people remain loyal to their party of choice , dietrich said : " we do n't have election posters here , we do n't need them . " dietrich said he has a critical view of what 's going on in berlin right now . " what 's happening there is does n't amount to much right now , " he said , adding that he 's definitely going to vote .
" we need change in germany , we need a different government .
it ca n't go on like this with the unemployment rates .
non-wage labor costs are killing everyone and there 's nothing left at the end of the day . " but dietrich said he believes that a new government will also struggle . " it really does n't matter who governs us right now , " he said .
" they all do n't have their feet on the ground .
they all do n't know how normal people are doing . " bildunterschrift : people walking in the tidal flats near baltrum renate bär is a retiree who lives in neuruppin in the eastern german state of brandenburg .
she 's also highly skeptical of the political process in berlin . " i 'm interested in politics , but what can one say about the developments there ? " she said , adding that she 's disappointed . " but even if you 'd vote for someone else , nothing would change , i think , " she said .
" there wo n't be new jobs .
sometimes i ask myself what the government is really there for .
but not going to vote does n't make things better either . " but she added that she does n't believe a change in government would help . " maybe it would even get worse , " she said , adding that she also does n't see the new left party as an alternative .

" we live on an island of bliss , " he said .
" we have n't been damaged as much by the social democrats and the greens .

" as afghanistan attemps to reconstruct everything from clinics to wells , the circus is the only organization that fosters the arts among afghan children all over the country .
the project combines a children 's performance group and daily lessons in juggling , mask-making , acrobatics and other performance arts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mmcc children performing in afghanistan when the circus went on it 's first tour , hundreds of thousands of children all over afghanistan saw the first circus of their life . thanks to international funding the mobile mini circus for children will be able to bring a condensed version of their show to audiences in germany and denmark as part of a " kinder culture caravan . " learning about the germans shir khan , a 24-year-old actor stands in front of a map of germany that adorns the wall of a small room in kabul .
he points to the map : " most of the people in germany are christians ; they have a god , too .
there are muslims in germany as well , but not nearly as many as here . "
a group of children sits cross-legged on the ground , attentively following khan 's words .
" what is the capital of germany , bonn or berlin ? " one of them asks .
" what is the most famous place in germany ? " another child wants to know . the children are also shown pictures of forests and half-timbered houses , along with castles such as neuschwanstein .
also included are photos of frankfurt ; with its imposing skyline , and berlin .
some of the children have heard about the berlin wall , but shir khan is not able to answer all of their questions about why the wall was built , how high it was and how long it stood .
" warning : landmines ! "
the circus ' trip to germany is a big adventure .
" the children will do acrobatics , juggling , ride unicycles , walk on stilts and perform as clowns , " says david mason , one of the founding members of the circus . in addition , the group will present excerpts of programs they 've performed in afghanistan .
for example , " the humming mosquito , " in which a boy in a green bodysuit with red paper wings tied to his back plays a malaria-carrying mosquito that trys to bite other performers as well as curious young onlookers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions of un-exploded landmines still litter the afghan countryside most of the performances in afghanistan deal with the grave dangers young people face in their daily lives , such as landmines and diarrhea .
" warning : landmines ! " is the name of another piece , that will be performed in germany .
" we do n't re-enact scenes of death and horrible injury here , " says berit mühlhausen , the circus ' other founding member .
" instead , we put a monkey on stage , who gets hurt badly . "
in reality , children die every day in afghanistan after stepping on landmines .
several million of these deadly weapons are still slumbering just below the surface of the ground .
it is estimated that it would take more than 20 years to clear or destroy them all .
300,000 young viewers and growing the children 's mini circus has been in existence for two and a half years .
today , it provides artistic training for about 80 children , ranging from storytelling and puppet theater to sports and creative radio journalism .
last year , the children 's circus brought laughter into the lives of some 25,000 children and students attending schools in kabul .
nationwide , the circus performed for an estimated 300,000 young viewers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghani students at an all-girls school these shows help children to deal with the trauma of war and the resulting psychological stress .
" when our oldest performers play in rural areas , there is sometimes a mullah or former taliban sitting in the audience , " david mason relates .
" at first , they sit there unsmiling with crossed arms , but , the longer the program goes on , the more the stern faces relax , and at the end they even join in the laughter and applause . " looking to the future under the taliban music and theater performances were banned .
the circus that european audiences will see is a theatrical image of afghan society with performers representing all of major ethnic groups . after 25 years of civil war afghanistan 's uzbek , tajik , hazara and pashtun peoples have relatively little to smile about . still , if the laughter and smiles at their performances are any indication , perhaps the childrens mini circus is a good first step toward building a brighter , funnier future . martin gerner , qantara.de -lrb- aal -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de learning to learn in germany after years of war and unrest , coming to germany was like a dream for a group of afghan students .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de election 2005 -pipe- 10.09.2005 germans battle the blues ahead of vote großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he 's the exception in germany as germany prepares to go to the polls , there is a clear contrast between the image of the country from abroad and the pessimism that reigns within as many germans fear their prospects in a globalized world . after seven years of chancellor gerhard schröder 's leadership , citizens of europe 's largest economy are glum about the future . a poll released just ten days before the september 18 election showed germans are more pessimistic about their future now than at any time since national reunification 15 years ago .
a whopping 68 percent are frightened by rising joblessness , a similar number by a declining economy -lrb- 70 percent -rrb- and soaring prices -lrb- 72 percent -rrb- , the survey by r + v insurance company showed .
and 52 percent said they were more fearful about the future in general - twice as high as in 1990 . chancellor gerhard schröder touched on the issue in his only head-to-head televised debate with angela merkel during the election campaign .
merkel portrayed germany as a country weighed down by the burden of unemployment which rose to five million this year and said people were looking over their shoulders worrying that their job may be the next to go . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conservative challenger angela merkel , left , and german chancellor gerhard schröder are pictured on a screen during a television debate from a studio in berlin adlershof , sunday , sept .
4 , 2005 .
schröder hit back : " you talk about germany as if it is a useless country .
it is dangerous to present it like that , not least for our position in international competition . " " the view of us from abroad is far better , " schröder said , adding that germany 's economy compared favorably with those of italy , spain and france .
the chancellor is campaigning to continue a program of controversial labour market reforms he says the country needs to compete in the 21st century . better off than france ? as a german-born member of the british parliament , gisela stuart is ideally placed to gauge the opinion of her country of birth from abroad .
she told the afp news agency that germany had more grounds for optimism than its neighbor france " there is pessimism within germany and they are stagnating quite badly .
individually they are affluent enough , but no one is prepared to bite the bullet on the economy .
but they are beginning to see what they need to do , " she said .
" i am much more worried about the future of france with its centrally planned economy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuart said germany just has to re-discover the liberal underpinnings of its economy that help the country experience an unprecedented boom after the war . according to some observers , germany 's economy still does compete against say , france or italy , partly because of recent reforms , but that is necessarily translating into greater confidence in the general public . holger fahrenkrug , chief economist at ubs bank in frankfurt , said that while the economy may be improving , workers were being hit in the pocket . " no one in germany would deny that great progress has been made on competitiveness and labour costs , but in real terms wages have been slashed and that makes consumers unhappy , " he said .
" the level of wealth in germany is still very favorable , but it is entering a period where it is struggling to keep up with other economies which used to perform worse . " dw staff / afp -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gaging germany 's voters a mere 10 days before the german election , dw-world called voters in all corners of the country to find out how they feel about the future .

while some said they are ready for a change , others do n't think it will help . together with his wife , roswitha , georg dietrich runs a bed and breakfast on baltrum , the smallest eastern frisian island .
the election campaign is hardly noticeable there as people remain loyal to their party of choice , dietrich said : " we do n't have election posters here , we do n't need them . " dietrich said he has a critical view of what 's going on in berlin right now . " what 's happening there is does n't amount to much right now , " he said , adding that he 's definitely going to vote .
" we need change in germany , we need a different government .
it ca n't go on like this with the unemployment rates .
non-wage labor costs are killing everyone and there 's nothing left at the end of the day . " but dietrich said he believes that a new government will also struggle . " it really does n't matter who governs us right now , " he said .
" they all do n't have their feet on the ground .
they all do n't know how normal people are doing . " bildunterschrift : people walking in the tidal flats near baltrum renate bär is a retiree who lives in neuruppin in the eastern german state of brandenburg .
she 's also highly skeptical of the political process in berlin . " i 'm interested in politics , but what can one say about the developments there ? " she said , adding that she 's disappointed . " but even if you 'd vote for someone else , nothing would change , i think , " she said .
" there wo n't be new jobs .
sometimes i ask myself what the government is really there for .
but not going to vote does n't make things better either . " but she added that she does n't believe a change in government would help . " maybe it would even get worse , " she said , adding that she also does n't see the new left party as an alternative .
" that 's why i 'll probably vote -lrb- for the social democrats -rrb- again . " bildunterschrift : neuruppin 's skyline further south , peter kalus , a teacher in the bavarian town of utting , said he 'd like to tell chancellor gerhard schröder " to go back to where he came from . " " i wish we 'd get a new government , " he said , adding that he also does not want turkey to join the eu . he expects the economy to improve after a change of government , adding that things in bavaria are already much better than elsewhere in germany . " we live on an island of bliss , " he said .
" we have n't been damaged as much by the social democrats and the greens . " but he said he 'd rather see his state 's premier , edmund stoiber , become chancellor instead of conservative candidate angela merkel . bildunterschrift : utting sits on ammersee lake heide lemmerbrock is the mayor of germany 's smallest town , wiedenborstel , in the northernmost state of schleswig-holstein , which has a population of six people .

right now he 's busy as president of the 2006 world cup committee .
on september 11 he celebrates his 60th birthday .
how would you describe your character ?
i find it difficult to talk about myself .
it 's better if those around me or those who know me say something. euromaxx : who is your personal hero ?
well , my hero when i was a child was a cowboy .
his name was fuzzi .
i do n't know if you ever saw these black-and-white films from 40 or 50 years ago .
later , of course , my role models were mostly in soccer .
my passion was soccer , and it still is .
there was pele , uwe seeler , and not to forget fritz walter back then .
those were my soccer role models .
what temptation are you unable to resist ?
i was born under the sign of virgo , as you know .
they are actually sensitive and reserved .
i tend to say : i have to have that !
this is most people 's driving force , anyway : to have something .
and as soon as they have it , it 's becomes worthless .

his name was fuzzi .

mr hain , speaking to the british irish association in cambridge , said the psni had undergone massive change .
he said 65 % of the 175 patten report recommendations on policing the province had been fully implemented .
" my message to everyone - from loyalists to republican - is : work with the psni and allow others to do so , " he said .
with sinn fein still refusing to urge its supporters to recognise the police service of northern ireland because it believes reforms do not go far enough , mr hain said more progress was being made on the remaining patten recommendations .
mr hain said in under four years , the composition of catholics in the regular force had risen from 8 % to 18.41 % and that the proportion of women officers has gone from 13 % to almost 20 % .
he also commended the leadership shown by the chief constable in meeting the many challenges and opportunities the psni faced in policing in northern ireland .
" sir hugh orde and his officers have risen to the opportunities given to them through policing in northern ireland admirably , " he said .
" policing matters to people in northern ireland more than ever before .
" people want to see professionalism , dedication and courage .
they must continue to have confidence in the police service .
" that is why i said earlier this week that paramilitaries will not be able to join the police .
" but equally we must continue to develop community policing , including considering the introduction of community support officers who have been so successful in great britain . "
he added there can not be a normal society without normal policing .

mr hain , speaking to the british irish association in cambridge , said the psni had undergone massive change .
he said 65 % of the 175 patten report recommendations on policing the province had been fully implemented .
" my message to everyone - from loyalists to republican - is : work with the psni and allow others to do so , " he said .
with sinn fein still refusing to urge its supporters to recognise the police service of northern ireland because it believes reforms do not go far enough , mr hain said more progress was being made on the remaining patten recommendations .
mr hain said in under four years , the composition of catholics in the regular force had risen from 8 % to 18.41 % and that the proportion of women officers has gone from 13 % to almost 20 % .
he also commended the leadership shown by the chief constable in meeting the many challenges and opportunities the psni faced in policing in northern ireland .
" sir hugh orde and his officers have risen to the opportunities given to them through policing in northern ireland admirably , " he said .
" policing matters to people in northern ireland more than ever before .
" people want to see professionalism , dedication and courage .
they must continue to have confidence in the police service .
" that is why i said earlier this week that paramilitaries will not be able to join the police .
" but equally we must continue to develop community policing , including considering the introduction of community support officers who have been so successful in great britain . "
he added there can not be a normal society without normal policing .

twenty-seven-year-old raymond kristiansen weaves quickly in and out of the crowds of locals and tourists on the streets of bergen .
he carries with him a small , hand-held camcorder that seems like a natural extension of his arm .
kristiansen is constantly on the prowl for footage .
" often i just walk around and share moments , " he says .
" sharing moments " is what kristiansen does as a video-blogger .
" i like to take walks when i 'm having my breaks at work , and then i vlog my walks and put them online .
i can just ramble on about philosophy , or whatever . "
kristiansen is part of a growing number of people around the world who are incorporating video into their online diaries .
some of these so-called vloggers use high-end video cameras , while others make do with digital still cameras that can shoot 30 seconds of footage .
some try to do humour .
others are more artistic .
reindeer , politics and laughs in his nine months of vlogging , kristiansen has done a bit of everything .
earlier this year , he posted videos he shot during norway 's national day festivities .
he has also interviewed relatives in northern norway about their reindeer herds .
kristiansen has also used the camera as a kind of therapy .
in one grainy vlog he posted back in august , he lamented ; " i have n't made much money myself in the last several months .
so , i guess video-blogging has taken a bit too much of my time . "
we do n't need the mainstream media to tell us what 's interesting anymore .
millions of people want to tell their stories , and with video-blogging , they can tell their stories raymond kristiansen kristiansen does not consider himself to be a leader in the vlogosphere , which is the community of video-bloggers across the globe .
but he is spearheading the use of vlogs in politics , as an active member of the youth wing of norway 's liberal party .
at a recent campaign event ahead of the elections , the leader of the liberal party did a photo-op with a local businessman in bergen .
while the mainstream media gathered around to record sound bites , kristiansen stood in the background , taping the entire event with his small camcorder .
" i 'm from the party , and yet i 'm looking at the party , " kristiansen says of his strange middle role .
" i see myself as a mix of sort-of archivist , someone trying to capture things immediately .
" i am inside , and i am promoting the party , and if i do decide to put some of this online , it will be to show how the media use our party . "
kristiansen says he is looking for perspectives on politics that will energise a new generation of norwegian voters .
" today in norway , many youth are feeling disillusioned with politics , " he kristiansen .
" they feel that politics is all the same .
and if i can interview people , put them online , it lowers the barrier . "
quick and dirty kristiansen admits that some of the older members of the party are not quite sure about vlogging .
some are sceptical that online videos can help spread the party 's message .
others are afraid of pulling back the curtain on the party 's inner workings .
" one of the advisers was asking me , ' why is raymond filming ? " ' says lars-henrik michelsen , president of the liberal youth party .
the vlogging community is growing on the web " i think it 's unusual , and people are n't used to it .
and so , people ask questions at the beginning .
but we are not worried about raymond broadcasting something online that he should not .
i think it will be good for the party , and people get more inside information . "
after the news conference , kristiansen rushes back the party 's offices in bergen .
it only takes him a few minutes to download footage from his camera to the computer .
he then does a bit of editing , and adds a few finishing touches .
" i want it to be quick and dirty , that 's what i like about video-blogging , " he says .
in no time , he has uploaded his one minute video clip to the party 's weblog , and his own personal blog .
he personal site is www.dltq.org.
the d-l-t-q stands for do n't lose the question .
" and what 's the question i do n't want to lose ? " asks kristiansen .
" what is video-blogging ? "
that question is something kristiansen and other vloggers are figuring that out , day by day , frame by frame .
" we do n't need the mainstream media to tell us what 's interesting anymore , " he says .
" millions of people want to tell their stories , and with video-blogging , they can tell their stories . "
kristiansen is a real evangelist for vlogging , especially outside the us .
as he likes to tell people it 's all fun .
he is helping organise the european videoblogging conference in amsterdam , which is scheduled to start 10 september .

twenty-seven-year-old raymond kristiansen weaves quickly in and out of the crowds of locals and tourists on the streets of bergen .
he carries with him a small , hand-held camcorder that seems like a natural extension of his arm .
kristiansen is constantly on the prowl for footage .
" often i just walk around and share moments , " he says .
" sharing moments " is what kristiansen does as a video-blogger .
" i like to take walks when i 'm having my breaks at work , and then i vlog my walks and put them online .
i can just ramble on about philosophy , or whatever . "
kristiansen is part of a growing number of people around the world who are incorporating video into their online diaries .
some of these so-called vloggers use high-end video cameras , while others make do with digital still cameras that can shoot 30 seconds of footage .
some try to do humour .
others are more artistic .
reindeer , politics and laughs in his nine months of vlogging , kristiansen has done a bit of everything .
earlier this year , he posted videos he shot during norway 's national day festivities .
he has also interviewed relatives in northern norway about their reindeer herds .
kristiansen has also used the camera as a kind of therapy .
in one grainy vlog he posted back in august , he lamented ; " i have n't made much money myself in the last several months .
so , i guess video-blogging has taken a bit too much of my time . "
we do n't need the mainstream media to tell us what 's interesting anymore .
millions of people want to tell their stories , and with video-blogging , they can tell their stories raymond kristiansen kristiansen does not consider himself to be a leader in the vlogosphere , which is the community of video-bloggers across the globe .
but he is spearheading the use of vlogs in politics , as an active member of the youth wing of norway 's liberal party .
at a recent campaign event ahead of the elections , the leader of the liberal party did a photo-op with a local businessman in bergen .
while the mainstream media gathered around to record sound bites , kristiansen stood in the background , taping the entire event with his small camcorder .
" i 'm from the party , and yet i 'm looking at the party , " kristiansen says of his strange middle role .
" i see myself as a mix of sort-of archivist , someone trying to capture things immediately .
" i am inside , and i am promoting the party , and if i do decide to put some of this online , it will be to show how the media use our party . "
kristiansen says he is looking for perspectives on politics that will energise a new generation of norwegian voters .
" today in norway , many youth are feeling disillusioned with politics , " he kristiansen .
" they feel that politics is all the same .
and if i can interview people , put them online , it lowers the barrier . "
quick and dirty kristiansen admits that some of the older members of the party are not quite sure about vlogging .
some are sceptical that online videos can help spread the party 's message .
others are afraid of pulling back the curtain on the party 's inner workings .
" one of the advisers was asking me , ' why is raymond filming ? " ' says lars-henrik michelsen , president of the liberal youth party .
the vlogging community is growing on the web " i think it 's unusual , and people are n't used to it .
and so , people ask questions at the beginning .
but we are not worried about raymond broadcasting something online that he should not .
i think it will be good for the party , and people get more inside information . "
after the news conference , kristiansen rushes back the party 's offices in bergen .
it only takes him a few minutes to download footage from his camera to the computer .
he then does a bit of editing , and adds a few finishing touches .
" i want it to be quick and dirty , that 's what i like about video-blogging , " he says .
in no time , he has uploaded his one minute video clip to the party 's weblog , and his own personal blog .
he personal site is www.dltq.org.
the d-l-t-q stands for do n't lose the question .
" and what 's the question i do n't want to lose ? " asks kristiansen .
" what is video-blogging ? "
that question is something kristiansen and other vloggers are figuring that out , day by day , frame by frame .
" we do n't need the mainstream media to tell us what 's interesting anymore , " he says .
" millions of people want to tell their stories , and with video-blogging , they can tell their stories . "
kristiansen is a real evangelist for vlogging , especially outside the us .
as he likes to tell people it 's all fun .
he is helping organise the european videoblogging conference in amsterdam , which is scheduled to start 10 september .
