program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 10.11.2005 economics could trump human rights at china talks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's leader hu jintao bypassed protests in london in the royal coach chinese president hu jintao begins a four-day visit to germany on thursday .
economic matters are set to dominate talks , but some are calling for german leaders to address china 's human rights and environmental record . china is seen , rightly , as an economic giant just awakening from a long sleep , which will have enormous influence on world markets in the 21st century .
this is why developed countries and global companies have been scrambling to court the chinese government , in the hopes of getting a piece of a very lucrative pie as the country opens up and its 1.3 billion citizens flex their growing purchasing muscles . germany 's relationship with the middle kingdom has up to now largely been based on this economic potential .
outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder made it a foreign policy priority to get more german companies into china , and companies like siemens and volkswagen secured lucrative contracts on his watch . but there are voices calling for meetings between president hu and german political leaders address more than just booming imports and possible business partnerships during the visit to berlin and north rhine-westphalia , the country 's industrial heartland .
concerns that , in many people 's estimations , have forced issues like human rights , democracy , and china 's worsening environmental record further down on the agenda . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hu jintao passes a protest banner as he is taken to buckingham palace in britain , where hu is holding talks with prime minister tony blair on trade , security and climate change on wednesday , pro-democracy campaigners , free tibet groups and members of the outlawed falun gong religious movement have been holding noisy protests .
activists have been angered by what they perceive as western indifference to the darker flipside to china 's brilliant economic ascendance . less-than-stellar record in many areas protesters take issue with china 's liberal use of the death penalty .
the government executives about 10,000 people a year , often on charges such as bribery , embezzlement and stealing gasoline .
political dissidents are often tortured , or misdiagnosed by police psychiatrists and locked away in mental asylums . the status of tibet remains controversial .
while china describes its march into the region in 1950 as a " liberation , " the buddhist religious leader , the dalai lama , has long demanded independence .
disappearances and torture of his supporters are commonplace . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of the falun gong spiritual movement at a protest tolerance of minority religious groups , such as the falun gong or protestants , is nearly non-existent .
freedom of expression and conscience are severely restricted . " china must recognize that a free society can not overlook the trampling of human rights , even when economic interests are at stake , " said christian lindner , the general secretary of the free-market liberal fdp party in north rhine-westphalia . while environmental concerns are supposed on be on the agenda during talks between the british and chinese leaders , the country has a poor environmental record .
as its double-digit growth continues , it could be the greatest threat to the health of the planet , activists say . its hunger for energy and drive for coal-fired power stations is vastly increasing the global output of greenhouse gases .
china now overtakes the us as the world 's leading consumer of grain , meat , coal and steel . good relations germany 's relations with china have been excellent under gerhard schröder and it is unlikely that chancellor-designate angela merkel will want to drastically change the tenor .
bilateral trade has skyrocketed and direct investment in china is high . during the state visit this week , economic and cultural accords worth 1.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.6 billion -rrb- are set to be signed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder , left , is greeted by hu jintao monday in 2002 in beijing one week before the planned visit , china 's foreign minister , li zhaoxing , is that germany 's policies toward china under a merkel chancellorship remain as they were under schröder 's .
that includes schröder 's insistence that the eu lift its arms embargo against china , which was put into place after the bloody crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators in 1989 . china regards the weapons ban as a " relict " of the cold war and according to li , " should have been thrown on the trash heap of history long ago . " schröder appeared to agree , although his position runs counter to those of the us and japan , and many of his eu counterparts .
critics of his position said he was more concerned with german firms cutting deals in china than perhaps igniting a new arms race in asia . then opposition leader angela merkel came out against lifting the arms embargo , although her remarks that she places great importance on the relationship between china and germany have some in both berlin and beijing wondering if her position could change . however , friedbert pflüger , a christian democrat member of the german parliament and a central figure in mapping out the new government 's foreign policy , told the financial times deutschland newspaper on monday that a lifting of the eu arms embargo will not be placed on the " list of administrative work " of the new german coalition cabinet . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu and china resolve textile dispute the eu-chinese summit in beijing , boosted by the settlement of the dispute over import quotas for chinese textiles , kicked off to an optimistic start on monday .

a sharp rise in bilateral trade and direct german investments in china turned the german-chinese relations under chancellor schröder into a success story .
but that could change under angela merkel .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 10.11.2005 economics could trump human rights at china talks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's leader hu jintao bypassed protests in london in the royal coach chinese president hu jintao begins a four-day visit to germany on thursday .
economic matters are set to dominate talks , but some are calling for german leaders to address china 's human rights and environmental record . china is seen , rightly , as an economic giant just awakening from a long sleep , which will have enormous influence on world markets in the 21st century .
this is why developed countries and global companies have been scrambling to court the chinese government , in the hopes of getting a piece of a very lucrative pie as the country opens up and its 1.3 billion citizens flex their growing purchasing muscles . germany 's relationship with the middle kingdom has up to now largely been based on this economic potential .
outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder made it a foreign policy priority to get more german companies into china , and companies like siemens and volkswagen secured lucrative contracts on his watch . but there are voices calling for meetings between president hu and german political leaders address more than just booming imports and possible business partnerships during the visit to berlin and north rhine-westphalia , the country 's industrial heartland .
concerns that , in many people 's estimations , have forced issues like human rights , democracy , and china 's worsening environmental record further down on the agenda . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hu jintao passes a protest banner as he is taken to buckingham palace in britain , where hu is holding talks with prime minister tony blair on trade , security and climate change on wednesday , pro-democracy campaigners , free tibet groups and members of the outlawed falun gong religious movement have been holding noisy protests .
activists have been angered by what they perceive as western indifference to the darker flipside to china 's brilliant economic ascendance . less-than-stellar record in many areas protesters take issue with china 's liberal use of the death penalty .
the government executives about 10,000 people a year , often on charges such as bribery , embezzlement and stealing gasoline .
political dissidents are often tortured , or misdiagnosed by police psychiatrists and locked away in mental asylums . the status of tibet remains controversial .
while china describes its march into the region in 1950 as a " liberation , " the buddhist religious leader , the dalai lama , has long demanded independence .
disappearances and torture of his supporters are commonplace . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of the falun gong spiritual movement at a protest tolerance of minority religious groups , such as the falun gong or protestants , is nearly non-existent .
freedom of expression and conscience are severely restricted . " china must recognize that a free society can not overlook the trampling of human rights , even when economic interests are at stake , " said christian lindner , the general secretary of the free-market liberal fdp party in north rhine-westphalia . while environmental concerns are supposed on be on the agenda during talks between the british and chinese leaders , the country has a poor environmental record .
as its double-digit growth continues , it could be the greatest threat to the health of the planet , activists say . its hunger for energy and drive for coal-fired power stations is vastly increasing the global output of greenhouse gases .
china now overtakes the us as the world 's leading consumer of grain , meat , coal and steel . good relations germany 's relations with china have been excellent under gerhard schröder and it is unlikely that chancellor-designate angela merkel will want to drastically change the tenor .
bilateral trade has skyrocketed and direct investment in china is high . during the state visit this week , economic and cultural accords worth 1.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.6 billion -rrb- are set to be signed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder , left , is greeted by hu jintao monday in 2002 in beijing one week before the planned visit , china 's foreign minister , li zhaoxing , is that germany 's policies toward china under a merkel chancellorship remain as they were under schröder 's .
that includes schröder 's insistence that the eu lift its arms embargo against china , which was put into place after the bloody crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators in 1989 . china regards the weapons ban as a " relict " of the cold war and according to li , " should have been thrown on the trash heap of history long ago . " schröder appeared to agree , although his position runs counter to those of the us and japan , and many of his eu counterparts .
critics of his position said he was more concerned with german firms cutting deals in china than perhaps igniting a new arms race in asia . then opposition leader angela merkel came out against lifting the arms embargo , although her remarks that she places great importance on the relationship between china and germany have some in both berlin and beijing wondering if her position could change . however , friedbert pflüger , a christian democrat member of the german parliament and a central figure in mapping out the new government 's foreign policy , told the financial times deutschland newspaper on monday that a lifting of the eu arms embargo will not be placed on the " list of administrative work " of the new german coalition cabinet . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu and china resolve textile dispute the eu-chinese summit in beijing , boosted by the settlement of the dispute over import quotas for chinese textiles , kicked off to an optimistic start on monday .

" the world recognizes that this is a major public health challenge , " said who director general lee jong-wook at the end of the three-day conference .
" once a pandemic virus appears , it will be too late . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : director of the world health organization , lee jong-wook , left up to a billion dollars will be needed over the next three years to help poor countries shore up their defences , including 35 million needed immediately for action over the next six months .
financial support is an important element of the action plan , said who influenza expert klaus stöhr , as many of the countries likely to be most affected by bird flu are too poor to implement the required procedures to fight the virus . " it comes down to developed countries deciding how far they want to go in preparing themselves for the next pandemic , and how much money they can give to asia , africa and south america , " stöhr said . to help developing countries , the world bank will hold a minister-level donors ' conference in beijing in january . preparing for a pandemic for preparation in the event of a pandemic , the focus is on strengthening health monitoring systems , stockpiling of antiviral drugs to dampen the spread of an outbreak and exercises to train medical personnel and the public . experts acknowledged , though , that the billion-dollar figure was little more than a stab at quantifying costs . it does not include the cost of stockpiling antivirals or compensating farmers for culled flocks , both liable to surge if the scare amplifies . " these figures would go through the roof in the case of a pandemic , " said world bank spokesman phillip hay . swift decision-making the speedy , ambitious action plan marks a break in the history of how mankind has tackled new diseases . in the case of aids and sars , novel pathogens gained a vital foothold through delays in spotting them , bureaucratic delays or cover-ups and lack of funding . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bird flu virus strain h5n1 could mutate and become a threat to humans " if sufficient political will is there to shore up necessary resources , then we believe the likelihood of a human influenza pandemic can be very substantially reduced if not avoided , " said samuel jutzi , director of the food and agricultural organization 's animal production and health division . " there 's consensus , clarity , and there 's much better communication , " said david nabarro , the un 's coordinator on flu .
" i think we 'll be much quicker to control avian influenza as a result and if a pandemic starts there 's a pretty good chance it will be smaller as a result of the work we 've done in the last three days than it would have been otherwise . " sixty-four people have died since h5n1 erupted among asian poultry flocks in 2003 , according to a who toll and national figures .
around 150 million fowl have been slaughtered , and the economic bill is put at more than 10 billion dollars . at present , h5n1 's lethal stretch to humans is limited .
it is picked up by people who are in close proximity to infected birds , and in its present form , it is not very transmissible from human to human .

" the world recognizes that this is a major public health challenge , " said who director general lee jong-wook at the end of the three-day conference .
" once a pandemic virus appears , it will be too late . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : director of the world health organization , lee jong-wook , left up to a billion dollars will be needed over the next three years to help poor countries shore up their defences , including 35 million needed immediately for action over the next six months .
financial support is an important element of the action plan , said who influenza expert klaus stöhr , as many of the countries likely to be most affected by bird flu are too poor to implement the required procedures to fight the virus . " it comes down to developed countries deciding how far they want to go in preparing themselves for the next pandemic , and how much money they can give to asia , africa and south america , " stöhr said . to help developing countries , the world bank will hold a minister-level donors ' conference in beijing in january . preparing for a pandemic for preparation in the event of a pandemic , the focus is on strengthening health monitoring systems , stockpiling of antiviral drugs to dampen the spread of an outbreak and exercises to train medical personnel and the public . experts acknowledged , though , that the billion-dollar figure was little more than a stab at quantifying costs . it does not include the cost of stockpiling antivirals or compensating farmers for culled flocks , both liable to surge if the scare amplifies . " these figures would go through the roof in the case of a pandemic , " said world bank spokesman phillip hay . swift decision-making the speedy , ambitious action plan marks a break in the history of how mankind has tackled new diseases . in the case of aids and sars , novel pathogens gained a vital foothold through delays in spotting them , bureaucratic delays or cover-ups and lack of funding . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bird flu virus strain h5n1 could mutate and become a threat to humans " if sufficient political will is there to shore up necessary resources , then we believe the likelihood of a human influenza pandemic can be very substantially reduced if not avoided , " said samuel jutzi , director of the food and agricultural organization 's animal production and health division . " there 's consensus , clarity , and there 's much better communication , " said david nabarro , the un 's coordinator on flu .
" i think we 'll be much quicker to control avian influenza as a result and if a pandemic starts there 's a pretty good chance it will be smaller as a result of the work we 've done in the last three days than it would have been otherwise . " sixty-four people have died since h5n1 erupted among asian poultry flocks in 2003 , according to a who toll and national figures .
around 150 million fowl have been slaughtered , and the economic bill is put at more than 10 billion dollars . at present , h5n1 's lethal stretch to humans is limited .

based on the river data , this would mean that each one of them would have to sniff the highly unlikely number of 16 lines , or portions , of the drug each day . researchers say that the new method is so precise that they can detect even the smallest traces of cocaine in the water . " we can detect even a single dosis of cocaine of 50 to 100 milligrams , " the imbp 's fritz sörgel told der spiegel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london 's thames is also full of cocaine metabolites similar studies in britain and italy also produced equally startling results : london 's thames river contains the equivalent of 80,000 lines of cocaine each day , while the metabolites of 40,000 daily lines float in italy 's po river , which flows through the city of turin . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de addicted to medication that germany is home to high levels of alcoholism and tobacco addiction is a well-established , if unhappy fact .

germany 's largest christian churches and the country 's retailers have called on people to hold their christmas spirit until the end of november to keep the season from losing its significance . while workers throughout germany have been installing christmas decorations in pedestrian zones , shopping malls and stores , the unlikely alliance of churches and retailers called on people not to turn the lights on and keep christmas markets closed for a few more weeks . " everything in its time .
advent is in december , " is the initiative 's motto that is also supported by germany 's league of cities and municipalities and the consumer protection office . margot kässmann , the bishop of the evangelical church in hanover , said that the campaign was not targeting consumerism as such , but was rather trying to give people the chance to enjoy a limited and special time of year to prepare for christmas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is she getting enough time for reflection ?
" the point is to give people an opportunity for tranquillity and contemplation , " said karl jüsten , a representative for the catholic church , according to dpa news service . but he added that there was no need to overreact .
" i 've also bought christmas decorations during summer , " he said . commerce backs churches retailer representatives meanwhile said they saw the initiative as an " attempt at reconciliation between commerce and church . " christmas should remain special , " said hubertus pellengahr , the retailers ' association 's spokesman , adding that 20 percent of annual revenues in the retail sector come from christmas shopping . more su n day shoppi n g bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last-minute christmas shopping support for a late christmas might also get easier if retailers actually manage to push through a demand that stores are allowed to stay open on sundays during december . while stores can currently open on four sundays per year , december has been taboo so far . " municipalities have to be able to allow open sundays in december as well , " pellengahr said last week , adding that retailers were not trying to get more sundays to sell their goods . one german town seems eager to do away completely with closed shops on sundays .
the town council of marktl am inn has asked the authorities in upper bavaria to allow shops around the central square to open on sunday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supermarket , marktl-style they say that this is necessary to deal with the recent increase in tourists , who mainly tend to visit marktl on sunday . the reason ?

" the world recognizes that this is a major public health challenge , " said who director general lee jong-wook at the end of the three-day conference .
" once a pandemic virus appears , it will be too late . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : director of the world health organization , lee jong-wook , left up to a billion dollars will be needed over the next three years to help poor countries shore up their defences , including 35 million needed immediately for action over the next six months .
financial support is an important element of the action plan , said who influenza expert klaus stöhr , as many of the countries likely to be most affected by bird flu are too poor to implement the required procedures to fight the virus . " it comes down to developed countries deciding how far they want to go in preparing themselves for the next pandemic , and how much money they can give to asia , africa and south america , " stöhr said . to help developing countries , the world bank will hold a minister-level donors ' conference in beijing in january . preparing for a pandemic for preparation in the event of a pandemic , the focus is on strengthening health monitoring systems , stockpiling of antiviral drugs to dampen the spread of an outbreak and exercises to train medical personnel and the public . experts acknowledged , though , that the billion-dollar figure was little more than a stab at quantifying costs . it does not include the cost of stockpiling antivirals or compensating farmers for culled flocks , both liable to surge if the scare amplifies . " these figures would go through the roof in the case of a pandemic , " said world bank spokesman phillip hay . swift decision-making the speedy , ambitious action plan marks a break in the history of how mankind has tackled new diseases . in the case of aids and sars , novel pathogens gained a vital foothold through delays in spotting them , bureaucratic delays or cover-ups and lack of funding . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bird flu virus strain h5n1 could mutate and become a threat to humans " if sufficient political will is there to shore up necessary resources , then we believe the likelihood of a human influenza pandemic can be very substantially reduced if not avoided , " said samuel jutzi , director of the food and agricultural organization 's animal production and health division . " there 's consensus , clarity , and there 's much better communication , " said david nabarro , the un 's coordinator on flu .
" i think we 'll be much quicker to control avian influenza as a result and if a pandemic starts there 's a pretty good chance it will be smaller as a result of the work we 've done in the last three days than it would have been otherwise . " sixty-four people have died since h5n1 erupted among asian poultry flocks in 2003 , according to a who toll and national figures .
around 150 million fowl have been slaughtered , and the economic bill is put at more than 10 billion dollars . at present , h5n1 's lethal stretch to humans is limited .
it is picked up by people who are in close proximity to infected birds , and in its present form , it is not very transmissible from human to human .
the big worry is that it could gain genes by mixing with conventional flu strains that would make it both highly contagious and deadly . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de flu pandemic now just a matter of time , conference told a three-day council of war on avian influenza opened in geneva monday to warnings that a flu pandemic was inevitable , could kill millions and inflict serious economic damage if the world failed to defend itself .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 10.11.2005 economics could trump human rights at china talks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's leader hu jintao bypassed protests in london in the royal coach chinese president hu jintao begins a four-day visit to germany on thursday .
economic matters are set to dominate talks , but some are calling for german leaders to address china 's human rights and environmental record . china is seen , rightly , as an economic giant just awakening from a long sleep , which will have enormous influence on world markets in the 21st century .
this is why developed countries and global companies have been scrambling to court the chinese government , in the hopes of getting a piece of a very lucrative pie as the country opens up and its 1.3 billion citizens flex their growing purchasing muscles . germany 's relationship with the middle kingdom has up to now largely been based on this economic potential .
outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder made it a foreign policy priority to get more german companies into china , and companies like siemens and volkswagen secured lucrative contracts on his watch . but there are voices calling for meetings between president hu and german political leaders address more than just booming imports and possible business partnerships during the visit to berlin and north rhine-westphalia , the country 's industrial heartland .
concerns that , in many people 's estimations , have forced issues like human rights , democracy , and china 's worsening environmental record further down on the agenda . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hu jintao passes a protest banner as he is taken to buckingham palace in britain , where hu is holding talks with prime minister tony blair on trade , security and climate change on wednesday , pro-democracy campaigners , free tibet groups and members of the outlawed falun gong religious movement have been holding noisy protests .
activists have been angered by what they perceive as western indifference to the darker flipside to china 's brilliant economic ascendance . less-than-stellar record in many areas protesters take issue with china 's liberal use of the death penalty .
the government executives about 10,000 people a year , often on charges such as bribery , embezzlement and stealing gasoline .
political dissidents are often tortured , or misdiagnosed by police psychiatrists and locked away in mental asylums . the status of tibet remains controversial .
while china describes its march into the region in 1950 as a " liberation , " the buddhist religious leader , the dalai lama , has long demanded independence .
disappearances and torture of his supporters are commonplace . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of the falun gong spiritual movement at a protest tolerance of minority religious groups , such as the falun gong or protestants , is nearly non-existent .
freedom of expression and conscience are severely restricted . " china must recognize that a free society can not overlook the trampling of human rights , even when economic interests are at stake , " said christian lindner , the general secretary of the free-market liberal fdp party in north rhine-westphalia . while environmental concerns are supposed on be on the agenda during talks between the british and chinese leaders , the country has a poor environmental record .
as its double-digit growth continues , it could be the greatest threat to the health of the planet , activists say . its hunger for energy and drive for coal-fired power stations is vastly increasing the global output of greenhouse gases .
china now overtakes the us as the world 's leading consumer of grain , meat , coal and steel . good relations germany 's relations with china have been excellent under gerhard schröder and it is unlikely that chancellor-designate angela merkel will want to drastically change the tenor .
bilateral trade has skyrocketed and direct investment in china is high . during the state visit this week , economic and cultural accords worth 1.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.6 billion -rrb- are set to be signed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder , left , is greeted by hu jintao monday in 2002 in beijing one week before the planned visit , china 's foreign minister , li zhaoxing , is that germany 's policies toward china under a merkel chancellorship remain as they were under schröder 's .
that includes schröder 's insistence that the eu lift its arms embargo against china , which was put into place after the bloody crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators in 1989 . china regards the weapons ban as a " relict " of the cold war and according to li , " should have been thrown on the trash heap of history long ago . " schröder appeared to agree , although his position runs counter to those of the us and japan , and many of his eu counterparts .
critics of his position said he was more concerned with german firms cutting deals in china than perhaps igniting a new arms race in asia . then opposition leader angela merkel came out against lifting the arms embargo , although her remarks that she places great importance on the relationship between china and germany have some in both berlin and beijing wondering if her position could change . however , friedbert pflüger , a christian democrat member of the german parliament and a central figure in mapping out the new government 's foreign policy , told the financial times deutschland newspaper on monday that a lifting of the eu arms embargo will not be placed on the " list of administrative work " of the new german coalition cabinet . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu and china resolve textile dispute the eu-chinese summit in beijing , boosted by the settlement of the dispute over import quotas for chinese textiles , kicked off to an optimistic start on monday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 10.11.2005 economics could trump human rights at china talks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's leader hu jintao bypassed protests in london in the royal coach chinese president hu jintao begins a four-day visit to germany on thursday .
economic matters are set to dominate talks , but some are calling for german leaders to address china 's human rights and environmental record . china is seen , rightly , as an economic giant just awakening from a long sleep , which will have enormous influence on world markets in the 21st century .
this is why developed countries and global companies have been scrambling to court the chinese government , in the hopes of getting a piece of a very lucrative pie as the country opens up and its 1.3 billion citizens flex their growing purchasing muscles . germany 's relationship with the middle kingdom has up to now largely been based on this economic potential .
outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder made it a foreign policy priority to get more german companies into china , and companies like siemens and volkswagen secured lucrative contracts on his watch . but there are voices calling for meetings between president hu and german political leaders address more than just booming imports and possible business partnerships during the visit to berlin and north rhine-westphalia , the country 's industrial heartland .
concerns that , in many people 's estimations , have forced issues like human rights , democracy , and china 's worsening environmental record further down on the agenda . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hu jintao passes a protest banner as he is taken to buckingham palace in britain , where hu is holding talks with prime minister tony blair on trade , security and climate change on wednesday , pro-democracy campaigners , free tibet groups and members of the outlawed falun gong religious movement have been holding noisy protests .
activists have been angered by what they perceive as western indifference to the darker flipside to china 's brilliant economic ascendance . less-than-stellar record in many areas protesters take issue with china 's liberal use of the death penalty .
the government executives about 10,000 people a year , often on charges such as bribery , embezzlement and stealing gasoline .
political dissidents are often tortured , or misdiagnosed by police psychiatrists and locked away in mental asylums . the status of tibet remains controversial .
while china describes its march into the region in 1950 as a " liberation , " the buddhist religious leader , the dalai lama , has long demanded independence .
disappearances and torture of his supporters are commonplace . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of the falun gong spiritual movement at a protest tolerance of minority religious groups , such as the falun gong or protestants , is nearly non-existent .
freedom of expression and conscience are severely restricted . " china must recognize that a free society can not overlook the trampling of human rights , even when economic interests are at stake , " said christian lindner , the general secretary of the free-market liberal fdp party in north rhine-westphalia . while environmental concerns are supposed on be on the agenda during talks between the british and chinese leaders , the country has a poor environmental record .
as its double-digit growth continues , it could be the greatest threat to the health of the planet , activists say . its hunger for energy and drive for coal-fired power stations is vastly increasing the global output of greenhouse gases .
china now overtakes the us as the world 's leading consumer of grain , meat , coal and steel . good relations germany 's relations with china have been excellent under gerhard schröder and it is unlikely that chancellor-designate angela merkel will want to drastically change the tenor .
bilateral trade has skyrocketed and direct investment in china is high . during the state visit this week , economic and cultural accords worth 1.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.6 billion -rrb- are set to be signed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder , left , is greeted by hu jintao monday in 2002 in beijing one week before the planned visit , china 's foreign minister , li zhaoxing , is that germany 's policies toward china under a merkel chancellorship remain as they were under schröder 's .
that includes schröder 's insistence that the eu lift its arms embargo against china , which was put into place after the bloody crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators in 1989 . china regards the weapons ban as a " relict " of the cold war and according to li , " should have been thrown on the trash heap of history long ago . " schröder appeared to agree , although his position runs counter to those of the us and japan , and many of his eu counterparts .
critics of his position said he was more concerned with german firms cutting deals in china than perhaps igniting a new arms race in asia . then opposition leader angela merkel came out against lifting the arms embargo , although her remarks that she places great importance on the relationship between china and germany have some in both berlin and beijing wondering if her position could change . however , friedbert pflüger , a christian democrat member of the german parliament and a central figure in mapping out the new government 's foreign policy , told the financial times deutschland newspaper on monday that a lifting of the eu arms embargo will not be placed on the " list of administrative work " of the new german coalition cabinet . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu and china resolve textile dispute the eu-chinese summit in beijing , boosted by the settlement of the dispute over import quotas for chinese textiles , kicked off to an optimistic start on monday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 10.11.2005 global experts devise action plan to fight bird flu großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tackling the problem at its source experts at a global conference in geneva have acted with unprecedented speed to agree on an aggressive blueprint to tackle bird flu , and strengthen plans to cope with a possible pandemic among humans . around 600 experts representing governments , international organizations and companies contributed to the who 's action plan on bird flu , which gives highest priority to fighting the virus at its source - outbreaks among birds . to that effect , governments are to increase veterinary surveillance to detect outbreaks , implement the preventative vaccination of poultry , cull infected flocks , and compensate farmers for their losses . " the world recognizes that this is a major public health challenge , " said who director general lee jong-wook at the end of the three-day conference .
" once a pandemic virus appears , it will be too late . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : director of the world health organization , lee jong-wook , left up to a billion dollars will be needed over the next three years to help poor countries shore up their defences , including 35 million needed immediately for action over the next six months .
financial support is an important element of the action plan , said who influenza expert klaus stöhr , as many of the countries likely to be most affected by bird flu are too poor to implement the required procedures to fight the virus . " it comes down to developed countries deciding how far they want to go in preparing themselves for the next pandemic , and how much money they can give to asia , africa and south america , " stöhr said . to help developing countries , the world bank will hold a minister-level donors ' conference in beijing in january . preparing for a pandemic for preparation in the event of a pandemic , the focus is on strengthening health monitoring systems , stockpiling of antiviral drugs to dampen the spread of an outbreak and exercises to train medical personnel and the public . experts acknowledged , though , that the billion-dollar figure was little more than a stab at quantifying costs . it does not include the cost of stockpiling antivirals or compensating farmers for culled flocks , both liable to surge if the scare amplifies . " these figures would go through the roof in the case of a pandemic , " said world bank spokesman phillip hay . swift decision-making the speedy , ambitious action plan marks a break in the history of how mankind has tackled new diseases . in the case of aids and sars , novel pathogens gained a vital foothold through delays in spotting them , bureaucratic delays or cover-ups and lack of funding . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bird flu virus strain h5n1 could mutate and become a threat to humans " if sufficient political will is there to shore up necessary resources , then we believe the likelihood of a human influenza pandemic can be very substantially reduced if not avoided , " said samuel jutzi , director of the food and agricultural organization 's animal production and health division . " there 's consensus , clarity , and there 's much better communication , " said david nabarro , the un 's coordinator on flu .
" i think we 'll be much quicker to control avian influenza as a result and if a pandemic starts there 's a pretty good chance it will be smaller as a result of the work we 've done in the last three days than it would have been otherwise . " sixty-four people have died since h5n1 erupted among asian poultry flocks in 2003 , according to a who toll and national figures .
around 150 million fowl have been slaughtered , and the economic bill is put at more than 10 billion dollars . at present , h5n1 's lethal stretch to humans is limited .
it is picked up by people who are in close proximity to infected birds , and in its present form , it is not very transmissible from human to human .
the big worry is that it could gain genes by mixing with conventional flu strains that would make it both highly contagious and deadly . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de flu pandemic now just a matter of time , conference told a three-day council of war on avian influenza opened in geneva monday to warnings that a flu pandemic was inevitable , could kill millions and inflict serious economic damage if the world failed to defend itself .

" the world recognizes that this is a major public health challenge , " said who director general lee jong-wook at the end of the three-day conference .
" once a pandemic virus appears , it will be too late . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : director of the world health organization , lee jong-wook , left up to a billion dollars will be needed over the next three years to help poor countries shore up their defences , including 35 million needed immediately for action over the next six months .
financial support is an important element of the action plan , said who influenza expert klaus stöhr , as many of the countries likely to be most affected by bird flu are too poor to implement the required procedures to fight the virus . " it comes down to developed countries deciding how far they want to go in preparing themselves for the next pandemic , and how much money they can give to asia , africa and south america , " stöhr said . to help developing countries , the world bank will hold a minister-level donors ' conference in beijing in january . preparing for a pandemic for preparation in the event of a pandemic , the focus is on strengthening health monitoring systems , stockpiling of antiviral drugs to dampen the spread of an outbreak and exercises to train medical personnel and the public . experts acknowledged , though , that the billion-dollar figure was little more than a stab at quantifying costs . it does not include the cost of stockpiling antivirals or compensating farmers for culled flocks , both liable to surge if the scare amplifies . " these figures would go through the roof in the case of a pandemic , " said world bank spokesman phillip hay . swift decision-making the speedy , ambitious action plan marks a break in the history of how mankind has tackled new diseases . in the case of aids and sars , novel pathogens gained a vital foothold through delays in spotting them , bureaucratic delays or cover-ups and lack of funding . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bird flu virus strain h5n1 could mutate and become a threat to humans " if sufficient political will is there to shore up necessary resources , then we believe the likelihood of a human influenza pandemic can be very substantially reduced if not avoided , " said samuel jutzi , director of the food and agricultural organization 's animal production and health division . " there 's consensus , clarity , and there 's much better communication , " said david nabarro , the un 's coordinator on flu .
" i think we 'll be much quicker to control avian influenza as a result and if a pandemic starts there 's a pretty good chance it will be smaller as a result of the work we 've done in the last three days than it would have been otherwise . " sixty-four people have died since h5n1 erupted among asian poultry flocks in 2003 , according to a who toll and national figures .
around 150 million fowl have been slaughtered , and the economic bill is put at more than 10 billion dollars . at present , h5n1 's lethal stretch to humans is limited .
it is picked up by people who are in close proximity to infected birds , and in its present form , it is not very transmissible from human to human .
the big worry is that it could gain genes by mixing with conventional flu strains that would make it both highly contagious and deadly . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de flu pandemic now just a matter of time , conference told a three-day council of war on avian influenza opened in geneva monday to warnings that a flu pandemic was inevitable , could kill millions and inflict serious economic damage if the world failed to defend itself .

germany 's largest christian churches and the country 's retailers have called on people to hold their christmas spirit until the end of november to keep the season from losing its significance . while workers throughout germany have been installing christmas decorations in pedestrian zones , shopping malls and stores , the unlikely alliance of churches and retailers called on people not to turn the lights on and keep christmas markets closed for a few more weeks . " everything in its time .
advent is in december , " is the initiative 's motto that is also supported by germany 's league of cities and municipalities and the consumer protection office . margot kässmann , the bishop of the evangelical church in hanover , said that the campaign was not targeting consumerism as such , but was rather trying to give people the chance to enjoy a limited and special time of year to prepare for christmas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is she getting enough time for reflection ?
" the point is to give people an opportunity for tranquillity and contemplation , " said karl jüsten , a representative for the catholic church , according to dpa news service . but he added that there was no need to overreact .
" i 've also bought christmas decorations during summer , " he said . commerce backs churches retailer representatives meanwhile said they saw the initiative as an " attempt at reconciliation between commerce and church .

" municipalities have to be able to allow open sundays in december as well , " pellengahr said last week , adding that retailers were not trying to get more sundays to sell their goods . one german town seems eager to do away completely with closed shops on sundays .

germany 's largest christian churches and the country 's retailers have called on people to hold their christmas spirit until the end of november to keep the season from losing its significance . while workers throughout germany have been installing christmas decorations in pedestrian zones , shopping malls and stores , the unlikely alliance of churches and retailers called on people not to turn the lights on and keep christmas markets closed for a few more weeks . " everything in its time .
advent is in december , " is the initiative 's motto that is also supported by germany 's league of cities and municipalities and the consumer protection office . margot kässmann , the bishop of the evangelical church in hanover , said that the campaign was not targeting consumerism as such , but was rather trying to give people the chance to enjoy a limited and special time of year to prepare for christmas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is she getting enough time for reflection ?
" the point is to give people an opportunity for tranquillity and contemplation , " said karl jüsten , a representative for the catholic church , according to dpa news service . but he added that there was no need to overreact .
" i 've also bought christmas decorations during summer , " he said . commerce backs churches retailer representatives meanwhile said they saw the initiative as an " attempt at reconciliation between commerce and church . " christmas should remain special , " said hubertus pellengahr , the retailers ' association 's spokesman , adding that 20 percent of annual revenues in the retail sector come from christmas shopping . more su n day shoppi n g bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last-minute christmas shopping support for a late christmas might also get easier if retailers actually manage to push through a demand that stores are allowed to stay open on sundays during december . while stores can currently open on four sundays per year , december has been taboo so far . " municipalities have to be able to allow open sundays in december as well , " pellengahr said last week , adding that retailers were not trying to get more sundays to sell their goods . one german town seems eager to do away completely with closed shops on sundays .
the town council of marktl am inn has asked the authorities in upper bavaria to allow shops around the central square to open on sunday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supermarket , marktl-style they say that this is necessary to deal with the recent increase in tourists , who mainly tend to visit marktl on sunday . the reason ?

germany 's largest christian churches and the country 's retailers have called on people to hold their christmas spirit until the end of november to keep the season from losing its significance . while workers throughout germany have been installing christmas decorations in pedestrian zones , shopping malls and stores , the unlikely alliance of churches and retailers called on people not to turn the lights on and keep christmas markets closed for a few more weeks . " everything in its time .
advent is in december , " is the initiative 's motto that is also supported by germany 's league of cities and municipalities and the consumer protection office . margot kässmann , the bishop of the evangelical church in hanover , said that the campaign was not targeting consumerism as such , but was rather trying to give people the chance to enjoy a limited and special time of year to prepare for christmas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is she getting enough time for reflection ?
" the point is to give people an opportunity for tranquillity and contemplation , " said karl jüsten , a representative for the catholic church , according to dpa news service . but he added that there was no need to overreact .
" i 've also bought christmas decorations during summer , " he said . commerce backs churches retailer representatives meanwhile said they saw the initiative as an " attempt at reconciliation between commerce and church . " christmas should remain special , " said hubertus pellengahr , the retailers ' association 's spokesman , adding that 20 percent of annual revenues in the retail sector come from christmas shopping . more su n day shoppi n g bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last-minute christmas shopping support for a late christmas might also get easier if retailers actually manage to push through a demand that stores are allowed to stay open on sundays during december . while stores can currently open on four sundays per year , december has been taboo so far . " municipalities have to be able to allow open sundays in december as well , " pellengahr said last week , adding that retailers were not trying to get more sundays to sell their goods . one german town seems eager to do away completely with closed shops on sundays .
the town council of marktl am inn has asked the authorities in upper bavaria to allow shops around the central square to open on sunday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supermarket , marktl-style they say that this is necessary to deal with the recent increase in tourists , who mainly tend to visit marktl on sunday . the reason ?

" the world recognizes that this is a major public health challenge , " said who director general lee jong-wook at the end of the three-day conference .
" once a pandemic virus appears , it will be too late . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : director of the world health organization , lee jong-wook , left up to a billion dollars will be needed over the next three years to help poor countries shore up their defences , including 35 million needed immediately for action over the next six months .
financial support is an important element of the action plan , said who influenza expert klaus stöhr , as many of the countries likely to be most affected by bird flu are too poor to implement the required procedures to fight the virus . " it comes down to developed countries deciding how far they want to go in preparing themselves for the next pandemic , and how much money they can give to asia , africa and south america , " stöhr said . to help developing countries , the world bank will hold a minister-level donors ' conference in beijing in january . preparing for a pandemic for preparation in the event of a pandemic , the focus is on strengthening health monitoring systems , stockpiling of antiviral drugs to dampen the spread of an outbreak and exercises to train medical personnel and the public . experts acknowledged , though , that the billion-dollar figure was little more than a stab at quantifying costs . it does not include the cost of stockpiling antivirals or compensating farmers for culled flocks , both liable to surge if the scare amplifies . " these figures would go through the roof in the case of a pandemic , " said world bank spokesman phillip hay . swift decision-making the speedy , ambitious action plan marks a break in the history of how mankind has tackled new diseases . in the case of aids and sars , novel pathogens gained a vital foothold through delays in spotting them , bureaucratic delays or cover-ups and lack of funding . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bird flu virus strain h5n1 could mutate and become a threat to humans " if sufficient political will is there to shore up necessary resources , then we believe the likelihood of a human influenza pandemic can be very substantially reduced if not avoided , " said samuel jutzi , director of the food and agricultural organization 's animal production and health division . " there 's consensus , clarity , and there 's much better communication , " said david nabarro , the un 's coordinator on flu .
" i think we 'll be much quicker to control avian influenza as a result and if a pandemic starts there 's a pretty good chance it will be smaller as a result of the work we 've done in the last three days than it would have been otherwise . " sixty-four people have died since h5n1 erupted among asian poultry flocks in 2003 , according to a who toll and national figures .
around 150 million fowl have been slaughtered , and the economic bill is put at more than 10 billion dollars . at present , h5n1 's lethal stretch to humans is limited .
it is picked up by people who are in close proximity to infected birds , and in its present form , it is not very transmissible from human to human .

economic matters are set to dominate talks , but some are calling for german leaders to address china 's human rights and environmental record . china is seen , rightly , as an economic giant just awakening from a long sleep , which will have enormous influence on world markets in the 21st century .
this is why developed countries and global companies have been scrambling to court the chinese government , in the hopes of getting a piece of a very lucrative pie as the country opens up and its 1.3 billion citizens flex their growing purchasing muscles . germany 's relationship with the middle kingdom has up to now largely been based on this economic potential .
outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder made it a foreign policy priority to get more german companies into china , and companies like siemens and volkswagen secured lucrative contracts on his watch . but there are voices calling for meetings between president hu and german political leaders address more than just booming imports and possible business partnerships during the visit to berlin and north rhine-westphalia , the country 's industrial heartland .

that includes schröder 's insistence that the eu lift its arms embargo against china , which was put into place after the bloody crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators in 1989 . china regards the weapons ban as a " relict " of the cold war and according to li , " should have been thrown on the trash heap of history long ago . " schröder appeared to agree , although his position runs counter to those of the us and japan , and many of his eu counterparts .
critics of his position said he was more concerned with german firms cutting deals in china than perhaps igniting a new arms race in asia . then opposition leader angela merkel came out against lifting the arms embargo , although her remarks that she places great importance on the relationship between china and germany have some in both berlin and beijing wondering if her position could change . however , friedbert pflüger , a christian democrat member of the german parliament and a central figure in mapping out the new government 's foreign policy , told the financial times deutschland newspaper on monday that a lifting of the eu arms embargo will not be placed on the " list of administrative work " of the new german coalition cabinet . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu and china resolve textile dispute the eu-chinese summit in beijing , boosted by the settlement of the dispute over import quotas for chinese textiles , kicked off to an optimistic start on monday .

germany 's largest christian churches and the country 's retailers have called on people to hold their christmas spirit until the end of november to keep the season from losing its significance . while workers throughout germany have been installing christmas decorations in pedestrian zones , shopping malls and stores , the unlikely alliance of churches and retailers called on people not to turn the lights on and keep christmas markets closed for a few more weeks . " everything in its time .
advent is in december , " is the initiative 's motto that is also supported by germany 's league of cities and municipalities and the consumer protection office . margot kässmann , the bishop of the evangelical church in hanover , said that the campaign was not targeting consumerism as such , but was rather trying to give people the chance to enjoy a limited and special time of year to prepare for christmas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is she getting enough time for reflection ?
" the point is to give people an opportunity for tranquillity and contemplation , " said karl jüsten , a representative for the catholic church , according to dpa news service . but he added that there was no need to overreact .

" municipalities have to be able to allow open sundays in december as well , " pellengahr said last week , adding that retailers were not trying to get more sundays to sell their goods . one german town seems eager to do away completely with closed shops on sundays .

" the world recognizes that this is a major public health challenge , " said who director general lee jong-wook at the end of the three-day conference .
" once a pandemic virus appears , it will be too late . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : director of the world health organization , lee jong-wook , left up to a billion dollars will be needed over the next three years to help poor countries shore up their defences , including 35 million needed immediately for action over the next six months .
financial support is an important element of the action plan , said who influenza expert klaus stöhr , as many of the countries likely to be most affected by bird flu are too poor to implement the required procedures to fight the virus . " it comes down to developed countries deciding how far they want to go in preparing themselves for the next pandemic , and how much money they can give to asia , africa and south america , " stöhr said . to help developing countries , the world bank will hold a minister-level donors ' conference in beijing in january . preparing for a pandemic for preparation in the event of a pandemic , the focus is on strengthening health monitoring systems , stockpiling of antiviral drugs to dampen the spread of an outbreak and exercises to train medical personnel and the public . experts acknowledged , though , that the billion-dollar figure was little more than a stab at quantifying costs . it does not include the cost of stockpiling antivirals or compensating farmers for culled flocks , both liable to surge if the scare amplifies . " these figures would go through the roof in the case of a pandemic , " said world bank spokesman phillip hay . swift decision-making the speedy , ambitious action plan marks a break in the history of how mankind has tackled new diseases . in the case of aids and sars , novel pathogens gained a vital foothold through delays in spotting them , bureaucratic delays or cover-ups and lack of funding . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bird flu virus strain h5n1 could mutate and become a threat to humans " if sufficient political will is there to shore up necessary resources , then we believe the likelihood of a human influenza pandemic can be very substantially reduced if not avoided , " said samuel jutzi , director of the food and agricultural organization 's animal production and health division . " there 's consensus , clarity , and there 's much better communication , " said david nabarro , the un 's coordinator on flu .
" i think we 'll be much quicker to control avian influenza as a result and if a pandemic starts there 's a pretty good chance it will be smaller as a result of the work we 've done in the last three days than it would have been otherwise . " sixty-four people have died since h5n1 erupted among asian poultry flocks in 2003 , according to a who toll and national figures .
around 150 million fowl have been slaughtered , and the economic bill is put at more than 10 billion dollars . at present , h5n1 's lethal stretch to humans is limited .
it is picked up by people who are in close proximity to infected birds , and in its present form , it is not very transmissible from human to human .

the daily telegraph labels it " blair 's blackest day " while the independent calls it the " moment tony blair lost his authority " .
the express says blair is doomed , but the sun defended mr blair , calling mps who voted against the law " traitors " .
the daily mail asks if it is the " beginning of the end ? " while the independent says " he ai n't seen nothing yet " .
labour rebellion thursday 's papers examine minutely the sequence of events leading up to mr blair 's defeat .
the mirror recounts how mps were dragged from commons bars to support the prime minister in his hour of need .
the guardian says mr blair 's face froze after being told the outcome of the vote by chief whip hilary armstrong .
meanwhile , the times brings into question support among mps for mr blair 's other planned reforms .
public school investigation education fees are a hot topic in thursday 's papers .
the guardian reports on the troubles facing 50 leading public schools found guilty of running an " illegal price fixing cartel " .
the investigation allegedly began when a student hacked into his school 's financial records and told the press .
in its editorial , the daily telegraph says that having stopped colluding , the schools should compete aggressively to benefit customers .

it says this is in case people wake up in the coffin and ca n't call for help .
but that does not explain some last requests , which include going to the grave with bottles of whisky , a coconut and in one case a bag of crisps .

releasing its results for the half-year to 30 september , the japanese firm sold a total of 659,000 vehicles , an increase of 13,000 on a year earlier .
yet revenues at the firm , which is continuing efforts to recover from a defect scandal , dropped 7 % year-on-year due in part to rising marketing costs .
losses were reduced , although last year 's figure included one-off charges .
free checks mitsubishi 's revenues for the half-year were 991.3bn yen -lrb- $ 8.4bn ; £ 4.8bn -rrb- , down from 1.07 trillion yen a year earlier .
net losses totalled 63.8bn yen , compared to 178.8bn yen a year previously , when they were hit by the one-off cost of a free vehicle inspection programme designed to win back customer trust after the defect scandal .
at the time mitsubishi was forced to admit that it had previously covered up a number of faults to avoid bad publicity .
the company 's half-year sales in japan totalled 108,000 vehicles , an increase of 12,000 on the same period last year .
sales in north american were down 11,000 to 81,000 , while those in europe were up 19,000 to 131,000 .
the company now expects to break even during the second half of its financial year , although it says it will remain in the red for the year to 31 march 2006 as a whole .
its results were broadly in line with market expectations .

pre-tax profits before one-off costs rose 3 % to £ 1.13bn in the six months to september 30 , compared to one year ago .
the group said " new wave " revenues , from it , broadband and mobile services had helped drive earnings higher , while traditional business revenues fell 5 % .

openreach operates bt 's local loop , the last mile or so of cables between local exchanges and people 's landline phones , and aims to improve the access of rival telephone companies to the bt network .
the advent of increased competition in the telecom sector has squeezed bt 's profits , with the company having to turn increasingly to other areas of the business to drive earnings .
bt revealed that average yearly revenues from households fell by £ 1 to £ 253 , with broadband revenues helping to offset lower call revenues .
meanwhile , a 15 % increase in revenues from major corporate customers also helped boost profits .

his son , ken wiwa , told the bbc news website of his memories of that day and how he sees the situation now .
in pictures : ken saro-wiwa is it worth dying for a cause ? "
i remember the exact moment he died .
i was sitting in a restaurant chatting and laughing with friends when i felt a brief palpitation in my chest - it felt like a vital connection had been ruptured inside me and i just knew .
i fell silent and looking back i can see myself sitting alone with my thoughts while all around me there is laughter and genial conversation at the table .
it was midnight in auckland and midday in nigeria and my father had just been hanged ; his broken body lay in a shallow sand pit in a hut at the condemned prisoners ' block at port harcourt prison .
i have so many vivid memories of the days and weeks before and after my father was killed .
for a long time i tried to forget .
it was the only way i knew how to mask the trauma .
but then somewhere down the line i realised that to forget was to play into the hands of those who wanted him dead and i eventually came to appreciate that the best way to deal with my grief was to remember the personal details of my father 's death in order to preserve the political integrity of his life .
looking back , the issues my father died for - greater political and ecological accountability in the oil industry - are now at the front and centre of international affairs with climate change and the war on terror dominating world affairs .
in a way , the future of the planet is very much at stake in these issues and i appreciate why so many people are committed to remembering my father .
on this tenth anniversary , around the world , thousands of people are actively preventing that erasure of memory ; from the remember saro-wiwa project in london to the vigils being held from thailand to south africa .
people are refusing to forget the name , ken saro-wiwa .

in pictures : ken saro-wiwa is it worth dying for a cause ?
i remember the exact moment he died .
i was sitting in a restaurant chatting and laughing with friends when i felt a brief palpitation in my chest - it felt like a vital connection had been ruptured inside me and i just knew .
i fell silent and looking back i can see myself sitting alone with my thoughts while all around me there is laughter and genial conversation at the table .
it was midnight in auckland and midday in nigeria and my father had just been hanged ; his broken body lay in a shallow sand pit in a hut at the condemned prisoners ' block at port harcourt prison .
i have so many vivid memories of the days and weeks before and after my father was killed .
for a long time i tried to forget .
it was the only way i knew how to mask the trauma .
three generations of wiwas enlarge image but then somewhere down the line i realised that to forget was to play into the hands of those who wanted him dead and i eventually came to appreciate that the best way to deal with my grief was to remember the personal details of my father 's death in order to preserve the political integrity of his life .
looking back , the issues my father died for - greater political and ecological accountability in the oil industry - are now at the front and centre of international affairs with climate change and the war on terror dominating world affairs .
in a way , the future of the planet is very much at stake in these issues and i appreciate why so many people are committed to remembering my father .
on this tenth anniversary , around the world , thousands of people are actively preventing that erasure of memory ; from the remember saro-wiwa project in london to the vigils being held from thailand to south africa .
people are refusing to forget the name , ken saro-wiwa .
as milan kundera wrote , ' the struggle of humanity against power , is the struggle of memory against forgetting . '

communities minister malcolm chisholm has also announced the creation of a £ 2m fund to support local projects to tackle racism and support integration .
he said : " no-one should be held back in modern scotland because of their race , colour or background . "
the coalition will cover issues such as ethnic minorities ' employment problems .
the body , which will be chaired by mr chisholm , will also look at the issues of verbal or physical abuse . "
where barriers to opportunity exist , i want to see them torn down " malcolm chisholm communities minister the moves were announced following an eight-month race equality review .
an action plan and racial equality strategy will be published next year .
mr chisholm said the steps unveiled on thursday were laying the foundations for " a comprehensive set of measures to tackle disadvantage and discrimination in scotland to make race equality a reality for everyone " .
" the executive has a duty to show leadership to the public , private and voluntary sectors in tackling the damaging impact prejudice and discrimination can have in the workplace , in schools , in our public services and on our streets , " he said .
" we all need to challenge racism .
but it is not just malicious or intended racism which creates barriers .
more support " we also need to look at our organisational , business and employment practices , as well as how we deliver our services . "
ethnic minorities needed more support to enable their voices to be heard more clearly and directly , said the minister .
" where barriers to opportunity exist , i want to see them torn down , " he added .
" our message on tackling the evils of racism is uncompromising : there is no place for racism in scotland and this includes intended or indirect discrimination faced or caused by employers , employees , organisations and individuals . "
the race integration and community support fund will operate from april next year until march 2008 .
it will distribute £ 2m to support cross-community integration and help organisations and communities to tackle racism and promote equality .
the executive is also allocating an additional £ 2.3m to strengthen the work of the minority ethnic voluntary sector and support public agencies to meet their legal responsibilities .
working groups will be set up to look at minority ethnic communities in rural areas and examine the needs of refugees and asylum seekers .
cultural change ali jarvis , interim director of the commission for racial equality in scotland , said it hoped to see continued progress on race equality .
she said : " it is heartening to see the review going beyond this to addressing the tougher issues of cultural change .
" we are delighted that the minister is taking a leadership role on this issue and look forward to working in partnership to shape the ongoing national strategy on race in scotland on the basis of these firm foundations . "
zaffir hakim of the stuc said the review and the action announced by mr chisholm were a " positive step " .

the two men co-created the basic networking protocol , called tcp / ip , that keeps the net running to this day .
politicians , generals , entertainers and astronauts have been awarded the honour in the past .
the medal is generally given to those that have made exceptional contributions to america 's security , to world peace or had a significant impact on the cultural life of the nation through their efforts .
" all who receive the medal of freedom can know that they have a special place in the life of our country , and have earned the respect and affection of the american people , " said president george w bush as he presented the awards .

together the transmission control protocol -lrb- tcp -rrb- and the internet protocol -lrb- ip -rrb- ensure that packets of data reach the right net address and check that once data has arrived none of the information was lost during transmission .
these protocols also help to make any network built with them resistant to disruption as they can generally route around any damage to links between separate networks .
also honoured with the medal in 2005 were muhammad ali , aretha franklin , alan greenspan , historian robert conquest and paul rusesabagina who sheltered people in his hotel during the 1994 rwandan genocide .
president bush drew laughs by assuming a mock boxing posture when awarding ali his medal .
" when you say , ' the greatest of all time ' is in the room , everyone knows who you mean , " said mr bush .
" it 's quite a claim to make .
but as muhammad ali once said , ' it 's not bragging if you can back it up ' . "
past recipients include doris day , pope john paul ii and edward teller .
us president harry truman established the medal in 1945 and it was initially intended to recognise significant civilian contributions to the war effort .
it was revived in 1963 by john f kennedy as a reward for distinguished service to the american nation .

katie leung was picked from 5,000 hopefuls but for a group of young actors , harry potter and the goblet of fire is their first taste of the movie-making business - and a big budget one at that .
the goblet of fire introduces the characters of cedric diggory , cho chang and victor krum , all of whom have a big part to play in harry 's fourth year at hogwarts .
the actors were chosen following a massive casting search with robert pattinson picked to play cedric , katie leung as cho and stansilav ianevski as victor .
for leung and ianevski it was a case of a dream come true as they were selected ahead of other hopefuls despite having no acting experience .
leung queued for four-and-a-half hours at her first audition , spending just two minutes inside as casting directors selected girls purely on whether they had the right look for the part of cho , who harry develops a crush on .
she was persuaded to head from her native scotland to london for the audition by her father .
" at the beginning i went for a bit of fun , i was really relaxed about the whole thing and just thought i was going to gain experience from it , " said the 18-year-old .
" getting the part did n't really affect me in anyway until people started saying ' you beat 5,000 girls ' and that 's when i think ' yes , i did ' . "
comforting words she added : " i did n't realise i could act before i went to the audition .
it surprised me as much as anyone else . "
she admits she found it difficult on set at first but found radcliffe a great help .
robert pattinson had not read harry potter before the casting process began " i felt really uncomfortable but daniel 's such a great actor and he told me to relax and i got used to it .
his advice was do n't let everything go to my head - just be level-headed . "
emma watson who plays hermione also gave her some sound advice about the premiere .
" she said make the most of it , it 's your day .
just enjoy the experience , " said leung .
ianevski , 20 , was also plucked from obscurity to play krum , the bulgarian quidditch hero of the durmstrang institute .
although educated in london , he fitted the krum bill right down to his nationality and his love of keeping fit .
there is acting in ianevski 's blood , his grandmother was a professional actress in black and white films in bulgaria .
family atmosphere " the bulgarian film industry was very strong but the money has gone now since the fall of communism and not so many films are made there , " said ianevski .
he insists the newcomers were made to feel welcome on the set by the potter veterans .
" i met emma -lrb- watson -rrb- first when mike -lrb- newell -rrb- introduced me to her when i went into the studio for the first time .
" i felt as if i had known everyone for years even though i was entering something new .
it was a really good family atmosphere . "
although this was his first screen role he has his sights set high .
" i have always followed keanu reeves , right from the beginning until he reached the top - i would like to do the same . "
but ianevski was disappointed when he read the sixth harry potter book and found his character did not make a return to the action .
for robert pattinson , 19 , winning the role of hogwarts ' champion cedric was not such a new experience , having already appeared in several films including the recent adaptation of vanity fair .
although he was not a harry potter aficionado he was thrilled to be involved in such a large project .
" i had n't read any of the books or seen the films so i ca n't say i was a fan .
i knew of them , it 's impossible not to know about them , " he said .
" when i found out about the audition i read the book in about a day and knew i wanted to do it .
" there 's something very special about it .
i think people will be watching the films for years , there 's nothing else like it .
pattinson started out as a backstage hand at a theatre company and originally had no interest in acting .
stanislav ianevski was cast as the quidditch hero victor krum but he was inspired by its production of guys and dolls and landed the lead part in the next production of our town .
sissy poet he admits that when he first arrived on set he was not exactly as fit as he should have been for the role of the athletic cedric .
" i had n't done anything for about six months before so i was a little bit unfit .
i remember the costume designer saying when i was trying on swimming trunks ' are n't you supposed to be fit , you could be playing a sissy poet or something ' .
" the next day i got a call from the assistant director about a personal training programme . "
pattinson also will not be returning for the fifth movie but plans to continue his acting career on stage and screen .

director mike newell called jk rowling 's goblet of fire " a brick of a book " , adding it would have been impossible to include everything in just one film .
rather than splitting it in two , large chunks have been slashed , leaving the bare bones of the story of harry potter 's fourth year at wizard school and his first face-to-face encounter with his nemesis voldemort .
the entire opening has been cut so , this time , the dursley family do not get a look in .
instead harry starts out at the weasleys - unfortunately without julie walters -lrb- mrs weasley -rrb- .
with some of the story glossed over it leaves more time for some impressive set scenes such as the quidditch world cup .
it is stirring stuff to see the teams whizzing around on broomsticks inside a stadium that reaches into the clouds .
seamless handover the triwizard tournament , in which wizards are set potentially fatal tasks , shows off some quality special effects .
after the high of the contest comes the news that voldemort 's followers the death-eaters are regrouping , sparking scary scenes that justify the film 's 12a rating -lrb- meaning young children can not see it without adult supervision -rrb- .
an unrecognisable ralph fiennes as voldemort also ups the scare factor several notches .
while it is certainly darker than previous films it also displays more of the teenage angst experienced by the wizards in the lead-up to their first formal dance .
radcliffe , rupert grint and emma watson have improved greatly as harry , ron and hermione since their first stilted performances five years ago .
their confidence has grown with age and its now easier to accept them in their roles rather than young actors still trying to find their feet .
the new crop of youngsters playing the likes of cedric diggory , victor krum and fleur delacour have wisely been given restricted lines , so their acting skills are not particularly tested .
slick performances come from alan rickman as professor snape and brendan gleeson as mad-eye moody , while michael gambon has made dumbledore his own , having inherited it from the late richard harris .
although newell is new to the franchise , there is no clear difference between his style and previous potter director alfonso cuaron 's in the prisoner of azkaban , although there was a marked difference between cuaron and chris columbus , who directed movies one and two .
newell has created a polished movie .
it will delight existing potter fans , but , like the later books , it could be too hard for a new audience to follow the complex storylines this far into the series .
