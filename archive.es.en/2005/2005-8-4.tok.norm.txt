according to his manager , the 30-year-old athlete decided to end his professional sports career following " effective treatment of the burn-out syndrome . "
hannawald had already " achieved everything that one can achieve in ski jumping , " and his recovery would take too long to reach competition level fitness in the foreseeable future .
hannawald entered ski jumping history in 2001-02 , when he was the first athlete ever to win all four competitions at the four hills tournament in oberstdorf , high in the allgäu alps of bavaria , germany .
at the winter olympics in salt lake city in 2002 , hannawald was part of the gold-medal-winning team .
he also won the world championships in 2000 and 2002 .
he was considered an icon of the sport .
after a mental breakdown in april 2004 , hannawald entered treatment which lasted over a year .
in conversations with the german ski federation -lrb- dsv -rrb- , he had held open the possibility of a comeback , but the lost time made it increasingly unlikely .
hannawald 's former coach reinhard hess expressed understanding for the athlete 's decision .
" he will go into history as one of the greats in the sport , " he said . dw-world.de germans need a new hannawald as german athletes fail to capture world titles in key winter sports like the four hills tournament , downhill skiing and nordic events this season , many are beginning to yearn for past glory days .

outspoken green party politician hans-christian ströbele , likened interior minister otto schily 's controversial suggestion to allow " preventative custody " in the case of suspected terrorists to the nazis ' arrest of political opponents and other " undesirables " .
" we had a very , very sad experience in the nazi period , " ströbele said on zdf television .
" back then it was called ' preventative custody . '
we do n't want to go that way again . " schily had suggested in an interview with the süddeutsche zeitung that protective custody be allowed as a last resort in protecting citizens against terrorists , referring to the " deadly threat of worldwide islamic terrorism . " günter beckstein , the bavarian interior minister , appearing on the same program , sharply criticized the comparison .
it was irresponsible to compare the crimes of the nazis with a democratic security apparatus , said beckstein . arrests should be limited to illegal aliens who could not be deported due to the imminent death penalty awaiting them in their home country , he added . schily 's controversial proposal was also rejected by the opposition liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- who said it was " clearly unconsitutional . " dw-world.de schily demands tougher anti-terror laws germany is in need of tougher laws to protect against terrorists - including the ability to detain people who could be dangerous - interior minister otto schily said .

outspoken green party politician hans-christian ströbele , likened interior minister otto schily 's controversial suggestion to allow " preventative custody " in the case of suspected terrorists to the nazis ' arrest of political opponents and other " undesirables " .

" günter beckstein , the bavarian interior minister , appearing on the same program , sharply criticized the comparison .
it was irresponsible to compare the crimes of the nazis with a democratic security apparatus , said beckstein . arrests should be limited to illegal aliens who could not be deported due to the imminent death penalty awaiting them in their home country , he added . schily 's controversial proposal was also rejected by the opposition liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- who said it was " clearly unconsitutional .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 04.08.2005 eu calls for emergency un meeting on iran großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things have deteriorated between the eu and iran over recent weeks mahmoud ahmadinejad faces the possibility of being brought before the un 's nuclear watchdog in his first week as iran 's president after the eu called for emergency talks on the islamic republic 's atomic program . european diplomats have asked for an emergency meeting of the un atomic agency next tuesday in order to keep pressure on iran not to resume sensitive nuclear fuel cycle work , diplomats said thursday .
the news comes as iran 's new president mahmoud ahmadinejad faces up to tough decisions as he takes over the running of the islamic republic on thursday with the most pressing issue being the diplomatic stand-off with the european union and the united states which he inherited from his predecessor . the former revolutionary guard began his first day in office on thursday but the work of his government begins after saturday , the day he takes the oath of office and announces his cabinet . this weekend is likely to see the new president thrust into a row which could lead to un sanctions if iran does not back down from its threat to restart nuclear work which the europeans and americans suspect might be aimed at building an atomic bomb . on wednesday , iran announced that it would back off its threat to resume suspended uranium conversion activities , a move that was welcomed by the united states .
tehran had said it planned to resume the controversial fuel-cycle work this week but later signaled it would delay the start until saturday , in effect giving more time for diplomacy . new president but no new foreign policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even with ahmadinejad at the reins , there is no guarantee that iran will become a more diplomatic partner in the future .
the new president 's choices will continue to be determined by deference to supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei , iran 's most powerful figure . " he has to consult with the supreme leader , " said an unnamed political analyst in an interview with reuters .
" he came to power with the hardliners ' backing , now he has to satisfy them . " iran 's chief nuclear negotiator hassan rohani , who could be replaced by ahmadinejad , told state television there would be no policy change under any new negotiating team .
" iran 's nuclear policy is ... decided by top officials .
it will not be changed . "
local media have said former state broadcasting chief ali larijani , a hardliner close to the ayatollah , would replace rohani and take charge of the nuclear negotiations with the eu . us encouraged by decision to delay enrichment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nevertheless , the delay in restarting enrichment has given the us in particular cause for hope .
" it certainly is a positive thing that the steps that the iranians had previously suggested they would take have not occurred , " spokesman tom casey told reporters . the united states and its european allies have made clear that any move to restart fuel-cycle activities suspended under an accord struck in november could force them to seek possible un sanctions again iran .
" if they 've heeded those calls , that 's a good thing , " casey told the daily state department briefing . the iranian move gives britain , france and germany time to finalize a new package of economic and security incentives they had been working on to persuade tehran to renounce its enrichment program . a state department official , who asked not to be named , said the europeans had informed washington they would unveil the package over the weekend , perhaps as early as friday .
he gave no other details . iran reiterates nuclear desire to europeans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's isfahan nuclear facility .
but iran has said it remains determined to resume its uranium conversion work at the isfahan plant .
the process is the first step in the cycle to produce fuel for nuclear reactors . in a letter sent to the foreign ministers of the eu-3 on tuesday , hassan rowhani said this " inalienable right can not be the subject of arbitrary and subjective criteria . " " your side has continued to refrain from responding substantively to our proposals , in whole or even in part .
we intend to take a minimal step , " the letter said .
" the islamic republic of iran stringently desires a negotiated resumption of its enrichment activities and is prepared to continue in good faith and in an expeditious and result-oriented manner its negotiations , " it said . the so-called eu-3 were reportedly ready to offer the iranians guaranteed fuel for a nuclear power plant they are building at bushehr and others they may build further down the road .
the package was also expected to include trade benefits , including civilian aircraft and parts iran badly needs , help in joining the world trade organization and a promise to bring tehran into regional security talks . eu , us still at odds over iran deal the united states was initially skeptical about the european initiative to negotiate with iran but changed tack in march and agreed to back the effort .
still , speculation has persisted about potential differences in the us and european positions . the europeans have reportedly flirted with the idea of allowing iran to retain some limited civilian nuclear capacity .
the americans have insisted iran completely halt its fuel cycle work and dismantle its facilities . but the us administration insisted it was on the same page with its trans-atlantic allies as they prepared to make what could be a last-ditch offer to the iranians .
" it would be pretty hard for us to support a process , including the proposals in it , based on things we had n't seen and we had n't agreed with , " said the state department official . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu voices concern for iran nuclear talks eu leaders face an uncertain future in their negotiations with iran over its nuclear program following the election of ultra-conservative president mahmoud ahmadinejad , even warning the talks could be frozen .

the news comes as iran 's new president mahmoud ahmadinejad faces up to tough decisions as he takes over the running of the islamic republic on thursday with the most pressing issue being the diplomatic stand-off with the european union and the united states which he inherited from his predecessor . the former revolutionary guard began his first day in office on thursday but the work of his government begins after saturday , the day he takes the oath of office and announces his cabinet . this weekend is likely to see the new president thrust into a row which could lead to un sanctions if iran does not back down from its threat to restart nuclear work which the europeans and americans suspect might be aimed at building an atomic bomb . on wednesday , iran announced that it would back off its threat to resume suspended uranium conversion activities , a move that was welcomed by the united states .

according to mandatory legal filings published on the automaker 's web site , six managers have exercised options to buy daimlerchrysler shares at a discounted price and then immediately re-sold those shares at a much higher market price on the same day , reaping fat profits from the transactions .
since schrempp announced last week that he planned to step down three years ahead of the expiration of his contract , daimlerchrysler shares have risen by more than 10 percent on the stock exchange .
two board members , thomas sidlik and eckhard cordes , and four other top executives , harald böstler , herbert kauffmann , ulrich walker , wolfgang diez and günter egle , all liquidated their holdings since the announcement , netting a total 1.26 million euros -lrb- $ 1.56 million -rrb- , according to daimlerchrysler 's own information .
on top of that , the managers received additional cash payments to make up for differences between the reference price and the actual strike price of the options , daimlerchrysler said .
all in all , the managers took home more than 1.5 million euros in profits from the deals .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de election 2005 -pipe- 04.08.2005 " lafontaine is not a german haider " 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from spd leader to spd enemy : oskar lafontaine how strong is germany 's new leftist alliance ?
how dangerous is it for the social democrats ?
is the left party 's new front man , oskar lafontaine , wooing right wing voters ?
a political scientist offers answers . the political scientist and party researcher klaus detterbeck teaches at the institute for political science at the university of magdeburg . dw-world : what chances do you give the new leftist alliance in the expedited bundestag elections ? klaus detterbeck : i would put the chances relatively high .
i would , however , differentiate between a short-term success for the bundestag elections , and the long-term perspective , which i view more critically .
in the short-term , the party has the opportunity to fill a vacuum which exists in the current competition between the parties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators protesting in berlin against social welfare cuts for the voters in western germany there has been no outlet to express frustrations with reform of the social welfare system , the effects of market liberalization .
here the party is filling a gap .
in the long-term i see the problem that the alliance parties are actually quite heterogeneous , that both at the grassroots as well as the leadership level there are significant differences between the labor union members in the west and the old pds -lrb- party of democratic socialism , the successor of the communist party of east germany -rrb- cadre in the east .
the differences will be difficult to reconcile , both for the party platform and the political goals .
what brings the groups together is the protest against social reforms .
in the longer-term they will have a falling out . so the left party is a protest party ?
what will define their constituency ? in the west it will doubtless be the disaffected stalwarts of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , just that unionized milieu from which the spd drew its base over decades .
in the east it will be the old pds voters coming from various societal groupings .
on the one side there is thus the protest voter trying to prevent the east from being treated as second-class , but there is also the old gdr cadre .
it will definitely be a protest party .
when we look to other countries , for example to spain or sweden , we also see similar leftist groupings , also heterogeneous , drawing their members from communists , greens , and leftist activists .
they feed off of the protest against modernization and the liberalization of the welfare state . there it functions on a long-term basis ... yes , since it has to do with very pragmatic , loose alliances , which for the most part remain separate from one another and only come together for the election .
this just wo n't work in germany .
the left party has to position itself .
after the election , problems will surely develop , and so i see little chance that the party will remain together . is the spd seriously threatened by this new alliance ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no longer guaranteed spd voters the spd will definitely suffer losses at its base , the unionized milieu - voters who may not have gone to the polls had this party not materialized .
they must see their chance to express their anger and disappointment with the spd government , a chance to make their frustration known .
this is without doubt a threat for the spd . is the spd responding appropriately to this threat by attempting to slander the new alliance ? the spd has always assumed it was the voice of the left , the voice of the traditional organized labor in the broadest sense .
now there has been for a long , long time a serious competition here .
and the spd shows an allergic reaction and is flip-flopping : on the one hand , it is trying to restore its social competence , the intention to more strongly articulate social justice .
on the other hand they are trying to portray the new alliance as illegitimate .
this is bound to come off badly for those voters disappointed by the schröder government and will motivate them to keep their distance from the spd .
the spd 's strategy is thus not exactly helping them to woo back their base .
but it is difficult to imagine what the spd 's options are at this point . continue reading to find out whether lafontaine is fishing for voters on the extreme right . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de social justice or economic folly ?
the new hard-left grouping in germany , the left party , is sending tremors across the political landscape .
but , the party 's economic program has industry groups and economists shaking their heads , and worrying .
-lrb- aug .
3 , 2005 -rrb- the comeback kid former spd chairman oskar lafontaine has had a tumultuous career in politics , withdrawing twice from the limelight in the past three decades .
but this pugnacious and passionate " napoleon " is back for his waterloo .
-lrb- july 20 , 2005 -rrb- goodbye pds , hello " left party " after much back and forth , germany 's reform communist pds party on sunday voted in favor of joining a new leftist alliance , and agreed to change their name , as expected , to the left party .

how dangerous is it for the social democrats ?
is the left party 's new front man , oskar lafontaine , wooing right wing voters ?
a political scientist offers answers . the political scientist and party researcher klaus detterbeck teaches at the institute for political science at the university of magdeburg . dw-world : what chances do you give the new leftist alliance in the expedited bundestag elections ? klaus detterbeck : i would put the chances relatively high .
i would , however , differentiate between a short-term success for the bundestag elections , and the long-term perspective , which i view more critically .
in the short-term , the party has the opportunity to fill a vacuum which exists in the current competition between the parties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators protesting in berlin against social welfare cuts for the voters in western germany there has been no outlet to express frustrations with reform of the social welfare system , the effects of market liberalization .
here the party is filling a gap .
in the long-term i see the problem that the alliance parties are actually quite heterogeneous , that both at the grassroots as well as the leadership level there are significant differences between the labor union members in the west and the old pds -lrb- party of democratic socialism , the successor of the communist party of east germany -rrb- cadre in the east .
the differences will be difficult to reconcile , both for the party platform and the political goals .
what brings the groups together is the protest against social reforms .
in the longer-term they will have a falling out . so the left party is a protest party ?
what will define their constituency ? in the west it will doubtless be the disaffected stalwarts of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , just that unionized milieu from which the spd drew its base over decades .
in the east it will be the old pds voters coming from various societal groupings .
on the one side there is thus the protest voter trying to prevent the east from being treated as second-class , but there is also the old gdr cadre .
it will definitely be a protest party .
when we look to other countries , for example to spain or sweden , we also see similar leftist groupings , also heterogeneous , drawing their members from communists , greens , and leftist activists .
they feed off of the protest against modernization and the liberalization of the welfare state . there it functions on a long-term basis ... yes , since it has to do with very pragmatic , loose alliances , which for the most part remain separate from one another and only come together for the election .
this just wo n't work in germany .
the left party has to position itself .
after the election , problems will surely develop , and so i see little chance that the party will remain together . is the spd seriously threatened by this new alliance ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no longer guaranteed spd voters the spd will definitely suffer losses at its base , the unionized milieu - voters who may not have gone to the polls had this party not materialized .
they must see their chance to express their anger and disappointment with the spd government , a chance to make their frustration known .
this is without doubt a threat for the spd . is the spd responding appropriately to this threat by attempting to slander the new alliance ? the spd has always assumed it was the voice of the left , the voice of the traditional organized labor in the broadest sense .
now there has been for a long , long time a serious competition here .
and the spd shows an allergic reaction and is flip-flopping : on the one hand , it is trying to restore its social competence , the intention to more strongly articulate social justice .
on the other hand they are trying to portray the new alliance as illegitimate .
this is bound to come off badly for those voters disappointed by the schröder government and will motivate them to keep their distance from the spd .
the spd 's strategy is thus not exactly helping them to woo back their base .
but it is difficult to imagine what the spd 's options are at this point . continue reading to find out whether lafontaine is fishing for voters on the extreme right . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de social justice or economic folly ?
the new hard-left grouping in germany , the left party , is sending tremors across the political landscape .
but , the party 's economic program has industry groups and economists shaking their heads , and worrying .

how dangerous is it for the social democrats ?
is the left party 's new front man , oskar lafontaine , wooing right wing voters ?
a political scientist offers answers . the political scientist and party researcher klaus detterbeck teaches at the institute for political science at the university of magdeburg . dw-world : what chances do you give the new leftist alliance in the expedited bundestag elections ? klaus detterbeck : i would put the chances relatively high .
i would , however , differentiate between a short-term success for the bundestag elections , and the long-term perspective , which i view more critically .
in the short-term , the party has the opportunity to fill a vacuum which exists in the current competition between the parties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators protesting in berlin against social welfare cuts for the voters in western germany there has been no outlet to express frustrations with reform of the social welfare system , the effects of market liberalization .
here the party is filling a gap .
in the long-term i see the problem that the alliance parties are actually quite heterogeneous , that both at the grassroots as well as the leadership level there are significant differences between the labor union members in the west and the old pds -lrb- party of democratic socialism , the successor of the communist party of east germany -rrb- cadre in the east .
the differences will be difficult to reconcile , both for the party platform and the political goals .
what brings the groups together is the protest against social reforms .
in the longer-term they will have a falling out . so the left party is a protest party ?
what will define their constituency ? in the west it will doubtless be the disaffected stalwarts of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , just that unionized milieu from which the spd drew its base over decades .
in the east it will be the old pds voters coming from various societal groupings .
on the one side there is thus the protest voter trying to prevent the east from being treated as second-class , but there is also the old gdr cadre .
it will definitely be a protest party .
when we look to other countries , for example to spain or sweden , we also see similar leftist groupings , also heterogeneous , drawing their members from communists , greens , and leftist activists .
they feed off of the protest against modernization and the liberalization of the welfare state . there it functions on a long-term basis ... yes , since it has to do with very pragmatic , loose alliances , which for the most part remain separate from one another and only come together for the election .
this just wo n't work in germany .
the left party has to position itself .
after the election , problems will surely develop , and so i see little chance that the party will remain together . is the spd seriously threatened by this new alliance ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no longer guaranteed spd voters the spd will definitely suffer losses at its base , the unionized milieu - voters who may not have gone to the polls had this party not materialized .
they must see their chance to express their anger and disappointment with the spd government , a chance to make their frustration known .
this is without doubt a threat for the spd . is the spd responding appropriately to this threat by attempting to slander the new alliance ? the spd has always assumed it was the voice of the left , the voice of the traditional organized labor in the broadest sense .
now there has been for a long , long time a serious competition here .
and the spd shows an allergic reaction and is flip-flopping : on the one hand , it is trying to restore its social competence , the intention to more strongly articulate social justice .
on the other hand they are trying to portray the new alliance as illegitimate .
this is bound to come off badly for those voters disappointed by the schröder government and will motivate them to keep their distance from the spd .
the spd 's strategy is thus not exactly helping them to woo back their base .

how dangerous is it for the social democrats ?
is the left party 's new front man , oskar lafontaine , wooing right wing voters ?
a political scientist offers answers . the political scientist and party researcher klaus detterbeck teaches at the institute for political science at the university of magdeburg . dw-world : what chances do you give the new leftist alliance in the expedited bundestag elections ? klaus detterbeck : i would put the chances relatively high .
i would , however , differentiate between a short-term success for the bundestag elections , and the long-term perspective , which i view more critically .
in the short-term , the party has the opportunity to fill a vacuum which exists in the current competition between the parties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators protesting in berlin against social welfare cuts for the voters in western germany there has been no outlet to express frustrations with reform of the social welfare system , the effects of market liberalization .
here the party is filling a gap .
in the long-term i see the problem that the alliance parties are actually quite heterogeneous , that both at the grassroots as well as the leadership level there are significant differences between the labor union members in the west and the old pds -lrb- party of democratic socialism , the successor of the communist party of east germany -rrb- cadre in the east .
the differences will be difficult to reconcile , both for the party platform and the political goals .
what brings the groups together is the protest against social reforms .
in the longer-term they will have a falling out . so the left party is a protest party ?
what will define their constituency ? in the west it will doubtless be the disaffected stalwarts of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , just that unionized milieu from which the spd drew its base over decades .
in the east it will be the old pds voters coming from various societal groupings .
on the one side there is thus the protest voter trying to prevent the east from being treated as second-class , but there is also the old gdr cadre .
it will definitely be a protest party .
when we look to other countries , for example to spain or sweden , we also see similar leftist groupings , also heterogeneous , drawing their members from communists , greens , and leftist activists .
they feed off of the protest against modernization and the liberalization of the welfare state . there it functions on a long-term basis ... yes , since it has to do with very pragmatic , loose alliances , which for the most part remain separate from one another and only come together for the election .

is this justified ? the party is certainly populist in the sense that they rail against change and modernization without really wanting to , or rather being able to say , what they would do differently .
it is a party that wants to excite tempers and encourage protest without being able to give answers .
one could say that this is not necessarily the role of a new opposition party .
it is a chance to express protest and it can lead the established parties to reconsider certain issues . gregor gysi and oskar lafontaine , the former spd chief , will act together as top candidates .
lafontaine in particular has been attacked by the spd and the greens .
he was given the epithet of " german haider -lrb- austria 's right-wing populist politician -rrb- , " fishing for votes on the extreme right .
what do you think of this accusation ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jörg haider recently split from the populist freedom party he founded and started a new right-wing alliance no , in my opinion you ca n't look at it that way .
the charge goes back to a speech lafontaine made , in which he spoke of " alien workers , " a concept from the rightist camp .
when one looks at the political development of lafontaine , i do n't think it 's fair to speak of a rightist leaning or an attempt to court rightist voters .
lafontaine has always been a nonconformist , someone who has always taken positions not directly in line with that of his party .
he is continuing with this .
so the comparison with haider is not justified . but does lafontaine really offer any sensible remedies ? lafontaine has , since his retreat from the federal government , been constantly appealing to the public , whether in publications or in talk shows , spreading his view of things - that is , a state control of the globalized economy .
he has time and again been criticized , that his solutions are completely unrealistic .
for himself and for the groupings he stands for , this is a reasonable answer to globalization .
it is , however , in the current situation , no adequate response .
it is impossible to see how a strong governmental , national control could be implemented at the european level .
should lafontaine be asked to implement his policies in the real world , then his alliance would really dissolve quite quickly .
but as an opposition party , as a protest party , such goals are legitimate .
it is an opportunity for disgruntled voters to express that they do not agree with the course and the pace of the reforms .

according to mandatory legal filings published on the automaker 's web site , six managers have exercised options to buy daimlerchrysler shares at a discounted price and then immediately re-sold those shares at a much higher market price on the same day , reaping fat profits from the transactions .
since schrempp announced last week that he planned to step down three years ahead of the expiration of his contract , daimlerchrysler shares have risen by more than 10 percent on the stock exchange .
two board members , thomas sidlik and eckhard cordes , and four other top executives , harald böstler , herbert kauffmann , ulrich walker , wolfgang diez and günter egle , all liquidated their holdings since the announcement , netting a total 1.26 million euros -lrb- $ 1.56 million -rrb- , according to daimlerchrysler 's own information .
on top of that , the managers received additional cash payments to make up for differences between the reference price and the actual strike price of the options , daimlerchrysler said .
all in all , the managers took home more than 1.5 million euros in profits from the deals .
the transactions were criticized by shareholder groups , who argued that the variable components of managers ' wages should not be linked to the share price but to a company 's long-term profits . dw-world.de opinion : generational change in the board room something 's going on in german board rooms .

but their mandate is still unclear . around 100 unarmed military and civilian officials from the european union will monitor the implementation of a peace pact between the indonesian government and the separatist free aceh movement -lrb- gam -rrb- .
they will be joined by an equal number of monitors from the association of southeast asian nations -lrb- asean -rrb- . indonesia and gam tentatively reached a deal on july 17 to end almost 30 years of war , in which close to 15,000 people have died .
their pact includes the disarmament of rebels and a troop withdrawal from aceh . the pact is due to be signed on august 15 in helsinki - two days before the 60th anniversary of indonesian independence .
a 28-strong team of european and southeast asian officials visited banda aceh this week to make logistical preparations for the monitoring mission , which could begin shortly after the pact is signed . but the mission has so far only been defined in general terms .
a protocol of measures to take should the pact be violated has not been agreed on , nor has the length of the mission .

" we 're offering our support for the peace process , and we 'll try to accommodate the wishes of the indonesian government . " however , it 's questionable whether all the wishes of the indonesian side can really be fulfilled .

they will be joined by an equal number of monitors from the association of southeast asian nations -lrb- asean -rrb- . indonesia and gam tentatively reached a deal on july 17 to end almost 30 years of war , in which close to 15,000 people have died .
their pact includes the disarmament of rebels and a troop withdrawal from aceh . the pact is due to be signed on august 15 in helsinki - two days before the 60th anniversary of indonesian independence .
a 28-strong team of european and southeast asian officials visited banda aceh this week to make logistical preparations for the monitoring mission , which could begin shortly after the pact is signed . but the mission has so far only been defined in general terms .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 04.08.2005 the cost of environmental pollution germany may be an eco-friendly place , but support for the environment does come at a price - a fact that some organizations are trying to disprove .
but environmental groups themselves are n't so sure . germans who own a car ca n't avoid the fact that 65 cents -lrb- $ 0.80 -rrb- of every euro that goes into their fuel tank flows into state coffers in the form of various energy taxes . it may be a high price to pay in a country that prides itself on its environmentally-friendly policies .
but according to tanja loitz of climate seeks protection , a program supported by the german environment ministry , there are ways to help the environment and save money at the same time .
" most people do not know that most household co2 emissions come from heating , " she said , explaining why one of the campaign 's goals is to reduce the 120 million tons of annual household co2 emissions .
" there is not a lack of interest in the environment , but a lack of factual knowledge . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : home heating releases the most household greenhouse gasses raising awareness by saving money if the numerous recycling programs across the country are any indication , germans already tend to be an environmentally-conscious bunch .
in fact , 74 percent of germans rate protecting the environment as very important , according to a recent study conducted by pollster forsa .
at the same time , most of those surveyed were of different opinions when it came to the question of what could be done about it .
" consumers certainly find the topic interesting , but are only willing to become involved in small degrees if it affects their wallets , " said moritz lehmkuhl , head of climate partner , an organization that tries to raise awareness of climate change among businesses and the public .
" the idea that they should save money and shop for bargains still dominates among consumers . "
who should be held responsible ?
he agreed with loitz on the importance of individual participation if there is a chance of achieving the kyoto protocol 's goals of reducing greenhouse gasses by 5 percent of 1990 levels before 2012 , and that the best way to get people 's attention is by saying it will save them money .
environmental groups also say that minimizing monetary concerns is an effective way of changing daily habits . but some would like to see the government make polluting more costly instead of relying on people to be voluntarily more concerned about their surroundings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friends of the earth germany " people who voluntarily take part are already very environmentally conscious and think about their actions , " said markus steigenberger of friends of the earth germany .
" i do not think voluntary action programs have a large effect on the general population . "
the alternative of legal coercion , however , is not an effective way to make people responsible for their actions , lehmkuhl argued .
" taxes have a negative aftertaste , and with voluntary initiatives you can achieve something extra , " he said .
" it is important to show that people can personally do something . "
climate partner recommends consumers make online purchases through climate friends , a portal that invests sales commissions - exactly how much depends on company specific deals - in sustainable , climate-neutral projects around the world .
legislation more effective bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the average german produces about 11 tons of co2 a year steinberger of friends of the earth said that people who actually use these services to make up for the 11 tons of co2 the average german produces annually are doing the right thing and added that raising environmental awareness is crucial .
at the same time , legislation is the best way to help the environment , he said .
" we need defined goals and legislation that lets business and people act in a climate-friendly way and makes pollution expensive , " steinberger said .
climate seeks protection 's loitz suggests that the most effective laws would focus on rewarding those who prevent pollution rather than doling out punishments for those who cause it .
while environmental groups continue work to get stricter laws enacted and enforced , and climate seeks protection and climate partner continue their voluntary programs , all the groups maintain that increasing the environmental consciousness that keeps greenhouse gasses from being produced is necessary .
there is , after all , no way to get co2 back in the bottle once it 's emitted . sean sinico , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de goal for germany and the environment in just over 13 months , millions of soccer fans will descend on germany for the world cup .

but environmental groups themselves are n't so sure . germans who own a car ca n't avoid the fact that 65 cents -lrb- $ 0.80 -rrb- of every euro that goes into their fuel tank flows into state coffers in the form of various energy taxes . it may be a high price to pay in a country that prides itself on its environmentally-friendly policies .
but according to tanja loitz of climate seeks protection , a program supported by the german environment ministry , there are ways to help the environment and save money at the same time .
" most people do not know that most household co2 emissions come from heating , " she said , explaining why one of the campaign 's goals is to reduce the 120 million tons of annual household co2 emissions .
" there is not a lack of interest in the environment , but a lack of factual knowledge . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : home heating releases the most household greenhouse gasses raising awareness by saving money if the numerous recycling programs across the country are any indication , germans already tend to be an environmentally-conscious bunch .
in fact , 74 percent of germans rate protecting the environment as very important , according to a recent study conducted by pollster forsa .
at the same time , most of those surveyed were of different opinions when it came to the question of what could be done about it .
" consumers certainly find the topic interesting , but are only willing to become involved in small degrees if it affects their wallets , " said moritz lehmkuhl , head of climate partner , an organization that tries to raise awareness of climate change among businesses and the public .
" the idea that they should save money and shop for bargains still dominates among consumers . "
who should be held responsible ?
he agreed with loitz on the importance of individual participation if there is a chance of achieving the kyoto protocol 's goals of reducing greenhouse gasses by 5 percent of 1990 levels before 2012 , and that the best way to get people 's attention is by saying it will save them money .
environmental groups also say that minimizing monetary concerns is an effective way of changing daily habits . but some would like to see the government make polluting more costly instead of relying on people to be voluntarily more concerned about their surroundings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friends of the earth germany " people who voluntarily take part are already very environmentally conscious and think about their actions , " said markus steigenberger of friends of the earth germany .
" i do not think voluntary action programs have a large effect on the general population . "
the alternative of legal coercion , however , is not an effective way to make people responsible for their actions , lehmkuhl argued .
" taxes have a negative aftertaste , and with voluntary initiatives you can achieve something extra , " he said .
" it is important to show that people can personally do something . "
climate partner recommends consumers make online purchases through climate friends , a portal that invests sales commissions - exactly how much depends on company specific deals - in sustainable , climate-neutral projects around the world .
legislation more effective bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the average german produces about 11 tons of co2 a year steinberger of friends of the earth said that people who actually use these services to make up for the 11 tons of co2 the average german produces annually are doing the right thing and added that raising environmental awareness is crucial .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 04.08.2005 the cost of environmental pollution germany may be an eco-friendly place , but support for the environment does come at a price - a fact that some organizations are trying to disprove .
but environmental groups themselves are n't so sure . germans who own a car ca n't avoid the fact that 65 cents -lrb- $ 0.80 -rrb- of every euro that goes into their fuel tank flows into state coffers in the form of various energy taxes . it may be a high price to pay in a country that prides itself on its environmentally-friendly policies .
but according to tanja loitz of climate seeks protection , a program supported by the german environment ministry , there are ways to help the environment and save money at the same time .
" most people do not know that most household co2 emissions come from heating , " she said , explaining why one of the campaign 's goals is to reduce the 120 million tons of annual household co2 emissions .
" there is not a lack of interest in the environment , but a lack of factual knowledge . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : home heating releases the most household greenhouse gasses raising awareness by saving money if the numerous recycling programs across the country are any indication , germans already tend to be an environmentally-conscious bunch .
in fact , 74 percent of germans rate protecting the environment as very important , according to a recent study conducted by pollster forsa .
at the same time , most of those surveyed were of different opinions when it came to the question of what could be done about it .
" consumers certainly find the topic interesting , but are only willing to become involved in small degrees if it affects their wallets , " said moritz lehmkuhl , head of climate partner , an organization that tries to raise awareness of climate change among businesses and the public .
" the idea that they should save money and shop for bargains still dominates among consumers . "
who should be held responsible ?
he agreed with loitz on the importance of individual participation if there is a chance of achieving the kyoto protocol 's goals of reducing greenhouse gasses by 5 percent of 1990 levels before 2012 , and that the best way to get people 's attention is by saying it will save them money .
environmental groups also say that minimizing monetary concerns is an effective way of changing daily habits . but some would like to see the government make polluting more costly instead of relying on people to be voluntarily more concerned about their surroundings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friends of the earth germany " people who voluntarily take part are already very environmentally conscious and think about their actions , " said markus steigenberger of friends of the earth germany .
" i do not think voluntary action programs have a large effect on the general population . "
the alternative of legal coercion , however , is not an effective way to make people responsible for their actions , lehmkuhl argued .
" taxes have a negative aftertaste , and with voluntary initiatives you can achieve something extra , " he said .
" it is important to show that people can personally do something . "
climate partner recommends consumers make online purchases through climate friends , a portal that invests sales commissions - exactly how much depends on company specific deals - in sustainable , climate-neutral projects around the world .
legislation more effective bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the average german produces about 11 tons of co2 a year steinberger of friends of the earth said that people who actually use these services to make up for the 11 tons of co2 the average german produces annually are doing the right thing and added that raising environmental awareness is crucial .
at the same time , legislation is the best way to help the environment , he said .
" we need defined goals and legislation that lets business and people act in a climate-friendly way and makes pollution expensive , " steinberger said .
climate seeks protection 's loitz suggests that the most effective laws would focus on rewarding those who prevent pollution rather than doling out punishments for those who cause it .
while environmental groups continue work to get stricter laws enacted and enforced , and climate seeks protection and climate partner continue their voluntary programs , all the groups maintain that increasing the environmental consciousness that keeps greenhouse gasses from being produced is necessary .
there is , after all , no way to get co2 back in the bottle once it 's emitted . sean sinico , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de goal for germany and the environment in just over 13 months , millions of soccer fans will descend on germany for the world cup .
to limit the strain on the environment , the organizing committee has announced the green goal campaign .

china and the us have agreed to work together to try and prevent the expansion of the united nations security council to include a further six permanent seats , including one for germany . the contentious bid to enlarge the security council led by germany , japan , brazil and india , collectively known as the group of four or g4 , has met with steady resistance from both washington and beijing over the past months , but their joining forces to block the move is a departure which will likely further dilute any chance of the plan 's success .

through the association , the three auto giants aim to standardize fuel-cell technologies in a bid to commercialize the vehicles worldwide , japan 's top-selling daily yomiuri shimbun said .
they hope the collaboration will reduce development costs for fuel-cell technologies and also help standardize fuel nozzles and other parts related to a hydrogen supply system , said the daily , which did not identify its sources .
the affiliation is likely to prompt other automakers to form alliances on fuel-cell vehicles , it said .
honda denied there were any concrete plans but said the company has been working with a consortium grouping gm , bmw and european auto-parts makers to develop filling systems for liquid hydrogen .
toyota and gm , the world 's two top automakers , have been in talks to set up a fuel-cell vehicle joint venture this year but the asahi shimbun daily said last week they had decided to scrap the plan because of a disagreement on technology sharing .
fuel-cell vehicles generate no harmful emissions and are one step ahead of other hybrid vehicles which combine conventional internal combustion engines with electric motors . dw-world.de fill it up with hydrogen drivers in berlin can fill up their cars with hydrogen at the world 's largest service station for fuel cell vehicles .
opened on friday , the project paves the way for widespread use of alternative energy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 04.08.2005 eu to send peace monitors to aceh großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : disarmament and a withdrawal of troops should bring peace to aceh the eu is sending a peace monitoring mission to asia for the first time to observe a pact to end decades of civil war in indonesia 's aceh province .
but their mandate is still unclear . around 100 unarmed military and civilian officials from the european union will monitor the implementation of a peace pact between the indonesian government and the separatist free aceh movement -lrb- gam -rrb- .
they will be joined by an equal number of monitors from the association of southeast asian nations -lrb- asean -rrb- . indonesia and gam tentatively reached a deal on july 17 to end almost 30 years of war , in which close to 15,000 people have died .
their pact includes the disarmament of rebels and a troop withdrawal from aceh . the pact is due to be signed on august 15 in helsinki - two days before the 60th anniversary of indonesian independence .
a 28-strong team of european and southeast asian officials visited banda aceh this week to make logistical preparations for the monitoring mission , which could begin shortly after the pact is signed . but the mission has so far only been defined in general terms .
a protocol of measures to take should the pact be violated has not been agreed on , nor has the length of the mission .
these and other details are expected to be addressed in the coming weeks . no reconstruction without peace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a local volunteer walks past a wall graffiti ' good by -lrb- e -rrb- banda aceh ' on a shop shutter in january in banda aceh , indonesia aceh was particularly hard hit by last december 's tsunami , and one could expect that the vast amount of reconstruction work still to be done might take precedence over the peace accord .
but the former eu representative in jakarta , ana maria gomes , said the accord ca n't wait . " we 're of the opinion that it 's only through an acceleration of the peace process that the reconstruction process can really begin to move forward , " gomes said .
" we 're offering our support for the peace process , and we 'll try to accommodate the wishes of the indonesian government . " however , it 's questionable whether all the wishes of the indonesian side can really be fulfilled .
indonesia 's military chief , endriartono sutarto , has requested that soldiers should be included among the monitors , in order to be able to react immediately should an emergency arise .
the eu framework , though , expressly excludes a military component from this type of mission . risk of failure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two soldiers guard the baiturrahman mosque on election day , in sept .
2004 , in banda aceh , indonesia generally the impression from jakarta is that it 's not overly keen to see the start of the international mission .
there 's considerable danger that not only gam hardliners , but also those within the indonesian military , could quickly foil the aims of the peace mission .
it would n't be the first time : in 2002 , a dozen observers from thailand and the philippines watched over a short-lived truce that ended as the spiral of violence grew out of control . the hope this time is that the aftermath of the devastating tsunami in indonesia will be enough to convince both sides in the aceh conflict to give peace - and reconstruction - a chance . tobias grote-beverborg -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tsunami relief all positive government says around five months after the tsunami disaster in south asia , berlin presented an optimistic preliminary report .

the sale represents a big step forward for the troubled retail giant , which suffered the worst crisis in its history in 2004 .
chief executive officer thomas middelhoff said the deal almost completes karstadtquelle 's goal of securing its finances .

" we are glad to report that our margin has improved significantly in the first half of 2005 , " said middelhoff , adding that the company had reduced net debt by 800 million euros , not including the new divestments .

the 124-outlet runners point chain was sold to hannover finanz group .
karstadtquelle did not disclose the sales price of either deal . middelhoff said that staff at all 250 outlets involved in the sales would be taken over by the new owners .

german retail managers are also worried by the prospect of a possible hike in value-added sales tax . however , the company is confident that its restructuring plan will be successful in the long run . " we are glad to report that our margin has improved significantly in the first half of 2005 , " said middelhoff , adding that the company had reduced net debt by 800 million euros , not including the new divestments .
the company has reduced its number of employees by around 25,000 , resulting in a 16 percent decrease in staff costs .

the news comes as iran 's new president mahmoud ahmadinejad faces up to tough decisions as he takes over the running of the islamic republic on thursday with the most pressing issue being the diplomatic stand-off with the european union and the united states which he inherited from his predecessor . the former revolutionary guard began his first day in office on thursday but the work of his government begins after saturday , the day he takes the oath of office and announces his cabinet . this weekend is likely to see the new president thrust into a row which could lead to un sanctions if iran does not back down from its threat to restart nuclear work which the europeans and americans suspect might be aimed at building an atomic bomb . on wednesday , iran announced that it would back off its threat to resume suspended uranium conversion activities , a move that was welcomed by the united states .

" if they 've heeded those calls , that 's a good thing , " casey told the daily state department briefing . the iranian move gives britain , france and germany time to finalize a new package of economic and security incentives they had been working on to persuade tehran to renounce its enrichment program . a state department official , who asked not to be named , said the europeans had informed washington they would unveil the package over the weekend , perhaps as early as friday .

" the islamic republic of iran stringently desires a negotiated resumption of its enrichment activities and is prepared to continue in good faith and in an expeditious and result-oriented manner its negotiations , " it said . the so-called eu-3 were reportedly ready to offer the iranians guaranteed fuel for a nuclear power plant they are building at bushehr and others they may build further down the road .
the package was also expected to include trade benefits , including civilian aircraft and parts iran badly needs , help in joining the world trade organization and a promise to bring tehran into regional security talks . eu , us still at odds over iran deal the united states was initially skeptical about the european initiative to negotiate with iran but changed tack in march and agreed to back the effort .

the americans have insisted iran completely halt its fuel cycle work and dismantle its facilities . but the us administration insisted it was on the same page with its trans-atlantic allies as they prepared to make what could be a last-ditch offer to the iranians .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 04.08.2005 eu all but clears germany in visa affair großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer took responsibility for the 2000 visa policy directive germany 's visa policy of 2000 violated a number of eu laws , the european commission said thursday , but subsequent amendments have been enough to avoid legal action .
however , some doubts remain . germany escaped legal action after the european commission ruled on thursday that while the lax system at the heart of the german visa scandal violated european union norms , berlin had since remedied the problem with a reformed policy that complies with eu rules . the scandal , for which foreign minister joschka fischer has accepted responsibility , revolves around the loose visa policies that allowed thousands of criminals and illegal workers , mainly from ukraine , to enter germany between 2000 and 2002 . commission spokesman friso roscam abbing told a news briefing that the german policy circular issued by fischer in 2000 , which the christian democrat opposition describes as an opening of " the floodgates to a wave of unsuitable migrants , " did not comply with a range of european directives or laws . fischer 's circular contravened eu laws " the 2000 -lrb- instruction -rrb- was not compatible with schengen law , with eu law , with the common consular instructions , " abbing said .
justice and security commissioner franco frattini added that the 2000 circular that was the basis for the easier policy " ran counter to the common consular instructions -lrb- cci -rrb- " . bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer passes the entrance of a parliamentary panel investigating the visa scandal in april . the directive from fischer 's office ordered german consulates , notably in eastern europe , to give applicants the benefit of the doubt if they could not fully justify their financial means of support or the purpose of their trip . however , after the german foreign ministry had been plunged into a crisis concerning the visas and a flood of migrants , the visa policy was amended to the satisfaction of the eu 's executive .
" an examination of the guiding circular of oct .
26 , 2004 ... leads to the conclusion that the breaches of the cci in the previous circulars have been remedied , " frattini said . breaches remedied but questions remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franco frattini , eu justice commissioner frattini did point out , however , that some points in the 2004 circular were unclear and would benefit from clarification , but these were not grounds to invalidate the german policy , he said . the german foreign ministry welcomed the commission 's assessment that the german rules now met eu requirements . the almost disastrous political lesson learnt by the germans showed that countries should be aware that there was no place for liberal interpretations in national legislation or instructions of common eu visa regulations adopted for the schengen passport-free travel area , frattini added . conservative lawmaker targets red-green coalition however , while the commission appeared to close the book on the incident , others were not so quick to let germany off the hook .
opposition german eu lawmaker jochim würmeling challenged the commission to investigate berlin 's new policies , claiming that these too were flawed . würmeling , who said that the commission ruling on germany 's current visa policy was " in no way a virtual acquittal , " explained that while there were still discrepancies between the german and the european rules on the burden of proof for visa applicants there was a " grave deviation " from eu law , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : calling the commission 's analysis of the 2000 rules " damning , " würmeling then turned on the social democratic-green coalition government saying that its attitude to the visa policy showed " just how crass this wrong decision taken by the government was . " " one gets the impression that the ... government was completely indifferent to what eu rules said about issuing visas , " he said . visa scandal to cast shadow over election würmeling intends to raise the issue again in an attempt to hold the german government accountable in a question time session with frattini when the eu parliament reconvenes in september , just two weeks before likely german elections . it could be perfect timing for the opposition parties in germany who have been hounding gerhard schröder 's government for months over the scandal . the visa affair has weakened the bond between the ruling coalition , with ministers forced to testify before a parliamentary commission of inquiry and blame being passed between parties and departments before fischer took the hit for the team . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de probe into visa affair must go on germany 's highest court on wednesday thwarted a bid by the embattled government to wrap up a parliamentary probe into what 's become known as the " visa affair " ahead of likely elections in september .

opposition german eu lawmaker jochim würmeling challenged the commission to investigate berlin 's new policies , claiming that these too were flawed . würmeling , who said that the commission ruling on germany 's current visa policy was " in no way a virtual acquittal , " explained that while there were still discrepancies between the german and the european rules on the burden of proof for visa applicants there was a " grave deviation " from eu law , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : calling the commission 's analysis of the 2000 rules " damning , " würmeling then turned on the social democratic-green coalition government saying that its attitude to the visa policy showed " just how crass this wrong decision taken by the government was . " " one gets the impression that the ... government was completely indifferent to what eu rules said about issuing visas , " he said . visa scandal to cast shadow over election würmeling intends to raise the issue again in an attempt to hold the german government accountable in a question time session with frattini when the eu parliament reconvenes in september , just two weeks before likely german elections . it could be perfect timing for the opposition parties in germany who have been hounding gerhard schröder 's government for months over the scandal . the visa affair has weakened the bond between the ruling coalition , with ministers forced to testify before a parliamentary commission of inquiry and blame being passed between parties and departments before fischer took the hit for the team . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de probe into visa affair must go on germany 's highest court on wednesday thwarted a bid by the embattled government to wrap up a parliamentary probe into what 's become known as the " visa affair " ahead of likely elections in september .

but their mandate is still unclear . around 100 unarmed military and civilian officials from the european union will monitor the implementation of a peace pact between the indonesian government and the separatist free aceh movement -lrb- gam -rrb- .
they will be joined by an equal number of monitors from the association of southeast asian nations -lrb- asean -rrb- . indonesia and gam tentatively reached a deal on july 17 to end almost 30 years of war , in which close to 15,000 people have died .
their pact includes the disarmament of rebels and a troop withdrawal from aceh . the pact is due to be signed on august 15 in helsinki - two days before the 60th anniversary of indonesian independence .
a 28-strong team of european and southeast asian officials visited banda aceh this week to make logistical preparations for the monitoring mission , which could begin shortly after the pact is signed . but the mission has so far only been defined in general terms .
a protocol of measures to take should the pact be violated has not been agreed on , nor has the length of the mission .
these and other details are expected to be addressed in the coming weeks . no reconstruction without peace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a local volunteer walks past a wall graffiti ' good by -lrb- e -rrb- banda aceh ' on a shop shutter in january in banda aceh , indonesia aceh was particularly hard hit by last december 's tsunami , and one could expect that the vast amount of reconstruction work still to be done might take precedence over the peace accord .
but the former eu representative in jakarta , ana maria gomes , said the accord ca n't wait . " we 're of the opinion that it 's only through an acceleration of the peace process that the reconstruction process can really begin to move forward , " gomes said .
" we 're offering our support for the peace process , and we 'll try to accommodate the wishes of the indonesian government . " however , it 's questionable whether all the wishes of the indonesian side can really be fulfilled .
indonesia 's military chief , endriartono sutarto , has requested that soldiers should be included among the monitors , in order to be able to react immediately should an emergency arise .
the eu framework , though , expressly excludes a military component from this type of mission . risk of failure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two soldiers guard the baiturrahman mosque on election day , in sept .
2004 , in banda aceh , indonesia generally the impression from jakarta is that it 's not overly keen to see the start of the international mission .
there 's considerable danger that not only gam hardliners , but also those within the indonesian military , could quickly foil the aims of the peace mission .
it would n't be the first time : in 2002 , a dozen observers from thailand and the philippines watched over a short-lived truce that ended as the spiral of violence grew out of control . the hope this time is that the aftermath of the devastating tsunami in indonesia will be enough to convince both sides in the aceh conflict to give peace - and reconstruction - a chance . tobias grote-beverborg -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tsunami relief all positive government says around five months after the tsunami disaster in south asia , berlin presented an optimistic preliminary report .

" at this stage , i think our objective will be to oppose the g4 , to make sure that they do not have sufficient votes to risk dividing the house , " he said . expansion without division wang stated that the g4 plan would drive a wedge through the 191 un member states , adding that the ultimate objective of both the us and china was expansion without division . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : g4 foreign ministers " we agreed to work together to make sure that our interests are being maintained , which means that we have to work in parallel ways to see that the unity of the un members , the unity of every regional group will not be spoiled because of this maneuver and process , " he added . painfully slow process the issue of reforming the security council , which still reflects the power structure in the aftermath of wwii , has been on the un agenda for several years , but it has so far proved impossible to reach any agreement on exactly how it should be expanded . earlier this year , un secretary general kofi annan told member states that he wanted a decision before a summit of world leaders in september . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united nations general secretary kofi annan there are currently 15 council seats , just five of which are permanent .
the g4 resolution calls for the addition of six new permanent seats without the power of veto , and four non-permanent ones . germany , japan , brazil and india have earmarked four of the six seats for themselves and the remaining two for african nations .
egypt , nigeria and south africa are the leading contenders . bidding for african support heads of state and representatives of the 53-nation african union -lrb- au -rrb- are meeting in the ethiopian capital of addis ababa on thursday to try and reach a common position on the g4 expansion resolution , but there is little hope that the summit will produce any consensus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flags of the african union algeria 's un ambassador , abdallah baali , warned against any expectation of the meeting producing a unified position , " despite efforts to accommodate the g4 . "
delegates from the four aspirant countries are also there to drum up support for their cause . if their resolution is to have any chance of winning the two-thirds majority in a un general assembly vote , the g4 nations will need the support of the african union . for its part , the au is calling for the expansion of the council to 26 seats , with a total of seven new permanent seats with veto rights . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us reportedly opposed to berlin 's un bid us secretary of state condoleezza rice reportedly is opposed to germany 's bid for a permanent seat on the un security council .

" it is certainly a very big police operation today , " andy trotter , the metropolitan police 's deputy assistant commissioner , told bbc radio .
" we are out there to reassure londoners and also to deter any further attacks on the system , " trotter added .
" london is at a very high state of alert . " al qaeda deputy issues warning of more attacks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fuelling fears of another terrorist strike , al qaeda leader osama bin laden 's right-hand man , ayman al-zawahiri , warned britain and the united states they would face more attacks , in a video broadcast thursday .
" these policies -lrb- of british prime minister tony blair -rrb- will bring them more destruction after the explosions of london , " he said in the footage , shown on the al-jazeera satellite channel . zawahiri also threatened the united states with " horror that would make them forget the horror they saw in vietnam , " referring to the war in that country . four weeks ago on july 7 , a nightmare came true for britons when four suicide bombers blew themselves up on three underground trains and a double-decker bus , killing 52 people and injuring hundreds more . a fortnight later , another gang apparently tried to carry out a copycat atrocity that backfired when their bombs failed to detonate properly . britain 's worst terror scourge has sparked an unprecedented manhunt that has resulted in scores of arrests both here and overseas . first july 21 suspect remanded in custody bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a judge thursday ordered the first suspect to be charged in britain in connection with the july 21 attacks to be remanded in custody until a further hearing on august 11 . ismael abdurahman , 23 , is charged with failing to disclose information to police about a man suspected of trying to blow up a train in shepherd 's bush , west london .
that suspect , hamdi issac , was arrested in rome last week . abdurahman did not enter a formal plea but his lawyer ann faul said he denied any connections to terrorism .
" i have been instructed to tell the court he is , and will be , vigorously contesting this charge and that he has no involvement in any terrorist activity whatsoever , " she said . abdurahman was arrested on july 28 in south london and faces a maximum sentence of five years in prison if convicted .
the man is not one of the four key suspects accused of carrying out the operation , whose pictures were released after the abortive bombings . extensive manhunt getting results bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the british authorities are holding a total of 14 people in custody in relation to the attacks , including three of the suspected would-be bombers , while hamdi issac , a fourth bomb suspect , is held in italy and is due to face an extradition hearing on august 17 . in a fast-moving international investigation , zambia announced wednesday that it would deport haroon aswat , the alleged mastermind behind london 's first attacks on july 7 , who was arrested in the capital lusaka two weeks ago . back in london , commuters and tourists were putting on a brave face despite jitters about another attack . london jittery as thursday comes round again bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " it is the first thing i thought of this morning - it is thursday , something is bound to happen because it is thursday , " said rosemary gajlmal , 20 , a waitress at a bagel restaurant in central london , as she stepped off one of the capital 's red buses , which was full of passengers . plenty of people were also using the underground network , which ran an almost normal service for the first time since the july 7 bombings with the piccadilly line fully restored and a limited service on the circle line . passenger numbers on the subway have plunged 30 percent at weekends and between five to 15 percent on weekdays since the july 7 bombings . but transport for london said this was largely due to some of the network being out of action , and predicted that levels would soon return to normal . reports that the the families of victims killed in the july 7 attacks will be eligible for up to 16,000 euros -lrb- $ 20,000 -rrb- in government compensation have been met by derision by british victims ' groups who say the compensation is far too little . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the home office confirmed the reports and added that those most seriously injured in the blasts will be eligible for up to 360,000 euros , a spokeswoman for told afp .
the sums compare with around $ 2 million paid out by the us government to families of those killed in the sept .

they will be joined by an equal number of monitors from the association of southeast asian nations -lrb- asean -rrb- . indonesia and gam tentatively reached a deal on july 17 to end almost 30 years of war , in which close to 15,000 people have died .
their pact includes the disarmament of rebels and a troop withdrawal from aceh . the pact is due to be signed on august 15 in helsinki - two days before the 60th anniversary of indonesian independence .

" we 're offering our support for the peace process , and we 'll try to accommodate the wishes of the indonesian government . " however , it 's questionable whether all the wishes of the indonesian side can really be fulfilled .
indonesia 's military chief , endriartono sutarto , has requested that soldiers should be included among the monitors , in order to be able to react immediately should an emergency arise .
the eu framework , though , expressly excludes a military component from this type of mission . risk of failure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two soldiers guard the baiturrahman mosque on election day , in sept .

there 's considerable danger that not only gam hardliners , but also those within the indonesian military , could quickly foil the aims of the peace mission .

when one looks at the political development of lafontaine , i do n't think it 's fair to speak of a rightist leaning or an attempt to court rightist voters .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 04.08.2005 eu to send peace monitors to aceh großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : disarmament and a withdrawal of troops should bring peace to aceh the eu is sending a peace monitoring mission to asia for the first time to observe a pact to end decades of civil war in indonesia 's aceh province .
but their mandate is still unclear . around 100 unarmed military and civilian officials from the european union will monitor the implementation of a peace pact between the indonesian government and the separatist free aceh movement -lrb- gam -rrb- .
they will be joined by an equal number of monitors from the association of southeast asian nations -lrb- asean -rrb- . indonesia and gam tentatively reached a deal on july 17 to end almost 30 years of war , in which close to 15,000 people have died .
their pact includes the disarmament of rebels and a troop withdrawal from aceh . the pact is due to be signed on august 15 in helsinki - two days before the 60th anniversary of indonesian independence .
a 28-strong team of european and southeast asian officials visited banda aceh this week to make logistical preparations for the monitoring mission , which could begin shortly after the pact is signed . but the mission has so far only been defined in general terms .
a protocol of measures to take should the pact be violated has not been agreed on , nor has the length of the mission .
these and other details are expected to be addressed in the coming weeks . no reconstruction without peace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a local volunteer walks past a wall graffiti ' good by -lrb- e -rrb- banda aceh ' on a shop shutter in january in banda aceh , indonesia aceh was particularly hard hit by last december 's tsunami , and one could expect that the vast amount of reconstruction work still to be done might take precedence over the peace accord .
but the former eu representative in jakarta , ana maria gomes , said the accord ca n't wait . " we 're of the opinion that it 's only through an acceleration of the peace process that the reconstruction process can really begin to move forward , " gomes said .
" we 're offering our support for the peace process , and we 'll try to accommodate the wishes of the indonesian government . " however , it 's questionable whether all the wishes of the indonesian side can really be fulfilled .
indonesia 's military chief , endriartono sutarto , has requested that soldiers should be included among the monitors , in order to be able to react immediately should an emergency arise .
the eu framework , though , expressly excludes a military component from this type of mission . risk of failure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two soldiers guard the baiturrahman mosque on election day , in sept .
2004 , in banda aceh , indonesia generally the impression from jakarta is that it 's not overly keen to see the start of the international mission .
there 's considerable danger that not only gam hardliners , but also those within the indonesian military , could quickly foil the aims of the peace mission .
it would n't be the first time : in 2002 , a dozen observers from thailand and the philippines watched over a short-lived truce that ended as the spiral of violence grew out of control . the hope this time is that the aftermath of the devastating tsunami in indonesia will be enough to convince both sides in the aceh conflict to give peace - and reconstruction - a chance . tobias grote-beverborg -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tsunami relief all positive government says around five months after the tsunami disaster in south asia , berlin presented an optimistic preliminary report .

how dangerous is it for the social democrats ?
is the left party 's new front man , oskar lafontaine , wooing right wing voters ?
a political scientist offers answers . the political scientist and party researcher klaus detterbeck teaches at the institute for political science at the university of magdeburg . dw-world : what chances do you give the new leftist alliance in the expedited bundestag elections ? klaus detterbeck : i would put the chances relatively high .
i would , however , differentiate between a short-term success for the bundestag elections , and the long-term perspective , which i view more critically .
in the short-term , the party has the opportunity to fill a vacuum which exists in the current competition between the parties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators protesting in berlin against social welfare cuts for the voters in western germany there has been no outlet to express frustrations with reform of the social welfare system , the effects of market liberalization .
here the party is filling a gap .
in the long-term i see the problem that the alliance parties are actually quite heterogeneous , that both at the grassroots as well as the leadership level there are significant differences between the labor union members in the west and the old pds -lrb- party of democratic socialism , the successor of the communist party of east germany -rrb- cadre in the east .
the differences will be difficult to reconcile , both for the party platform and the political goals .
what brings the groups together is the protest against social reforms .
in the longer-term they will have a falling out . so the left party is a protest party ?
what will define their constituency ? in the west it will doubtless be the disaffected stalwarts of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , just that unionized milieu from which the spd drew its base over decades .
in the east it will be the old pds voters coming from various societal groupings .
on the one side there is thus the protest voter trying to prevent the east from being treated as second-class , but there is also the old gdr cadre .
it will definitely be a protest party .
when we look to other countries , for example to spain or sweden , we also see similar leftist groupings , also heterogeneous , drawing their members from communists , greens , and leftist activists .
they feed off of the protest against modernization and the liberalization of the welfare state . there it functions on a long-term basis ... yes , since it has to do with very pragmatic , loose alliances , which for the most part remain separate from one another and only come together for the election .
this just wo n't work in germany .
the left party has to position itself .
after the election , problems will surely develop , and so i see little chance that the party will remain together . is the spd seriously threatened by this new alliance ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no longer guaranteed spd voters the spd will definitely suffer losses at its base , the unionized milieu - voters who may not have gone to the polls had this party not materialized .
they must see their chance to express their anger and disappointment with the spd government , a chance to make their frustration known .
this is without doubt a threat for the spd . is the spd responding appropriately to this threat by attempting to slander the new alliance ? the spd has always assumed it was the voice of the left , the voice of the traditional organized labor in the broadest sense .
now there has been for a long , long time a serious competition here .
and the spd shows an allergic reaction and is flip-flopping : on the one hand , it is trying to restore its social competence , the intention to more strongly articulate social justice .
on the other hand they are trying to portray the new alliance as illegitimate .
this is bound to come off badly for those voters disappointed by the schröder government and will motivate them to keep their distance from the spd .
the spd 's strategy is thus not exactly helping them to woo back their base .
but it is difficult to imagine what the spd 's options are at this point . continue reading to find out whether lafontaine is fishing for voters on the extreme right . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de social justice or economic folly ?

but environmental groups themselves are n't so sure . germans who own a car ca n't avoid the fact that 65 cents -lrb- $ 0.80 -rrb- of every euro that goes into their fuel tank flows into state coffers in the form of various energy taxes . it may be a high price to pay in a country that prides itself on its environmentally-friendly policies .
but according to tanja loitz of climate seeks protection , a program supported by the german environment ministry , there are ways to help the environment and save money at the same time .
" most people do not know that most household co2 emissions come from heating , " she said , explaining why one of the campaign 's goals is to reduce the 120 million tons of annual household co2 emissions .
" there is not a lack of interest in the environment , but a lack of factual knowledge . "

in fact , 74 percent of germans rate protecting the environment as very important , according to a recent study conducted by pollster forsa .
at the same time , most of those surveyed were of different opinions when it came to the question of what could be done about it .
" consumers certainly find the topic interesting , but are only willing to become involved in small degrees if it affects their wallets , " said moritz lehmkuhl , head of climate partner , an organization that tries to raise awareness of climate change among businesses and the public .
" the idea that they should save money and shop for bargains still dominates among consumers . "
who should be held responsible ?
he agreed with loitz on the importance of individual participation if there is a chance of achieving the kyoto protocol 's goals of reducing greenhouse gasses by 5 percent of 1990 levels before 2012 , and that the best way to get people 's attention is by saying it will save them money .
environmental groups also say that minimizing monetary concerns is an effective way of changing daily habits . but some would like to see the government make polluting more costly instead of relying on people to be voluntarily more concerned about their surroundings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friends of the earth germany " people who voluntarily take part are already very environmentally conscious and think about their actions , " said markus steigenberger of friends of the earth germany .
" i do not think voluntary action programs have a large effect on the general population . "
the alternative of legal coercion , however , is not an effective way to make people responsible for their actions , lehmkuhl argued .
" taxes have a negative aftertaste , and with voluntary initiatives you can achieve something extra , " he said .
" it is important to show that people can personally do something . "
climate partner recommends consumers make online purchases through climate friends , a portal that invests sales commissions - exactly how much depends on company specific deals - in sustainable , climate-neutral projects around the world .
legislation more effective bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the average german produces about 11 tons of co2 a year steinberger of friends of the earth said that people who actually use these services to make up for the 11 tons of co2 the average german produces annually are doing the right thing and added that raising environmental awareness is crucial .
at the same time , legislation is the best way to help the environment , he said .
" we need defined goals and legislation that lets business and people act in a climate-friendly way and makes pollution expensive , " steinberger said .
climate seeks protection 's loitz suggests that the most effective laws would focus on rewarding those who prevent pollution rather than doling out punishments for those who cause it .
while environmental groups continue work to get stricter laws enacted and enforced , and climate seeks protection and climate partner continue their voluntary programs , all the groups maintain that increasing the environmental consciousness that keeps greenhouse gasses from being produced is necessary .

but according to tanja loitz of climate seeks protection , a program supported by the german environment ministry , there are ways to help the environment and save money at the same time .
" most people do not know that most household co2 emissions come from heating , " she said , explaining why one of the campaign 's goals is to reduce the 120 million tons of annual household co2 emissions .
" there is not a lack of interest in the environment , but a lack of factual knowledge . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : home heating releases the most household greenhouse gasses raising awareness by saving money if the numerous recycling programs across the country are any indication , germans already tend to be an environmentally-conscious bunch .
in fact , 74 percent of germans rate protecting the environment as very important , according to a recent study conducted by pollster forsa .
at the same time , most of those surveyed were of different opinions when it came to the question of what could be done about it .
" consumers certainly find the topic interesting , but are only willing to become involved in small degrees if it affects their wallets , " said moritz lehmkuhl , head of climate partner , an organization that tries to raise awareness of climate change among businesses and the public .
" the idea that they should save money and shop for bargains still dominates among consumers . "
who should be held responsible ?
he agreed with loitz on the importance of individual participation if there is a chance of achieving the kyoto protocol 's goals of reducing greenhouse gasses by 5 percent of 1990 levels before 2012 , and that the best way to get people 's attention is by saying it will save them money .
environmental groups also say that minimizing monetary concerns is an effective way of changing daily habits . but some would like to see the government make polluting more costly instead of relying on people to be voluntarily more concerned about their surroundings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friends of the earth germany " people who voluntarily take part are already very environmentally conscious and think about their actions , " said markus steigenberger of friends of the earth germany .
" i do not think voluntary action programs have a large effect on the general population . "
the alternative of legal coercion , however , is not an effective way to make people responsible for their actions , lehmkuhl argued .
" taxes have a negative aftertaste , and with voluntary initiatives you can achieve something extra , " he said .
" it is important to show that people can personally do something . "
climate partner recommends consumers make online purchases through climate friends , a portal that invests sales commissions - exactly how much depends on company specific deals - in sustainable , climate-neutral projects around the world .
legislation more effective bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the average german produces about 11 tons of co2 a year steinberger of friends of the earth said that people who actually use these services to make up for the 11 tons of co2 the average german produces annually are doing the right thing and added that raising environmental awareness is crucial .
at the same time , legislation is the best way to help the environment , he said .
" we need defined goals and legislation that lets business and people act in a climate-friendly way and makes pollution expensive , " steinberger said .
climate seeks protection 's loitz suggests that the most effective laws would focus on rewarding those who prevent pollution rather than doling out punishments for those who cause it .
while environmental groups continue work to get stricter laws enacted and enforced , and climate seeks protection and climate partner continue their voluntary programs , all the groups maintain that increasing the environmental consciousness that keeps greenhouse gasses from being produced is necessary .
there is , after all , no way to get co2 back in the bottle once it 's emitted . sean sinico , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de goal for germany and the environment in just over 13 months , millions of soccer fans will descend on germany for the world cup .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 04.08.2005 eu calls for emergency un meeting on iran großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things have deteriorated between the eu and iran over recent weeks mahmoud ahmadinejad faces the possibility of being brought before the un 's nuclear watchdog in his first week as iran 's president after the eu called for emergency talks on the islamic republic 's atomic program . european diplomats have asked for an emergency meeting of the un atomic agency next tuesday in order to keep pressure on iran not to resume sensitive nuclear fuel cycle work , diplomats said thursday .
the news comes as iran 's new president mahmoud ahmadinejad faces up to tough decisions as he takes over the running of the islamic republic on thursday with the most pressing issue being the diplomatic stand-off with the european union and the united states which he inherited from his predecessor . the former revolutionary guard began his first day in office on thursday but the work of his government begins after saturday , the day he takes the oath of office and announces his cabinet . this weekend is likely to see the new president thrust into a row which could lead to un sanctions if iran does not back down from its threat to restart nuclear work which the europeans and americans suspect might be aimed at building an atomic bomb . on wednesday , iran announced that it would back off its threat to resume suspended uranium conversion activities , a move that was welcomed by the united states .
tehran had said it planned to resume the controversial fuel-cycle work this week but later signaled it would delay the start until saturday , in effect giving more time for diplomacy . new president but no new foreign policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even with ahmadinejad at the reins , there is no guarantee that iran will become a more diplomatic partner in the future .
the new president 's choices will continue to be determined by deference to supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei , iran 's most powerful figure . " he has to consult with the supreme leader , " said an unnamed political analyst in an interview with reuters .
" he came to power with the hardliners ' backing , now he has to satisfy them . " iran 's chief nuclear negotiator hassan rohani , who could be replaced by ahmadinejad , told state television there would be no policy change under any new negotiating team .
" iran 's nuclear policy is ... decided by top officials .
it will not be changed . "
local media have said former state broadcasting chief ali larijani , a hardliner close to the ayatollah , would replace rohani and take charge of the nuclear negotiations with the eu . us encouraged by decision to delay enrichment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nevertheless , the delay in restarting enrichment has given the us in particular cause for hope .
" it certainly is a positive thing that the steps that the iranians had previously suggested they would take have not occurred , " spokesman tom casey told reporters . the united states and its european allies have made clear that any move to restart fuel-cycle activities suspended under an accord struck in november could force them to seek possible un sanctions again iran .
" if they 've heeded those calls , that 's a good thing , " casey told the daily state department briefing . the iranian move gives britain , france and germany time to finalize a new package of economic and security incentives they had been working on to persuade tehran to renounce its enrichment program . a state department official , who asked not to be named , said the europeans had informed washington they would unveil the package over the weekend , perhaps as early as friday .
he gave no other details . iran reiterates nuclear desire to europeans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's isfahan nuclear facility .
but iran has said it remains determined to resume its uranium conversion work at the isfahan plant .
the process is the first step in the cycle to produce fuel for nuclear reactors . in a letter sent to the foreign ministers of the eu-3 on tuesday , hassan rowhani said this " inalienable right can not be the subject of arbitrary and subjective criteria . " " your side has continued to refrain from responding substantively to our proposals , in whole or even in part .
we intend to take a minimal step , " the letter said .
" the islamic republic of iran stringently desires a negotiated resumption of its enrichment activities and is prepared to continue in good faith and in an expeditious and result-oriented manner its negotiations , " it said . the so-called eu-3 were reportedly ready to offer the iranians guaranteed fuel for a nuclear power plant they are building at bushehr and others they may build further down the road .
the package was also expected to include trade benefits , including civilian aircraft and parts iran badly needs , help in joining the world trade organization and a promise to bring tehran into regional security talks . eu , us still at odds over iran deal the united states was initially skeptical about the european initiative to negotiate with iran but changed tack in march and agreed to back the effort .
still , speculation has persisted about potential differences in the us and european positions . the europeans have reportedly flirted with the idea of allowing iran to retain some limited civilian nuclear capacity .
the americans have insisted iran completely halt its fuel cycle work and dismantle its facilities . but the us administration insisted it was on the same page with its trans-atlantic allies as they prepared to make what could be a last-ditch offer to the iranians .
" it would be pretty hard for us to support a process , including the proposals in it , based on things we had n't seen and we had n't agreed with , " said the state department official . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu voices concern for iran nuclear talks eu leaders face an uncertain future in their negotiations with iran over its nuclear program following the election of ultra-conservative president mahmoud ahmadinejad , even warning the talks could be frozen .
-lrb- june 26 , 2005 -rrb- iran may defy eu nuclear suspension deal iran is unhappy with the progress of nuclear negotiations with the european union and may resume uranium conversion activities next week in defiance of a key agreement , senior officials warned saturday .
-lrb- april 30 , 2005 -rrb- us , europe aligned on iran nuke incentives while the europeans talked tough on wednesday , calling for more transparency from iran in its nuclear activities , the us announced that it may back europe 's incentive-based negotiations with tehran .

but their mandate is still unclear . around 100 unarmed military and civilian officials from the european union will monitor the implementation of a peace pact between the indonesian government and the separatist free aceh movement -lrb- gam -rrb- .
they will be joined by an equal number of monitors from the association of southeast asian nations -lrb- asean -rrb- . indonesia and gam tentatively reached a deal on july 17 to end almost 30 years of war , in which close to 15,000 people have died .
their pact includes the disarmament of rebels and a troop withdrawal from aceh . the pact is due to be signed on august 15 in helsinki - two days before the 60th anniversary of indonesian independence .
a 28-strong team of european and southeast asian officials visited banda aceh this week to make logistical preparations for the monitoring mission , which could begin shortly after the pact is signed . but the mission has so far only been defined in general terms .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : home heating releases the most household greenhouse gasses raising awareness by saving money if the numerous recycling programs across the country are any indication , germans already tend to be an environmentally-conscious bunch .
in fact , 74 percent of germans rate protecting the environment as very important , according to a recent study conducted by pollster forsa .

at the same time , legislation is the best way to help the environment , he said .
" we need defined goals and legislation that lets business and people act in a climate-friendly way and makes pollution expensive , " steinberger said .
climate seeks protection 's loitz suggests that the most effective laws would focus on rewarding those who prevent pollution rather than doling out punishments for those who cause it .
while environmental groups continue work to get stricter laws enacted and enforced , and climate seeks protection and climate partner continue their voluntary programs , all the groups maintain that increasing the environmental consciousness that keeps greenhouse gasses from being produced is necessary .

how dangerous is it for the social democrats ?
is the left party 's new front man , oskar lafontaine , wooing right wing voters ?
a political scientist offers answers . the political scientist and party researcher klaus detterbeck teaches at the institute for political science at the university of magdeburg . dw-world : what chances do you give the new leftist alliance in the expedited bundestag elections ? klaus detterbeck : i would put the chances relatively high .
i would , however , differentiate between a short-term success for the bundestag elections , and the long-term perspective , which i view more critically .
in the short-term , the party has the opportunity to fill a vacuum which exists in the current competition between the parties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators protesting in berlin against social welfare cuts for the voters in western germany there has been no outlet to express frustrations with reform of the social welfare system , the effects of market liberalization .
here the party is filling a gap .
in the long-term i see the problem that the alliance parties are actually quite heterogeneous , that both at the grassroots as well as the leadership level there are significant differences between the labor union members in the west and the old pds -lrb- party of democratic socialism , the successor of the communist party of east germany -rrb- cadre in the east .
the differences will be difficult to reconcile , both for the party platform and the political goals .
what brings the groups together is the protest against social reforms .
in the longer-term they will have a falling out . so the left party is a protest party ?
what will define their constituency ? in the west it will doubtless be the disaffected stalwarts of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , just that unionized milieu from which the spd drew its base over decades .
in the east it will be the old pds voters coming from various societal groupings .
on the one side there is thus the protest voter trying to prevent the east from being treated as second-class , but there is also the old gdr cadre .
it will definitely be a protest party .
when we look to other countries , for example to spain or sweden , we also see similar leftist groupings , also heterogeneous , drawing their members from communists , greens , and leftist activists .
they feed off of the protest against modernization and the liberalization of the welfare state . there it functions on a long-term basis ... yes , since it has to do with very pragmatic , loose alliances , which for the most part remain separate from one another and only come together for the election .
this just wo n't work in germany .
the left party has to position itself .
after the election , problems will surely develop , and so i see little chance that the party will remain together . is the spd seriously threatened by this new alliance ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no longer guaranteed spd voters the spd will definitely suffer losses at its base , the unionized milieu - voters who may not have gone to the polls had this party not materialized .
they must see their chance to express their anger and disappointment with the spd government , a chance to make their frustration known .
this is without doubt a threat for the spd . is the spd responding appropriately to this threat by attempting to slander the new alliance ? the spd has always assumed it was the voice of the left , the voice of the traditional organized labor in the broadest sense .
now there has been for a long , long time a serious competition here .
and the spd shows an allergic reaction and is flip-flopping : on the one hand , it is trying to restore its social competence , the intention to more strongly articulate social justice .
on the other hand they are trying to portray the new alliance as illegitimate .
this is bound to come off badly for those voters disappointed by the schröder government and will motivate them to keep their distance from the spd .
the spd 's strategy is thus not exactly helping them to woo back their base .
but it is difficult to imagine what the spd 's options are at this point . continue reading to find out whether lafontaine is fishing for voters on the extreme right . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de social justice or economic folly ?
the new hard-left grouping in germany , the left party , is sending tremors across the political landscape .

how dangerous is it for the social democrats ?
is the left party 's new front man , oskar lafontaine , wooing right wing voters ?
a political scientist offers answers . the political scientist and party researcher klaus detterbeck teaches at the institute for political science at the university of magdeburg . dw-world : what chances do you give the new leftist alliance in the expedited bundestag elections ? klaus detterbeck : i would put the chances relatively high .
i would , however , differentiate between a short-term success for the bundestag elections , and the long-term perspective , which i view more critically .
in the short-term , the party has the opportunity to fill a vacuum which exists in the current competition between the parties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators protesting in berlin against social welfare cuts for the voters in western germany there has been no outlet to express frustrations with reform of the social welfare system , the effects of market liberalization .
here the party is filling a gap .
in the long-term i see the problem that the alliance parties are actually quite heterogeneous , that both at the grassroots as well as the leadership level there are significant differences between the labor union members in the west and the old pds -lrb- party of democratic socialism , the successor of the communist party of east germany -rrb- cadre in the east .
the differences will be difficult to reconcile , both for the party platform and the political goals .
what brings the groups together is the protest against social reforms .
in the longer-term they will have a falling out . so the left party is a protest party ?
what will define their constituency ? in the west it will doubtless be the disaffected stalwarts of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , just that unionized milieu from which the spd drew its base over decades .
in the east it will be the old pds voters coming from various societal groupings .
on the one side there is thus the protest voter trying to prevent the east from being treated as second-class , but there is also the old gdr cadre .
it will definitely be a protest party .
when we look to other countries , for example to spain or sweden , we also see similar leftist groupings , also heterogeneous , drawing their members from communists , greens , and leftist activists .
they feed off of the protest against modernization and the liberalization of the welfare state . there it functions on a long-term basis ... yes , since it has to do with very pragmatic , loose alliances , which for the most part remain separate from one another and only come together for the election .
this just wo n't work in germany .
the left party has to position itself .
after the election , problems will surely develop , and so i see little chance that the party will remain together . is the spd seriously threatened by this new alliance ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no longer guaranteed spd voters the spd will definitely suffer losses at its base , the unionized milieu - voters who may not have gone to the polls had this party not materialized .
they must see their chance to express their anger and disappointment with the spd government , a chance to make their frustration known .
this is without doubt a threat for the spd . is the spd responding appropriately to this threat by attempting to slander the new alliance ? the spd has always assumed it was the voice of the left , the voice of the traditional organized labor in the broadest sense .
now there has been for a long , long time a serious competition here .
and the spd shows an allergic reaction and is flip-flopping : on the one hand , it is trying to restore its social competence , the intention to more strongly articulate social justice .
on the other hand they are trying to portray the new alliance as illegitimate .
this is bound to come off badly for those voters disappointed by the schröder government and will motivate them to keep their distance from the spd .
the spd 's strategy is thus not exactly helping them to woo back their base .
but it is difficult to imagine what the spd 's options are at this point . continue reading to find out whether lafontaine is fishing for voters on the extreme right . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de social justice or economic folly ?

is this justified ? the party is certainly populist in the sense that they rail against change and modernization without really wanting to , or rather being able to say , what they would do differently .
it is a party that wants to excite tempers and encourage protest without being able to give answers .
one could say that this is not necessarily the role of a new opposition party .
it is a chance to express protest and it can lead the established parties to reconsider certain issues . gregor gysi and oskar lafontaine , the former spd chief , will act together as top candidates .
lafontaine in particular has been attacked by the spd and the greens .
he was given the epithet of " german haider -lrb- austria 's right-wing populist politician -rrb- , " fishing for votes on the extreme right .
what do you think of this accusation ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jörg haider recently split from the populist freedom party he founded and started a new right-wing alliance no , in my opinion you ca n't look at it that way .
the charge goes back to a speech lafontaine made , in which he spoke of " alien workers , " a concept from the rightist camp .
when one looks at the political development of lafontaine , i do n't think it 's fair to speak of a rightist leaning or an attempt to court rightist voters .
lafontaine has always been a nonconformist , someone who has always taken positions not directly in line with that of his party .
he is continuing with this .
so the comparison with haider is not justified . but does lafontaine really offer any sensible remedies ? lafontaine has , since his retreat from the federal government , been constantly appealing to the public , whether in publications or in talk shows , spreading his view of things - that is , a state control of the globalized economy .
he has time and again been criticized , that his solutions are completely unrealistic .
for himself and for the groupings he stands for , this is a reasonable answer to globalization .
it is , however , in the current situation , no adequate response .
it is impossible to see how a strong governmental , national control could be implemented at the european level .
should lafontaine be asked to implement his policies in the real world , then his alliance would really dissolve quite quickly .
but as an opposition party , as a protest party , such goals are legitimate .
it is an opportunity for disgruntled voters to express that they do not agree with the course and the pace of the reforms .
thus the party fulfills a democratic function . steffen leidel interviewed klaus detterbeck -lrb- jc -rrb- back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de social justice or economic folly ?

china and the us have agreed to work together to try and prevent the expansion of the united nations security council to include a further six permanent seats , including one for germany . the contentious bid to enlarge the security council led by germany , japan , brazil and india , collectively known as the group of four or g4 , has met with steady resistance from both washington and beijing over the past months , but their joining forces to block the move is a departure which will likely further dilute any chance of the plan 's success .
speaking after a meeting with his newly-appointed us counterpart , john bolton , in new york , china 's un ambassador , wang guangya said they had agreed on a way to proceed together . " at this stage , i think our objective will be to oppose the g4 , to make sure that they do not have sufficient votes to risk dividing the house , " he said . expansion without division wang stated that the g4 plan would drive a wedge through the 191 un member states , adding that the ultimate objective of both the us and china was expansion without division . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : g4 foreign ministers " we agreed to work together to make sure that our interests are being maintained , which means that we have to work in parallel ways to see that the unity of the un members , the unity of every regional group will not be spoiled because of this maneuver and process , " he added . painfully slow process the issue of reforming the security council , which still reflects the power structure in the aftermath of wwii , has been on the un agenda for several years , but it has so far proved impossible to reach any agreement on exactly how it should be expanded . earlier this year , un secretary general kofi annan told member states that he wanted a decision before a summit of world leaders in september . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united nations general secretary kofi annan there are currently 15 council seats , just five of which are permanent .
the g4 resolution calls for the addition of six new permanent seats without the power of veto , and four non-permanent ones . germany , japan , brazil and india have earmarked four of the six seats for themselves and the remaining two for african nations .
egypt , nigeria and south africa are the leading contenders . bidding for african support heads of state and representatives of the 53-nation african union -lrb- au -rrb- are meeting in the ethiopian capital of addis ababa on thursday to try and reach a common position on the g4 expansion resolution , but there is little hope that the summit will produce any consensus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flags of the african union algeria 's un ambassador , abdallah baali , warned against any expectation of the meeting producing a unified position , " despite efforts to accommodate the g4 . "
delegates from the four aspirant countries are also there to drum up support for their cause . if their resolution is to have any chance of winning the two-thirds majority in a un general assembly vote , the g4 nations will need the support of the african union . for its part , the au is calling for the expansion of the council to 26 seats , with a total of seven new permanent seats with veto rights . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us reportedly opposed to berlin 's un bid us secretary of state condoleezza rice reportedly is opposed to germany 's bid for a permanent seat on the un security council .

china and the us have agreed to work together to try and prevent the expansion of the united nations security council to include a further six permanent seats , including one for germany . the contentious bid to enlarge the security council led by germany , japan , brazil and india , collectively known as the group of four or g4 , has met with steady resistance from both washington and beijing over the past months , but their joining forces to block the move is a departure which will likely further dilute any chance of the plan 's success .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de election 2005 -pipe- 04.08.2005 " lafontaine is not a german haider " 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from spd leader to spd enemy : oskar lafontaine how strong is germany 's new leftist alliance ?
how dangerous is it for the social democrats ?
is the left party 's new front man , oskar lafontaine , wooing right wing voters ?
a political scientist offers answers . the political scientist and party researcher klaus detterbeck teaches at the institute for political science at the university of magdeburg . dw-world : what chances do you give the new leftist alliance in the expedited bundestag elections ? klaus detterbeck : i would put the chances relatively high .
i would , however , differentiate between a short-term success for the bundestag elections , and the long-term perspective , which i view more critically .
in the short-term , the party has the opportunity to fill a vacuum which exists in the current competition between the parties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators protesting in berlin against social welfare cuts for the voters in western germany there has been no outlet to express frustrations with reform of the social welfare system , the effects of market liberalization .
here the party is filling a gap .
in the long-term i see the problem that the alliance parties are actually quite heterogeneous , that both at the grassroots as well as the leadership level there are significant differences between the labor union members in the west and the old pds -lrb- party of democratic socialism , the successor of the communist party of east germany -rrb- cadre in the east .
the differences will be difficult to reconcile , both for the party platform and the political goals .
what brings the groups together is the protest against social reforms .
in the longer-term they will have a falling out . so the left party is a protest party ?
what will define their constituency ? in the west it will doubtless be the disaffected stalwarts of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , just that unionized milieu from which the spd drew its base over decades .
in the east it will be the old pds voters coming from various societal groupings .
on the one side there is thus the protest voter trying to prevent the east from being treated as second-class , but there is also the old gdr cadre .
it will definitely be a protest party .
when we look to other countries , for example to spain or sweden , we also see similar leftist groupings , also heterogeneous , drawing their members from communists , greens , and leftist activists .
they feed off of the protest against modernization and the liberalization of the welfare state . there it functions on a long-term basis ... yes , since it has to do with very pragmatic , loose alliances , which for the most part remain separate from one another and only come together for the election .
this just wo n't work in germany .
the left party has to position itself .
after the election , problems will surely develop , and so i see little chance that the party will remain together . is the spd seriously threatened by this new alliance ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no longer guaranteed spd voters the spd will definitely suffer losses at its base , the unionized milieu - voters who may not have gone to the polls had this party not materialized .
they must see their chance to express their anger and disappointment with the spd government , a chance to make their frustration known .
this is without doubt a threat for the spd . is the spd responding appropriately to this threat by attempting to slander the new alliance ? the spd has always assumed it was the voice of the left , the voice of the traditional organized labor in the broadest sense .
now there has been for a long , long time a serious competition here .
and the spd shows an allergic reaction and is flip-flopping : on the one hand , it is trying to restore its social competence , the intention to more strongly articulate social justice .
on the other hand they are trying to portray the new alliance as illegitimate .
this is bound to come off badly for those voters disappointed by the schröder government and will motivate them to keep their distance from the spd .
the spd 's strategy is thus not exactly helping them to woo back their base .
but it is difficult to imagine what the spd 's options are at this point . continue reading to find out whether lafontaine is fishing for voters on the extreme right . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de social justice or economic folly ?
the new hard-left grouping in germany , the left party , is sending tremors across the political landscape .
but , the party 's economic program has industry groups and economists shaking their heads , and worrying .
-lrb- aug .
3 , 2005 -rrb- the comeback kid former spd chairman oskar lafontaine has had a tumultuous career in politics , withdrawing twice from the limelight in the past three decades .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de election 2005 -pipe- 04.08.2005 " lafontaine is not a german haider " back to first page back 2/2 many are calling the new alliance populist .
is this justified ? the party is certainly populist in the sense that they rail against change and modernization without really wanting to , or rather being able to say , what they would do differently .
it is a party that wants to excite tempers and encourage protest without being able to give answers .
one could say that this is not necessarily the role of a new opposition party .
it is a chance to express protest and it can lead the established parties to reconsider certain issues . gregor gysi and oskar lafontaine , the former spd chief , will act together as top candidates .
lafontaine in particular has been attacked by the spd and the greens .
he was given the epithet of " german haider -lrb- austria 's right-wing populist politician -rrb- , " fishing for votes on the extreme right .
what do you think of this accusation ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jörg haider recently split from the populist freedom party he founded and started a new right-wing alliance no , in my opinion you ca n't look at it that way .
the charge goes back to a speech lafontaine made , in which he spoke of " alien workers , " a concept from the rightist camp .
when one looks at the political development of lafontaine , i do n't think it 's fair to speak of a rightist leaning or an attempt to court rightist voters .
lafontaine has always been a nonconformist , someone who has always taken positions not directly in line with that of his party .
he is continuing with this .
so the comparison with haider is not justified . but does lafontaine really offer any sensible remedies ? lafontaine has , since his retreat from the federal government , been constantly appealing to the public , whether in publications or in talk shows , spreading his view of things - that is , a state control of the globalized economy .
he has time and again been criticized , that his solutions are completely unrealistic .
for himself and for the groupings he stands for , this is a reasonable answer to globalization .
it is , however , in the current situation , no adequate response .
it is impossible to see how a strong governmental , national control could be implemented at the european level .
should lafontaine be asked to implement his policies in the real world , then his alliance would really dissolve quite quickly .
but as an opposition party , as a protest party , such goals are legitimate .
it is an opportunity for disgruntled voters to express that they do not agree with the course and the pace of the reforms .
thus the party fulfills a democratic function . steffen leidel interviewed klaus detterbeck -lrb- jc -rrb- back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de social justice or economic folly ?
the new hard-left grouping in germany , the left party , is sending tremors across the political landscape .
but , the party 's economic program has industry groups and economists shaking their heads , and worrying .
-lrb- aug .
3 , 2005 -rrb- the comeback kid former spd chairman oskar lafontaine has had a tumultuous career in politics , withdrawing twice from the limelight in the past three decades .
but this pugnacious and passionate " napoleon " is back for his waterloo .

however , some doubts remain . germany escaped legal action after the european commission ruled on thursday that while the lax system at the heart of the german visa scandal violated european union norms , berlin had since remedied the problem with a reformed policy that complies with eu rules . the scandal , for which foreign minister joschka fischer has accepted responsibility , revolves around the loose visa policies that allowed thousands of criminals and illegal workers , mainly from ukraine , to enter germany between 2000 and 2002 . commission spokesman friso roscam abbing told a news briefing that the german policy circular issued by fischer in 2000 , which the christian democrat opposition describes as an opening of " the floodgates to a wave of unsuitable migrants , " did not comply with a range of european directives or laws . fischer 's circular contravened eu laws " the 2000 -lrb- instruction -rrb- was not compatible with schengen law , with eu law , with the common consular instructions , " abbing said .
justice and security commissioner franco frattini added that the 2000 circular that was the basis for the easier policy " ran counter to the common consular instructions -lrb- cci -rrb- " . bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer passes the entrance of a parliamentary panel investigating the visa scandal in april . the directive from fischer 's office ordered german consulates , notably in eastern europe , to give applicants the benefit of the doubt if they could not fully justify their financial means of support or the purpose of their trip . however , after the german foreign ministry had been plunged into a crisis concerning the visas and a flood of migrants , the visa policy was amended to the satisfaction of the eu 's executive .
" an examination of the guiding circular of oct .
26 , 2004 ... leads to the conclusion that the breaches of the cci in the previous circulars have been remedied , " frattini said . breaches remedied but questions remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franco frattini , eu justice commissioner frattini did point out , however , that some points in the 2004 circular were unclear and would benefit from clarification , but these were not grounds to invalidate the german policy , he said . the german foreign ministry welcomed the commission 's assessment that the german rules now met eu requirements . the almost disastrous political lesson learnt by the germans showed that countries should be aware that there was no place for liberal interpretations in national legislation or instructions of common eu visa regulations adopted for the schengen passport-free travel area , frattini added . conservative lawmaker targets red-green coalition however , while the commission appeared to close the book on the incident , others were not so quick to let germany off the hook .
opposition german eu lawmaker jochim würmeling challenged the commission to investigate berlin 's new policies , claiming that these too were flawed . würmeling , who said that the commission ruling on germany 's current visa policy was " in no way a virtual acquittal , " explained that while there were still discrepancies between the german and the european rules on the burden of proof for visa applicants there was a " grave deviation " from eu law , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : calling the commission 's analysis of the 2000 rules " damning , " würmeling then turned on the social democratic-green coalition government saying that its attitude to the visa policy showed " just how crass this wrong decision taken by the government was . " " one gets the impression that the ... government was completely indifferent to what eu rules said about issuing visas , " he said . visa scandal to cast shadow over election würmeling intends to raise the issue again in an attempt to hold the german government accountable in a question time session with frattini when the eu parliament reconvenes in september , just two weeks before likely german elections . it could be perfect timing for the opposition parties in germany who have been hounding gerhard schröder 's government for months over the scandal . the visa affair has weakened the bond between the ruling coalition , with ministers forced to testify before a parliamentary commission of inquiry and blame being passed between parties and departments before fischer took the hit for the team . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de probe into visa affair must go on germany 's highest court on wednesday thwarted a bid by the embattled government to wrap up a parliamentary probe into what 's become known as the " visa affair " ahead of likely elections in september .

the news comes as iran 's new president mahmoud ahmadinejad faces up to tough decisions as he takes over the running of the islamic republic on thursday with the most pressing issue being the diplomatic stand-off with the european union and the united states which he inherited from his predecessor . the former revolutionary guard began his first day in office on thursday but the work of his government begins after saturday , the day he takes the oath of office and announces his cabinet . this weekend is likely to see the new president thrust into a row which could lead to un sanctions if iran does not back down from its threat to restart nuclear work which the europeans and americans suspect might be aimed at building an atomic bomb . on wednesday , iran announced that it would back off its threat to resume suspended uranium conversion activities , a move that was welcomed by the united states .
tehran had said it planned to resume the controversial fuel-cycle work this week but later signaled it would delay the start until saturday , in effect giving more time for diplomacy . new president but no new foreign policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even with ahmadinejad at the reins , there is no guarantee that iran will become a more diplomatic partner in the future .
the new president 's choices will continue to be determined by deference to supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei , iran 's most powerful figure . " he has to consult with the supreme leader , " said an unnamed political analyst in an interview with reuters .
" he came to power with the hardliners ' backing , now he has to satisfy them . " iran 's chief nuclear negotiator hassan rohani , who could be replaced by ahmadinejad , told state television there would be no policy change under any new negotiating team .
" iran 's nuclear policy is ... decided by top officials .
it will not be changed . "
local media have said former state broadcasting chief ali larijani , a hardliner close to the ayatollah , would replace rohani and take charge of the nuclear negotiations with the eu . us encouraged by decision to delay enrichment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nevertheless , the delay in restarting enrichment has given the us in particular cause for hope .
" it certainly is a positive thing that the steps that the iranians had previously suggested they would take have not occurred , " spokesman tom casey told reporters . the united states and its european allies have made clear that any move to restart fuel-cycle activities suspended under an accord struck in november could force them to seek possible un sanctions again iran .
" if they 've heeded those calls , that 's a good thing , " casey told the daily state department briefing . the iranian move gives britain , france and germany time to finalize a new package of economic and security incentives they had been working on to persuade tehran to renounce its enrichment program . a state department official , who asked not to be named , said the europeans had informed washington they would unveil the package over the weekend , perhaps as early as friday .
he gave no other details . iran reiterates nuclear desire to europeans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's isfahan nuclear facility .
but iran has said it remains determined to resume its uranium conversion work at the isfahan plant .
the process is the first step in the cycle to produce fuel for nuclear reactors . in a letter sent to the foreign ministers of the eu-3 on tuesday , hassan rowhani said this " inalienable right can not be the subject of arbitrary and subjective criteria . " " your side has continued to refrain from responding substantively to our proposals , in whole or even in part .
we intend to take a minimal step , " the letter said .
" the islamic republic of iran stringently desires a negotiated resumption of its enrichment activities and is prepared to continue in good faith and in an expeditious and result-oriented manner its negotiations , " it said . the so-called eu-3 were reportedly ready to offer the iranians guaranteed fuel for a nuclear power plant they are building at bushehr and others they may build further down the road .
the package was also expected to include trade benefits , including civilian aircraft and parts iran badly needs , help in joining the world trade organization and a promise to bring tehran into regional security talks . eu , us still at odds over iran deal the united states was initially skeptical about the european initiative to negotiate with iran but changed tack in march and agreed to back the effort .
still , speculation has persisted about potential differences in the us and european positions . the europeans have reportedly flirted with the idea of allowing iran to retain some limited civilian nuclear capacity .
the americans have insisted iran completely halt its fuel cycle work and dismantle its facilities . but the us administration insisted it was on the same page with its trans-atlantic allies as they prepared to make what could be a last-ditch offer to the iranians .
" it would be pretty hard for us to support a process , including the proposals in it , based on things we had n't seen and we had n't agreed with , " said the state department official . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu voices concern for iran nuclear talks eu leaders face an uncertain future in their negotiations with iran over its nuclear program following the election of ultra-conservative president mahmoud ahmadinejad , even warning the talks could be frozen .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de election 2005 -pipe- 04.08.2005 " lafontaine is not a german haider " back to first page back 2/2 many are calling the new alliance populist .
is this justified ? the party is certainly populist in the sense that they rail against change and modernization without really wanting to , or rather being able to say , what they would do differently .
it is a party that wants to excite tempers and encourage protest without being able to give answers .
one could say that this is not necessarily the role of a new opposition party .
it is a chance to express protest and it can lead the established parties to reconsider certain issues . gregor gysi and oskar lafontaine , the former spd chief , will act together as top candidates .
lafontaine in particular has been attacked by the spd and the greens .
he was given the epithet of " german haider -lrb- austria 's right-wing populist politician -rrb- , " fishing for votes on the extreme right .
what do you think of this accusation ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jörg haider recently split from the populist freedom party he founded and started a new right-wing alliance no , in my opinion you ca n't look at it that way .
the charge goes back to a speech lafontaine made , in which he spoke of " alien workers , " a concept from the rightist camp .
when one looks at the political development of lafontaine , i do n't think it 's fair to speak of a rightist leaning or an attempt to court rightist voters .
lafontaine has always been a nonconformist , someone who has always taken positions not directly in line with that of his party .
he is continuing with this .
so the comparison with haider is not justified . but does lafontaine really offer any sensible remedies ? lafontaine has , since his retreat from the federal government , been constantly appealing to the public , whether in publications or in talk shows , spreading his view of things - that is , a state control of the globalized economy .
he has time and again been criticized , that his solutions are completely unrealistic .
for himself and for the groupings he stands for , this is a reasonable answer to globalization .
it is , however , in the current situation , no adequate response .
it is impossible to see how a strong governmental , national control could be implemented at the european level .
should lafontaine be asked to implement his policies in the real world , then his alliance would really dissolve quite quickly .
but as an opposition party , as a protest party , such goals are legitimate .
it is an opportunity for disgruntled voters to express that they do not agree with the course and the pace of the reforms .
thus the party fulfills a democratic function . steffen leidel interviewed klaus detterbeck -lrb- jc -rrb- back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de social justice or economic folly ?
the new hard-left grouping in germany , the left party , is sending tremors across the political landscape .
but , the party 's economic program has industry groups and economists shaking their heads , and worrying .

3 , 2005 -rrb- the comeback kid former spd chairman oskar lafontaine has had a tumultuous career in politics , withdrawing twice from the limelight in the past three decades .

however , some doubts remain . germany escaped legal action after the european commission ruled on thursday that while the lax system at the heart of the german visa scandal violated european union norms , berlin had since remedied the problem with a reformed policy that complies with eu rules . the scandal , for which foreign minister joschka fischer has accepted responsibility , revolves around the loose visa policies that allowed thousands of criminals and illegal workers , mainly from ukraine , to enter germany between 2000 and 2002 . commission spokesman friso roscam abbing told a news briefing that the german policy circular issued by fischer in 2000 , which the christian democrat opposition describes as an opening of " the floodgates to a wave of unsuitable migrants , " did not comply with a range of european directives or laws . fischer 's circular contravened eu laws " the 2000 -lrb- instruction -rrb- was not compatible with schengen law , with eu law , with the common consular instructions , " abbing said .
justice and security commissioner franco frattini added that the 2000 circular that was the basis for the easier policy " ran counter to the common consular instructions -lrb- cci -rrb- " . bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer passes the entrance of a parliamentary panel investigating the visa scandal in april . the directive from fischer 's office ordered german consulates , notably in eastern europe , to give applicants the benefit of the doubt if they could not fully justify their financial means of support or the purpose of their trip . however , after the german foreign ministry had been plunged into a crisis concerning the visas and a flood of migrants , the visa policy was amended to the satisfaction of the eu 's executive .
" an examination of the guiding circular of oct .
26 , 2004 ... leads to the conclusion that the breaches of the cci in the previous circulars have been remedied , " frattini said . breaches remedied but questions remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franco frattini , eu justice commissioner frattini did point out , however , that some points in the 2004 circular were unclear and would benefit from clarification , but these were not grounds to invalidate the german policy , he said . the german foreign ministry welcomed the commission 's assessment that the german rules now met eu requirements . the almost disastrous political lesson learnt by the germans showed that countries should be aware that there was no place for liberal interpretations in national legislation or instructions of common eu visa regulations adopted for the schengen passport-free travel area , frattini added . conservative lawmaker targets red-green coalition however , while the commission appeared to close the book on the incident , others were not so quick to let germany off the hook .
opposition german eu lawmaker jochim würmeling challenged the commission to investigate berlin 's new policies , claiming that these too were flawed . würmeling , who said that the commission ruling on germany 's current visa policy was " in no way a virtual acquittal , " explained that while there were still discrepancies between the german and the european rules on the burden of proof for visa applicants there was a " grave deviation " from eu law , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : calling the commission 's analysis of the 2000 rules " damning , " würmeling then turned on the social democratic-green coalition government saying that its attitude to the visa policy showed " just how crass this wrong decision taken by the government was . " " one gets the impression that the ... government was completely indifferent to what eu rules said about issuing visas , " he said . visa scandal to cast shadow over election würmeling intends to raise the issue again in an attempt to hold the german government accountable in a question time session with frattini when the eu parliament reconvenes in september , just two weeks before likely german elections . it could be perfect timing for the opposition parties in germany who have been hounding gerhard schröder 's government for months over the scandal . the visa affair has weakened the bond between the ruling coalition , with ministers forced to testify before a parliamentary commission of inquiry and blame being passed between parties and departments before fischer took the hit for the team . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de probe into visa affair must go on germany 's highest court on wednesday thwarted a bid by the embattled government to wrap up a parliamentary probe into what 's become known as the " visa affair " ahead of likely elections in september .

the move has outraged the conservative opposition .

but their mandate is still unclear . around 100 unarmed military and civilian officials from the european union will monitor the implementation of a peace pact between the indonesian government and the separatist free aceh movement -lrb- gam -rrb- .
they will be joined by an equal number of monitors from the association of southeast asian nations -lrb- asean -rrb- . indonesia and gam tentatively reached a deal on july 17 to end almost 30 years of war , in which close to 15,000 people have died .
their pact includes the disarmament of rebels and a troop withdrawal from aceh . the pact is due to be signed on august 15 in helsinki - two days before the 60th anniversary of indonesian independence .
a 28-strong team of european and southeast asian officials visited banda aceh this week to make logistical preparations for the monitoring mission , which could begin shortly after the pact is signed . but the mission has so far only been defined in general terms .
a protocol of measures to take should the pact be violated has not been agreed on , nor has the length of the mission .
these and other details are expected to be addressed in the coming weeks . no reconstruction without peace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a local volunteer walks past a wall graffiti ' good by -lrb- e -rrb- banda aceh ' on a shop shutter in january in banda aceh , indonesia aceh was particularly hard hit by last december 's tsunami , and one could expect that the vast amount of reconstruction work still to be done might take precedence over the peace accord .
but the former eu representative in jakarta , ana maria gomes , said the accord ca n't wait . " we 're of the opinion that it 's only through an acceleration of the peace process that the reconstruction process can really begin to move forward , " gomes said .
" we 're offering our support for the peace process , and we 'll try to accommodate the wishes of the indonesian government . " however , it 's questionable whether all the wishes of the indonesian side can really be fulfilled .
indonesia 's military chief , endriartono sutarto , has requested that soldiers should be included among the monitors , in order to be able to react immediately should an emergency arise .
the eu framework , though , expressly excludes a military component from this type of mission . risk of failure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two soldiers guard the baiturrahman mosque on election day , in sept .
2004 , in banda aceh , indonesia generally the impression from jakarta is that it 's not overly keen to see the start of the international mission .
there 's considerable danger that not only gam hardliners , but also those within the indonesian military , could quickly foil the aims of the peace mission .
it would n't be the first time : in 2002 , a dozen observers from thailand and the philippines watched over a short-lived truce that ended as the spiral of violence grew out of control . the hope this time is that the aftermath of the devastating tsunami in indonesia will be enough to convince both sides in the aceh conflict to give peace - and reconstruction - a chance . tobias grote-beverborg -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tsunami relief all positive government says around five months after the tsunami disaster in south asia , berlin presented an optimistic preliminary report .

speaking after a meeting with his newly-appointed us counterpart , john bolton , in new york , china 's un ambassador , wang guangya said they had agreed on a way to proceed together . " at this stage , i think our objective will be to oppose the g4 , to make sure that they do not have sufficient votes to risk dividing the house , " he said . expansion without division wang stated that the g4 plan would drive a wedge through the 191 un member states , adding that the ultimate objective of both the us and china was expansion without division . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : g4 foreign ministers " we agreed to work together to make sure that our interests are being maintained , which means that we have to work in parallel ways to see that the unity of the un members , the unity of every regional group will not be spoiled because of this maneuver and process , " he added . painfully slow process the issue of reforming the security council , which still reflects the power structure in the aftermath of wwii , has been on the un agenda for several years , but it has so far proved impossible to reach any agreement on exactly how it should be expanded . earlier this year , un secretary general kofi annan told member states that he wanted a decision before a summit of world leaders in september . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united nations general secretary kofi annan there are currently 15 council seats , just five of which are permanent .
the g4 resolution calls for the addition of six new permanent seats without the power of veto , and four non-permanent ones . germany , japan , brazil and india have earmarked four of the six seats for themselves and the remaining two for african nations .
egypt , nigeria and south africa are the leading contenders . bidding for african support heads of state and representatives of the 53-nation african union -lrb- au -rrb- are meeting in the ethiopian capital of addis ababa on thursday to try and reach a common position on the g4 expansion resolution , but there is little hope that the summit will produce any consensus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flags of the african union algeria 's un ambassador , abdallah baali , warned against any expectation of the meeting producing a unified position , " despite efforts to accommodate the g4 .

but their mandate is still unclear . around 100 unarmed military and civilian officials from the european union will monitor the implementation of a peace pact between the indonesian government and the separatist free aceh movement -lrb- gam -rrb- .
they will be joined by an equal number of monitors from the association of southeast asian nations -lrb- asean -rrb- . indonesia and gam tentatively reached a deal on july 17 to end almost 30 years of war , in which close to 15,000 people have died .
their pact includes the disarmament of rebels and a troop withdrawal from aceh . the pact is due to be signed on august 15 in helsinki - two days before the 60th anniversary of indonesian independence .
a 28-strong team of european and southeast asian officials visited banda aceh this week to make logistical preparations for the monitoring mission , which could begin shortly after the pact is signed . but the mission has so far only been defined in general terms .

" we 're offering our support for the peace process , and we 'll try to accommodate the wishes of the indonesian government . " however , it 's questionable whether all the wishes of the indonesian side can really be fulfilled .
indonesia 's military chief , endriartono sutarto , has requested that soldiers should be included among the monitors , in order to be able to react immediately should an emergency arise .

there 's considerable danger that not only gam hardliners , but also those within the indonesian military , could quickly foil the aims of the peace mission .
it would n't be the first time : in 2002 , a dozen observers from thailand and the philippines watched over a short-lived truce that ended as the spiral of violence grew out of control . the hope this time is that the aftermath of the devastating tsunami in indonesia will be enough to convince both sides in the aceh conflict to give peace - and reconstruction - a chance . tobias grote-beverborg -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tsunami relief all positive government says around five months after the tsunami disaster in south asia , berlin presented an optimistic preliminary report .

but their mandate is still unclear . around 100 unarmed military and civilian officials from the european union will monitor the implementation of a peace pact between the indonesian government and the separatist free aceh movement -lrb- gam -rrb- .
they will be joined by an equal number of monitors from the association of southeast asian nations -lrb- asean -rrb- . indonesia and gam tentatively reached a deal on july 17 to end almost 30 years of war , in which close to 15,000 people have died .
their pact includes the disarmament of rebels and a troop withdrawal from aceh . the pact is due to be signed on august 15 in helsinki - two days before the 60th anniversary of indonesian independence .
a 28-strong team of european and southeast asian officials visited banda aceh this week to make logistical preparations for the monitoring mission , which could begin shortly after the pact is signed . but the mission has so far only been defined in general terms .

however , some doubts remain . germany escaped legal action after the european commission ruled on thursday that while the lax system at the heart of the german visa scandal violated european union norms , berlin had since remedied the problem with a reformed policy that complies with eu rules . the scandal , for which foreign minister joschka fischer has accepted responsibility , revolves around the loose visa policies that allowed thousands of criminals and illegal workers , mainly from ukraine , to enter germany between 2000 and 2002 . commission spokesman friso roscam abbing told a news briefing that the german policy circular issued by fischer in 2000 , which the christian democrat opposition describes as an opening of " the floodgates to a wave of unsuitable migrants , " did not comply with a range of european directives or laws . fischer 's circular contravened eu laws " the 2000 -lrb- instruction -rrb- was not compatible with schengen law , with eu law , with the common consular instructions , " abbing said .
justice and security commissioner franco frattini added that the 2000 circular that was the basis for the easier policy " ran counter to the common consular instructions -lrb- cci -rrb- " . bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer passes the entrance of a parliamentary panel investigating the visa scandal in april . the directive from fischer 's office ordered german consulates , notably in eastern europe , to give applicants the benefit of the doubt if they could not fully justify their financial means of support or the purpose of their trip . however , after the german foreign ministry had been plunged into a crisis concerning the visas and a flood of migrants , the visa policy was amended to the satisfaction of the eu 's executive .
" an examination of the guiding circular of oct .
26 , 2004 ... leads to the conclusion that the breaches of the cci in the previous circulars have been remedied , " frattini said . breaches remedied but questions remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franco frattini , eu justice commissioner frattini did point out , however , that some points in the 2004 circular were unclear and would benefit from clarification , but these were not grounds to invalidate the german policy , he said . the german foreign ministry welcomed the commission 's assessment that the german rules now met eu requirements . the almost disastrous political lesson learnt by the germans showed that countries should be aware that there was no place for liberal interpretations in national legislation or instructions of common eu visa regulations adopted for the schengen passport-free travel area , frattini added . conservative lawmaker targets red-green coalition however , while the commission appeared to close the book on the incident , others were not so quick to let germany off the hook .
opposition german eu lawmaker jochim würmeling challenged the commission to investigate berlin 's new policies , claiming that these too were flawed . würmeling , who said that the commission ruling on germany 's current visa policy was " in no way a virtual acquittal , " explained that while there were still discrepancies between the german and the european rules on the burden of proof for visa applicants there was a " grave deviation " from eu law , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : calling the commission 's analysis of the 2000 rules " damning , " würmeling then turned on the social democratic-green coalition government saying that its attitude to the visa policy showed " just how crass this wrong decision taken by the government was . " " one gets the impression that the ... government was completely indifferent to what eu rules said about issuing visas , " he said . visa scandal to cast shadow over election würmeling intends to raise the issue again in an attempt to hold the german government accountable in a question time session with frattini when the eu parliament reconvenes in september , just two weeks before likely german elections . it could be perfect timing for the opposition parties in germany who have been hounding gerhard schröder 's government for months over the scandal . the visa affair has weakened the bond between the ruling coalition , with ministers forced to testify before a parliamentary commission of inquiry and blame being passed between parties and departments before fischer took the hit for the team . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de probe into visa affair must go on germany 's highest court on wednesday thwarted a bid by the embattled government to wrap up a parliamentary probe into what 's become known as the " visa affair " ahead of likely elections in september .
-lrb- june 16 , 2005 -rrb- government ends visa investigation as germany prepares for early elections , the coalition government has initiated steps to dissolve a parliamentary committee looking into large-scale visa abuses .
the move has outraged the conservative opposition .
-lrb- june 2 , 2005 -rrb- fischer accepts blame in immigration probe german foreign minister joschka fischer admitted on monday that he failed to act more quickly to stop visa abuses which allowed tens of thousands of eastern europeans to flood into germany between 2000 and 2003 .

the news comes as iran 's new president mahmoud ahmadinejad faces up to tough decisions as he takes over the running of the islamic republic on thursday with the most pressing issue being the diplomatic stand-off with the european union and the united states which he inherited from his predecessor . the former revolutionary guard began his first day in office on thursday but the work of his government begins after saturday , the day he takes the oath of office and announces his cabinet . this weekend is likely to see the new president thrust into a row which could lead to un sanctions if iran does not back down from its threat to restart nuclear work which the europeans and americans suspect might be aimed at building an atomic bomb . on wednesday , iran announced that it would back off its threat to resume suspended uranium conversion activities , a move that was welcomed by the united states .

tehran had said it planned to resume the controversial fuel-cycle work this week but later signaled it would delay the start until saturday , in effect giving more time for diplomacy . new president but no new foreign policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even with ahmadinejad at the reins , there is no guarantee that iran will become a more diplomatic partner in the future .
the new president 's choices will continue to be determined by deference to supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei , iran 's most powerful figure . " he has to consult with the supreme leader , " said an unnamed political analyst in an interview with reuters .
" he came to power with the hardliners ' backing , now he has to satisfy them . " iran 's chief nuclear negotiator hassan rohani , who could be replaced by ahmadinejad , told state television there would be no policy change under any new negotiating team .

" if they 've heeded those calls , that 's a good thing , " casey told the daily state department briefing . the iranian move gives britain , france and germany time to finalize a new package of economic and security incentives they had been working on to persuade tehran to renounce its enrichment program . a state department official , who asked not to be named , said the europeans had informed washington they would unveil the package over the weekend , perhaps as early as friday .

still , speculation has persisted about potential differences in the us and european positions . the europeans have reportedly flirted with the idea of allowing iran to retain some limited civilian nuclear capacity .
the americans have insisted iran completely halt its fuel cycle work and dismantle its facilities . but the us administration insisted it was on the same page with its trans-atlantic allies as they prepared to make what could be a last-ditch offer to the iranians .

the news comes as iran 's new president mahmoud ahmadinejad faces up to tough decisions as he takes over the running of the islamic republic on thursday with the most pressing issue being the diplomatic stand-off with the european union and the united states which he inherited from his predecessor . the former revolutionary guard began his first day in office on thursday but the work of his government begins after saturday , the day he takes the oath of office and announces his cabinet . this weekend is likely to see the new president thrust into a row which could lead to un sanctions if iran does not back down from its threat to restart nuclear work which the europeans and americans suspect might be aimed at building an atomic bomb . on wednesday , iran announced that it would back off its threat to resume suspended uranium conversion activities , a move that was welcomed by the united states .
tehran had said it planned to resume the controversial fuel-cycle work this week but later signaled it would delay the start until saturday , in effect giving more time for diplomacy . new president but no new foreign policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even with ahmadinejad at the reins , there is no guarantee that iran will become a more diplomatic partner in the future .
the new president 's choices will continue to be determined by deference to supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei , iran 's most powerful figure . " he has to consult with the supreme leader , " said an unnamed political analyst in an interview with reuters .
" he came to power with the hardliners ' backing , now he has to satisfy them . " iran 's chief nuclear negotiator hassan rohani , who could be replaced by ahmadinejad , told state television there would be no policy change under any new negotiating team .
" iran 's nuclear policy is ... decided by top officials .
it will not be changed . "
local media have said former state broadcasting chief ali larijani , a hardliner close to the ayatollah , would replace rohani and take charge of the nuclear negotiations with the eu . us encouraged by decision to delay enrichment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nevertheless , the delay in restarting enrichment has given the us in particular cause for hope .
" it certainly is a positive thing that the steps that the iranians had previously suggested they would take have not occurred , " spokesman tom casey told reporters . the united states and its european allies have made clear that any move to restart fuel-cycle activities suspended under an accord struck in november could force them to seek possible un sanctions again iran .
" if they 've heeded those calls , that 's a good thing , " casey told the daily state department briefing . the iranian move gives britain , france and germany time to finalize a new package of economic and security incentives they had been working on to persuade tehran to renounce its enrichment program . a state department official , who asked not to be named , said the europeans had informed washington they would unveil the package over the weekend , perhaps as early as friday .
he gave no other details . iran reiterates nuclear desire to europeans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's isfahan nuclear facility .
but iran has said it remains determined to resume its uranium conversion work at the isfahan plant .
the process is the first step in the cycle to produce fuel for nuclear reactors . in a letter sent to the foreign ministers of the eu-3 on tuesday , hassan rowhani said this " inalienable right can not be the subject of arbitrary and subjective criteria . " " your side has continued to refrain from responding substantively to our proposals , in whole or even in part .
we intend to take a minimal step , " the letter said .
" the islamic republic of iran stringently desires a negotiated resumption of its enrichment activities and is prepared to continue in good faith and in an expeditious and result-oriented manner its negotiations , " it said . the so-called eu-3 were reportedly ready to offer the iranians guaranteed fuel for a nuclear power plant they are building at bushehr and others they may build further down the road .
the package was also expected to include trade benefits , including civilian aircraft and parts iran badly needs , help in joining the world trade organization and a promise to bring tehran into regional security talks . eu , us still at odds over iran deal the united states was initially skeptical about the european initiative to negotiate with iran but changed tack in march and agreed to back the effort .
still , speculation has persisted about potential differences in the us and european positions . the europeans have reportedly flirted with the idea of allowing iran to retain some limited civilian nuclear capacity .
the americans have insisted iran completely halt its fuel cycle work and dismantle its facilities . but the us administration insisted it was on the same page with its trans-atlantic allies as they prepared to make what could be a last-ditch offer to the iranians .
" it would be pretty hard for us to support a process , including the proposals in it , based on things we had n't seen and we had n't agreed with , " said the state department official . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu voices concern for iran nuclear talks eu leaders face an uncertain future in their negotiations with iran over its nuclear program following the election of ultra-conservative president mahmoud ahmadinejad , even warning the talks could be frozen .
-lrb- june 26 , 2005 -rrb- iran may defy eu nuclear suspension deal iran is unhappy with the progress of nuclear negotiations with the european union and may resume uranium conversion activities next week in defiance of a key agreement , senior officials warned saturday .
-lrb- april 30 , 2005 -rrb- us , europe aligned on iran nuke incentives while the europeans talked tough on wednesday , calling for more transparency from iran in its nuclear activities , the us announced that it may back europe 's incentive-based negotiations with tehran .

26 , 2004 ... leads to the conclusion that the breaches of the cci in the previous circulars have been remedied , " frattini said . breaches remedied but questions remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franco frattini , eu justice commissioner frattini did point out , however , that some points in the 2004 circular were unclear and would benefit from clarification , but these were not grounds to invalidate the german policy , he said . the german foreign ministry welcomed the commission 's assessment that the german rules now met eu requirements . the almost disastrous political lesson learnt by the germans showed that countries should be aware that there was no place for liberal interpretations in national legislation or instructions of common eu visa regulations adopted for the schengen passport-free travel area , frattini added . conservative lawmaker targets red-green coalition however , while the commission appeared to close the book on the incident , others were not so quick to let germany off the hook .
opposition german eu lawmaker jochim würmeling challenged the commission to investigate berlin 's new policies , claiming that these too were flawed . würmeling , who said that the commission ruling on germany 's current visa policy was " in no way a virtual acquittal , " explained that while there were still discrepancies between the german and the european rules on the burden of proof for visa applicants there was a " grave deviation " from eu law , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : calling the commission 's analysis of the 2000 rules " damning , " würmeling then turned on the social democratic-green coalition government saying that its attitude to the visa policy showed " just how crass this wrong decision taken by the government was . " " one gets the impression that the ... government was completely indifferent to what eu rules said about issuing visas , " he said . visa scandal to cast shadow over election würmeling intends to raise the issue again in an attempt to hold the german government accountable in a question time session with frattini when the eu parliament reconvenes in september , just two weeks before likely german elections . it could be perfect timing for the opposition parties in germany who have been hounding gerhard schröder 's government for months over the scandal . the visa affair has weakened the bond between the ruling coalition , with ministers forced to testify before a parliamentary commission of inquiry and blame being passed between parties and departments before fischer took the hit for the team . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de probe into visa affair must go on germany 's highest court on wednesday thwarted a bid by the embattled government to wrap up a parliamentary probe into what 's become known as the " visa affair " ahead of likely elections in september .

the news comes as iran 's new president mahmoud ahmadinejad faces up to tough decisions as he takes over the running of the islamic republic on thursday with the most pressing issue being the diplomatic stand-off with the european union and the united states which he inherited from his predecessor . the former revolutionary guard began his first day in office on thursday but the work of his government begins after saturday , the day he takes the oath of office and announces his cabinet . this weekend is likely to see the new president thrust into a row which could lead to un sanctions if iran does not back down from its threat to restart nuclear work which the europeans and americans suspect might be aimed at building an atomic bomb . on wednesday , iran announced that it would back off its threat to resume suspended uranium conversion activities , a move that was welcomed by the united states .
tehran had said it planned to resume the controversial fuel-cycle work this week but later signaled it would delay the start until saturday , in effect giving more time for diplomacy . new president but no new foreign policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even with ahmadinejad at the reins , there is no guarantee that iran will become a more diplomatic partner in the future .
the new president 's choices will continue to be determined by deference to supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei , iran 's most powerful figure . " he has to consult with the supreme leader , " said an unnamed political analyst in an interview with reuters .
" he came to power with the hardliners ' backing , now he has to satisfy them . " iran 's chief nuclear negotiator hassan rohani , who could be replaced by ahmadinejad , told state television there would be no policy change under any new negotiating team .
" iran 's nuclear policy is ... decided by top officials .
it will not be changed . "

" it certainly is a positive thing that the steps that the iranians had previously suggested they would take have not occurred , " spokesman tom casey told reporters . the united states and its european allies have made clear that any move to restart fuel-cycle activities suspended under an accord struck in november could force them to seek possible un sanctions again iran .
" if they 've heeded those calls , that 's a good thing , " casey told the daily state department briefing . the iranian move gives britain , france and germany time to finalize a new package of economic and security incentives they had been working on to persuade tehran to renounce its enrichment program . a state department official , who asked not to be named , said the europeans had informed washington they would unveil the package over the weekend , perhaps as early as friday .

but iran has said it remains determined to resume its uranium conversion work at the isfahan plant .
the process is the first step in the cycle to produce fuel for nuclear reactors . in a letter sent to the foreign ministers of the eu-3 on tuesday , hassan rowhani said this " inalienable right can not be the subject of arbitrary and subjective criteria . " " your side has continued to refrain from responding substantively to our proposals , in whole or even in part .
we intend to take a minimal step , " the letter said .
" the islamic republic of iran stringently desires a negotiated resumption of its enrichment activities and is prepared to continue in good faith and in an expeditious and result-oriented manner its negotiations , " it said . the so-called eu-3 were reportedly ready to offer the iranians guaranteed fuel for a nuclear power plant they are building at bushehr and others they may build further down the road .
the package was also expected to include trade benefits , including civilian aircraft and parts iran badly needs , help in joining the world trade organization and a promise to bring tehran into regional security talks . eu , us still at odds over iran deal the united states was initially skeptical about the european initiative to negotiate with iran but changed tack in march and agreed to back the effort .
still , speculation has persisted about potential differences in the us and european positions . the europeans have reportedly flirted with the idea of allowing iran to retain some limited civilian nuclear capacity .
the americans have insisted iran completely halt its fuel cycle work and dismantle its facilities . but the us administration insisted it was on the same page with its trans-atlantic allies as they prepared to make what could be a last-ditch offer to the iranians .

china and the us have agreed to work together to try and prevent the expansion of the united nations security council to include a further six permanent seats , including one for germany . the contentious bid to enlarge the security council led by germany , japan , brazil and india , collectively known as the group of four or g4 , has met with steady resistance from both washington and beijing over the past months , but their joining forces to block the move is a departure which will likely further dilute any chance of the plan 's success .
speaking after a meeting with his newly-appointed us counterpart , john bolton , in new york , china 's un ambassador , wang guangya said they had agreed on a way to proceed together . " at this stage , i think our objective will be to oppose the g4 , to make sure that they do not have sufficient votes to risk dividing the house , " he said . expansion without division wang stated that the g4 plan would drive a wedge through the 191 un member states , adding that the ultimate objective of both the us and china was expansion without division . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : g4 foreign ministers " we agreed to work together to make sure that our interests are being maintained , which means that we have to work in parallel ways to see that the unity of the un members , the unity of every regional group will not be spoiled because of this maneuver and process , " he added . painfully slow process the issue of reforming the security council , which still reflects the power structure in the aftermath of wwii , has been on the un agenda for several years , but it has so far proved impossible to reach any agreement on exactly how it should be expanded . earlier this year , un secretary general kofi annan told member states that he wanted a decision before a summit of world leaders in september . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united nations general secretary kofi annan there are currently 15 council seats , just five of which are permanent .
the g4 resolution calls for the addition of six new permanent seats without the power of veto , and four non-permanent ones . germany , japan , brazil and india have earmarked four of the six seats for themselves and the remaining two for african nations .
egypt , nigeria and south africa are the leading contenders . bidding for african support heads of state and representatives of the 53-nation african union -lrb- au -rrb- are meeting in the ethiopian capital of addis ababa on thursday to try and reach a common position on the g4 expansion resolution , but there is little hope that the summit will produce any consensus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flags of the african union algeria 's un ambassador , abdallah baali , warned against any expectation of the meeting producing a unified position , " despite efforts to accommodate the g4 . "
delegates from the four aspirant countries are also there to drum up support for their cause . if their resolution is to have any chance of winning the two-thirds majority in a un general assembly vote , the g4 nations will need the support of the african union . for its part , the au is calling for the expansion of the council to 26 seats , with a total of seven new permanent seats with veto rights . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us reportedly opposed to berlin 's un bid us secretary of state condoleezza rice reportedly is opposed to germany 's bid for a permanent seat on the un security council .

but their mandate is still unclear . around 100 unarmed military and civilian officials from the european union will monitor the implementation of a peace pact between the indonesian government and the separatist free aceh movement -lrb- gam -rrb- .
they will be joined by an equal number of monitors from the association of southeast asian nations -lrb- asean -rrb- . indonesia and gam tentatively reached a deal on july 17 to end almost 30 years of war , in which close to 15,000 people have died .
their pact includes the disarmament of rebels and a troop withdrawal from aceh . the pact is due to be signed on august 15 in helsinki - two days before the 60th anniversary of indonesian independence .
a 28-strong team of european and southeast asian officials visited banda aceh this week to make logistical preparations for the monitoring mission , which could begin shortly after the pact is signed . but the mission has so far only been defined in general terms .
a protocol of measures to take should the pact be violated has not been agreed on , nor has the length of the mission .
these and other details are expected to be addressed in the coming weeks . no reconstruction without peace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a local volunteer walks past a wall graffiti ' good by -lrb- e -rrb- banda aceh ' on a shop shutter in january in banda aceh , indonesia aceh was particularly hard hit by last december 's tsunami , and one could expect that the vast amount of reconstruction work still to be done might take precedence over the peace accord .
but the former eu representative in jakarta , ana maria gomes , said the accord ca n't wait . " we 're of the opinion that it 's only through an acceleration of the peace process that the reconstruction process can really begin to move forward , " gomes said .
" we 're offering our support for the peace process , and we 'll try to accommodate the wishes of the indonesian government . " however , it 's questionable whether all the wishes of the indonesian side can really be fulfilled .
indonesia 's military chief , endriartono sutarto , has requested that soldiers should be included among the monitors , in order to be able to react immediately should an emergency arise .
the eu framework , though , expressly excludes a military component from this type of mission . risk of failure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two soldiers guard the baiturrahman mosque on election day , in sept .
2004 , in banda aceh , indonesia generally the impression from jakarta is that it 's not overly keen to see the start of the international mission .
there 's considerable danger that not only gam hardliners , but also those within the indonesian military , could quickly foil the aims of the peace mission .
it would n't be the first time : in 2002 , a dozen observers from thailand and the philippines watched over a short-lived truce that ended as the spiral of violence grew out of control . the hope this time is that the aftermath of the devastating tsunami in indonesia will be enough to convince both sides in the aceh conflict to give peace - and reconstruction - a chance . tobias grote-beverborg -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tsunami relief all positive government says around five months after the tsunami disaster in south asia , berlin presented an optimistic preliminary report .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de election 2005 -pipe- 04.08.2005 " lafontaine is not a german haider " 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from spd leader to spd enemy : oskar lafontaine how strong is germany 's new leftist alliance ?
how dangerous is it for the social democrats ?
is the left party 's new front man , oskar lafontaine , wooing right wing voters ?
a political scientist offers answers . the political scientist and party researcher klaus detterbeck teaches at the institute for political science at the university of magdeburg . dw-world : what chances do you give the new leftist alliance in the expedited bundestag elections ? klaus detterbeck : i would put the chances relatively high .
i would , however , differentiate between a short-term success for the bundestag elections , and the long-term perspective , which i view more critically .
in the short-term , the party has the opportunity to fill a vacuum which exists in the current competition between the parties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators protesting in berlin against social welfare cuts for the voters in western germany there has been no outlet to express frustrations with reform of the social welfare system , the effects of market liberalization .
here the party is filling a gap .
in the long-term i see the problem that the alliance parties are actually quite heterogeneous , that both at the grassroots as well as the leadership level there are significant differences between the labor union members in the west and the old pds -lrb- party of democratic socialism , the successor of the communist party of east germany -rrb- cadre in the east .
the differences will be difficult to reconcile , both for the party platform and the political goals .
what brings the groups together is the protest against social reforms .
in the longer-term they will have a falling out . so the left party is a protest party ?
what will define their constituency ? in the west it will doubtless be the disaffected stalwarts of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , just that unionized milieu from which the spd drew its base over decades .
in the east it will be the old pds voters coming from various societal groupings .
on the one side there is thus the protest voter trying to prevent the east from being treated as second-class , but there is also the old gdr cadre .
it will definitely be a protest party .
when we look to other countries , for example to spain or sweden , we also see similar leftist groupings , also heterogeneous , drawing their members from communists , greens , and leftist activists .
they feed off of the protest against modernization and the liberalization of the welfare state . there it functions on a long-term basis ... yes , since it has to do with very pragmatic , loose alliances , which for the most part remain separate from one another and only come together for the election .
this just wo n't work in germany .
the left party has to position itself .
after the election , problems will surely develop , and so i see little chance that the party will remain together . is the spd seriously threatened by this new alliance ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no longer guaranteed spd voters the spd will definitely suffer losses at its base , the unionized milieu - voters who may not have gone to the polls had this party not materialized .
they must see their chance to express their anger and disappointment with the spd government , a chance to make their frustration known .
this is without doubt a threat for the spd . is the spd responding appropriately to this threat by attempting to slander the new alliance ? the spd has always assumed it was the voice of the left , the voice of the traditional organized labor in the broadest sense .
now there has been for a long , long time a serious competition here .
and the spd shows an allergic reaction and is flip-flopping : on the one hand , it is trying to restore its social competence , the intention to more strongly articulate social justice .
on the other hand they are trying to portray the new alliance as illegitimate .
this is bound to come off badly for those voters disappointed by the schröder government and will motivate them to keep their distance from the spd .
the spd 's strategy is thus not exactly helping them to woo back their base .
but it is difficult to imagine what the spd 's options are at this point . continue reading to find out whether lafontaine is fishing for voters on the extreme right . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de social justice or economic folly ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de election 2005 -pipe- 04.08.2005 " lafontaine is not a german haider " back to first page back 2/2 many are calling the new alliance populist .
is this justified ? the party is certainly populist in the sense that they rail against change and modernization without really wanting to , or rather being able to say , what they would do differently .
it is a party that wants to excite tempers and encourage protest without being able to give answers .
one could say that this is not necessarily the role of a new opposition party .
it is a chance to express protest and it can lead the established parties to reconsider certain issues . gregor gysi and oskar lafontaine , the former spd chief , will act together as top candidates .
lafontaine in particular has been attacked by the spd and the greens .
he was given the epithet of " german haider -lrb- austria 's right-wing populist politician -rrb- , " fishing for votes on the extreme right .
what do you think of this accusation ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jörg haider recently split from the populist freedom party he founded and started a new right-wing alliance no , in my opinion you ca n't look at it that way .
the charge goes back to a speech lafontaine made , in which he spoke of " alien workers , " a concept from the rightist camp .
when one looks at the political development of lafontaine , i do n't think it 's fair to speak of a rightist leaning or an attempt to court rightist voters .
lafontaine has always been a nonconformist , someone who has always taken positions not directly in line with that of his party .
he is continuing with this .
so the comparison with haider is not justified . but does lafontaine really offer any sensible remedies ? lafontaine has , since his retreat from the federal government , been constantly appealing to the public , whether in publications or in talk shows , spreading his view of things - that is , a state control of the globalized economy .
he has time and again been criticized , that his solutions are completely unrealistic .
for himself and for the groupings he stands for , this is a reasonable answer to globalization .
it is , however , in the current situation , no adequate response .
it is impossible to see how a strong governmental , national control could be implemented at the european level .
should lafontaine be asked to implement his policies in the real world , then his alliance would really dissolve quite quickly .
but as an opposition party , as a protest party , such goals are legitimate .
it is an opportunity for disgruntled voters to express that they do not agree with the course and the pace of the reforms .
thus the party fulfills a democratic function . steffen leidel interviewed klaus detterbeck -lrb- jc -rrb- back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de social justice or economic folly ?

the sale represents a big step forward for the troubled retail giant , which suffered the worst crisis in its history in 2004 .
chief executive officer thomas middelhoff said the deal almost completes karstadtquelle 's goal of securing its finances . " this is a major milestone in the turnaround of our company and we are glad that it could be achieved in such a short time , " middelhoff said . the company also announced the sale of its 51-outlet sinnleffers chain to an international investors group comprised of deutsche industrie-holding -lrb- frankfurt -rrb- , hmd partners -lrb- us -rrb- and british real estate investor curzon global partners .
the 124-outlet runners point chain was sold to hannover finanz group .
karstadtquelle did not disclose the sales price of either deal . middelhoff said that staff at all 250 outlets involved in the sales would be taken over by the new owners . " the buyers have stated very clearly that business is to continue in the long run , " he said in an effort to allay fears that department store closures could lead to depressed city centers . concentrating on core business bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the deals leave karstadtquelle free to focus on its remaining core 89 department stores .
the company plans to remodel the stores and add new high-end fashion , furniture and sporting goods lines to draw customers in future . the disposals also give the company " more negotiating space " for future divestments , middelhoff said .
according to the divestment plan released in september , a logistics center in frankfurt is still to be sold . another source of concern for the company is its mail-order business , which saw revenues drop by 6.5 percent in the last quarter .
middelhoff promised a management shake-up of the unit last month . " this business will also be led back into the black , " he said . long-term strategy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new owners of karstadtquelle 's businesses promised to retain all staff karstadtquelle 's troubles reached a peak in 2004 due mainly to poor retail sales , and analysts have said the prognosis does n't look much better for 2005 .
german retail managers are also worried by the prospect of a possible hike in value-added sales tax . however , the company is confident that its restructuring plan will be successful in the long run . " we are glad to report that our margin has improved significantly in the first half of 2005 , " said middelhoff , adding that the company had reduced net debt by 800 million euros , not including the new divestments .
the company has reduced its number of employees by around 25,000 , resulting in a 16 percent decrease in staff costs .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de election 2005 -pipe- 04.08.2005 " lafontaine is not a german haider " 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from spd leader to spd enemy : oskar lafontaine how strong is germany 's new leftist alliance ?
how dangerous is it for the social democrats ?
is the left party 's new front man , oskar lafontaine , wooing right wing voters ?
a political scientist offers answers . the political scientist and party researcher klaus detterbeck teaches at the institute for political science at the university of magdeburg . dw-world : what chances do you give the new leftist alliance in the expedited bundestag elections ? klaus detterbeck : i would put the chances relatively high .
i would , however , differentiate between a short-term success for the bundestag elections , and the long-term perspective , which i view more critically .
in the short-term , the party has the opportunity to fill a vacuum which exists in the current competition between the parties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators protesting in berlin against social welfare cuts for the voters in western germany there has been no outlet to express frustrations with reform of the social welfare system , the effects of market liberalization .
here the party is filling a gap .
in the long-term i see the problem that the alliance parties are actually quite heterogeneous , that both at the grassroots as well as the leadership level there are significant differences between the labor union members in the west and the old pds -lrb- party of democratic socialism , the successor of the communist party of east germany -rrb- cadre in the east .
the differences will be difficult to reconcile , both for the party platform and the political goals .
what brings the groups together is the protest against social reforms .
in the longer-term they will have a falling out . so the left party is a protest party ?
what will define their constituency ? in the west it will doubtless be the disaffected stalwarts of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , just that unionized milieu from which the spd drew its base over decades .
in the east it will be the old pds voters coming from various societal groupings .
on the one side there is thus the protest voter trying to prevent the east from being treated as second-class , but there is also the old gdr cadre .
it will definitely be a protest party .
when we look to other countries , for example to spain or sweden , we also see similar leftist groupings , also heterogeneous , drawing their members from communists , greens , and leftist activists .
they feed off of the protest against modernization and the liberalization of the welfare state . there it functions on a long-term basis ... yes , since it has to do with very pragmatic , loose alliances , which for the most part remain separate from one another and only come together for the election .
this just wo n't work in germany .
the left party has to position itself .
after the election , problems will surely develop , and so i see little chance that the party will remain together . is the spd seriously threatened by this new alliance ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no longer guaranteed spd voters the spd will definitely suffer losses at its base , the unionized milieu - voters who may not have gone to the polls had this party not materialized .
they must see their chance to express their anger and disappointment with the spd government , a chance to make their frustration known .
this is without doubt a threat for the spd . is the spd responding appropriately to this threat by attempting to slander the new alliance ? the spd has always assumed it was the voice of the left , the voice of the traditional organized labor in the broadest sense .
now there has been for a long , long time a serious competition here .
and the spd shows an allergic reaction and is flip-flopping : on the one hand , it is trying to restore its social competence , the intention to more strongly articulate social justice .
on the other hand they are trying to portray the new alliance as illegitimate .
this is bound to come off badly for those voters disappointed by the schröder government and will motivate them to keep their distance from the spd .
the spd 's strategy is thus not exactly helping them to woo back their base .
but it is difficult to imagine what the spd 's options are at this point . continue reading to find out whether lafontaine is fishing for voters on the extreme right . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de social justice or economic folly ?
the new hard-left grouping in germany , the left party , is sending tremors across the political landscape .
but , the party 's economic program has industry groups and economists shaking their heads , and worrying .

is this justified ? the party is certainly populist in the sense that they rail against change and modernization without really wanting to , or rather being able to say , what they would do differently .
it is a party that wants to excite tempers and encourage protest without being able to give answers .
one could say that this is not necessarily the role of a new opposition party .
it is a chance to express protest and it can lead the established parties to reconsider certain issues . gregor gysi and oskar lafontaine , the former spd chief , will act together as top candidates .
lafontaine in particular has been attacked by the spd and the greens .
he was given the epithet of " german haider -lrb- austria 's right-wing populist politician -rrb- , " fishing for votes on the extreme right .
what do you think of this accusation ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jörg haider recently split from the populist freedom party he founded and started a new right-wing alliance no , in my opinion you ca n't look at it that way .
the charge goes back to a speech lafontaine made , in which he spoke of " alien workers , " a concept from the rightist camp .
when one looks at the political development of lafontaine , i do n't think it 's fair to speak of a rightist leaning or an attempt to court rightist voters .
lafontaine has always been a nonconformist , someone who has always taken positions not directly in line with that of his party .
he is continuing with this .
so the comparison with haider is not justified . but does lafontaine really offer any sensible remedies ? lafontaine has , since his retreat from the federal government , been constantly appealing to the public , whether in publications or in talk shows , spreading his view of things - that is , a state control of the globalized economy .
he has time and again been criticized , that his solutions are completely unrealistic .
for himself and for the groupings he stands for , this is a reasonable answer to globalization .
it is , however , in the current situation , no adequate response .
it is impossible to see how a strong governmental , national control could be implemented at the european level .
should lafontaine be asked to implement his policies in the real world , then his alliance would really dissolve quite quickly .
but as an opposition party , as a protest party , such goals are legitimate .
it is an opportunity for disgruntled voters to express that they do not agree with the course and the pace of the reforms .
thus the party fulfills a democratic function . steffen leidel interviewed klaus detterbeck -lrb- jc -rrb- back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de social justice or economic folly ?

he is continuing with this .
so the comparison with haider is not justified . but does lafontaine really offer any sensible remedies ? lafontaine has , since his retreat from the federal government , been constantly appealing to the public , whether in publications or in talk shows , spreading his view of things - that is , a state control of the globalized economy .
he has time and again been criticized , that his solutions are completely unrealistic .
for himself and for the groupings he stands for , this is a reasonable answer to globalization .
it is , however , in the current situation , no adequate response .
it is impossible to see how a strong governmental , national control could be implemented at the european level .
should lafontaine be asked to implement his policies in the real world , then his alliance would really dissolve quite quickly .
but as an opposition party , as a protest party , such goals are legitimate .
it is an opportunity for disgruntled voters to express that they do not agree with the course and the pace of the reforms .
thus the party fulfills a democratic function . steffen leidel interviewed klaus detterbeck -lrb- jc -rrb- back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de social justice or economic folly ?

how dangerous is it for the social democrats ?
is the left party 's new front man , oskar lafontaine , wooing right wing voters ?
a political scientist offers answers . the political scientist and party researcher klaus detterbeck teaches at the institute for political science at the university of magdeburg . dw-world : what chances do you give the new leftist alliance in the expedited bundestag elections ? klaus detterbeck : i would put the chances relatively high .
i would , however , differentiate between a short-term success for the bundestag elections , and the long-term perspective , which i view more critically .
in the short-term , the party has the opportunity to fill a vacuum which exists in the current competition between the parties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators protesting in berlin against social welfare cuts for the voters in western germany there has been no outlet to express frustrations with reform of the social welfare system , the effects of market liberalization .
here the party is filling a gap .
in the long-term i see the problem that the alliance parties are actually quite heterogeneous , that both at the grassroots as well as the leadership level there are significant differences between the labor union members in the west and the old pds -lrb- party of democratic socialism , the successor of the communist party of east germany -rrb- cadre in the east .
the differences will be difficult to reconcile , both for the party platform and the political goals .
what brings the groups together is the protest against social reforms .
in the longer-term they will have a falling out . so the left party is a protest party ?
what will define their constituency ? in the west it will doubtless be the disaffected stalwarts of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , just that unionized milieu from which the spd drew its base over decades .
in the east it will be the old pds voters coming from various societal groupings .
on the one side there is thus the protest voter trying to prevent the east from being treated as second-class , but there is also the old gdr cadre .
it will definitely be a protest party .
when we look to other countries , for example to spain or sweden , we also see similar leftist groupings , also heterogeneous , drawing their members from communists , greens , and leftist activists .
they feed off of the protest against modernization and the liberalization of the welfare state . there it functions on a long-term basis ... yes , since it has to do with very pragmatic , loose alliances , which for the most part remain separate from one another and only come together for the election .
this just wo n't work in germany .
the left party has to position itself .
after the election , problems will surely develop , and so i see little chance that the party will remain together . is the spd seriously threatened by this new alliance ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no longer guaranteed spd voters the spd will definitely suffer losses at its base , the unionized milieu - voters who may not have gone to the polls had this party not materialized .
they must see their chance to express their anger and disappointment with the spd government , a chance to make their frustration known .
this is without doubt a threat for the spd . is the spd responding appropriately to this threat by attempting to slander the new alliance ? the spd has always assumed it was the voice of the left , the voice of the traditional organized labor in the broadest sense .
now there has been for a long , long time a serious competition here .
and the spd shows an allergic reaction and is flip-flopping : on the one hand , it is trying to restore its social competence , the intention to more strongly articulate social justice .
on the other hand they are trying to portray the new alliance as illegitimate .
this is bound to come off badly for those voters disappointed by the schröder government and will motivate them to keep their distance from the spd .
the spd 's strategy is thus not exactly helping them to woo back their base .

that suspect , hamdi issac , was arrested in rome last week . abdurahman did not enter a formal plea but his lawyer ann faul said he denied any connections to terrorism .
" i have been instructed to tell the court he is , and will be , vigorously contesting this charge and that he has no involvement in any terrorist activity whatsoever , " she said . abdurahman was arrested on july 28 in south london and faces a maximum sentence of five years in prison if convicted .

the sale represents a big step forward for the troubled retail giant , which suffered the worst crisis in its history in 2004 .
chief executive officer thomas middelhoff said the deal almost completes karstadtquelle 's goal of securing its finances . " this is a major milestone in the turnaround of our company and we are glad that it could be achieved in such a short time , " middelhoff said . the company also announced the sale of its 51-outlet sinnleffers chain to an international investors group comprised of deutsche industrie-holding -lrb- frankfurt -rrb- , hmd partners -lrb- us -rrb- and british real estate investor curzon global partners .
the 124-outlet runners point chain was sold to hannover finanz group .
karstadtquelle did not disclose the sales price of either deal . middelhoff said that staff at all 250 outlets involved in the sales would be taken over by the new owners . " the buyers have stated very clearly that business is to continue in the long run , " he said in an effort to allay fears that department store closures could lead to depressed city centers . concentrating on core business bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the deals leave karstadtquelle free to focus on its remaining core 89 department stores .
the company plans to remodel the stores and add new high-end fashion , furniture and sporting goods lines to draw customers in future . the disposals also give the company " more negotiating space " for future divestments , middelhoff said .
according to the divestment plan released in september , a logistics center in frankfurt is still to be sold . another source of concern for the company is its mail-order business , which saw revenues drop by 6.5 percent in the last quarter .
middelhoff promised a management shake-up of the unit last month . " this business will also be led back into the black , " he said . long-term strategy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new owners of karstadtquelle 's businesses promised to retain all staff karstadtquelle 's troubles reached a peak in 2004 due mainly to poor retail sales , and analysts have said the prognosis does n't look much better for 2005 .
german retail managers are also worried by the prospect of a possible hike in value-added sales tax . however , the company is confident that its restructuring plan will be successful in the long run . " we are glad to report that our margin has improved significantly in the first half of 2005 , " said middelhoff , adding that the company had reduced net debt by 800 million euros , not including the new divestments .
the company has reduced its number of employees by around 25,000 , resulting in a 16 percent decrease in staff costs .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de election 2005 -pipe- 04.08.2005 " lafontaine is not a german haider " 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from spd leader to spd enemy : oskar lafontaine how strong is germany 's new leftist alliance ?
how dangerous is it for the social democrats ?
is the left party 's new front man , oskar lafontaine , wooing right wing voters ?
a political scientist offers answers . the political scientist and party researcher klaus detterbeck teaches at the institute for political science at the university of magdeburg . dw-world : what chances do you give the new leftist alliance in the expedited bundestag elections ? klaus detterbeck : i would put the chances relatively high .
i would , however , differentiate between a short-term success for the bundestag elections , and the long-term perspective , which i view more critically .
in the short-term , the party has the opportunity to fill a vacuum which exists in the current competition between the parties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators protesting in berlin against social welfare cuts for the voters in western germany there has been no outlet to express frustrations with reform of the social welfare system , the effects of market liberalization .
here the party is filling a gap .
in the long-term i see the problem that the alliance parties are actually quite heterogeneous , that both at the grassroots as well as the leadership level there are significant differences between the labor union members in the west and the old pds -lrb- party of democratic socialism , the successor of the communist party of east germany -rrb- cadre in the east .
the differences will be difficult to reconcile , both for the party platform and the political goals .
what brings the groups together is the protest against social reforms .
in the longer-term they will have a falling out . so the left party is a protest party ?
what will define their constituency ? in the west it will doubtless be the disaffected stalwarts of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , just that unionized milieu from which the spd drew its base over decades .
in the east it will be the old pds voters coming from various societal groupings .
on the one side there is thus the protest voter trying to prevent the east from being treated as second-class , but there is also the old gdr cadre .
it will definitely be a protest party .
when we look to other countries , for example to spain or sweden , we also see similar leftist groupings , also heterogeneous , drawing their members from communists , greens , and leftist activists .
they feed off of the protest against modernization and the liberalization of the welfare state . there it functions on a long-term basis ... yes , since it has to do with very pragmatic , loose alliances , which for the most part remain separate from one another and only come together for the election .
this just wo n't work in germany .
the left party has to position itself .
after the election , problems will surely develop , and so i see little chance that the party will remain together . is the spd seriously threatened by this new alliance ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no longer guaranteed spd voters the spd will definitely suffer losses at its base , the unionized milieu - voters who may not have gone to the polls had this party not materialized .
they must see their chance to express their anger and disappointment with the spd government , a chance to make their frustration known .
this is without doubt a threat for the spd . is the spd responding appropriately to this threat by attempting to slander the new alliance ? the spd has always assumed it was the voice of the left , the voice of the traditional organized labor in the broadest sense .
now there has been for a long , long time a serious competition here .
and the spd shows an allergic reaction and is flip-flopping : on the one hand , it is trying to restore its social competence , the intention to more strongly articulate social justice .
on the other hand they are trying to portray the new alliance as illegitimate .
this is bound to come off badly for those voters disappointed by the schröder government and will motivate them to keep their distance from the spd .
the spd 's strategy is thus not exactly helping them to woo back their base .
but it is difficult to imagine what the spd 's options are at this point . continue reading to find out whether lafontaine is fishing for voters on the extreme right . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de social justice or economic folly ?
the new hard-left grouping in germany , the left party , is sending tremors across the political landscape .
but , the party 's economic program has industry groups and economists shaking their heads , and worrying .
-lrb- aug .
3 , 2005 -rrb- the comeback kid former spd chairman oskar lafontaine has had a tumultuous career in politics , withdrawing twice from the limelight in the past three decades .
but this pugnacious and passionate " napoleon " is back for his waterloo .
-lrb- july 20 , 2005 -rrb- goodbye pds , hello " left party " after much back and forth , germany 's reform communist pds party on sunday voted in favor of joining a new leftist alliance , and agreed to change their name , as expected , to the left party .

the news comes as iran 's new president mahmoud ahmadinejad faces up to tough decisions as he takes over the running of the islamic republic on thursday with the most pressing issue being the diplomatic stand-off with the european union and the united states which he inherited from his predecessor . the former revolutionary guard began his first day in office on thursday but the work of his government begins after saturday , the day he takes the oath of office and announces his cabinet . this weekend is likely to see the new president thrust into a row which could lead to un sanctions if iran does not back down from its threat to restart nuclear work which the europeans and americans suspect might be aimed at building an atomic bomb . on wednesday , iran announced that it would back off its threat to resume suspended uranium conversion activities , a move that was welcomed by the united states .
tehran had said it planned to resume the controversial fuel-cycle work this week but later signaled it would delay the start until saturday , in effect giving more time for diplomacy . new president but no new foreign policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even with ahmadinejad at the reins , there is no guarantee that iran will become a more diplomatic partner in the future .
the new president 's choices will continue to be determined by deference to supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei , iran 's most powerful figure . " he has to consult with the supreme leader , " said an unnamed political analyst in an interview with reuters .
" he came to power with the hardliners ' backing , now he has to satisfy them . " iran 's chief nuclear negotiator hassan rohani , who could be replaced by ahmadinejad , told state television there would be no policy change under any new negotiating team .
" iran 's nuclear policy is ... decided by top officials .
it will not be changed . "
local media have said former state broadcasting chief ali larijani , a hardliner close to the ayatollah , would replace rohani and take charge of the nuclear negotiations with the eu . us encouraged by decision to delay enrichment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nevertheless , the delay in restarting enrichment has given the us in particular cause for hope .
" it certainly is a positive thing that the steps that the iranians had previously suggested they would take have not occurred , " spokesman tom casey told reporters . the united states and its european allies have made clear that any move to restart fuel-cycle activities suspended under an accord struck in november could force them to seek possible un sanctions again iran .
" if they 've heeded those calls , that 's a good thing , " casey told the daily state department briefing . the iranian move gives britain , france and germany time to finalize a new package of economic and security incentives they had been working on to persuade tehran to renounce its enrichment program . a state department official , who asked not to be named , said the europeans had informed washington they would unveil the package over the weekend , perhaps as early as friday .
he gave no other details . iran reiterates nuclear desire to europeans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's isfahan nuclear facility .
but iran has said it remains determined to resume its uranium conversion work at the isfahan plant .
the process is the first step in the cycle to produce fuel for nuclear reactors . in a letter sent to the foreign ministers of the eu-3 on tuesday , hassan rowhani said this " inalienable right can not be the subject of arbitrary and subjective criteria . " " your side has continued to refrain from responding substantively to our proposals , in whole or even in part .
we intend to take a minimal step , " the letter said .
" the islamic republic of iran stringently desires a negotiated resumption of its enrichment activities and is prepared to continue in good faith and in an expeditious and result-oriented manner its negotiations , " it said . the so-called eu-3 were reportedly ready to offer the iranians guaranteed fuel for a nuclear power plant they are building at bushehr and others they may build further down the road .
the package was also expected to include trade benefits , including civilian aircraft and parts iran badly needs , help in joining the world trade organization and a promise to bring tehran into regional security talks . eu , us still at odds over iran deal the united states was initially skeptical about the european initiative to negotiate with iran but changed tack in march and agreed to back the effort .
still , speculation has persisted about potential differences in the us and european positions . the europeans have reportedly flirted with the idea of allowing iran to retain some limited civilian nuclear capacity .
the americans have insisted iran completely halt its fuel cycle work and dismantle its facilities . but the us administration insisted it was on the same page with its trans-atlantic allies as they prepared to make what could be a last-ditch offer to the iranians .
" it would be pretty hard for us to support a process , including the proposals in it , based on things we had n't seen and we had n't agreed with , " said the state department official . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu voices concern for iran nuclear talks eu leaders face an uncertain future in their negotiations with iran over its nuclear program following the election of ultra-conservative president mahmoud ahmadinejad , even warning the talks could be frozen .

the sale represents a big step forward for the troubled retail giant , which suffered the worst crisis in its history in 2004 .
chief executive officer thomas middelhoff said the deal almost completes karstadtquelle 's goal of securing its finances . " this is a major milestone in the turnaround of our company and we are glad that it could be achieved in such a short time , " middelhoff said . the company also announced the sale of its 51-outlet sinnleffers chain to an international investors group comprised of deutsche industrie-holding -lrb- frankfurt -rrb- , hmd partners -lrb- us -rrb- and british real estate investor curzon global partners .
the 124-outlet runners point chain was sold to hannover finanz group .
karstadtquelle did not disclose the sales price of either deal . middelhoff said that staff at all 250 outlets involved in the sales would be taken over by the new owners . " the buyers have stated very clearly that business is to continue in the long run , " he said in an effort to allay fears that department store closures could lead to depressed city centers . concentrating on core business bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the deals leave karstadtquelle free to focus on its remaining core 89 department stores .
the company plans to remodel the stores and add new high-end fashion , furniture and sporting goods lines to draw customers in future . the disposals also give the company " more negotiating space " for future divestments , middelhoff said .
according to the divestment plan released in september , a logistics center in frankfurt is still to be sold . another source of concern for the company is its mail-order business , which saw revenues drop by 6.5 percent in the last quarter .
middelhoff promised a management shake-up of the unit last month . " this business will also be led back into the black , " he said . long-term strategy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new owners of karstadtquelle 's businesses promised to retain all staff karstadtquelle 's troubles reached a peak in 2004 due mainly to poor retail sales , and analysts have said the prognosis does n't look much better for 2005 .
german retail managers are also worried by the prospect of a possible hike in value-added sales tax . however , the company is confident that its restructuring plan will be successful in the long run . " we are glad to report that our margin has improved significantly in the first half of 2005 , " said middelhoff , adding that the company had reduced net debt by 800 million euros , not including the new divestments .
the company has reduced its number of employees by around 25,000 , resulting in a 16 percent decrease in staff costs . " overall , we have taken a large step towards ensuring the future of karstadtquelle , " middelhoff said . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deal reached at karstadtquelle management and unions at karstadtquelle finally reached agreement thursday on a package of measures aimed at pulling the troubled german department store chain out of its current crisis , company officials said .

china and the us have agreed to work together to try and prevent the expansion of the united nations security council to include a further six permanent seats , including one for germany . the contentious bid to enlarge the security council led by germany , japan , brazil and india , collectively known as the group of four or g4 , has met with steady resistance from both washington and beijing over the past months , but their joining forces to block the move is a departure which will likely further dilute any chance of the plan 's success .
speaking after a meeting with his newly-appointed us counterpart , john bolton , in new york , china 's un ambassador , wang guangya said they had agreed on a way to proceed together . " at this stage , i think our objective will be to oppose the g4 , to make sure that they do not have sufficient votes to risk dividing the house , " he said . expansion without division wang stated that the g4 plan would drive a wedge through the 191 un member states , adding that the ultimate objective of both the us and china was expansion without division . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : g4 foreign ministers " we agreed to work together to make sure that our interests are being maintained , which means that we have to work in parallel ways to see that the unity of the un members , the unity of every regional group will not be spoiled because of this maneuver and process , " he added . painfully slow process the issue of reforming the security council , which still reflects the power structure in the aftermath of wwii , has been on the un agenda for several years , but it has so far proved impossible to reach any agreement on exactly how it should be expanded . earlier this year , un secretary general kofi annan told member states that he wanted a decision before a summit of world leaders in september . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united nations general secretary kofi annan there are currently 15 council seats , just five of which are permanent .
the g4 resolution calls for the addition of six new permanent seats without the power of veto , and four non-permanent ones . germany , japan , brazil and india have earmarked four of the six seats for themselves and the remaining two for african nations .
egypt , nigeria and south africa are the leading contenders . bidding for african support heads of state and representatives of the 53-nation african union -lrb- au -rrb- are meeting in the ethiopian capital of addis ababa on thursday to try and reach a common position on the g4 expansion resolution , but there is little hope that the summit will produce any consensus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flags of the african union algeria 's un ambassador , abdallah baali , warned against any expectation of the meeting producing a unified position , " despite efforts to accommodate the g4 . "
delegates from the four aspirant countries are also there to drum up support for their cause . if their resolution is to have any chance of winning the two-thirds majority in a un general assembly vote , the g4 nations will need the support of the african union . for its part , the au is calling for the expansion of the council to 26 seats , with a total of seven new permanent seats with veto rights . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us reportedly opposed to berlin 's un bid us secretary of state condoleezza rice reportedly is opposed to germany 's bid for a permanent seat on the un security council .

but environmental groups themselves are n't so sure . germans who own a car ca n't avoid the fact that 65 cents -lrb- $ 0.80 -rrb- of every euro that goes into their fuel tank flows into state coffers in the form of various energy taxes . it may be a high price to pay in a country that prides itself on its environmentally-friendly policies .
but according to tanja loitz of climate seeks protection , a program supported by the german environment ministry , there are ways to help the environment and save money at the same time .
" most people do not know that most household co2 emissions come from heating , " she said , explaining why one of the campaign 's goals is to reduce the 120 million tons of annual household co2 emissions .
" there is not a lack of interest in the environment , but a lack of factual knowledge . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : home heating releases the most household greenhouse gasses raising awareness by saving money if the numerous recycling programs across the country are any indication , germans already tend to be an environmentally-conscious bunch .
in fact , 74 percent of germans rate protecting the environment as very important , according to a recent study conducted by pollster forsa .
at the same time , most of those surveyed were of different opinions when it came to the question of what could be done about it .
" consumers certainly find the topic interesting , but are only willing to become involved in small degrees if it affects their wallets , " said moritz lehmkuhl , head of climate partner , an organization that tries to raise awareness of climate change among businesses and the public .
" the idea that they should save money and shop for bargains still dominates among consumers . "
who should be held responsible ?
he agreed with loitz on the importance of individual participation if there is a chance of achieving the kyoto protocol 's goals of reducing greenhouse gasses by 5 percent of 1990 levels before 2012 , and that the best way to get people 's attention is by saying it will save them money .
environmental groups also say that minimizing monetary concerns is an effective way of changing daily habits . but some would like to see the government make polluting more costly instead of relying on people to be voluntarily more concerned about their surroundings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friends of the earth germany " people who voluntarily take part are already very environmentally conscious and think about their actions , " said markus steigenberger of friends of the earth germany .
" i do not think voluntary action programs have a large effect on the general population . "
the alternative of legal coercion , however , is not an effective way to make people responsible for their actions , lehmkuhl argued .
" taxes have a negative aftertaste , and with voluntary initiatives you can achieve something extra , " he said .
" it is important to show that people can personally do something . "
climate partner recommends consumers make online purchases through climate friends , a portal that invests sales commissions - exactly how much depends on company specific deals - in sustainable , climate-neutral projects around the world .
legislation more effective bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the average german produces about 11 tons of co2 a year steinberger of friends of the earth said that people who actually use these services to make up for the 11 tons of co2 the average german produces annually are doing the right thing and added that raising environmental awareness is crucial .
at the same time , legislation is the best way to help the environment , he said .
" we need defined goals and legislation that lets business and people act in a climate-friendly way and makes pollution expensive , " steinberger said .
climate seeks protection 's loitz suggests that the most effective laws would focus on rewarding those who prevent pollution rather than doling out punishments for those who cause it .
while environmental groups continue work to get stricter laws enacted and enforced , and climate seeks protection and climate partner continue their voluntary programs , all the groups maintain that increasing the environmental consciousness that keeps greenhouse gasses from being produced is necessary .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de election 2005 -pipe- 04.08.2005 " lafontaine is not a german haider " back to first page back 2/2 many are calling the new alliance populist .
is this justified ? the party is certainly populist in the sense that they rail against change and modernization without really wanting to , or rather being able to say , what they would do differently .
it is a party that wants to excite tempers and encourage protest without being able to give answers .
one could say that this is not necessarily the role of a new opposition party .
it is a chance to express protest and it can lead the established parties to reconsider certain issues . gregor gysi and oskar lafontaine , the former spd chief , will act together as top candidates .
lafontaine in particular has been attacked by the spd and the greens .
he was given the epithet of " german haider -lrb- austria 's right-wing populist politician -rrb- , " fishing for votes on the extreme right .
what do you think of this accusation ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jörg haider recently split from the populist freedom party he founded and started a new right-wing alliance no , in my opinion you ca n't look at it that way .
the charge goes back to a speech lafontaine made , in which he spoke of " alien workers , " a concept from the rightist camp .
when one looks at the political development of lafontaine , i do n't think it 's fair to speak of a rightist leaning or an attempt to court rightist voters .
lafontaine has always been a nonconformist , someone who has always taken positions not directly in line with that of his party .
he is continuing with this .
so the comparison with haider is not justified . but does lafontaine really offer any sensible remedies ? lafontaine has , since his retreat from the federal government , been constantly appealing to the public , whether in publications or in talk shows , spreading his view of things - that is , a state control of the globalized economy .
he has time and again been criticized , that his solutions are completely unrealistic .
for himself and for the groupings he stands for , this is a reasonable answer to globalization .
it is , however , in the current situation , no adequate response .
it is impossible to see how a strong governmental , national control could be implemented at the european level .
should lafontaine be asked to implement his policies in the real world , then his alliance would really dissolve quite quickly .
but as an opposition party , as a protest party , such goals are legitimate .
it is an opportunity for disgruntled voters to express that they do not agree with the course and the pace of the reforms .
thus the party fulfills a democratic function . steffen leidel interviewed klaus detterbeck -lrb- jc -rrb- back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de social justice or economic folly ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 04.08.2005 eu all but clears germany in visa affair großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer took responsibility for the 2000 visa policy directive germany 's visa policy of 2000 violated a number of eu laws , the european commission said thursday , but subsequent amendments have been enough to avoid legal action .
however , some doubts remain . germany escaped legal action after the european commission ruled on thursday that while the lax system at the heart of the german visa scandal violated european union norms , berlin had since remedied the problem with a reformed policy that complies with eu rules . the scandal , for which foreign minister joschka fischer has accepted responsibility , revolves around the loose visa policies that allowed thousands of criminals and illegal workers , mainly from ukraine , to enter germany between 2000 and 2002 . commission spokesman friso roscam abbing told a news briefing that the german policy circular issued by fischer in 2000 , which the christian democrat opposition describes as an opening of " the floodgates to a wave of unsuitable migrants , " did not comply with a range of european directives or laws . fischer 's circular contravened eu laws " the 2000 -lrb- instruction -rrb- was not compatible with schengen law , with eu law , with the common consular instructions , " abbing said .
justice and security commissioner franco frattini added that the 2000 circular that was the basis for the easier policy " ran counter to the common consular instructions -lrb- cci -rrb- " . bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer passes the entrance of a parliamentary panel investigating the visa scandal in april . the directive from fischer 's office ordered german consulates , notably in eastern europe , to give applicants the benefit of the doubt if they could not fully justify their financial means of support or the purpose of their trip . however , after the german foreign ministry had been plunged into a crisis concerning the visas and a flood of migrants , the visa policy was amended to the satisfaction of the eu 's executive .
" an examination of the guiding circular of oct .
26 , 2004 ... leads to the conclusion that the breaches of the cci in the previous circulars have been remedied , " frattini said . breaches remedied but questions remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franco frattini , eu justice commissioner frattini did point out , however , that some points in the 2004 circular were unclear and would benefit from clarification , but these were not grounds to invalidate the german policy , he said . the german foreign ministry welcomed the commission 's assessment that the german rules now met eu requirements . the almost disastrous political lesson learnt by the germans showed that countries should be aware that there was no place for liberal interpretations in national legislation or instructions of common eu visa regulations adopted for the schengen passport-free travel area , frattini added . conservative lawmaker targets red-green coalition however , while the commission appeared to close the book on the incident , others were not so quick to let germany off the hook .
opposition german eu lawmaker jochim würmeling challenged the commission to investigate berlin 's new policies , claiming that these too were flawed . würmeling , who said that the commission ruling on germany 's current visa policy was " in no way a virtual acquittal , " explained that while there were still discrepancies between the german and the european rules on the burden of proof for visa applicants there was a " grave deviation " from eu law , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : calling the commission 's analysis of the 2000 rules " damning , " würmeling then turned on the social democratic-green coalition government saying that its attitude to the visa policy showed " just how crass this wrong decision taken by the government was . " " one gets the impression that the ... government was completely indifferent to what eu rules said about issuing visas , " he said . visa scandal to cast shadow over election würmeling intends to raise the issue again in an attempt to hold the german government accountable in a question time session with frattini when the eu parliament reconvenes in september , just two weeks before likely german elections . it could be perfect timing for the opposition parties in germany who have been hounding gerhard schröder 's government for months over the scandal . the visa affair has weakened the bond between the ruling coalition , with ministers forced to testify before a parliamentary commission of inquiry and blame being passed between parties and departments before fischer took the hit for the team . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de probe into visa affair must go on germany 's highest court on wednesday thwarted a bid by the embattled government to wrap up a parliamentary probe into what 's become known as the " visa affair " ahead of likely elections in september .

a political scientist offers answers . the political scientist and party researcher klaus detterbeck teaches at the institute for political science at the university of magdeburg . dw-world : what chances do you give the new leftist alliance in the expedited bundestag elections ? klaus detterbeck : i would put the chances relatively high .
i would , however , differentiate between a short-term success for the bundestag elections , and the long-term perspective , which i view more critically .
in the short-term , the party has the opportunity to fill a vacuum which exists in the current competition between the parties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators protesting in berlin against social welfare cuts for the voters in western germany there has been no outlet to express frustrations with reform of the social welfare system , the effects of market liberalization .
here the party is filling a gap .
in the long-term i see the problem that the alliance parties are actually quite heterogeneous , that both at the grassroots as well as the leadership level there are significant differences between the labor union members in the west and the old pds -lrb- party of democratic socialism , the successor of the communist party of east germany -rrb- cadre in the east .
the differences will be difficult to reconcile , both for the party platform and the political goals .
what brings the groups together is the protest against social reforms .
in the longer-term they will have a falling out . so the left party is a protest party ?
what will define their constituency ? in the west it will doubtless be the disaffected stalwarts of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , just that unionized milieu from which the spd drew its base over decades .
in the east it will be the old pds voters coming from various societal groupings .
on the one side there is thus the protest voter trying to prevent the east from being treated as second-class , but there is also the old gdr cadre .
it will definitely be a protest party .
when we look to other countries , for example to spain or sweden , we also see similar leftist groupings , also heterogeneous , drawing their members from communists , greens , and leftist activists .
they feed off of the protest against modernization and the liberalization of the welfare state . there it functions on a long-term basis ... yes , since it has to do with very pragmatic , loose alliances , which for the most part remain separate from one another and only come together for the election .
this just wo n't work in germany .
the left party has to position itself .
after the election , problems will surely develop , and so i see little chance that the party will remain together . is the spd seriously threatened by this new alliance ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no longer guaranteed spd voters the spd will definitely suffer losses at its base , the unionized milieu - voters who may not have gone to the polls had this party not materialized .
they must see their chance to express their anger and disappointment with the spd government , a chance to make their frustration known .
this is without doubt a threat for the spd . is the spd responding appropriately to this threat by attempting to slander the new alliance ? the spd has always assumed it was the voice of the left , the voice of the traditional organized labor in the broadest sense .
now there has been for a long , long time a serious competition here .
and the spd shows an allergic reaction and is flip-flopping : on the one hand , it is trying to restore its social competence , the intention to more strongly articulate social justice .
on the other hand they are trying to portray the new alliance as illegitimate .
this is bound to come off badly for those voters disappointed by the schröder government and will motivate them to keep their distance from the spd .
the spd 's strategy is thus not exactly helping them to woo back their base .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 04.08.2005 the cost of environmental pollution germany may be an eco-friendly place , but support for the environment does come at a price - a fact that some organizations are trying to disprove .
but environmental groups themselves are n't so sure . germans who own a car ca n't avoid the fact that 65 cents -lrb- $ 0.80 -rrb- of every euro that goes into their fuel tank flows into state coffers in the form of various energy taxes . it may be a high price to pay in a country that prides itself on its environmentally-friendly policies .
but according to tanja loitz of climate seeks protection , a program supported by the german environment ministry , there are ways to help the environment and save money at the same time .
" most people do not know that most household co2 emissions come from heating , " she said , explaining why one of the campaign 's goals is to reduce the 120 million tons of annual household co2 emissions .
" there is not a lack of interest in the environment , but a lack of factual knowledge . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : home heating releases the most household greenhouse gasses raising awareness by saving money if the numerous recycling programs across the country are any indication , germans already tend to be an environmentally-conscious bunch .
in fact , 74 percent of germans rate protecting the environment as very important , according to a recent study conducted by pollster forsa .
at the same time , most of those surveyed were of different opinions when it came to the question of what could be done about it .
" consumers certainly find the topic interesting , but are only willing to become involved in small degrees if it affects their wallets , " said moritz lehmkuhl , head of climate partner , an organization that tries to raise awareness of climate change among businesses and the public .
" the idea that they should save money and shop for bargains still dominates among consumers . "
who should be held responsible ?
he agreed with loitz on the importance of individual participation if there is a chance of achieving the kyoto protocol 's goals of reducing greenhouse gasses by 5 percent of 1990 levels before 2012 , and that the best way to get people 's attention is by saying it will save them money .
environmental groups also say that minimizing monetary concerns is an effective way of changing daily habits . but some would like to see the government make polluting more costly instead of relying on people to be voluntarily more concerned about their surroundings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friends of the earth germany " people who voluntarily take part are already very environmentally conscious and think about their actions , " said markus steigenberger of friends of the earth germany .
" i do not think voluntary action programs have a large effect on the general population . "
the alternative of legal coercion , however , is not an effective way to make people responsible for their actions , lehmkuhl argued .
" taxes have a negative aftertaste , and with voluntary initiatives you can achieve something extra , " he said .
" it is important to show that people can personally do something . "
climate partner recommends consumers make online purchases through climate friends , a portal that invests sales commissions - exactly how much depends on company specific deals - in sustainable , climate-neutral projects around the world .
legislation more effective bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the average german produces about 11 tons of co2 a year steinberger of friends of the earth said that people who actually use these services to make up for the 11 tons of co2 the average german produces annually are doing the right thing and added that raising environmental awareness is crucial .
at the same time , legislation is the best way to help the environment , he said .
" we need defined goals and legislation that lets business and people act in a climate-friendly way and makes pollution expensive , " steinberger said .
climate seeks protection 's loitz suggests that the most effective laws would focus on rewarding those who prevent pollution rather than doling out punishments for those who cause it .
while environmental groups continue work to get stricter laws enacted and enforced , and climate seeks protection and climate partner continue their voluntary programs , all the groups maintain that increasing the environmental consciousness that keeps greenhouse gasses from being produced is necessary .
there is , after all , no way to get co2 back in the bottle once it 's emitted . sean sinico , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de goal for germany and the environment in just over 13 months , millions of soccer fans will descend on germany for the world cup .

china and the us have agreed to work together to try and prevent the expansion of the united nations security council to include a further six permanent seats , including one for germany . the contentious bid to enlarge the security council led by germany , japan , brazil and india , collectively known as the group of four or g4 , has met with steady resistance from both washington and beijing over the past months , but their joining forces to block the move is a departure which will likely further dilute any chance of the plan 's success .
speaking after a meeting with his newly-appointed us counterpart , john bolton , in new york , china 's un ambassador , wang guangya said they had agreed on a way to proceed together . " at this stage , i think our objective will be to oppose the g4 , to make sure that they do not have sufficient votes to risk dividing the house , " he said . expansion without division wang stated that the g4 plan would drive a wedge through the 191 un member states , adding that the ultimate objective of both the us and china was expansion without division . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : g4 foreign ministers " we agreed to work together to make sure that our interests are being maintained , which means that we have to work in parallel ways to see that the unity of the un members , the unity of every regional group will not be spoiled because of this maneuver and process , " he added . painfully slow process the issue of reforming the security council , which still reflects the power structure in the aftermath of wwii , has been on the un agenda for several years , but it has so far proved impossible to reach any agreement on exactly how it should be expanded . earlier this year , un secretary general kofi annan told member states that he wanted a decision before a summit of world leaders in september . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united nations general secretary kofi annan there are currently 15 council seats , just five of which are permanent .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 04.08.2005 the cost of environmental pollution germany may be an eco-friendly place , but support for the environment does come at a price - a fact that some organizations are trying to disprove .
but environmental groups themselves are n't so sure . germans who own a car ca n't avoid the fact that 65 cents -lrb- $ 0.80 -rrb- of every euro that goes into their fuel tank flows into state coffers in the form of various energy taxes . it may be a high price to pay in a country that prides itself on its environmentally-friendly policies .
but according to tanja loitz of climate seeks protection , a program supported by the german environment ministry , there are ways to help the environment and save money at the same time .
" most people do not know that most household co2 emissions come from heating , " she said , explaining why one of the campaign 's goals is to reduce the 120 million tons of annual household co2 emissions .
" there is not a lack of interest in the environment , but a lack of factual knowledge . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : home heating releases the most household greenhouse gasses raising awareness by saving money if the numerous recycling programs across the country are any indication , germans already tend to be an environmentally-conscious bunch .
in fact , 74 percent of germans rate protecting the environment as very important , according to a recent study conducted by pollster forsa .
at the same time , most of those surveyed were of different opinions when it came to the question of what could be done about it .
" consumers certainly find the topic interesting , but are only willing to become involved in small degrees if it affects their wallets , " said moritz lehmkuhl , head of climate partner , an organization that tries to raise awareness of climate change among businesses and the public .
" the idea that they should save money and shop for bargains still dominates among consumers . "
who should be held responsible ?
he agreed with loitz on the importance of individual participation if there is a chance of achieving the kyoto protocol 's goals of reducing greenhouse gasses by 5 percent of 1990 levels before 2012 , and that the best way to get people 's attention is by saying it will save them money .
environmental groups also say that minimizing monetary concerns is an effective way of changing daily habits . but some would like to see the government make polluting more costly instead of relying on people to be voluntarily more concerned about their surroundings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friends of the earth germany " people who voluntarily take part are already very environmentally conscious and think about their actions , " said markus steigenberger of friends of the earth germany .
" i do not think voluntary action programs have a large effect on the general population . "
the alternative of legal coercion , however , is not an effective way to make people responsible for their actions , lehmkuhl argued .
" taxes have a negative aftertaste , and with voluntary initiatives you can achieve something extra , " he said .
" it is important to show that people can personally do something . "
climate partner recommends consumers make online purchases through climate friends , a portal that invests sales commissions - exactly how much depends on company specific deals - in sustainable , climate-neutral projects around the world .
legislation more effective bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the average german produces about 11 tons of co2 a year steinberger of friends of the earth said that people who actually use these services to make up for the 11 tons of co2 the average german produces annually are doing the right thing and added that raising environmental awareness is crucial .
at the same time , legislation is the best way to help the environment , he said .
" we need defined goals and legislation that lets business and people act in a climate-friendly way and makes pollution expensive , " steinberger said .
climate seeks protection 's loitz suggests that the most effective laws would focus on rewarding those who prevent pollution rather than doling out punishments for those who cause it .
while environmental groups continue work to get stricter laws enacted and enforced , and climate seeks protection and climate partner continue their voluntary programs , all the groups maintain that increasing the environmental consciousness that keeps greenhouse gasses from being produced is necessary .
there is , after all , no way to get co2 back in the bottle once it 's emitted . sean sinico , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de goal for germany and the environment in just over 13 months , millions of soccer fans will descend on germany for the world cup .

the sale represents a big step forward for the troubled retail giant , which suffered the worst crisis in its history in 2004 .
chief executive officer thomas middelhoff said the deal almost completes karstadtquelle 's goal of securing its finances . " this is a major milestone in the turnaround of our company and we are glad that it could be achieved in such a short time , " middelhoff said . the company also announced the sale of its 51-outlet sinnleffers chain to an international investors group comprised of deutsche industrie-holding -lrb- frankfurt -rrb- , hmd partners -lrb- us -rrb- and british real estate investor curzon global partners .
the 124-outlet runners point chain was sold to hannover finanz group .
karstadtquelle did not disclose the sales price of either deal . middelhoff said that staff at all 250 outlets involved in the sales would be taken over by the new owners . " the buyers have stated very clearly that business is to continue in the long run , " he said in an effort to allay fears that department store closures could lead to depressed city centers . concentrating on core business bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the deals leave karstadtquelle free to focus on its remaining core 89 department stores .
the company plans to remodel the stores and add new high-end fashion , furniture and sporting goods lines to draw customers in future . the disposals also give the company " more negotiating space " for future divestments , middelhoff said .
according to the divestment plan released in september , a logistics center in frankfurt is still to be sold . another source of concern for the company is its mail-order business , which saw revenues drop by 6.5 percent in the last quarter .
middelhoff promised a management shake-up of the unit last month . " this business will also be led back into the black , " he said . long-term strategy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new owners of karstadtquelle 's businesses promised to retain all staff karstadtquelle 's troubles reached a peak in 2004 due mainly to poor retail sales , and analysts have said the prognosis does n't look much better for 2005 .
german retail managers are also worried by the prospect of a possible hike in value-added sales tax . however , the company is confident that its restructuring plan will be successful in the long run . " we are glad to report that our margin has improved significantly in the first half of 2005 , " said middelhoff , adding that the company had reduced net debt by 800 million euros , not including the new divestments .
the company has reduced its number of employees by around 25,000 , resulting in a 16 percent decrease in staff costs . " overall , we have taken a large step towards ensuring the future of karstadtquelle , " middelhoff said . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deal reached at karstadtquelle management and unions at karstadtquelle finally reached agreement thursday on a package of measures aimed at pulling the troubled german department store chain out of its current crisis , company officials said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 04.08.2005 eu all but clears germany in visa affair großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer took responsibility for the 2000 visa policy directive germany 's visa policy of 2000 violated a number of eu laws , the european commission said thursday , but subsequent amendments have been enough to avoid legal action .
however , some doubts remain . germany escaped legal action after the european commission ruled on thursday that while the lax system at the heart of the german visa scandal violated european union norms , berlin had since remedied the problem with a reformed policy that complies with eu rules . the scandal , for which foreign minister joschka fischer has accepted responsibility , revolves around the loose visa policies that allowed thousands of criminals and illegal workers , mainly from ukraine , to enter germany between 2000 and 2002 . commission spokesman friso roscam abbing told a news briefing that the german policy circular issued by fischer in 2000 , which the christian democrat opposition describes as an opening of " the floodgates to a wave of unsuitable migrants , " did not comply with a range of european directives or laws . fischer 's circular contravened eu laws " the 2000 -lrb- instruction -rrb- was not compatible with schengen law , with eu law , with the common consular instructions , " abbing said .
justice and security commissioner franco frattini added that the 2000 circular that was the basis for the easier policy " ran counter to the common consular instructions -lrb- cci -rrb- " . bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer passes the entrance of a parliamentary panel investigating the visa scandal in april . the directive from fischer 's office ordered german consulates , notably in eastern europe , to give applicants the benefit of the doubt if they could not fully justify their financial means of support or the purpose of their trip . however , after the german foreign ministry had been plunged into a crisis concerning the visas and a flood of migrants , the visa policy was amended to the satisfaction of the eu 's executive .
" an examination of the guiding circular of oct .
26 , 2004 ... leads to the conclusion that the breaches of the cci in the previous circulars have been remedied , " frattini said . breaches remedied but questions remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franco frattini , eu justice commissioner frattini did point out , however , that some points in the 2004 circular were unclear and would benefit from clarification , but these were not grounds to invalidate the german policy , he said . the german foreign ministry welcomed the commission 's assessment that the german rules now met eu requirements . the almost disastrous political lesson learnt by the germans showed that countries should be aware that there was no place for liberal interpretations in national legislation or instructions of common eu visa regulations adopted for the schengen passport-free travel area , frattini added . conservative lawmaker targets red-green coalition however , while the commission appeared to close the book on the incident , others were not so quick to let germany off the hook .
opposition german eu lawmaker jochim würmeling challenged the commission to investigate berlin 's new policies , claiming that these too were flawed . würmeling , who said that the commission ruling on germany 's current visa policy was " in no way a virtual acquittal , " explained that while there were still discrepancies between the german and the european rules on the burden of proof for visa applicants there was a " grave deviation " from eu law , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : calling the commission 's analysis of the 2000 rules " damning , " würmeling then turned on the social democratic-green coalition government saying that its attitude to the visa policy showed " just how crass this wrong decision taken by the government was . " " one gets the impression that the ... government was completely indifferent to what eu rules said about issuing visas , " he said . visa scandal to cast shadow over election würmeling intends to raise the issue again in an attempt to hold the german government accountable in a question time session with frattini when the eu parliament reconvenes in september , just two weeks before likely german elections . it could be perfect timing for the opposition parties in germany who have been hounding gerhard schröder 's government for months over the scandal . the visa affair has weakened the bond between the ruling coalition , with ministers forced to testify before a parliamentary commission of inquiry and blame being passed between parties and departments before fischer took the hit for the team . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de probe into visa affair must go on germany 's highest court on wednesday thwarted a bid by the embattled government to wrap up a parliamentary probe into what 's become known as the " visa affair " ahead of likely elections in september .

" it is certainly a very big police operation today , " andy trotter , the metropolitan police 's deputy assistant commissioner , told bbc radio .
" we are out there to reassure londoners and also to deter any further attacks on the system , " trotter added .
" london is at a very high state of alert . " al qaeda deputy issues warning of more attacks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fuelling fears of another terrorist strike , al qaeda leader osama bin laden 's right-hand man , ayman al-zawahiri , warned britain and the united states they would face more attacks , in a video broadcast thursday .
" these policies -lrb- of british prime minister tony blair -rrb- will bring them more destruction after the explosions of london , " he said in the footage , shown on the al-jazeera satellite channel . zawahiri also threatened the united states with " horror that would make them forget the horror they saw in vietnam , " referring to the war in that country . four weeks ago on july 7 , a nightmare came true for britons when four suicide bombers blew themselves up on three underground trains and a double-decker bus , killing 52 people and injuring hundreds more . a fortnight later , another gang apparently tried to carry out a copycat atrocity that backfired when their bombs failed to detonate properly . britain 's worst terror scourge has sparked an unprecedented manhunt that has resulted in scores of arrests both here and overseas . first july 21 suspect remanded in custody bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a judge thursday ordered the first suspect to be charged in britain in connection with the july 21 attacks to be remanded in custody until a further hearing on august 11 . ismael abdurahman , 23 , is charged with failing to disclose information to police about a man suspected of trying to blow up a train in shepherd 's bush , west london .
that suspect , hamdi issac , was arrested in rome last week . abdurahman did not enter a formal plea but his lawyer ann faul said he denied any connections to terrorism .
" i have been instructed to tell the court he is , and will be , vigorously contesting this charge and that he has no involvement in any terrorist activity whatsoever , " she said . abdurahman was arrested on july 28 in south london and faces a maximum sentence of five years in prison if convicted .
the man is not one of the four key suspects accused of carrying out the operation , whose pictures were released after the abortive bombings . extensive manhunt getting results bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the british authorities are holding a total of 14 people in custody in relation to the attacks , including three of the suspected would-be bombers , while hamdi issac , a fourth bomb suspect , is held in italy and is due to face an extradition hearing on august 17 . in a fast-moving international investigation , zambia announced wednesday that it would deport haroon aswat , the alleged mastermind behind london 's first attacks on july 7 , who was arrested in the capital lusaka two weeks ago . back in london , commuters and tourists were putting on a brave face despite jitters about another attack . london jittery as thursday comes round again bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " it is the first thing i thought of this morning - it is thursday , something is bound to happen because it is thursday , " said rosemary gajlmal , 20 , a waitress at a bagel restaurant in central london , as she stepped off one of the capital 's red buses , which was full of passengers . plenty of people were also using the underground network , which ran an almost normal service for the first time since the july 7 bombings with the piccadilly line fully restored and a limited service on the circle line . passenger numbers on the subway have plunged 30 percent at weekends and between five to 15 percent on weekdays since the july 7 bombings . but transport for london said this was largely due to some of the network being out of action , and predicted that levels would soon return to normal . reports that the the families of victims killed in the july 7 attacks will be eligible for up to 16,000 euros -lrb- $ 20,000 -rrb- in government compensation have been met by derision by british victims ' groups who say the compensation is far too little . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the home office confirmed the reports and added that those most seriously injured in the blasts will be eligible for up to 360,000 euros , a spokeswoman for told afp .

" it is certainly a very big police operation today , " andy trotter , the metropolitan police 's deputy assistant commissioner , told bbc radio .
" we are out there to reassure londoners and also to deter any further attacks on the system , " trotter added .

" these policies -lrb- of british prime minister tony blair -rrb- will bring them more destruction after the explosions of london , " he said in the footage , shown on the al-jazeera satellite channel . zawahiri also threatened the united states with " horror that would make them forget the horror they saw in vietnam , " referring to the war in that country . four weeks ago on july 7 , a nightmare came true for britons when four suicide bombers blew themselves up on three underground trains and a double-decker bus , killing 52 people and injuring hundreds more . a fortnight later , another gang apparently tried to carry out a copycat atrocity that backfired when their bombs failed to detonate properly . britain 's worst terror scourge has sparked an unprecedented manhunt that has resulted in scores of arrests both here and overseas . first july 21 suspect remanded in custody bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a judge thursday ordered the first suspect to be charged in britain in connection with the july 21 attacks to be remanded in custody until a further hearing on august 11 . ismael abdurahman , 23 , is charged with failing to disclose information to police about a man suspected of trying to blow up a train in shepherd 's bush , west london .
that suspect , hamdi issac , was arrested in rome last week . abdurahman did not enter a formal plea but his lawyer ann faul said he denied any connections to terrorism .
" i have been instructed to tell the court he is , and will be , vigorously contesting this charge and that he has no involvement in any terrorist activity whatsoever , " she said . abdurahman was arrested on july 28 in south london and faces a maximum sentence of five years in prison if convicted .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de election 2005 -pipe- 04.08.2005 " lafontaine is not a german haider " back to first page back 2/2 many are calling the new alliance populist .
is this justified ? the party is certainly populist in the sense that they rail against change and modernization without really wanting to , or rather being able to say , what they would do differently .
it is a party that wants to excite tempers and encourage protest without being able to give answers .
one could say that this is not necessarily the role of a new opposition party .
it is a chance to express protest and it can lead the established parties to reconsider certain issues . gregor gysi and oskar lafontaine , the former spd chief , will act together as top candidates .
lafontaine in particular has been attacked by the spd and the greens .
he was given the epithet of " german haider -lrb- austria 's right-wing populist politician -rrb- , " fishing for votes on the extreme right .
what do you think of this accusation ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jörg haider recently split from the populist freedom party he founded and started a new right-wing alliance no , in my opinion you ca n't look at it that way .
the charge goes back to a speech lafontaine made , in which he spoke of " alien workers , " a concept from the rightist camp .
when one looks at the political development of lafontaine , i do n't think it 's fair to speak of a rightist leaning or an attempt to court rightist voters .
lafontaine has always been a nonconformist , someone who has always taken positions not directly in line with that of his party .
he is continuing with this .
so the comparison with haider is not justified . but does lafontaine really offer any sensible remedies ? lafontaine has , since his retreat from the federal government , been constantly appealing to the public , whether in publications or in talk shows , spreading his view of things - that is , a state control of the globalized economy .
he has time and again been criticized , that his solutions are completely unrealistic .
for himself and for the groupings he stands for , this is a reasonable answer to globalization .
it is , however , in the current situation , no adequate response .
it is impossible to see how a strong governmental , national control could be implemented at the european level .
should lafontaine be asked to implement his policies in the real world , then his alliance would really dissolve quite quickly .
but as an opposition party , as a protest party , such goals are legitimate .
it is an opportunity for disgruntled voters to express that they do not agree with the course and the pace of the reforms .
thus the party fulfills a democratic function . steffen leidel interviewed klaus detterbeck -lrb- jc -rrb- back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de social justice or economic folly ?

the sale represents a big step forward for the troubled retail giant , which suffered the worst crisis in its history in 2004 .
chief executive officer thomas middelhoff said the deal almost completes karstadtquelle 's goal of securing its finances . " this is a major milestone in the turnaround of our company and we are glad that it could be achieved in such a short time , " middelhoff said . the company also announced the sale of its 51-outlet sinnleffers chain to an international investors group comprised of deutsche industrie-holding -lrb- frankfurt -rrb- , hmd partners -lrb- us -rrb- and british real estate investor curzon global partners .
the 124-outlet runners point chain was sold to hannover finanz group .
karstadtquelle did not disclose the sales price of either deal . middelhoff said that staff at all 250 outlets involved in the sales would be taken over by the new owners . " the buyers have stated very clearly that business is to continue in the long run , " he said in an effort to allay fears that department store closures could lead to depressed city centers . concentrating on core business bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the deals leave karstadtquelle free to focus on its remaining core 89 department stores .
the company plans to remodel the stores and add new high-end fashion , furniture and sporting goods lines to draw customers in future . the disposals also give the company " more negotiating space " for future divestments , middelhoff said .
according to the divestment plan released in september , a logistics center in frankfurt is still to be sold . another source of concern for the company is its mail-order business , which saw revenues drop by 6.5 percent in the last quarter .
middelhoff promised a management shake-up of the unit last month . " this business will also be led back into the black , " he said . long-term strategy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new owners of karstadtquelle 's businesses promised to retain all staff karstadtquelle 's troubles reached a peak in 2004 due mainly to poor retail sales , and analysts have said the prognosis does n't look much better for 2005 .
german retail managers are also worried by the prospect of a possible hike in value-added sales tax . however , the company is confident that its restructuring plan will be successful in the long run . " we are glad to report that our margin has improved significantly in the first half of 2005 , " said middelhoff , adding that the company had reduced net debt by 800 million euros , not including the new divestments .
the company has reduced its number of employees by around 25,000 , resulting in a 16 percent decrease in staff costs .

but their mandate is still unclear . around 100 unarmed military and civilian officials from the european union will monitor the implementation of a peace pact between the indonesian government and the separatist free aceh movement -lrb- gam -rrb- .
they will be joined by an equal number of monitors from the association of southeast asian nations -lrb- asean -rrb- . indonesia and gam tentatively reached a deal on july 17 to end almost 30 years of war , in which close to 15,000 people have died .
their pact includes the disarmament of rebels and a troop withdrawal from aceh . the pact is due to be signed on august 15 in helsinki - two days before the 60th anniversary of indonesian independence .
a 28-strong team of european and southeast asian officials visited banda aceh this week to make logistical preparations for the monitoring mission , which could begin shortly after the pact is signed . but the mission has so far only been defined in general terms .
a protocol of measures to take should the pact be violated has not been agreed on , nor has the length of the mission .
these and other details are expected to be addressed in the coming weeks . no reconstruction without peace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a local volunteer walks past a wall graffiti ' good by -lrb- e -rrb- banda aceh ' on a shop shutter in january in banda aceh , indonesia aceh was particularly hard hit by last december 's tsunami , and one could expect that the vast amount of reconstruction work still to be done might take precedence over the peace accord .
but the former eu representative in jakarta , ana maria gomes , said the accord ca n't wait . " we 're of the opinion that it 's only through an acceleration of the peace process that the reconstruction process can really begin to move forward , " gomes said .
" we 're offering our support for the peace process , and we 'll try to accommodate the wishes of the indonesian government . " however , it 's questionable whether all the wishes of the indonesian side can really be fulfilled .
indonesia 's military chief , endriartono sutarto , has requested that soldiers should be included among the monitors , in order to be able to react immediately should an emergency arise .
the eu framework , though , expressly excludes a military component from this type of mission . risk of failure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two soldiers guard the baiturrahman mosque on election day , in sept .
2004 , in banda aceh , indonesia generally the impression from jakarta is that it 's not overly keen to see the start of the international mission .
there 's considerable danger that not only gam hardliners , but also those within the indonesian military , could quickly foil the aims of the peace mission .
it would n't be the first time : in 2002 , a dozen observers from thailand and the philippines watched over a short-lived truce that ended as the spiral of violence grew out of control . the hope this time is that the aftermath of the devastating tsunami in indonesia will be enough to convince both sides in the aceh conflict to give peace - and reconstruction - a chance . tobias grote-beverborg -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tsunami relief all positive government says around five months after the tsunami disaster in south asia , berlin presented an optimistic preliminary report .

but their mandate is still unclear . around 100 unarmed military and civilian officials from the european union will monitor the implementation of a peace pact between the indonesian government and the separatist free aceh movement -lrb- gam -rrb- .
they will be joined by an equal number of monitors from the association of southeast asian nations -lrb- asean -rrb- . indonesia and gam tentatively reached a deal on july 17 to end almost 30 years of war , in which close to 15,000 people have died .
their pact includes the disarmament of rebels and a troop withdrawal from aceh . the pact is due to be signed on august 15 in helsinki - two days before the 60th anniversary of indonesian independence .

" it is certainly a very big police operation today , " andy trotter , the metropolitan police 's deputy assistant commissioner , told bbc radio .
" we are out there to reassure londoners and also to deter any further attacks on the system , " trotter added .
" london is at a very high state of alert . " al qaeda deputy issues warning of more attacks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fuelling fears of another terrorist strike , al qaeda leader osama bin laden 's right-hand man , ayman al-zawahiri , warned britain and the united states they would face more attacks , in a video broadcast thursday .
" these policies -lrb- of british prime minister tony blair -rrb- will bring them more destruction after the explosions of london , " he said in the footage , shown on the al-jazeera satellite channel . zawahiri also threatened the united states with " horror that would make them forget the horror they saw in vietnam , " referring to the war in that country . four weeks ago on july 7 , a nightmare came true for britons when four suicide bombers blew themselves up on three underground trains and a double-decker bus , killing 52 people and injuring hundreds more . a fortnight later , another gang apparently tried to carry out a copycat atrocity that backfired when their bombs failed to detonate properly . britain 's worst terror scourge has sparked an unprecedented manhunt that has resulted in scores of arrests both here and overseas . first july 21 suspect remanded in custody bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a judge thursday ordered the first suspect to be charged in britain in connection with the july 21 attacks to be remanded in custody until a further hearing on august 11 . ismael abdurahman , 23 , is charged with failing to disclose information to police about a man suspected of trying to blow up a train in shepherd 's bush , west london .

is this justified ? the party is certainly populist in the sense that they rail against change and modernization without really wanting to , or rather being able to say , what they would do differently .
it is a party that wants to excite tempers and encourage protest without being able to give answers .

for himself and for the groupings he stands for , this is a reasonable answer to globalization .
it is , however , in the current situation , no adequate response .
it is impossible to see how a strong governmental , national control could be implemented at the european level .

on the one side there is thus the protest voter trying to prevent the east from being treated as second-class , but there is also the old gdr cadre .

how dangerous is it for the social democrats ?
is the left party 's new front man , oskar lafontaine , wooing right wing voters ?
a political scientist offers answers . the political scientist and party researcher klaus detterbeck teaches at the institute for political science at the university of magdeburg . dw-world : what chances do you give the new leftist alliance in the expedited bundestag elections ? klaus detterbeck : i would put the chances relatively high .
i would , however , differentiate between a short-term success for the bundestag elections , and the long-term perspective , which i view more critically .
in the short-term , the party has the opportunity to fill a vacuum which exists in the current competition between the parties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators protesting in berlin against social welfare cuts for the voters in western germany there has been no outlet to express frustrations with reform of the social welfare system , the effects of market liberalization .
here the party is filling a gap .
in the long-term i see the problem that the alliance parties are actually quite heterogeneous , that both at the grassroots as well as the leadership level there are significant differences between the labor union members in the west and the old pds -lrb- party of democratic socialism , the successor of the communist party of east germany -rrb- cadre in the east .
the differences will be difficult to reconcile , both for the party platform and the political goals .
what brings the groups together is the protest against social reforms .
in the longer-term they will have a falling out . so the left party is a protest party ?
what will define their constituency ? in the west it will doubtless be the disaffected stalwarts of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , just that unionized milieu from which the spd drew its base over decades .
in the east it will be the old pds voters coming from various societal groupings .
on the one side there is thus the protest voter trying to prevent the east from being treated as second-class , but there is also the old gdr cadre .
it will definitely be a protest party .
when we look to other countries , for example to spain or sweden , we also see similar leftist groupings , also heterogeneous , drawing their members from communists , greens , and leftist activists .
they feed off of the protest against modernization and the liberalization of the welfare state . there it functions on a long-term basis ... yes , since it has to do with very pragmatic , loose alliances , which for the most part remain separate from one another and only come together for the election .
this just wo n't work in germany .
the left party has to position itself .
after the election , problems will surely develop , and so i see little chance that the party will remain together . is the spd seriously threatened by this new alliance ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no longer guaranteed spd voters the spd will definitely suffer losses at its base , the unionized milieu - voters who may not have gone to the polls had this party not materialized .
they must see their chance to express their anger and disappointment with the spd government , a chance to make their frustration known .
this is without doubt a threat for the spd . is the spd responding appropriately to this threat by attempting to slander the new alliance ? the spd has always assumed it was the voice of the left , the voice of the traditional organized labor in the broadest sense .
now there has been for a long , long time a serious competition here .
and the spd shows an allergic reaction and is flip-flopping : on the one hand , it is trying to restore its social competence , the intention to more strongly articulate social justice .
on the other hand they are trying to portray the new alliance as illegitimate .
this is bound to come off badly for those voters disappointed by the schröder government and will motivate them to keep their distance from the spd .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 04.08.2005 the cost of environmental pollution germany may be an eco-friendly place , but support for the environment does come at a price - a fact that some organizations are trying to disprove .
but environmental groups themselves are n't so sure . germans who own a car ca n't avoid the fact that 65 cents -lrb- $ 0.80 -rrb- of every euro that goes into their fuel tank flows into state coffers in the form of various energy taxes . it may be a high price to pay in a country that prides itself on its environmentally-friendly policies .
but according to tanja loitz of climate seeks protection , a program supported by the german environment ministry , there are ways to help the environment and save money at the same time .
" most people do not know that most household co2 emissions come from heating , " she said , explaining why one of the campaign 's goals is to reduce the 120 million tons of annual household co2 emissions .
" there is not a lack of interest in the environment , but a lack of factual knowledge . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : home heating releases the most household greenhouse gasses raising awareness by saving money if the numerous recycling programs across the country are any indication , germans already tend to be an environmentally-conscious bunch .
in fact , 74 percent of germans rate protecting the environment as very important , according to a recent study conducted by pollster forsa .
at the same time , most of those surveyed were of different opinions when it came to the question of what could be done about it .
" consumers certainly find the topic interesting , but are only willing to become involved in small degrees if it affects their wallets , " said moritz lehmkuhl , head of climate partner , an organization that tries to raise awareness of climate change among businesses and the public .
" the idea that they should save money and shop for bargains still dominates among consumers . "
who should be held responsible ?
he agreed with loitz on the importance of individual participation if there is a chance of achieving the kyoto protocol 's goals of reducing greenhouse gasses by 5 percent of 1990 levels before 2012 , and that the best way to get people 's attention is by saying it will save them money .
environmental groups also say that minimizing monetary concerns is an effective way of changing daily habits . but some would like to see the government make polluting more costly instead of relying on people to be voluntarily more concerned about their surroundings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friends of the earth germany " people who voluntarily take part are already very environmentally conscious and think about their actions , " said markus steigenberger of friends of the earth germany .
" i do not think voluntary action programs have a large effect on the general population . "
the alternative of legal coercion , however , is not an effective way to make people responsible for their actions , lehmkuhl argued .

but environmental groups themselves are n't so sure . germans who own a car ca n't avoid the fact that 65 cents -lrb- $ 0.80 -rrb- of every euro that goes into their fuel tank flows into state coffers in the form of various energy taxes . it may be a high price to pay in a country that prides itself on its environmentally-friendly policies .
but according to tanja loitz of climate seeks protection , a program supported by the german environment ministry , there are ways to help the environment and save money at the same time .
" most people do not know that most household co2 emissions come from heating , " she said , explaining why one of the campaign 's goals is to reduce the 120 million tons of annual household co2 emissions .
" there is not a lack of interest in the environment , but a lack of factual knowledge . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : home heating releases the most household greenhouse gasses raising awareness by saving money if the numerous recycling programs across the country are any indication , germans already tend to be an environmentally-conscious bunch .
in fact , 74 percent of germans rate protecting the environment as very important , according to a recent study conducted by pollster forsa .
at the same time , most of those surveyed were of different opinions when it came to the question of what could be done about it .
" consumers certainly find the topic interesting , but are only willing to become involved in small degrees if it affects their wallets , " said moritz lehmkuhl , head of climate partner , an organization that tries to raise awareness of climate change among businesses and the public .
" the idea that they should save money and shop for bargains still dominates among consumers . "
who should be held responsible ?
he agreed with loitz on the importance of individual participation if there is a chance of achieving the kyoto protocol 's goals of reducing greenhouse gasses by 5 percent of 1990 levels before 2012 , and that the best way to get people 's attention is by saying it will save them money .
environmental groups also say that minimizing monetary concerns is an effective way of changing daily habits . but some would like to see the government make polluting more costly instead of relying on people to be voluntarily more concerned about their surroundings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friends of the earth germany " people who voluntarily take part are already very environmentally conscious and think about their actions , " said markus steigenberger of friends of the earth germany .
" i do not think voluntary action programs have a large effect on the general population . "
the alternative of legal coercion , however , is not an effective way to make people responsible for their actions , lehmkuhl argued .
" taxes have a negative aftertaste , and with voluntary initiatives you can achieve something extra , " he said .
" it is important to show that people can personally do something . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 04.08.2005 the cost of environmental pollution germany may be an eco-friendly place , but support for the environment does come at a price - a fact that some organizations are trying to disprove .
but environmental groups themselves are n't so sure . germans who own a car ca n't avoid the fact that 65 cents -lrb- $ 0.80 -rrb- of every euro that goes into their fuel tank flows into state coffers in the form of various energy taxes . it may be a high price to pay in a country that prides itself on its environmentally-friendly policies .
but according to tanja loitz of climate seeks protection , a program supported by the german environment ministry , there are ways to help the environment and save money at the same time .
" most people do not know that most household co2 emissions come from heating , " she said , explaining why one of the campaign 's goals is to reduce the 120 million tons of annual household co2 emissions .
" there is not a lack of interest in the environment , but a lack of factual knowledge . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : home heating releases the most household greenhouse gasses raising awareness by saving money if the numerous recycling programs across the country are any indication , germans already tend to be an environmentally-conscious bunch .
in fact , 74 percent of germans rate protecting the environment as very important , according to a recent study conducted by pollster forsa .
at the same time , most of those surveyed were of different opinions when it came to the question of what could be done about it .
" consumers certainly find the topic interesting , but are only willing to become involved in small degrees if it affects their wallets , " said moritz lehmkuhl , head of climate partner , an organization that tries to raise awareness of climate change among businesses and the public .
" the idea that they should save money and shop for bargains still dominates among consumers . "
who should be held responsible ?
he agreed with loitz on the importance of individual participation if there is a chance of achieving the kyoto protocol 's goals of reducing greenhouse gasses by 5 percent of 1990 levels before 2012 , and that the best way to get people 's attention is by saying it will save them money .
environmental groups also say that minimizing monetary concerns is an effective way of changing daily habits . but some would like to see the government make polluting more costly instead of relying on people to be voluntarily more concerned about their surroundings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friends of the earth germany " people who voluntarily take part are already very environmentally conscious and think about their actions , " said markus steigenberger of friends of the earth germany .
" i do not think voluntary action programs have a large effect on the general population . "
the alternative of legal coercion , however , is not an effective way to make people responsible for their actions , lehmkuhl argued .
" taxes have a negative aftertaste , and with voluntary initiatives you can achieve something extra , " he said .
" it is important to show that people can personally do something . "
climate partner recommends consumers make online purchases through climate friends , a portal that invests sales commissions - exactly how much depends on company specific deals - in sustainable , climate-neutral projects around the world .
legislation more effective bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the average german produces about 11 tons of co2 a year steinberger of friends of the earth said that people who actually use these services to make up for the 11 tons of co2 the average german produces annually are doing the right thing and added that raising environmental awareness is crucial .
at the same time , legislation is the best way to help the environment , he said .
" we need defined goals and legislation that lets business and people act in a climate-friendly way and makes pollution expensive , " steinberger said .
climate seeks protection 's loitz suggests that the most effective laws would focus on rewarding those who prevent pollution rather than doling out punishments for those who cause it .
while environmental groups continue work to get stricter laws enacted and enforced , and climate seeks protection and climate partner continue their voluntary programs , all the groups maintain that increasing the environmental consciousness that keeps greenhouse gasses from being produced is necessary .
there is , after all , no way to get co2 back in the bottle once it 's emitted . sean sinico , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de goal for germany and the environment in just over 13 months , millions of soccer fans will descend on germany for the world cup .

how dangerous is it for the social democrats ?
is the left party 's new front man , oskar lafontaine , wooing right wing voters ?
a political scientist offers answers . the political scientist and party researcher klaus detterbeck teaches at the institute for political science at the university of magdeburg . dw-world : what chances do you give the new leftist alliance in the expedited bundestag elections ? klaus detterbeck : i would put the chances relatively high .
i would , however , differentiate between a short-term success for the bundestag elections , and the long-term perspective , which i view more critically .
in the short-term , the party has the opportunity to fill a vacuum which exists in the current competition between the parties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators protesting in berlin against social welfare cuts for the voters in western germany there has been no outlet to express frustrations with reform of the social welfare system , the effects of market liberalization .
here the party is filling a gap .
in the long-term i see the problem that the alliance parties are actually quite heterogeneous , that both at the grassroots as well as the leadership level there are significant differences between the labor union members in the west and the old pds -lrb- party of democratic socialism , the successor of the communist party of east germany -rrb- cadre in the east .
the differences will be difficult to reconcile , both for the party platform and the political goals .
what brings the groups together is the protest against social reforms .
in the longer-term they will have a falling out . so the left party is a protest party ?
what will define their constituency ? in the west it will doubtless be the disaffected stalwarts of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , just that unionized milieu from which the spd drew its base over decades .
in the east it will be the old pds voters coming from various societal groupings .
on the one side there is thus the protest voter trying to prevent the east from being treated as second-class , but there is also the old gdr cadre .
it will definitely be a protest party .
when we look to other countries , for example to spain or sweden , we also see similar leftist groupings , also heterogeneous , drawing their members from communists , greens , and leftist activists .
they feed off of the protest against modernization and the liberalization of the welfare state . there it functions on a long-term basis ... yes , since it has to do with very pragmatic , loose alliances , which for the most part remain separate from one another and only come together for the election .
this just wo n't work in germany .
the left party has to position itself .
after the election , problems will surely develop , and so i see little chance that the party will remain together . is the spd seriously threatened by this new alliance ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no longer guaranteed spd voters the spd will definitely suffer losses at its base , the unionized milieu - voters who may not have gone to the polls had this party not materialized .
they must see their chance to express their anger and disappointment with the spd government , a chance to make their frustration known .
this is without doubt a threat for the spd . is the spd responding appropriately to this threat by attempting to slander the new alliance ? the spd has always assumed it was the voice of the left , the voice of the traditional organized labor in the broadest sense .
now there has been for a long , long time a serious competition here .
and the spd shows an allergic reaction and is flip-flopping : on the one hand , it is trying to restore its social competence , the intention to more strongly articulate social justice .
on the other hand they are trying to portray the new alliance as illegitimate .
this is bound to come off badly for those voters disappointed by the schröder government and will motivate them to keep their distance from the spd .
the spd 's strategy is thus not exactly helping them to woo back their base .
but it is difficult to imagine what the spd 's options are at this point . continue reading to find out whether lafontaine is fishing for voters on the extreme right . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de social justice or economic folly ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de election 2005 -pipe- 04.08.2005 " lafontaine is not a german haider " back to first page back 2/2 many are calling the new alliance populist .
is this justified ? the party is certainly populist in the sense that they rail against change and modernization without really wanting to , or rather being able to say , what they would do differently .
it is a party that wants to excite tempers and encourage protest without being able to give answers .
one could say that this is not necessarily the role of a new opposition party .
it is a chance to express protest and it can lead the established parties to reconsider certain issues . gregor gysi and oskar lafontaine , the former spd chief , will act together as top candidates .
lafontaine in particular has been attacked by the spd and the greens .
he was given the epithet of " german haider -lrb- austria 's right-wing populist politician -rrb- , " fishing for votes on the extreme right .
what do you think of this accusation ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jörg haider recently split from the populist freedom party he founded and started a new right-wing alliance no , in my opinion you ca n't look at it that way .
the charge goes back to a speech lafontaine made , in which he spoke of " alien workers , " a concept from the rightist camp .
when one looks at the political development of lafontaine , i do n't think it 's fair to speak of a rightist leaning or an attempt to court rightist voters .
lafontaine has always been a nonconformist , someone who has always taken positions not directly in line with that of his party .
he is continuing with this .
so the comparison with haider is not justified . but does lafontaine really offer any sensible remedies ? lafontaine has , since his retreat from the federal government , been constantly appealing to the public , whether in publications or in talk shows , spreading his view of things - that is , a state control of the globalized economy .
he has time and again been criticized , that his solutions are completely unrealistic .
for himself and for the groupings he stands for , this is a reasonable answer to globalization .
it is , however , in the current situation , no adequate response .
it is impossible to see how a strong governmental , national control could be implemented at the european level .
should lafontaine be asked to implement his policies in the real world , then his alliance would really dissolve quite quickly .
but as an opposition party , as a protest party , such goals are legitimate .
it is an opportunity for disgruntled voters to express that they do not agree with the course and the pace of the reforms .
thus the party fulfills a democratic function . steffen leidel interviewed klaus detterbeck -lrb- jc -rrb- back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de social justice or economic folly ?

how dangerous is it for the social democrats ?
is the left party 's new front man , oskar lafontaine , wooing right wing voters ?
a political scientist offers answers . the political scientist and party researcher klaus detterbeck teaches at the institute for political science at the university of magdeburg . dw-world : what chances do you give the new leftist alliance in the expedited bundestag elections ? klaus detterbeck : i would put the chances relatively high .
i would , however , differentiate between a short-term success for the bundestag elections , and the long-term perspective , which i view more critically .
in the short-term , the party has the opportunity to fill a vacuum which exists in the current competition between the parties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators protesting in berlin against social welfare cuts for the voters in western germany there has been no outlet to express frustrations with reform of the social welfare system , the effects of market liberalization .
here the party is filling a gap .
in the long-term i see the problem that the alliance parties are actually quite heterogeneous , that both at the grassroots as well as the leadership level there are significant differences between the labor union members in the west and the old pds -lrb- party of democratic socialism , the successor of the communist party of east germany -rrb- cadre in the east .
the differences will be difficult to reconcile , both for the party platform and the political goals .
what brings the groups together is the protest against social reforms .
in the longer-term they will have a falling out . so the left party is a protest party ?
what will define their constituency ? in the west it will doubtless be the disaffected stalwarts of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , just that unionized milieu from which the spd drew its base over decades .
in the east it will be the old pds voters coming from various societal groupings .
on the one side there is thus the protest voter trying to prevent the east from being treated as second-class , but there is also the old gdr cadre .
it will definitely be a protest party .
when we look to other countries , for example to spain or sweden , we also see similar leftist groupings , also heterogeneous , drawing their members from communists , greens , and leftist activists .
they feed off of the protest against modernization and the liberalization of the welfare state . there it functions on a long-term basis ... yes , since it has to do with very pragmatic , loose alliances , which for the most part remain separate from one another and only come together for the election .
this just wo n't work in germany .
the left party has to position itself .
after the election , problems will surely develop , and so i see little chance that the party will remain together . is the spd seriously threatened by this new alliance ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no longer guaranteed spd voters the spd will definitely suffer losses at its base , the unionized milieu - voters who may not have gone to the polls had this party not materialized .
they must see their chance to express their anger and disappointment with the spd government , a chance to make their frustration known .
this is without doubt a threat for the spd . is the spd responding appropriately to this threat by attempting to slander the new alliance ? the spd has always assumed it was the voice of the left , the voice of the traditional organized labor in the broadest sense .
now there has been for a long , long time a serious competition here .
and the spd shows an allergic reaction and is flip-flopping : on the one hand , it is trying to restore its social competence , the intention to more strongly articulate social justice .
on the other hand they are trying to portray the new alliance as illegitimate .
this is bound to come off badly for those voters disappointed by the schröder government and will motivate them to keep their distance from the spd .
the spd 's strategy is thus not exactly helping them to woo back their base .
but it is difficult to imagine what the spd 's options are at this point . continue reading to find out whether lafontaine is fishing for voters on the extreme right . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de social justice or economic folly ?
the new hard-left grouping in germany , the left party , is sending tremors across the political landscape .
but , the party 's economic program has industry groups and economists shaking their heads , and worrying .

is this justified ? the party is certainly populist in the sense that they rail against change and modernization without really wanting to , or rather being able to say , what they would do differently .
it is a party that wants to excite tempers and encourage protest without being able to give answers .
one could say that this is not necessarily the role of a new opposition party .
it is a chance to express protest and it can lead the established parties to reconsider certain issues . gregor gysi and oskar lafontaine , the former spd chief , will act together as top candidates .
lafontaine in particular has been attacked by the spd and the greens .
he was given the epithet of " german haider -lrb- austria 's right-wing populist politician -rrb- , " fishing for votes on the extreme right .
what do you think of this accusation ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jörg haider recently split from the populist freedom party he founded and started a new right-wing alliance no , in my opinion you ca n't look at it that way .
the charge goes back to a speech lafontaine made , in which he spoke of " alien workers , " a concept from the rightist camp .
when one looks at the political development of lafontaine , i do n't think it 's fair to speak of a rightist leaning or an attempt to court rightist voters .
lafontaine has always been a nonconformist , someone who has always taken positions not directly in line with that of his party .
he is continuing with this .
so the comparison with haider is not justified . but does lafontaine really offer any sensible remedies ? lafontaine has , since his retreat from the federal government , been constantly appealing to the public , whether in publications or in talk shows , spreading his view of things - that is , a state control of the globalized economy .
he has time and again been criticized , that his solutions are completely unrealistic .
for himself and for the groupings he stands for , this is a reasonable answer to globalization .
it is , however , in the current situation , no adequate response .
it is impossible to see how a strong governmental , national control could be implemented at the european level .
should lafontaine be asked to implement his policies in the real world , then his alliance would really dissolve quite quickly .
but as an opposition party , as a protest party , such goals are legitimate .
it is an opportunity for disgruntled voters to express that they do not agree with the course and the pace of the reforms .

how dangerous is it for the social democrats ?
is the left party 's new front man , oskar lafontaine , wooing right wing voters ?
a political scientist offers answers . the political scientist and party researcher klaus detterbeck teaches at the institute for political science at the university of magdeburg . dw-world : what chances do you give the new leftist alliance in the expedited bundestag elections ? klaus detterbeck : i would put the chances relatively high .
i would , however , differentiate between a short-term success for the bundestag elections , and the long-term perspective , which i view more critically .
in the short-term , the party has the opportunity to fill a vacuum which exists in the current competition between the parties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators protesting in berlin against social welfare cuts for the voters in western germany there has been no outlet to express frustrations with reform of the social welfare system , the effects of market liberalization .
here the party is filling a gap .
in the long-term i see the problem that the alliance parties are actually quite heterogeneous , that both at the grassroots as well as the leadership level there are significant differences between the labor union members in the west and the old pds -lrb- party of democratic socialism , the successor of the communist party of east germany -rrb- cadre in the east .
the differences will be difficult to reconcile , both for the party platform and the political goals .
what brings the groups together is the protest against social reforms .
in the longer-term they will have a falling out . so the left party is a protest party ?
what will define their constituency ? in the west it will doubtless be the disaffected stalwarts of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , just that unionized milieu from which the spd drew its base over decades .
in the east it will be the old pds voters coming from various societal groupings .
on the one side there is thus the protest voter trying to prevent the east from being treated as second-class , but there is also the old gdr cadre .
it will definitely be a protest party .
when we look to other countries , for example to spain or sweden , we also see similar leftist groupings , also heterogeneous , drawing their members from communists , greens , and leftist activists .
they feed off of the protest against modernization and the liberalization of the welfare state . there it functions on a long-term basis ... yes , since it has to do with very pragmatic , loose alliances , which for the most part remain separate from one another and only come together for the election .
this just wo n't work in germany .
the left party has to position itself .
after the election , problems will surely develop , and so i see little chance that the party will remain together . is the spd seriously threatened by this new alliance ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no longer guaranteed spd voters the spd will definitely suffer losses at its base , the unionized milieu - voters who may not have gone to the polls had this party not materialized .
they must see their chance to express their anger and disappointment with the spd government , a chance to make their frustration known .
this is without doubt a threat for the spd . is the spd responding appropriately to this threat by attempting to slander the new alliance ? the spd has always assumed it was the voice of the left , the voice of the traditional organized labor in the broadest sense .
now there has been for a long , long time a serious competition here .
and the spd shows an allergic reaction and is flip-flopping : on the one hand , it is trying to restore its social competence , the intention to more strongly articulate social justice .
on the other hand they are trying to portray the new alliance as illegitimate .
this is bound to come off badly for those voters disappointed by the schröder government and will motivate them to keep their distance from the spd .
the spd 's strategy is thus not exactly helping them to woo back their base .
but it is difficult to imagine what the spd 's options are at this point . continue reading to find out whether lafontaine is fishing for voters on the extreme right . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de social justice or economic folly ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 04.08.2005 the cost of environmental pollution germany may be an eco-friendly place , but support for the environment does come at a price - a fact that some organizations are trying to disprove .
but environmental groups themselves are n't so sure . germans who own a car ca n't avoid the fact that 65 cents -lrb- $ 0.80 -rrb- of every euro that goes into their fuel tank flows into state coffers in the form of various energy taxes . it may be a high price to pay in a country that prides itself on its environmentally-friendly policies .
but according to tanja loitz of climate seeks protection , a program supported by the german environment ministry , there are ways to help the environment and save money at the same time .
" most people do not know that most household co2 emissions come from heating , " she said , explaining why one of the campaign 's goals is to reduce the 120 million tons of annual household co2 emissions .
" there is not a lack of interest in the environment , but a lack of factual knowledge . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : home heating releases the most household greenhouse gasses raising awareness by saving money if the numerous recycling programs across the country are any indication , germans already tend to be an environmentally-conscious bunch .
in fact , 74 percent of germans rate protecting the environment as very important , according to a recent study conducted by pollster forsa .
at the same time , most of those surveyed were of different opinions when it came to the question of what could be done about it .
" consumers certainly find the topic interesting , but are only willing to become involved in small degrees if it affects their wallets , " said moritz lehmkuhl , head of climate partner , an organization that tries to raise awareness of climate change among businesses and the public .
" the idea that they should save money and shop for bargains still dominates among consumers . "
who should be held responsible ?
he agreed with loitz on the importance of individual participation if there is a chance of achieving the kyoto protocol 's goals of reducing greenhouse gasses by 5 percent of 1990 levels before 2012 , and that the best way to get people 's attention is by saying it will save them money .
environmental groups also say that minimizing monetary concerns is an effective way of changing daily habits . but some would like to see the government make polluting more costly instead of relying on people to be voluntarily more concerned about their surroundings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friends of the earth germany " people who voluntarily take part are already very environmentally conscious and think about their actions , " said markus steigenberger of friends of the earth germany .
" i do not think voluntary action programs have a large effect on the general population . "
the alternative of legal coercion , however , is not an effective way to make people responsible for their actions , lehmkuhl argued .
" taxes have a negative aftertaste , and with voluntary initiatives you can achieve something extra , " he said .
" it is important to show that people can personally do something . "
climate partner recommends consumers make online purchases through climate friends , a portal that invests sales commissions - exactly how much depends on company specific deals - in sustainable , climate-neutral projects around the world .
legislation more effective bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the average german produces about 11 tons of co2 a year steinberger of friends of the earth said that people who actually use these services to make up for the 11 tons of co2 the average german produces annually are doing the right thing and added that raising environmental awareness is crucial .
at the same time , legislation is the best way to help the environment , he said .
" we need defined goals and legislation that lets business and people act in a climate-friendly way and makes pollution expensive , " steinberger said .
climate seeks protection 's loitz suggests that the most effective laws would focus on rewarding those who prevent pollution rather than doling out punishments for those who cause it .
while environmental groups continue work to get stricter laws enacted and enforced , and climate seeks protection and climate partner continue their voluntary programs , all the groups maintain that increasing the environmental consciousness that keeps greenhouse gasses from being produced is necessary .
there is , after all , no way to get co2 back in the bottle once it 's emitted . sean sinico , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de goal for germany and the environment in just over 13 months , millions of soccer fans will descend on germany for the world cup .

but environmental groups themselves are n't so sure . germans who own a car ca n't avoid the fact that 65 cents -lrb- $ 0.80 -rrb- of every euro that goes into their fuel tank flows into state coffers in the form of various energy taxes . it may be a high price to pay in a country that prides itself on its environmentally-friendly policies .
but according to tanja loitz of climate seeks protection , a program supported by the german environment ministry , there are ways to help the environment and save money at the same time .
" most people do not know that most household co2 emissions come from heating , " she said , explaining why one of the campaign 's goals is to reduce the 120 million tons of annual household co2 emissions .
" there is not a lack of interest in the environment , but a lack of factual knowledge . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : home heating releases the most household greenhouse gasses raising awareness by saving money if the numerous recycling programs across the country are any indication , germans already tend to be an environmentally-conscious bunch .
in fact , 74 percent of germans rate protecting the environment as very important , according to a recent study conducted by pollster forsa .
at the same time , most of those surveyed were of different opinions when it came to the question of what could be done about it .
" consumers certainly find the topic interesting , but are only willing to become involved in small degrees if it affects their wallets , " said moritz lehmkuhl , head of climate partner , an organization that tries to raise awareness of climate change among businesses and the public .
" the idea that they should save money and shop for bargains still dominates among consumers . "
who should be held responsible ?
he agreed with loitz on the importance of individual participation if there is a chance of achieving the kyoto protocol 's goals of reducing greenhouse gasses by 5 percent of 1990 levels before 2012 , and that the best way to get people 's attention is by saying it will save them money .
environmental groups also say that minimizing monetary concerns is an effective way of changing daily habits . but some would like to see the government make polluting more costly instead of relying on people to be voluntarily more concerned about their surroundings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friends of the earth germany " people who voluntarily take part are already very environmentally conscious and think about their actions , " said markus steigenberger of friends of the earth germany .
" i do not think voluntary action programs have a large effect on the general population . "
the alternative of legal coercion , however , is not an effective way to make people responsible for their actions , lehmkuhl argued .
" taxes have a negative aftertaste , and with voluntary initiatives you can achieve something extra , " he said .
" it is important to show that people can personally do something . "
climate partner recommends consumers make online purchases through climate friends , a portal that invests sales commissions - exactly how much depends on company specific deals - in sustainable , climate-neutral projects around the world .
legislation more effective bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the average german produces about 11 tons of co2 a year steinberger of friends of the earth said that people who actually use these services to make up for the 11 tons of co2 the average german produces annually are doing the right thing and added that raising environmental awareness is crucial .
at the same time , legislation is the best way to help the environment , he said .
" we need defined goals and legislation that lets business and people act in a climate-friendly way and makes pollution expensive , " steinberger said .
climate seeks protection 's loitz suggests that the most effective laws would focus on rewarding those who prevent pollution rather than doling out punishments for those who cause it .
while environmental groups continue work to get stricter laws enacted and enforced , and climate seeks protection and climate partner continue their voluntary programs , all the groups maintain that increasing the environmental consciousness that keeps greenhouse gasses from being produced is necessary .

is this justified ? the party is certainly populist in the sense that they rail against change and modernization without really wanting to , or rather being able to say , what they would do differently .
it is a party that wants to excite tempers and encourage protest without being able to give answers .
one could say that this is not necessarily the role of a new opposition party .
it is a chance to express protest and it can lead the established parties to reconsider certain issues . gregor gysi and oskar lafontaine , the former spd chief , will act together as top candidates .
lafontaine in particular has been attacked by the spd and the greens .
he was given the epithet of " german haider -lrb- austria 's right-wing populist politician -rrb- , " fishing for votes on the extreme right .
what do you think of this accusation ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jörg haider recently split from the populist freedom party he founded and started a new right-wing alliance no , in my opinion you ca n't look at it that way .
the charge goes back to a speech lafontaine made , in which he spoke of " alien workers , " a concept from the rightist camp .
when one looks at the political development of lafontaine , i do n't think it 's fair to speak of a rightist leaning or an attempt to court rightist voters .
lafontaine has always been a nonconformist , someone who has always taken positions not directly in line with that of his party .
he is continuing with this .
so the comparison with haider is not justified . but does lafontaine really offer any sensible remedies ? lafontaine has , since his retreat from the federal government , been constantly appealing to the public , whether in publications or in talk shows , spreading his view of things - that is , a state control of the globalized economy .
he has time and again been criticized , that his solutions are completely unrealistic .
for himself and for the groupings he stands for , this is a reasonable answer to globalization .
it is , however , in the current situation , no adequate response .
it is impossible to see how a strong governmental , national control could be implemented at the european level .
should lafontaine be asked to implement his policies in the real world , then his alliance would really dissolve quite quickly .
but as an opposition party , as a protest party , such goals are legitimate .
it is an opportunity for disgruntled voters to express that they do not agree with the course and the pace of the reforms .

is this justified ? the party is certainly populist in the sense that they rail against change and modernization without really wanting to , or rather being able to say , what they would do differently .
it is a party that wants to excite tempers and encourage protest without being able to give answers .
one could say that this is not necessarily the role of a new opposition party .
it is a chance to express protest and it can lead the established parties to reconsider certain issues . gregor gysi and oskar lafontaine , the former spd chief , will act together as top candidates .
lafontaine in particular has been attacked by the spd and the greens .
he was given the epithet of " german haider -lrb- austria 's right-wing populist politician -rrb- , " fishing for votes on the extreme right .
what do you think of this accusation ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jörg haider recently split from the populist freedom party he founded and started a new right-wing alliance no , in my opinion you ca n't look at it that way .
the charge goes back to a speech lafontaine made , in which he spoke of " alien workers , " a concept from the rightist camp .
when one looks at the political development of lafontaine , i do n't think it 's fair to speak of a rightist leaning or an attempt to court rightist voters .
lafontaine has always been a nonconformist , someone who has always taken positions not directly in line with that of his party .
he is continuing with this .
so the comparison with haider is not justified . but does lafontaine really offer any sensible remedies ? lafontaine has , since his retreat from the federal government , been constantly appealing to the public , whether in publications or in talk shows , spreading his view of things - that is , a state control of the globalized economy .
he has time and again been criticized , that his solutions are completely unrealistic .
for himself and for the groupings he stands for , this is a reasonable answer to globalization .
it is , however , in the current situation , no adequate response .
it is impossible to see how a strong governmental , national control could be implemented at the european level .
should lafontaine be asked to implement his policies in the real world , then his alliance would really dissolve quite quickly .
but as an opposition party , as a protest party , such goals are legitimate .
it is an opportunity for disgruntled voters to express that they do not agree with the course and the pace of the reforms .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de election 2005 -pipe- 04.08.2005 " lafontaine is not a german haider " back to first page back 2/2 many are calling the new alliance populist .
is this justified ? the party is certainly populist in the sense that they rail against change and modernization without really wanting to , or rather being able to say , what they would do differently .
it is a party that wants to excite tempers and encourage protest without being able to give answers .
one could say that this is not necessarily the role of a new opposition party .
it is a chance to express protest and it can lead the established parties to reconsider certain issues . gregor gysi and oskar lafontaine , the former spd chief , will act together as top candidates .
lafontaine in particular has been attacked by the spd and the greens .
he was given the epithet of " german haider -lrb- austria 's right-wing populist politician -rrb- , " fishing for votes on the extreme right .
what do you think of this accusation ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jörg haider recently split from the populist freedom party he founded and started a new right-wing alliance no , in my opinion you ca n't look at it that way .
the charge goes back to a speech lafontaine made , in which he spoke of " alien workers , " a concept from the rightist camp .
when one looks at the political development of lafontaine , i do n't think it 's fair to speak of a rightist leaning or an attempt to court rightist voters .
lafontaine has always been a nonconformist , someone who has always taken positions not directly in line with that of his party .
he is continuing with this .
so the comparison with haider is not justified . but does lafontaine really offer any sensible remedies ? lafontaine has , since his retreat from the federal government , been constantly appealing to the public , whether in publications or in talk shows , spreading his view of things - that is , a state control of the globalized economy .
he has time and again been criticized , that his solutions are completely unrealistic .
for himself and for the groupings he stands for , this is a reasonable answer to globalization .
it is , however , in the current situation , no adequate response .
it is impossible to see how a strong governmental , national control could be implemented at the european level .
should lafontaine be asked to implement his policies in the real world , then his alliance would really dissolve quite quickly .
but as an opposition party , as a protest party , such goals are legitimate .
it is an opportunity for disgruntled voters to express that they do not agree with the course and the pace of the reforms .
thus the party fulfills a democratic function . steffen leidel interviewed klaus detterbeck -lrb- jc -rrb- back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de social justice or economic folly ?

how dangerous is it for the social democrats ?
is the left party 's new front man , oskar lafontaine , wooing right wing voters ?
a political scientist offers answers . the political scientist and party researcher klaus detterbeck teaches at the institute for political science at the university of magdeburg . dw-world : what chances do you give the new leftist alliance in the expedited bundestag elections ? klaus detterbeck : i would put the chances relatively high .
i would , however , differentiate between a short-term success for the bundestag elections , and the long-term perspective , which i view more critically .
in the short-term , the party has the opportunity to fill a vacuum which exists in the current competition between the parties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators protesting in berlin against social welfare cuts for the voters in western germany there has been no outlet to express frustrations with reform of the social welfare system , the effects of market liberalization .
here the party is filling a gap .
in the long-term i see the problem that the alliance parties are actually quite heterogeneous , that both at the grassroots as well as the leadership level there are significant differences between the labor union members in the west and the old pds -lrb- party of democratic socialism , the successor of the communist party of east germany -rrb- cadre in the east .
the differences will be difficult to reconcile , both for the party platform and the political goals .
what brings the groups together is the protest against social reforms .
in the longer-term they will have a falling out . so the left party is a protest party ?
what will define their constituency ? in the west it will doubtless be the disaffected stalwarts of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , just that unionized milieu from which the spd drew its base over decades .
in the east it will be the old pds voters coming from various societal groupings .
on the one side there is thus the protest voter trying to prevent the east from being treated as second-class , but there is also the old gdr cadre .
it will definitely be a protest party .
when we look to other countries , for example to spain or sweden , we also see similar leftist groupings , also heterogeneous , drawing their members from communists , greens , and leftist activists .
they feed off of the protest against modernization and the liberalization of the welfare state . there it functions on a long-term basis ... yes , since it has to do with very pragmatic , loose alliances , which for the most part remain separate from one another and only come together for the election .
this just wo n't work in germany .
the left party has to position itself .
after the election , problems will surely develop , and so i see little chance that the party will remain together . is the spd seriously threatened by this new alliance ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no longer guaranteed spd voters the spd will definitely suffer losses at its base , the unionized milieu - voters who may not have gone to the polls had this party not materialized .
they must see their chance to express their anger and disappointment with the spd government , a chance to make their frustration known .
this is without doubt a threat for the spd . is the spd responding appropriately to this threat by attempting to slander the new alliance ? the spd has always assumed it was the voice of the left , the voice of the traditional organized labor in the broadest sense .
now there has been for a long , long time a serious competition here .
and the spd shows an allergic reaction and is flip-flopping : on the one hand , it is trying to restore its social competence , the intention to more strongly articulate social justice .
on the other hand they are trying to portray the new alliance as illegitimate .
this is bound to come off badly for those voters disappointed by the schröder government and will motivate them to keep their distance from the spd .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 04.08.2005 the cost of environmental pollution germany may be an eco-friendly place , but support for the environment does come at a price - a fact that some organizations are trying to disprove .
but environmental groups themselves are n't so sure . germans who own a car ca n't avoid the fact that 65 cents -lrb- $ 0.80 -rrb- of every euro that goes into their fuel tank flows into state coffers in the form of various energy taxes . it may be a high price to pay in a country that prides itself on its environmentally-friendly policies .
but according to tanja loitz of climate seeks protection , a program supported by the german environment ministry , there are ways to help the environment and save money at the same time .
" most people do not know that most household co2 emissions come from heating , " she said , explaining why one of the campaign 's goals is to reduce the 120 million tons of annual household co2 emissions .
" there is not a lack of interest in the environment , but a lack of factual knowledge . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : home heating releases the most household greenhouse gasses raising awareness by saving money if the numerous recycling programs across the country are any indication , germans already tend to be an environmentally-conscious bunch .
in fact , 74 percent of germans rate protecting the environment as very important , according to a recent study conducted by pollster forsa .
at the same time , most of those surveyed were of different opinions when it came to the question of what could be done about it .
" consumers certainly find the topic interesting , but are only willing to become involved in small degrees if it affects their wallets , " said moritz lehmkuhl , head of climate partner , an organization that tries to raise awareness of climate change among businesses and the public .
" the idea that they should save money and shop for bargains still dominates among consumers . "
who should be held responsible ?
he agreed with loitz on the importance of individual participation if there is a chance of achieving the kyoto protocol 's goals of reducing greenhouse gasses by 5 percent of 1990 levels before 2012 , and that the best way to get people 's attention is by saying it will save them money .
environmental groups also say that minimizing monetary concerns is an effective way of changing daily habits . but some would like to see the government make polluting more costly instead of relying on people to be voluntarily more concerned about their surroundings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friends of the earth germany " people who voluntarily take part are already very environmentally conscious and think about their actions , " said markus steigenberger of friends of the earth germany .
" i do not think voluntary action programs have a large effect on the general population . "
the alternative of legal coercion , however , is not an effective way to make people responsible for their actions , lehmkuhl argued .
" taxes have a negative aftertaste , and with voluntary initiatives you can achieve something extra , " he said .
" it is important to show that people can personally do something . "
climate partner recommends consumers make online purchases through climate friends , a portal that invests sales commissions - exactly how much depends on company specific deals - in sustainable , climate-neutral projects around the world .
legislation more effective bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the average german produces about 11 tons of co2 a year steinberger of friends of the earth said that people who actually use these services to make up for the 11 tons of co2 the average german produces annually are doing the right thing and added that raising environmental awareness is crucial .
at the same time , legislation is the best way to help the environment , he said .
" we need defined goals and legislation that lets business and people act in a climate-friendly way and makes pollution expensive , " steinberger said .
climate seeks protection 's loitz suggests that the most effective laws would focus on rewarding those who prevent pollution rather than doling out punishments for those who cause it .
while environmental groups continue work to get stricter laws enacted and enforced , and climate seeks protection and climate partner continue their voluntary programs , all the groups maintain that increasing the environmental consciousness that keeps greenhouse gasses from being produced is necessary .
there is , after all , no way to get co2 back in the bottle once it 's emitted . sean sinico , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de goal for germany and the environment in just over 13 months , millions of soccer fans will descend on germany for the world cup .

a political scientist offers answers . the political scientist and party researcher klaus detterbeck teaches at the institute for political science at the university of magdeburg . dw-world : what chances do you give the new leftist alliance in the expedited bundestag elections ? klaus detterbeck : i would put the chances relatively high .
i would , however , differentiate between a short-term success for the bundestag elections , and the long-term perspective , which i view more critically .
in the short-term , the party has the opportunity to fill a vacuum which exists in the current competition between the parties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators protesting in berlin against social welfare cuts for the voters in western germany there has been no outlet to express frustrations with reform of the social welfare system , the effects of market liberalization .
here the party is filling a gap .
in the long-term i see the problem that the alliance parties are actually quite heterogeneous , that both at the grassroots as well as the leadership level there are significant differences between the labor union members in the west and the old pds -lrb- party of democratic socialism , the successor of the communist party of east germany -rrb- cadre in the east .
the differences will be difficult to reconcile , both for the party platform and the political goals .
what brings the groups together is the protest against social reforms .
in the longer-term they will have a falling out . so the left party is a protest party ?
what will define their constituency ? in the west it will doubtless be the disaffected stalwarts of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , just that unionized milieu from which the spd drew its base over decades .
in the east it will be the old pds voters coming from various societal groupings .
on the one side there is thus the protest voter trying to prevent the east from being treated as second-class , but there is also the old gdr cadre .
it will definitely be a protest party .
when we look to other countries , for example to spain or sweden , we also see similar leftist groupings , also heterogeneous , drawing their members from communists , greens , and leftist activists .
they feed off of the protest against modernization and the liberalization of the welfare state . there it functions on a long-term basis ... yes , since it has to do with very pragmatic , loose alliances , which for the most part remain separate from one another and only come together for the election .
this just wo n't work in germany .
the left party has to position itself .
after the election , problems will surely develop , and so i see little chance that the party will remain together . is the spd seriously threatened by this new alliance ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no longer guaranteed spd voters the spd will definitely suffer losses at its base , the unionized milieu - voters who may not have gone to the polls had this party not materialized .
they must see their chance to express their anger and disappointment with the spd government , a chance to make their frustration known .
this is without doubt a threat for the spd . is the spd responding appropriately to this threat by attempting to slander the new alliance ? the spd has always assumed it was the voice of the left , the voice of the traditional organized labor in the broadest sense .
now there has been for a long , long time a serious competition here .
and the spd shows an allergic reaction and is flip-flopping : on the one hand , it is trying to restore its social competence , the intention to more strongly articulate social justice .
on the other hand they are trying to portray the new alliance as illegitimate .
this is bound to come off badly for those voters disappointed by the schröder government and will motivate them to keep their distance from the spd .
the spd 's strategy is thus not exactly helping them to woo back their base .
but it is difficult to imagine what the spd 's options are at this point . continue reading to find out whether lafontaine is fishing for voters on the extreme right . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de social justice or economic folly ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de election 2005 -pipe- 04.08.2005 " lafontaine is not a german haider " 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from spd leader to spd enemy : oskar lafontaine how strong is germany 's new leftist alliance ?
how dangerous is it for the social democrats ?
is the left party 's new front man , oskar lafontaine , wooing right wing voters ?
a political scientist offers answers . the political scientist and party researcher klaus detterbeck teaches at the institute for political science at the university of magdeburg . dw-world : what chances do you give the new leftist alliance in the expedited bundestag elections ? klaus detterbeck : i would put the chances relatively high .
i would , however , differentiate between a short-term success for the bundestag elections , and the long-term perspective , which i view more critically .
in the short-term , the party has the opportunity to fill a vacuum which exists in the current competition between the parties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators protesting in berlin against social welfare cuts for the voters in western germany there has been no outlet to express frustrations with reform of the social welfare system , the effects of market liberalization .
here the party is filling a gap .
in the long-term i see the problem that the alliance parties are actually quite heterogeneous , that both at the grassroots as well as the leadership level there are significant differences between the labor union members in the west and the old pds -lrb- party of democratic socialism , the successor of the communist party of east germany -rrb- cadre in the east .
the differences will be difficult to reconcile , both for the party platform and the political goals .
what brings the groups together is the protest against social reforms .
in the longer-term they will have a falling out . so the left party is a protest party ?
what will define their constituency ? in the west it will doubtless be the disaffected stalwarts of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , just that unionized milieu from which the spd drew its base over decades .
in the east it will be the old pds voters coming from various societal groupings .
on the one side there is thus the protest voter trying to prevent the east from being treated as second-class , but there is also the old gdr cadre .
it will definitely be a protest party .
when we look to other countries , for example to spain or sweden , we also see similar leftist groupings , also heterogeneous , drawing their members from communists , greens , and leftist activists .
they feed off of the protest against modernization and the liberalization of the welfare state . there it functions on a long-term basis ... yes , since it has to do with very pragmatic , loose alliances , which for the most part remain separate from one another and only come together for the election .
this just wo n't work in germany .
the left party has to position itself .
after the election , problems will surely develop , and so i see little chance that the party will remain together . is the spd seriously threatened by this new alliance ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no longer guaranteed spd voters the spd will definitely suffer losses at its base , the unionized milieu - voters who may not have gone to the polls had this party not materialized .
they must see their chance to express their anger and disappointment with the spd government , a chance to make their frustration known .
this is without doubt a threat for the spd . is the spd responding appropriately to this threat by attempting to slander the new alliance ? the spd has always assumed it was the voice of the left , the voice of the traditional organized labor in the broadest sense .
now there has been for a long , long time a serious competition here .
and the spd shows an allergic reaction and is flip-flopping : on the one hand , it is trying to restore its social competence , the intention to more strongly articulate social justice .
on the other hand they are trying to portray the new alliance as illegitimate .
this is bound to come off badly for those voters disappointed by the schröder government and will motivate them to keep their distance from the spd .
the spd 's strategy is thus not exactly helping them to woo back their base .
but it is difficult to imagine what the spd 's options are at this point . continue reading to find out whether lafontaine is fishing for voters on the extreme right . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de social justice or economic folly ?
the new hard-left grouping in germany , the left party , is sending tremors across the political landscape .
but , the party 's economic program has industry groups and economists shaking their heads , and worrying .
-lrb- aug .
3 , 2005 -rrb- the comeback kid former spd chairman oskar lafontaine has had a tumultuous career in politics , withdrawing twice from the limelight in the past three decades .
but this pugnacious and passionate " napoleon " is back for his waterloo .
-lrb- july 20 , 2005 -rrb- goodbye pds , hello " left party " after much back and forth , germany 's reform communist pds party on sunday voted in favor of joining a new leftist alliance , and agreed to change their name , as expected , to the left party .
-lrb- july 17 , 2005 -rrb- feedback what do you think of oskar lafontaine , his personal record and his politics ?
please include your name and country in your reply .

but their mandate is still unclear . around 100 unarmed military and civilian officials from the european union will monitor the implementation of a peace pact between the indonesian government and the separatist free aceh movement -lrb- gam -rrb- .
they will be joined by an equal number of monitors from the association of southeast asian nations -lrb- asean -rrb- . indonesia and gam tentatively reached a deal on july 17 to end almost 30 years of war , in which close to 15,000 people have died .
their pact includes the disarmament of rebels and a troop withdrawal from aceh . the pact is due to be signed on august 15 in helsinki - two days before the 60th anniversary of indonesian independence .
a 28-strong team of european and southeast asian officials visited banda aceh this week to make logistical preparations for the monitoring mission , which could begin shortly after the pact is signed . but the mission has so far only been defined in general terms .
a protocol of measures to take should the pact be violated has not been agreed on , nor has the length of the mission .

" we 're offering our support for the peace process , and we 'll try to accommodate the wishes of the indonesian government . " however , it 's questionable whether all the wishes of the indonesian side can really be fulfilled .

the sale represents a big step forward for the troubled retail giant , which suffered the worst crisis in its history in 2004 .
chief executive officer thomas middelhoff said the deal almost completes karstadtquelle 's goal of securing its finances . " this is a major milestone in the turnaround of our company and we are glad that it could be achieved in such a short time , " middelhoff said . the company also announced the sale of its 51-outlet sinnleffers chain to an international investors group comprised of deutsche industrie-holding -lrb- frankfurt -rrb- , hmd partners -lrb- us -rrb- and british real estate investor curzon global partners .
the 124-outlet runners point chain was sold to hannover finanz group .
karstadtquelle did not disclose the sales price of either deal . middelhoff said that staff at all 250 outlets involved in the sales would be taken over by the new owners . " the buyers have stated very clearly that business is to continue in the long run , " he said in an effort to allay fears that department store closures could lead to depressed city centers . concentrating on core business bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the deals leave karstadtquelle free to focus on its remaining core 89 department stores .
the company plans to remodel the stores and add new high-end fashion , furniture and sporting goods lines to draw customers in future . the disposals also give the company " more negotiating space " for future divestments , middelhoff said .
according to the divestment plan released in september , a logistics center in frankfurt is still to be sold . another source of concern for the company is its mail-order business , which saw revenues drop by 6.5 percent in the last quarter .
middelhoff promised a management shake-up of the unit last month . " this business will also be led back into the black , " he said . long-term strategy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new owners of karstadtquelle 's businesses promised to retain all staff karstadtquelle 's troubles reached a peak in 2004 due mainly to poor retail sales , and analysts have said the prognosis does n't look much better for 2005 .
german retail managers are also worried by the prospect of a possible hike in value-added sales tax . however , the company is confident that its restructuring plan will be successful in the long run . " we are glad to report that our margin has improved significantly in the first half of 2005 , " said middelhoff , adding that the company had reduced net debt by 800 million euros , not including the new divestments .
the company has reduced its number of employees by around 25,000 , resulting in a 16 percent decrease in staff costs . " overall , we have taken a large step towards ensuring the future of karstadtquelle , " middelhoff said . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deal reached at karstadtquelle management and unions at karstadtquelle finally reached agreement thursday on a package of measures aimed at pulling the troubled german department store chain out of its current crisis , company officials said .

china and the us have agreed to work together to try and prevent the expansion of the united nations security council to include a further six permanent seats , including one for germany . the contentious bid to enlarge the security council led by germany , japan , brazil and india , collectively known as the group of four or g4 , has met with steady resistance from both washington and beijing over the past months , but their joining forces to block the move is a departure which will likely further dilute any chance of the plan 's success .
speaking after a meeting with his newly-appointed us counterpart , john bolton , in new york , china 's un ambassador , wang guangya said they had agreed on a way to proceed together . " at this stage , i think our objective will be to oppose the g4 , to make sure that they do not have sufficient votes to risk dividing the house , " he said . expansion without division wang stated that the g4 plan would drive a wedge through the 191 un member states , adding that the ultimate objective of both the us and china was expansion without division . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : g4 foreign ministers " we agreed to work together to make sure that our interests are being maintained , which means that we have to work in parallel ways to see that the unity of the un members , the unity of every regional group will not be spoiled because of this maneuver and process , " he added . painfully slow process the issue of reforming the security council , which still reflects the power structure in the aftermath of wwii , has been on the un agenda for several years , but it has so far proved impossible to reach any agreement on exactly how it should be expanded . earlier this year , un secretary general kofi annan told member states that he wanted a decision before a summit of world leaders in september . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united nations general secretary kofi annan there are currently 15 council seats , just five of which are permanent .
the g4 resolution calls for the addition of six new permanent seats without the power of veto , and four non-permanent ones . germany , japan , brazil and india have earmarked four of the six seats for themselves and the remaining two for african nations .
egypt , nigeria and south africa are the leading contenders . bidding for african support heads of state and representatives of the 53-nation african union -lrb- au -rrb- are meeting in the ethiopian capital of addis ababa on thursday to try and reach a common position on the g4 expansion resolution , but there is little hope that the summit will produce any consensus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flags of the african union algeria 's un ambassador , abdallah baali , warned against any expectation of the meeting producing a unified position , " despite efforts to accommodate the g4 . "
delegates from the four aspirant countries are also there to drum up support for their cause . if their resolution is to have any chance of winning the two-thirds majority in a un general assembly vote , the g4 nations will need the support of the african union . for its part , the au is calling for the expansion of the council to 26 seats , with a total of seven new permanent seats with veto rights . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us reportedly opposed to berlin 's un bid us secretary of state condoleezza rice reportedly is opposed to germany 's bid for a permanent seat on the un security council .

but environmental groups themselves are n't so sure . germans who own a car ca n't avoid the fact that 65 cents -lrb- $ 0.80 -rrb- of every euro that goes into their fuel tank flows into state coffers in the form of various energy taxes . it may be a high price to pay in a country that prides itself on its environmentally-friendly policies .
but according to tanja loitz of climate seeks protection , a program supported by the german environment ministry , there are ways to help the environment and save money at the same time .
" most people do not know that most household co2 emissions come from heating , " she said , explaining why one of the campaign 's goals is to reduce the 120 million tons of annual household co2 emissions .
" there is not a lack of interest in the environment , but a lack of factual knowledge . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : home heating releases the most household greenhouse gasses raising awareness by saving money if the numerous recycling programs across the country are any indication , germans already tend to be an environmentally-conscious bunch .
in fact , 74 percent of germans rate protecting the environment as very important , according to a recent study conducted by pollster forsa .
at the same time , most of those surveyed were of different opinions when it came to the question of what could be done about it .
" consumers certainly find the topic interesting , but are only willing to become involved in small degrees if it affects their wallets , " said moritz lehmkuhl , head of climate partner , an organization that tries to raise awareness of climate change among businesses and the public .
" the idea that they should save money and shop for bargains still dominates among consumers . "
who should be held responsible ?
he agreed with loitz on the importance of individual participation if there is a chance of achieving the kyoto protocol 's goals of reducing greenhouse gasses by 5 percent of 1990 levels before 2012 , and that the best way to get people 's attention is by saying it will save them money .
environmental groups also say that minimizing monetary concerns is an effective way of changing daily habits . but some would like to see the government make polluting more costly instead of relying on people to be voluntarily more concerned about their surroundings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friends of the earth germany " people who voluntarily take part are already very environmentally conscious and think about their actions , " said markus steigenberger of friends of the earth germany .
" i do not think voluntary action programs have a large effect on the general population . "
the alternative of legal coercion , however , is not an effective way to make people responsible for their actions , lehmkuhl argued .
" taxes have a negative aftertaste , and with voluntary initiatives you can achieve something extra , " he said .
" it is important to show that people can personally do something . "
climate partner recommends consumers make online purchases through climate friends , a portal that invests sales commissions - exactly how much depends on company specific deals - in sustainable , climate-neutral projects around the world .
legislation more effective bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the average german produces about 11 tons of co2 a year steinberger of friends of the earth said that people who actually use these services to make up for the 11 tons of co2 the average german produces annually are doing the right thing and added that raising environmental awareness is crucial .
at the same time , legislation is the best way to help the environment , he said .
" we need defined goals and legislation that lets business and people act in a climate-friendly way and makes pollution expensive , " steinberger said .
climate seeks protection 's loitz suggests that the most effective laws would focus on rewarding those who prevent pollution rather than doling out punishments for those who cause it .
while environmental groups continue work to get stricter laws enacted and enforced , and climate seeks protection and climate partner continue their voluntary programs , all the groups maintain that increasing the environmental consciousness that keeps greenhouse gasses from being produced is necessary .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 04.08.2005 the cost of environmental pollution germany may be an eco-friendly place , but support for the environment does come at a price - a fact that some organizations are trying to disprove .
but environmental groups themselves are n't so sure . germans who own a car ca n't avoid the fact that 65 cents -lrb- $ 0.80 -rrb- of every euro that goes into their fuel tank flows into state coffers in the form of various energy taxes . it may be a high price to pay in a country that prides itself on its environmentally-friendly policies .
but according to tanja loitz of climate seeks protection , a program supported by the german environment ministry , there are ways to help the environment and save money at the same time .
" most people do not know that most household co2 emissions come from heating , " she said , explaining why one of the campaign 's goals is to reduce the 120 million tons of annual household co2 emissions .
" there is not a lack of interest in the environment , but a lack of factual knowledge . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : home heating releases the most household greenhouse gasses raising awareness by saving money if the numerous recycling programs across the country are any indication , germans already tend to be an environmentally-conscious bunch .
in fact , 74 percent of germans rate protecting the environment as very important , according to a recent study conducted by pollster forsa .
at the same time , most of those surveyed were of different opinions when it came to the question of what could be done about it .
" consumers certainly find the topic interesting , but are only willing to become involved in small degrees if it affects their wallets , " said moritz lehmkuhl , head of climate partner , an organization that tries to raise awareness of climate change among businesses and the public .
" the idea that they should save money and shop for bargains still dominates among consumers . "
who should be held responsible ?
he agreed with loitz on the importance of individual participation if there is a chance of achieving the kyoto protocol 's goals of reducing greenhouse gasses by 5 percent of 1990 levels before 2012 , and that the best way to get people 's attention is by saying it will save them money .

is this justified ? the party is certainly populist in the sense that they rail against change and modernization without really wanting to , or rather being able to say , what they would do differently .
it is a party that wants to excite tempers and encourage protest without being able to give answers .
one could say that this is not necessarily the role of a new opposition party .
it is a chance to express protest and it can lead the established parties to reconsider certain issues . gregor gysi and oskar lafontaine , the former spd chief , will act together as top candidates .
lafontaine in particular has been attacked by the spd and the greens .

the charge goes back to a speech lafontaine made , in which he spoke of " alien workers , " a concept from the rightist camp .
when one looks at the political development of lafontaine , i do n't think it 's fair to speak of a rightist leaning or an attempt to court rightist voters .
lafontaine has always been a nonconformist , someone who has always taken positions not directly in line with that of his party .
he is continuing with this .
so the comparison with haider is not justified . but does lafontaine really offer any sensible remedies ? lafontaine has , since his retreat from the federal government , been constantly appealing to the public , whether in publications or in talk shows , spreading his view of things - that is , a state control of the globalized economy .
he has time and again been criticized , that his solutions are completely unrealistic .
for himself and for the groupings he stands for , this is a reasonable answer to globalization .
it is , however , in the current situation , no adequate response .
it is impossible to see how a strong governmental , national control could be implemented at the european level .
should lafontaine be asked to implement his policies in the real world , then his alliance would really dissolve quite quickly .
but as an opposition party , as a protest party , such goals are legitimate .

is this justified ? the party is certainly populist in the sense that they rail against change and modernization without really wanting to , or rather being able to say , what they would do differently .
it is a party that wants to excite tempers and encourage protest without being able to give answers .
one could say that this is not necessarily the role of a new opposition party .
it is a chance to express protest and it can lead the established parties to reconsider certain issues . gregor gysi and oskar lafontaine , the former spd chief , will act together as top candidates .
lafontaine in particular has been attacked by the spd and the greens .
he was given the epithet of " german haider -lrb- austria 's right-wing populist politician -rrb- , " fishing for votes on the extreme right .
what do you think of this accusation ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jörg haider recently split from the populist freedom party he founded and started a new right-wing alliance no , in my opinion you ca n't look at it that way .
the charge goes back to a speech lafontaine made , in which he spoke of " alien workers , " a concept from the rightist camp .
when one looks at the political development of lafontaine , i do n't think it 's fair to speak of a rightist leaning or an attempt to court rightist voters .
lafontaine has always been a nonconformist , someone who has always taken positions not directly in line with that of his party .
he is continuing with this .
so the comparison with haider is not justified . but does lafontaine really offer any sensible remedies ? lafontaine has , since his retreat from the federal government , been constantly appealing to the public , whether in publications or in talk shows , spreading his view of things - that is , a state control of the globalized economy .
he has time and again been criticized , that his solutions are completely unrealistic .
for himself and for the groupings he stands for , this is a reasonable answer to globalization .
it is , however , in the current situation , no adequate response .
it is impossible to see how a strong governmental , national control could be implemented at the european level .
should lafontaine be asked to implement his policies in the real world , then his alliance would really dissolve quite quickly .
but as an opposition party , as a protest party , such goals are legitimate .
it is an opportunity for disgruntled voters to express that they do not agree with the course and the pace of the reforms .
thus the party fulfills a democratic function . steffen leidel interviewed klaus detterbeck -lrb- jc -rrb- back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de social justice or economic folly ?

how dangerous is it for the social democrats ?
is the left party 's new front man , oskar lafontaine , wooing right wing voters ?
a political scientist offers answers . the political scientist and party researcher klaus detterbeck teaches at the institute for political science at the university of magdeburg . dw-world : what chances do you give the new leftist alliance in the expedited bundestag elections ? klaus detterbeck : i would put the chances relatively high .
i would , however , differentiate between a short-term success for the bundestag elections , and the long-term perspective , which i view more critically .
in the short-term , the party has the opportunity to fill a vacuum which exists in the current competition between the parties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators protesting in berlin against social welfare cuts for the voters in western germany there has been no outlet to express frustrations with reform of the social welfare system , the effects of market liberalization .
here the party is filling a gap .
in the long-term i see the problem that the alliance parties are actually quite heterogeneous , that both at the grassroots as well as the leadership level there are significant differences between the labor union members in the west and the old pds -lrb- party of democratic socialism , the successor of the communist party of east germany -rrb- cadre in the east .
the differences will be difficult to reconcile , both for the party platform and the political goals .
what brings the groups together is the protest against social reforms .
in the longer-term they will have a falling out . so the left party is a protest party ?
what will define their constituency ? in the west it will doubtless be the disaffected stalwarts of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , just that unionized milieu from which the spd drew its base over decades .
in the east it will be the old pds voters coming from various societal groupings .
on the one side there is thus the protest voter trying to prevent the east from being treated as second-class , but there is also the old gdr cadre .
it will definitely be a protest party .
when we look to other countries , for example to spain or sweden , we also see similar leftist groupings , also heterogeneous , drawing their members from communists , greens , and leftist activists .
they feed off of the protest against modernization and the liberalization of the welfare state . there it functions on a long-term basis ... yes , since it has to do with very pragmatic , loose alliances , which for the most part remain separate from one another and only come together for the election .
this just wo n't work in germany .
the left party has to position itself .
after the election , problems will surely develop , and so i see little chance that the party will remain together . is the spd seriously threatened by this new alliance ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no longer guaranteed spd voters the spd will definitely suffer losses at its base , the unionized milieu - voters who may not have gone to the polls had this party not materialized .
they must see their chance to express their anger and disappointment with the spd government , a chance to make their frustration known .
this is without doubt a threat for the spd . is the spd responding appropriately to this threat by attempting to slander the new alliance ? the spd has always assumed it was the voice of the left , the voice of the traditional organized labor in the broadest sense .
now there has been for a long , long time a serious competition here .
and the spd shows an allergic reaction and is flip-flopping : on the one hand , it is trying to restore its social competence , the intention to more strongly articulate social justice .
on the other hand they are trying to portray the new alliance as illegitimate .
this is bound to come off badly for those voters disappointed by the schröder government and will motivate them to keep their distance from the spd .
the spd 's strategy is thus not exactly helping them to woo back their base .
but it is difficult to imagine what the spd 's options are at this point . continue reading to find out whether lafontaine is fishing for voters on the extreme right . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de social justice or economic folly ?

how dangerous is it for the social democrats ?
is the left party 's new front man , oskar lafontaine , wooing right wing voters ?
a political scientist offers answers . the political scientist and party researcher klaus detterbeck teaches at the institute for political science at the university of magdeburg . dw-world : what chances do you give the new leftist alliance in the expedited bundestag elections ? klaus detterbeck : i would put the chances relatively high .
i would , however , differentiate between a short-term success for the bundestag elections , and the long-term perspective , which i view more critically .
in the short-term , the party has the opportunity to fill a vacuum which exists in the current competition between the parties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators protesting in berlin against social welfare cuts for the voters in western germany there has been no outlet to express frustrations with reform of the social welfare system , the effects of market liberalization .
here the party is filling a gap .
in the long-term i see the problem that the alliance parties are actually quite heterogeneous , that both at the grassroots as well as the leadership level there are significant differences between the labor union members in the west and the old pds -lrb- party of democratic socialism , the successor of the communist party of east germany -rrb- cadre in the east .
the differences will be difficult to reconcile , both for the party platform and the political goals .
what brings the groups together is the protest against social reforms .
in the longer-term they will have a falling out . so the left party is a protest party ?
what will define their constituency ? in the west it will doubtless be the disaffected stalwarts of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , just that unionized milieu from which the spd drew its base over decades .
in the east it will be the old pds voters coming from various societal groupings .
on the one side there is thus the protest voter trying to prevent the east from being treated as second-class , but there is also the old gdr cadre .
it will definitely be a protest party .
when we look to other countries , for example to spain or sweden , we also see similar leftist groupings , also heterogeneous , drawing their members from communists , greens , and leftist activists .
they feed off of the protest against modernization and the liberalization of the welfare state . there it functions on a long-term basis ... yes , since it has to do with very pragmatic , loose alliances , which for the most part remain separate from one another and only come together for the election .
this just wo n't work in germany .
the left party has to position itself .
after the election , problems will surely develop , and so i see little chance that the party will remain together . is the spd seriously threatened by this new alliance ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no longer guaranteed spd voters the spd will definitely suffer losses at its base , the unionized milieu - voters who may not have gone to the polls had this party not materialized .
they must see their chance to express their anger and disappointment with the spd government , a chance to make their frustration known .
this is without doubt a threat for the spd . is the spd responding appropriately to this threat by attempting to slander the new alliance ? the spd has always assumed it was the voice of the left , the voice of the traditional organized labor in the broadest sense .
now there has been for a long , long time a serious competition here .
and the spd shows an allergic reaction and is flip-flopping : on the one hand , it is trying to restore its social competence , the intention to more strongly articulate social justice .
on the other hand they are trying to portray the new alliance as illegitimate .
this is bound to come off badly for those voters disappointed by the schröder government and will motivate them to keep their distance from the spd .
the spd 's strategy is thus not exactly helping them to woo back their base .
but it is difficult to imagine what the spd 's options are at this point . continue reading to find out whether lafontaine is fishing for voters on the extreme right . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de social justice or economic folly ?
the new hard-left grouping in germany , the left party , is sending tremors across the political landscape .

in the long-term i see the problem that the alliance parties are actually quite heterogeneous , that both at the grassroots as well as the leadership level there are significant differences between the labor union members in the west and the old pds -lrb- party of democratic socialism , the successor of the communist party of east germany -rrb- cadre in the east .
the differences will be difficult to reconcile , both for the party platform and the political goals .
what brings the groups together is the protest against social reforms .

what will define their constituency ? in the west it will doubtless be the disaffected stalwarts of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , just that unionized milieu from which the spd drew its base over decades .
in the east it will be the old pds voters coming from various societal groupings .
on the one side there is thus the protest voter trying to prevent the east from being treated as second-class , but there is also the old gdr cadre .
it will definitely be a protest party .

this is without doubt a threat for the spd . is the spd responding appropriately to this threat by attempting to slander the new alliance ? the spd has always assumed it was the voice of the left , the voice of the traditional organized labor in the broadest sense .

this is bound to come off badly for those voters disappointed by the schröder government and will motivate them to keep their distance from the spd .

however , some doubts remain . germany escaped legal action after the european commission ruled on thursday that while the lax system at the heart of the german visa scandal violated european union norms , berlin had since remedied the problem with a reformed policy that complies with eu rules . the scandal , for which foreign minister joschka fischer has accepted responsibility , revolves around the loose visa policies that allowed thousands of criminals and illegal workers , mainly from ukraine , to enter germany between 2000 and 2002 . commission spokesman friso roscam abbing told a news briefing that the german policy circular issued by fischer in 2000 , which the christian democrat opposition describes as an opening of " the floodgates to a wave of unsuitable migrants , " did not comply with a range of european directives or laws . fischer 's circular contravened eu laws " the 2000 -lrb- instruction -rrb- was not compatible with schengen law , with eu law , with the common consular instructions , " abbing said .
justice and security commissioner franco frattini added that the 2000 circular that was the basis for the easier policy " ran counter to the common consular instructions -lrb- cci -rrb- " . bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer passes the entrance of a parliamentary panel investigating the visa scandal in april . the directive from fischer 's office ordered german consulates , notably in eastern europe , to give applicants the benefit of the doubt if they could not fully justify their financial means of support or the purpose of their trip . however , after the german foreign ministry had been plunged into a crisis concerning the visas and a flood of migrants , the visa policy was amended to the satisfaction of the eu 's executive .

the news comes as iran 's new president mahmoud ahmadinejad faces up to tough decisions as he takes over the running of the islamic republic on thursday with the most pressing issue being the diplomatic stand-off with the european union and the united states which he inherited from his predecessor . the former revolutionary guard began his first day in office on thursday but the work of his government begins after saturday , the day he takes the oath of office and announces his cabinet . this weekend is likely to see the new president thrust into a row which could lead to un sanctions if iran does not back down from its threat to restart nuclear work which the europeans and americans suspect might be aimed at building an atomic bomb . on wednesday , iran announced that it would back off its threat to resume suspended uranium conversion activities , a move that was welcomed by the united states .
tehran had said it planned to resume the controversial fuel-cycle work this week but later signaled it would delay the start until saturday , in effect giving more time for diplomacy . new president but no new foreign policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even with ahmadinejad at the reins , there is no guarantee that iran will become a more diplomatic partner in the future .
the new president 's choices will continue to be determined by deference to supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei , iran 's most powerful figure . " he has to consult with the supreme leader , " said an unnamed political analyst in an interview with reuters .
" he came to power with the hardliners ' backing , now he has to satisfy them . " iran 's chief nuclear negotiator hassan rohani , who could be replaced by ahmadinejad , told state television there would be no policy change under any new negotiating team .
" iran 's nuclear policy is ... decided by top officials .

" it certainly is a positive thing that the steps that the iranians had previously suggested they would take have not occurred , " spokesman tom casey told reporters . the united states and its european allies have made clear that any move to restart fuel-cycle activities suspended under an accord struck in november could force them to seek possible un sanctions again iran .
" if they 've heeded those calls , that 's a good thing , " casey told the daily state department briefing . the iranian move gives britain , france and germany time to finalize a new package of economic and security incentives they had been working on to persuade tehran to renounce its enrichment program . a state department official , who asked not to be named , said the europeans had informed washington they would unveil the package over the weekend , perhaps as early as friday .

" " your side has continued to refrain from responding substantively to our proposals , in whole or even in part .
we intend to take a minimal step , " the letter said .
" the islamic republic of iran stringently desires a negotiated resumption of its enrichment activities and is prepared to continue in good faith and in an expeditious and result-oriented manner its negotiations , " it said . the so-called eu-3 were reportedly ready to offer the iranians guaranteed fuel for a nuclear power plant they are building at bushehr and others they may build further down the road .
the package was also expected to include trade benefits , including civilian aircraft and parts iran badly needs , help in joining the world trade organization and a promise to bring tehran into regional security talks . eu , us still at odds over iran deal the united states was initially skeptical about the european initiative to negotiate with iran but changed tack in march and agreed to back the effort .
still , speculation has persisted about potential differences in the us and european positions . the europeans have reportedly flirted with the idea of allowing iran to retain some limited civilian nuclear capacity .
the americans have insisted iran completely halt its fuel cycle work and dismantle its facilities . but the us administration insisted it was on the same page with its trans-atlantic allies as they prepared to make what could be a last-ditch offer to the iranians .

china and the us have agreed to work together to try and prevent the expansion of the united nations security council to include a further six permanent seats , including one for germany . the contentious bid to enlarge the security council led by germany , japan , brazil and india , collectively known as the group of four or g4 , has met with steady resistance from both washington and beijing over the past months , but their joining forces to block the move is a departure which will likely further dilute any chance of the plan 's success .

their pact includes the disarmament of rebels and a troop withdrawal from aceh . the pact is due to be signed on august 15 in helsinki - two days before the 60th anniversary of indonesian independence .
a 28-strong team of european and southeast asian officials visited banda aceh this week to make logistical preparations for the monitoring mission , which could begin shortly after the pact is signed . but the mission has so far only been defined in general terms .
a protocol of measures to take should the pact be violated has not been agreed on , nor has the length of the mission .
these and other details are expected to be addressed in the coming weeks . no reconstruction without peace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a local volunteer walks past a wall graffiti ' good by -lrb- e -rrb- banda aceh ' on a shop shutter in january in banda aceh , indonesia aceh was particularly hard hit by last december 's tsunami , and one could expect that the vast amount of reconstruction work still to be done might take precedence over the peace accord .
but the former eu representative in jakarta , ana maria gomes , said the accord ca n't wait . " we 're of the opinion that it 's only through an acceleration of the peace process that the reconstruction process can really begin to move forward , " gomes said .
" we 're offering our support for the peace process , and we 'll try to accommodate the wishes of the indonesian government . " however , it 's questionable whether all the wishes of the indonesian side can really be fulfilled .
indonesia 's military chief , endriartono sutarto , has requested that soldiers should be included among the monitors , in order to be able to react immediately should an emergency arise .
the eu framework , though , expressly excludes a military component from this type of mission . risk of failure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two soldiers guard the baiturrahman mosque on election day , in sept .
2004 , in banda aceh , indonesia generally the impression from jakarta is that it 's not overly keen to see the start of the international mission .
there 's considerable danger that not only gam hardliners , but also those within the indonesian military , could quickly foil the aims of the peace mission .
it would n't be the first time : in 2002 , a dozen observers from thailand and the philippines watched over a short-lived truce that ended as the spiral of violence grew out of control . the hope this time is that the aftermath of the devastating tsunami in indonesia will be enough to convince both sides in the aceh conflict to give peace - and reconstruction - a chance . tobias grote-beverborg -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tsunami relief all positive government says around five months after the tsunami disaster in south asia , berlin presented an optimistic preliminary report .

in the 1980s and 1990s the uk was widely seen as a bad place to grow old .
the state pension was well below the eu average , while the take up of benefits was notoriously low amongst the elderly .
horror stories of pensioners freezing to death in their own homes abounded .
in the 1980s and 1990s being elderly was the single biggest hallmark of poverty .
the idea that uk pensioners had a raw deal seeped into the collective consciousness .
in 2000 this was given further credence by the infamous ' packet of peanuts ' 70p rise in the state pension , which provoked widespread discontent .
golden age yet according to some experts , many of today 's pensioners and those about to retire , far from struggling to make ends meet , are living through a ' golden age ' .
they are immeasurably richer than their parents were , and what 's more , they are likely to enjoy a far more prosperous retirement than their children and grandchildren .
as a result of a fundamental shift in uk demographics , the prospects for people retiring in twenty or thirty years time look bleak ruth lea , centre for policy studies " i think that we will look back on this time as a sort of golden age , " ruth lea , director of the think-tank the centre for policy studies , told bbc news .
" many of those in retirement or about to retire enjoy sizeable occupational pensions .
" in addition , they may have bought their homes in the 1970s or 1980s for next to nothing and be sitting on a large profit . "
the figures certainly support the theory that the lot of uk pensioners has got much better in recent years .
according to official figures the number of pensioners defined as living in poverty has halved from 2.2 million to 1.1 million since 1996 , coinciding with a house price boom and the introduction of the means tested pensions credit .
how is it that nearly one in five britons live in poverty ?
in detail in fact , the drop off in pensioner poverty has been one of the major social changes of the past decade .
but experts say this ' golden age ' will pass soon .
" with a low birth rate and increased longevity there will soon be too few people of working age to support britain 's pensioners , " ms lea said .
" as a result of a fundamental shift in uk demographics , the prospects for people retiring in twenty or thirty years time look bleak . "
demographic strain the zero sum game is that by 2050 britain will move from having three-and-a-half workers for every pensioner to a ratio of fewer than two-and-a-half workers to every pensioner .
under such strain , many of the foundations of uk pension provision may give way .
ms lea told bbc news that the way the demographics were stacked in future the government would no longer be able to afford the present generous public sector pensions .
and one senior government pensions adviser , who wished to remain anonymous , told bbc news that there was genuine concern that in the future there could be serious social conflict between pensioners and a smaller number of taxpayers who are being asked to pay more and more to support retired people .
meanwhile , the fact that increases in the state pension are linked to prices rather than average wages means that future retirement prospects are grim for the estimated four out of ten britons who are likely to rely on it as their sole source of retirement income .
complaints about the state pension are no new thing according to the government actuary 's department if current trends continue the basic state pension will be worth less than 10 % of average earnings by 2050 .
anyone relying on just the state pension in 2050 will officially be living in poverty .
pension cuts at the same time , uk occupational pensions - once described by former labour social security minister frank field as the envy of the world - have fallen into a major crisis .
the majority of workplace final salary schemes - which offer employees a fixed percentage of their salary when they retire - have been closed to new members and replaced with money purchase schemes .
under a money purchase scheme , workers put money into a pension fund which is used to buy an annuity - a financial product which provides an income - when they retire .
that means the workers , not the company , are taking the risk .
according to investment management firm brewin dolphin wealth management the switch from final salary to money purchase has resulted in employers cutting the amount of money they pay into their workers ' pensions in half .
" the decline of workplace pensions is arguably the most serious threat of the lot , " malcolm mclean , chief executive of pensions advisory service -lrb- opas -rrb- , said .
" uk state provision has always lagged behind that of countries like france and germany but the vibrant occupational pension system made up for this , now this is n't what it was the onus is on the individual to save more . "
the decline of workplace pensions is arguably the most serious threat of the lot malcolm mclean , pensions advisory service and just when , according to mr mclean , uk workers need to save more to make up the shortfall in their pensions , consumers have been indulging in a credit-fuelled spending boom .
stark conclusion last october , the government pensions commission examined what was in store for those britons currently in their twenties , thirties and forties .
what the commission had to say should be enough to prompt sleepless nights for millions of britons .
the stark conclusion was that millions of britons are careering towards an impoverished old age .
and the problem could be most acute for britain 's women .
" in this scenario women continue to fare worse then men , " kate bellamy , senior policy officer with the fawcett society , told bbc news .
" many women take time off work to bring up children or care for relatives this prevents them from building up a full state or workplace pension . "
" what is more , women are still paid less than men and are often stuck in low paid poor promotion prospect work , " ms bellamy added .
the fawcett society , as well as age concern , has called for the state pension to be reformed so that women who take time off work to fulfil caring responsibilities have their national insurance contributions topped up by the government .
grim prospects the pensions commission will produce its final report into the future of uk pensions in the autumn .
the commission is set to recommend that individuals need to save more , work longer and pay more taxes .
but whatever solutions are proposed the prospects for future generations of pensioners look grim .
" i think that unless something radical happens many young people are heading for a very meagre old age which could drag on for thirty or so years , " mr mclean said .
" pensioner poverty is set to be a huge issue in the future , even those who traditionally thought they were safe from hardship will have to face up to the fact that it may affect them . "

the figures certainly support the theory that the lot of uk pensioners has got much better in recent years .
according to official figures the number of pensioners defined as living in poverty has halved from 2.2 million to 1.1 million since 1996 , coinciding with a house price boom and the introduction of the means tested pensions credit .

demographic strain the zero sum game is that by 2050 britain will move from having three-and-a-half workers for every pensioner to a ratio of fewer than two-and-a-half workers to every pensioner .

ms lea told bbc news that the way the demographics were stacked in future the government would no longer be able to afford the present generous public sector pensions .

meanwhile , the fact that increases in the state pension are linked to prices rather than average wages means that future retirement prospects are grim for the estimated four out of ten britons who are likely to rely on it as their sole source of retirement income .
complaints about the state pension are no new thing according to the government actuary 's department if current trends continue the basic state pension will be worth less than 10 % of average earnings by 2050 .
anyone relying on just the state pension in 2050 will officially be living in poverty .
pension cuts at the same time , uk occupational pensions - once described by former labour social security minister frank field as the envy of the world - have fallen into a major crisis .
the majority of workplace final salary schemes - which offer employees a fixed percentage of their salary when they retire - have been closed to new members and replaced with money purchase schemes .
under a money purchase scheme , workers put money into a pension fund which is used to buy an annuity - a financial product which provides an income - when they retire .
that means the workers , not the company , are taking the risk .
according to investment management firm brewin dolphin wealth management the switch from final salary to money purchase has resulted in employers cutting the amount of money they pay into their workers ' pensions in half .
" the decline of workplace pensions is arguably the most serious threat of the lot , " malcolm mclean , chief executive of pensions advisory service -lrb- opas -rrb- , said .

according to official figures the number of pensioners defined as living in poverty has halved from 2.2 million to 1.1 million since 1996 , coinciding with a house price boom and the introduction of the means tested pensions credit .
in fact , the drop off in pensioner poverty has been one of the major social changes of the past decade .
but experts say this ' golden age ' will pass soon .
" with a low birth rate and increased longevity there will soon be too few people of working age to support britain 's pensioners , " ms lea said .
" as a result of a fundamental shift in uk demographics , the prospects for people retiring in twenty or thirty years time look bleak . "
demographic strain the zero sum game is that by 2050 britain will move from having three-and-a-half workers for every pensioner to a ratio of fewer than two-and-a-half workers to every pensioner .
under such strain , many of the foundations of uk pension provision may give way .
ms lea told bbc news that the way the demographics were stacked in future the government would no longer be able to afford the present generous public sector pensions .
and one senior government pensions adviser , who wished to remain anonymous , told bbc news that there was genuine concern that in the future there could be serious social conflict between pensioners and a smaller number of taxpayers who are being asked to pay more and more to support retired people .
meanwhile , the fact that increases in the state pension are linked to prices rather than average wages means that future retirement prospects are grim for the estimated four out of ten britons who are likely to rely on it as their sole source of retirement income .
according to the government actuary 's department if current trends continue the basic state pension will be worth less than 10 % of average earnings by 2050 .
anyone relying on just the state pension in 2050 will officially be living in poverty .
pension cuts at the same time , uk occupational pensions - once described by former labour social security minister frank field as the envy of the world - have fallen into a major crisis .
the majority of workplace final salary schemes - which offer employees a fixed percentage of their salary when they retire - have been closed to new members and replaced with money purchase schemes .
under a money purchase scheme , workers put money into a pension fund which is used to buy an annuity - a financial product which provides an income - when they retire .
that means the workers , not the company , are taking the risk .
according to investment management firm brewin dolphin wealth management the switch from final salary to money purchase has resulted in employers cutting the amount of money they pay into their workers ' pensions in half .
" the decline of workplace pensions is arguably the most serious threat of the lot , " malcolm mclean , chief executive of pensions advisory service -lrb- opas -rrb- , said .
" uk state provision has always lagged behind that of countries like france and germany but the vibrant occupational pension system made up for this , now this is n't what it was the onus is on the individual to save more . "
" the decline of workplace pensions is arguably the most serious threat of the lot " malcolm mclean , pensions advisory service and just when , according to mr mclean , uk workers need to save more to make up the shortfall in their pensions , consumers have been indulging in a credit-fuelled spending boom .
stark conclusion last october , the government pensions commission examined what was in store for those britons currently in their twenties , thirties and forties .
what the commission had to say should be enough to prompt sleepless nights for millions of britons .
the stark conclusion was that millions of britons are careering towards an impoverished old age .
and the problem could be most acute for britain 's women .
" in this scenario women continue to fare worse then men , " kate bellamy , senior policy officer with the fawcett society , told bbc news .
" many women take time off work to bring up children or care for relatives this prevents them from building up a full state or workplace pension . "
" what is more , women are still paid less than men and are often stuck in low paid poor promotion prospect work , " ms bellamy added .
the fawcett society , as well as age concern , has called for the state pension to be reformed so that women who take time off work to fulfil caring responsibilities have their national insurance contributions topped up by the government .
grim prospects the pensions commission will produce its final report into the future of uk pensions in the autumn .
the commission is set to recommend that individuals need to save more , work longer and pay more taxes .
but whatever solutions are proposed the prospects for future generations of pensioners look grim .
" i think that unless something radical happens many young people are heading for a very meagre old age which could drag on for thirty or so years , " mr mclean said .
" pensioner poverty is set to be a huge issue in the future , even those who traditionally thought they were safe from hardship will have to face up to the fact that it may affect them . "

i 've seen all my three sons survive being a rabbi 's son . "
the answer rabbi dr reuven silverman gives , when asked about his biggest achievement , is telling .
rabbi silverman has spent 28 years at the helm of manchester reform synagogue in the heart of the city - a position he gained after passing a job interview in 1977 .
" they asked which football team i supported and i told them united .
they assumed it was manchester , but i actually support leeds united . "
he obviously sees his job as looking after a family - not just in terms of his relatives , but also in what he sees as the " extended family " of his congregation .
" there are people who do n't have a family .
for them , this congregation is their family , " he says .
" holding together a very disparate community " is what the rabbi considers to be his other biggest achievement .
in pictures : a rabbi 's day " they come from all over manchester and they 've all got differing shades of commitment to judaism .
some come from orthodox backgrounds , some not , and some have converted to judaism . "
he says the congregation has remained at a " steady " level of about 1,500 people in recent years .
" what 's encouraging is that we have seen a growth of younger people , " he said .
reformism is loyal to jewish traditions while reflecting modernity , and there are three reform congregations in manchester .
rabbi silverman said his congregation had been concentrating in recent months on developing inter-faith relationships .
the need for this was brought into sharp focus by the recent bomb attacks in london .
to that end , an annual weekend conference for members of northern reform synagogues planned for november , entitled ' faith to faith ' , will explore such issues .
" the important thing is for us to encourage a theological atmosphere of liberalism and to get together liberal-minded people of other faiths to encourage this , " rabbi silverman says .
' disproportionate power ' he believes it is impossible to change the minds of fundamentalists , but it is important to " keep the general atmosphere of our country on a non-fundamentalist tack " .
manchester reform synagogue 1857 : founded when orthodox synagogue splits into two congregations 1858 : first synagogue consecrated near the city 's cheetham hill road 1941 : that building destroyed by bomb on 1 june during blitz of city 1941 to 1953 : no break in services as congregation uses alternative accommodation 1953 : current building opened on 29 november " there are fundamentalists of all religions , including judaism .
" but reformism is opposed to that . "
the movement for reform judaism says it is " dismayed by the disproportionate power and influence of extreme right-wing jewish fanaticism and its unacceptable discrimination against non-orthodox jews " .
' critical mind ' on the subject of israel , rabbi silverman sees his movement as a critical friend of the country .
" we keep a very critical mind on developments in israel whilst being very supportive of israel , " he said .
" we are not blinkered and we speak our minds openly in terms of human rights .
" i 've had a couple of visits to israel and palestine in recent months as part of my involvement with rabbis for human rights in israel . "
the movement 's position on israel is that it is " deeply saddened that , up until now , the palestinians have failed to agree peace terms which we believe to have been a fair and just settlement of the conflicting claims and clashing rights that have bought so much suffering to the area " .
dr silverman 's career path wanted to become a rabbi at about eight years old training as a rabbi , including stint as student rabbi at manchester reform synagogue three years at edgware reform synagogue in 1977 , passes interview for job as manchester reform synagogue rabbi the only " just and peaceful solution " to the present problems in the area is one " based on two states sharing the land and living in mutual respect " , the movement adds .
new building but dealing with dramatic world events does not mean that rabbi silverman 's day-to-day tasks at the synagogue take a back seat .
helping a 12-year-old boy with bar mitzvah preparations , counselling a congregation member with a seriously ill relative , meeting the head teacher of the synagogue 's religious school and preparing an 82-year-old member of the congregation to read from the hebrew scriptures when the rabbi goes on holiday are all part of his day .
and he will become even busier in the next few years with the construction of a new building on the site of the current one which , he says , is " stuck in the 1950s " .
" i find it very scary and we 'll be without the building for about a year , " rabbi silverman says .
but the truth is that he is relishing the opportunity to further strengthen the community he has helped to build and maintain over the last 28 years .
" it 's an opportunity to pull together and to help people strengthen bonds . "

they 're first-name type of guys ; they wear sandals ; they never , ever stick to the point .
" i 'm a figure of beauty , " craig proclaims , lounging in his comfortable chair , feet firmly on the table .
" but while i reek of glamour , it 's just an illusion " .
" even when i was youthful , i was not very youthful , " the 52-year-old blurts , only for jim to chip in : " old young man becomes young old man . "
global reach do n't be deceived , though : this sunny californian banter conceals an online venture that has become a cultural phenomenon .
craigslist.com , their classified adverts website , has quietly emerged as one of the top 10 internet companies in the world in terms of page views , attracting more than 10 million unique visitors per month and with a presence in 175 cities across 34 countries .
the sites ' success has come in spite of , or perhaps because of , their notably basic , almost amateurish , design .
" brevity is the soul of wit , " craig declares , insisting that " the site is deliberately very plain " .
everything and nothing is a commodity on this virtual flea market , whose addictive nature has arisen from a bizarre blend of shopping and flirting : anything from cheap sofas or bicycles or electronic gadgets , to new apartments and casual sex is brokered here .
it is free as well , for everyone except companies placing job adverts in san francisco , los angeles and new york , and even these fees are low , ranging from $ 25 to $ 75 .
craigslist 's popularity has seen it tipped as the next google or ebay , and made craig and jim into hot media property hounded by hollywood moguls keen to bring their experiences to the silver screen .
numbers game the figures seem to justify the hype . "
" we think of ourselves as a community service , but we have a business structure out of necessity " craig newmark customer service rep and founder craigslist.com more than five million new classified adverts per month generate 2.5 billion page views .
each month , the website runs a million new forums postings and publishes 160,000 job adverts , according to company pr susan mactavish best , who has " known craig for years " and who also happens to cohabit with jim .
and all this is run by a team of no more than 18 staff to look after the technical kit , to moderate the discussion boards and to deal with what craig describes as " misbehaving apartment brokers in new york " .
the sites are self-policing : if enough users who find an advert offensive click to have it removed , it will simply disappear .
business or pleasure ?
which raises the question : is craigslist a business , or simply an unusually successful hobby ?
" we 're a business , " responds jim hesitantly .
although the company is tight-lipped about its finances , estimates put its annual earnings at around $ 10m ; not enormous compared with its potential , yet sufficient to ensure craig can afford the " few luxuries " he enjoys - namely " gadgets and overpriced coffee " .
" we think of ourselves as a community service , but we have a business structure out of necessity , " explains craig .
craig and jim are actively resisting the temptation to maximise profits , though with investors desperate to get in on the act they are having to fight hard to stay true to their beliefs .
share and share alike already , though , shares in craigslist have trickled through their fingers : ebay recently acquired a 25 % stake from a former employee , a deal neither craig nor jim is keen to comment on .
" we do n't talk about who owns us , " says jim , insisting that ebay " has a similar philosophy to ours " .
the deal seems to be a sore point , though .
when asked about what the former employee has done with the money from ebay , jim 's reply is curt .
" we 're not really in contact with them so we 're not sure what they 're doing . "
lack of trust craigslist 's rivals are not fooled by its apparently listless approach to business .
some analysts are already predicting that newspaper classified advertising could vanish entirely .
investment bank goldman sachs describes craigslist as " a real menace " to newspapers , and warns that " all publishers face a significant threat to their profitability " .
neither craig nor jim seem to lament the threat they pose to the future of local newspapers , however .
" people trust conventional media less and less , " says craig .
adds jim : " where do you want to throw your sympathies ?
with huge conglomerates or with millions of people who can use our services to get on with their lives ? "
