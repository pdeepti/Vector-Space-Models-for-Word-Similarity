in tv ads , most people are young and beautiful .
but this is changing in germany and elsewhere in europe as businesses discover that seniors have lots of money they 'd prefer to spend on products created for their needs . in the reality portrayed by tv advertisers , a 30-year-old man can afford to buy the latest mercedes-benz , only young people drink € 15 -lrb- $ 20 -rrb- bottles of champagne and even anti-wrinkle cream is applied by beautiful women who do n't look a day over 30 .
thus , when older people go shopping they often feel they 've been overlooked . eve fear , 65 , does n't feel tempted to buy anything when she goes to fashionable stores at home in birmingham in britain , she says .
young women look down at her from the large posters as if to say : " this is not for you , you 're too old for that . " " certainly we are not catered for within the fashion world and lots of older people do have a lot of money to spend , " eve fear said .
" there 's certainly still poverty amongst older people in britain but they like their holidays .
that kind of thing can all affect the economy . " for too long , business has only cared about the 14- 49 year olds , eve fear says .
but the politicians , businesspeople and seniors who met recently for an international conference in bonn to discuss seniors ' needs for new products determined that the future may just be in consumers beyond 50 , an ever larger part of society in industrialized countries . taking advantage of demographic change " in the year 2040 a third of the german citizens will be older than 60 , " birgit fischer , minister for family and seniors in the german state of north rhine-westphalia pointed out .
" there are already cities and communities where we have more 70- than seven-year olds .
because of that we need another perspective on the older generation .
economic growth and opportunities for society depend on that . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 've got the money still , political and economic views of seniors are often one-sided in germany , where older people are largely seen as an expense .
it 's true that the growing number of old people will have to rely on a decreasing number of younger people to finance old-age pensions .
additionally , health-care costs increase as society ages .
but by focusing only on problems , society risks missing the opportunities that " demographic change " offers . take spending power , for instance .
the spending capacity of germany 's seniors alone is € 90 billion - the gross domestic product of venezuela .
and people over 50 own half of germany 's wealth , according to a study by allensbach demographic institute .
of course , some do only live off € 400 a month , a minimum to exist .
but generally older people live much more comfortably than , say , many single mothers .
on average , a pensioner in a two-person household has € 1,600 to spend each month , about € 100 more than a member of a family with children under 17 .
a young , single mother with one child lives off only € 800 monthly on average . and older people have the time to spend their money , too . time and money on their hands " the impression is that older people are not interesting for the market because they often think they are old so they do n't spend a lot of money , they do n't have a lot of activities , " says the senior citizen 's representative in the dutch city of maastricht , salden stella .
but stella says the opposite is true .
" we see now that older people are very active . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who says seniors are n't active ?
as european business discovers seniors as a target group , they 're changing their tactics .
even the youth-obsessed advertising industry has begun trying to attract the older customers ; the " best agers " and " 50plus " are the heroes of the " silver economy . "
big companies have started employing so-called senior scouts , older people who test particular products in supermarkets for seniors .
can a coffee package be opened easily without agile young fingers ?
are the keys of a mobile phone big enough to call the doctor in an emergency ? " the sale of cars could be increased by 5 to 8 percent if the industry would offer cars that are senior-compatible , if they would care for the aged as a consumer group , " says klaus gretschmann of the council of the european union . " these are restraints that we have to remove and if we erase them the whole seniors sector will contribute to european economic growth .

but there is growing opposition to the proposals . a controversy is gathering pace in germany over proposals put forward by the regional state government of hesse to offer tax breaks to high-paid corporate executives , primarily in the banking sector , at a time when unemployment is at postwar highs . the bundesrat , or upper house of german parliament , on thursday is to examine proposals drawn up by hesse 's conservative state premier , roland koch , to cut the tax rate for super-rich executives to 35 percent from 42 percent for a period of three years . beneficiaries of the tax breaks would be corporate executives grossing more than € 77,000 -lrb- $ 101,000 -rrb- per year or € 151,000 for married bosses .
the aim would be to attract foreign managers and top employees to hesse and its financial centre , frankfurt . bad timing the timing of koch 's initiative could not be worse .
this week , jobless data showed that the number of people out of work in the eurozone 's biggest economy stands at a postwar high of 5.216 million , or 12.6 percent of the workforce . the draft proposals have been dubbed the " ackermann law " after josef ackermann , the head of germany 's biggest bank deutsche bank and the best-paid corporate chief in the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ackermann was also one of the fat cats involved in the high profile mannesmann trial in 2004 along with former mannesmann chairman klaus esser , mannesmann 's former supervisory board chief joachim funk , the former head of the powerful ig metall trade union , klaus zwickel , and two others . they were accused of approving 111.5 million deutsche marks -lrb- $ 71 million -rrb- in bonuses to management board members during the multi-billion-euro takeover of mannesmann by british mobile phone giant vodafone in 2000 .
esser alone pocketed more than € 15 million . all of those involved were cleared of any wrongdoing but the case raised serious questions about the virtual untouchable status of germany 's top executives and the rules governing their money . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no tax breaks for the super rich says hans eichel .
the tax break proposals have run into widespread resistance .
german finance minister hans eichel said : " there will be no tax breaks for the super rich with this government . "

that 's why their handlers are pampering them . many people have called in sick in recent weeks because of the flu that 's swept across the country .
at berlin 's zoo , officials are making sure that their animals do n't fall prey to viruses by boosting their immune systems . " we have to watch carefully that no animal gets sick or suffers from frost bites , " rudofl reinhard , a berlin zoologist , told dpa news service . while monkeys get fed a lot of fruit at the moment , " we 've ordered bags and bags of vitamin c for rhinos , " reinhard said . but zoo officials are n't just thinking of protective measures that work from the inside .
they cover paths with sand so that antelopes do n't break their ankles and regularly check rhino ears and elephant tails , which easily get frostbite . another trick to keep animals happy during those dark winter days is one that the majority of germans use too : sunbeds .
the zoo folks have n't resorted to it yet , but they say if it gets too dark , the rhinos at least will benefit from a little uv therapy . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de when business gets the flu anti-virus programs , security updates , firewalls – companies invest millions to protect computers from damaging viruses while little is done to prevent influenza , an equally costly bug in terms of lost productivity .

when bauhaus founder walter gropius fitted out the mess hall of the famous architecture college in dessau with the elegant , curved stool back in the 1920s , he launched the career of a design classic . decades later , the humble seat is at the heart of an acrimonious legal tussle . tecta vs. knoll tecta , a company based in the german state of lower saxony , is no longer allowed to sell the tubular steel stool it began marketing in 1982 .
moreover , the court ordered the company hand over all its profits from sales of the chair - as well as its matching table , the ' c4 ' - to rival business knoll international , which has an older claim to the design rights . knoll international sells a stool known as the ' laccio , ' which closely resembles breuer 's 1925 b9 model .
its sole difference is that while the b9 is sheer white , ' laccio ' is raven black . furniture feuds the dispute over the highly lucrative licence for the b9 has been dragging on for years . tecta argues it owns the rights because it signed a contract with the berlin bauhaus archive based on an agreement with breuer 's widow constanze .
in court , however , knoll was able to go one further , producing contracts personally signed by breuer in the 1960s .
the company came into possession of the documents when almost 50 years ago it acquired gavina , an italian company which had bought the rights to the b9 from the designer himself . bildunterschrift : dino gavina has revealed that the contract was considered valid for only ten years at the time of signing , which has prompted tecta to announce it will file an appeal . not the first time if so , it wo n't be the first time .
three years ago , the company won a legal battle with another company , l & c stendal , which manufactured copies of the breuer stool .
in court , l & c stendal argued that a stool is a household object rather than a work of art and therefore not subject to licencing laws .
in its final ruling , the court deemed the stool was indeed a work of art , and upheld the contract between tecta and breuer 's heirs . the battle over breuer one of the most influential designers of the 20th century , breuer both studied and taught at germany 's bauhaus school of architecture and design -lrb- photo -rrb- , which pioneered modern principles , technologies and the application of new materials in both the industrial and fine arts . an early fan of tubular steel , breuer designed a whole range of metal furniture including chairs , tables , stools and cupboards .

its sole difference is that while the b9 is sheer white , ' laccio ' is raven black . furniture feuds the dispute over the highly lucrative licence for the b9 has been dragging on for years . tecta argues it owns the rights because it signed a contract with the berlin bauhaus archive based on an agreement with breuer 's widow constanze .
in court , however , knoll was able to go one further , producing contracts personally signed by breuer in the 1960s .
the company came into possession of the documents when almost 50 years ago it acquired gavina , an italian company which had bought the rights to the b9 from the designer himself . bildunterschrift : dino gavina has revealed that the contract was considered valid for only ten years at the time of signing , which has prompted tecta to announce it will file an appeal . not the first time if so , it wo n't be the first time .
three years ago , the company won a legal battle with another company , l & c stendal , which manufactured copies of the breuer stool .
in court , l & c stendal argued that a stool is a household object rather than a work of art and therefore not subject to licencing laws .
in its final ruling , the court deemed the stool was indeed a work of art , and upheld the contract between tecta and breuer 's heirs . the battle over breuer one of the most influential designers of the 20th century , breuer both studied and taught at germany 's bauhaus school of architecture and design -lrb- photo -rrb- , which pioneered modern principles , technologies and the application of new materials in both the industrial and fine arts . an early fan of tubular steel , breuer designed a whole range of metal furniture including chairs , tables , stools and cupboards .

in tv ads , most people are young and beautiful .
but this is changing in germany and elsewhere in europe as businesses discover that seniors have lots of money they 'd prefer to spend on products created for their needs . in the reality portrayed by tv advertisers , a 30-year-old man can afford to buy the latest mercedes-benz , only young people drink € 15 -lrb- $ 20 -rrb- bottles of champagne and even anti-wrinkle cream is applied by beautiful women who do n't look a day over 30 .
thus , when older people go shopping they often feel they 've been overlooked . eve fear , 65 , does n't feel tempted to buy anything when she goes to fashionable stores at home in birmingham in britain , she says .
young women look down at her from the large posters as if to say : " this is not for you , you 're too old for that . " " certainly we are not catered for within the fashion world and lots of older people do have a lot of money to spend , " eve fear said .
" there 's certainly still poverty amongst older people in britain but they like their holidays .
that kind of thing can all affect the economy . " for too long , business has only cared about the 14- 49 year olds , eve fear says .
but the politicians , businesspeople and seniors who met recently for an international conference in bonn to discuss seniors ' needs for new products determined that the future may just be in consumers beyond 50 , an ever larger part of society in industrialized countries . taking advantage of demographic change " in the year 2040 a third of the german citizens will be older than 60 , " birgit fischer , minister for family and seniors in the german state of north rhine-westphalia pointed out .
" there are already cities and communities where we have more 70- than seven-year olds .
because of that we need another perspective on the older generation .
economic growth and opportunities for society depend on that . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 've got the money still , political and economic views of seniors are often one-sided in germany , where older people are largely seen as an expense .
it 's true that the growing number of old people will have to rely on a decreasing number of younger people to finance old-age pensions .
additionally , health-care costs increase as society ages .
but by focusing only on problems , society risks missing the opportunities that " demographic change " offers . take spending power , for instance .
the spending capacity of germany 's seniors alone is € 90 billion - the gross domestic product of venezuela .
and people over 50 own half of germany 's wealth , according to a study by allensbach demographic institute .
of course , some do only live off € 400 a month , a minimum to exist .
but generally older people live much more comfortably than , say , many single mothers .
on average , a pensioner in a two-person household has € 1,600 to spend each month , about € 100 more than a member of a family with children under 17 .
a young , single mother with one child lives off only € 800 monthly on average . and older people have the time to spend their money , too . time and money on their hands " the impression is that older people are not interesting for the market because they often think they are old so they do n't spend a lot of money , they do n't have a lot of activities , " says the senior citizen 's representative in the dutch city of maastricht , salden stella .
but stella says the opposite is true .
" we see now that older people are very active . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who says seniors are n't active ?
as european business discovers seniors as a target group , they 're changing their tactics .
even the youth-obsessed advertising industry has begun trying to attract the older customers ; the " best agers " and " 50plus " are the heroes of the " silver economy . "
big companies have started employing so-called senior scouts , older people who test particular products in supermarkets for seniors .
can a coffee package be opened easily without agile young fingers ?
are the keys of a mobile phone big enough to call the doctor in an emergency ? " the sale of cars could be increased by 5 to 8 percent if the industry would offer cars that are senior-compatible , if they would care for the aged as a consumer group , " says klaus gretschmann of the council of the european union .

when bauhaus founder walter gropius fitted out the mess hall of the famous architecture college in dessau with the elegant , curved stool back in the 1920s , he launched the career of a design classic . decades later , the humble seat is at the heart of an acrimonious legal tussle . tecta vs. knoll tecta , a company based in the german state of lower saxony , is no longer allowed to sell the tubular steel stool it began marketing in 1982 .
moreover , the court ordered the company hand over all its profits from sales of the chair - as well as its matching table , the ' c4 ' - to rival business knoll international , which has an older claim to the design rights . knoll international sells a stool known as the ' laccio , ' which closely resembles breuer 's 1925 b9 model .
its sole difference is that while the b9 is sheer white , ' laccio ' is raven black . furniture feuds the dispute over the highly lucrative licence for the b9 has been dragging on for years . tecta argues it owns the rights because it signed a contract with the berlin bauhaus archive based on an agreement with breuer 's widow constanze .
in court , however , knoll was able to go one further , producing contracts personally signed by breuer in the 1960s .
the company came into possession of the documents when almost 50 years ago it acquired gavina , an italian company which had bought the rights to the b9 from the designer himself . bildunterschrift : dino gavina has revealed that the contract was considered valid for only ten years at the time of signing , which has prompted tecta to announce it will file an appeal . not the first time if so , it wo n't be the first time .
three years ago , the company won a legal battle with another company , l & c stendal , which manufactured copies of the breuer stool .
in court , l & c stendal argued that a stool is a household object rather than a work of art and therefore not subject to licencing laws .
in its final ruling , the court deemed the stool was indeed a work of art , and upheld the contract between tecta and breuer 's heirs . the battle over breuer one of the most influential designers of the 20th century , breuer both studied and taught at germany 's bauhaus school of architecture and design -lrb- photo -rrb- , which pioneered modern principles , technologies and the application of new materials in both the industrial and fine arts . an early fan of tubular steel , breuer designed a whole range of metal furniture including chairs , tables , stools and cupboards .

that 's why their handlers are pampering them . many people have called in sick in recent weeks because of the flu that 's swept across the country .
at berlin 's zoo , officials are making sure that their animals do n't fall prey to viruses by boosting their immune systems . " we have to watch carefully that no animal gets sick or suffers from frost bites , " rudofl reinhard , a berlin zoologist , told dpa news service . while monkeys get fed a lot of fruit at the moment , " we 've ordered bags and bags of vitamin c for rhinos , " reinhard said . but zoo officials are n't just thinking of protective measures that work from the inside .
they cover paths with sand so that antelopes do n't break their ankles and regularly check rhino ears and elephant tails , which easily get frostbite . another trick to keep animals happy during those dark winter days is one that the majority of germans use too : sunbeds .
the zoo folks have n't resorted to it yet , but they say if it gets too dark , the rhinos at least will benefit from a little uv therapy . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de when business gets the flu anti-virus programs , security updates , firewalls – companies invest millions to protect computers from damaging viruses while little is done to prevent influenza , an equally costly bug in terms of lost productivity .

when bauhaus founder walter gropius fitted out the mess hall of the famous architecture college in dessau with the elegant , curved stool back in the 1920s , he launched the career of a design classic . decades later , the humble seat is at the heart of an acrimonious legal tussle . tecta vs. knoll tecta , a company based in the german state of lower saxony , is no longer allowed to sell the tubular steel stool it began marketing in 1982 .
moreover , the court ordered the company hand over all its profits from sales of the chair - as well as its matching table , the ' c4 ' - to rival business knoll international , which has an older claim to the design rights . knoll international sells a stool known as the ' laccio , ' which closely resembles breuer 's 1925 b9 model .
its sole difference is that while the b9 is sheer white , ' laccio ' is raven black . furniture feuds the dispute over the highly lucrative licence for the b9 has been dragging on for years . tecta argues it owns the rights because it signed a contract with the berlin bauhaus archive based on an agreement with breuer 's widow constanze .
in court , however , knoll was able to go one further , producing contracts personally signed by breuer in the 1960s .
the company came into possession of the documents when almost 50 years ago it acquired gavina , an italian company which had bought the rights to the b9 from the designer himself . bildunterschrift : dino gavina has revealed that the contract was considered valid for only ten years at the time of signing , which has prompted tecta to announce it will file an appeal . not the first time if so , it wo n't be the first time .
three years ago , the company won a legal battle with another company , l & c stendal , which manufactured copies of the breuer stool .
in court , l & c stendal argued that a stool is a household object rather than a work of art and therefore not subject to licencing laws .
in its final ruling , the court deemed the stool was indeed a work of art , and upheld the contract between tecta and breuer 's heirs . the battle over breuer one of the most influential designers of the 20th century , breuer both studied and taught at germany 's bauhaus school of architecture and design -lrb- photo -rrb- , which pioneered modern principles , technologies and the application of new materials in both the industrial and fine arts . an early fan of tubular steel , breuer designed a whole range of metal furniture including chairs , tables , stools and cupboards .

children of single parents and immigrant families are especially threatened . the report , released by the united nations children 's fund -lrb- unicef -rrb- on tuesday , found that in three quarters of the richest countries in the world child poverty has risen sometimes dramatically over the last 10 years .
it also said child poverty was on the increase because efforts of governments in the 26 most industrialized countries has waned in the past decades . the marked increase in child poverty in rich countries comes as a surprise and shatters popular perceptions that recent increases in wealth in the first world would be evenly spread among all people in society , according to the report 's authors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unicef logo peter adamson from unicef said that western governments appear to have dropped former ideals of creating equal living standards and argues that birth circumstances should not determine the life-time opportunities of children today . " there is a legitimate concern that progress towards that ideal has slowed , that some kind of barrier has been lowered , " he said .
" that barrier may well be the level and persistence of poverty and disadvantage in childhood .

unicef warned that child poverty will have lasting effects on the countries ‘ economic competitiveness and social cohesion . " children who grow up in poverty are at a marked and measurable disadvantage in their future lives , " adamson said .
" there is a strong statistical correlation between poverty in childhood and a variety of very well documented problems in later life .

altogether , about 1.5 million children in germany grow up in relative poverty . reinhard schlagintweit of unicef germany demanded swift action from the government of chancellor gerhard schröder , which was expected to discuss the report during a cabinet meeting on wednesday . " first there must be better opportunities for women with children to return to their jobs , " he said .
" secondly we must improve our education system at the lowest levels , including greater efforts to integrate non-german-speaking children .

children of single parents and immigrant families are especially threatened . the report , released by the united nations children 's fund -lrb- unicef -rrb- on tuesday , found that in three quarters of the richest countries in the world child poverty has risen sometimes dramatically over the last 10 years .
it also said child poverty was on the increase because efforts of governments in the 26 most industrialized countries has waned in the past decades . the marked increase in child poverty in rich countries comes as a surprise and shatters popular perceptions that recent increases in wealth in the first world would be evenly spread among all people in society , according to the report 's authors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unicef logo peter adamson from unicef said that western governments appear to have dropped former ideals of creating equal living standards and argues that birth circumstances should not determine the life-time opportunities of children today . " there is a legitimate concern that progress towards that ideal has slowed , that some kind of barrier has been lowered , " he said .
" that barrier may well be the level and persistence of poverty and disadvantage in childhood . " nordic countries fare best according to the study compiled by unicef ’ s institute in florence , italy , the northern european states of denmark and finland have the lowest levels of child poverty with 2.4 percent and 2.8 percent respectively .
the poverty line has been fixed at about € 8,000 -lrb- $ 10,500 -rrb- family income a year or less than half of the average income of a normal national houshold . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : begging for money on a mexican street the united states and mexico are at the bottom of the list of 25 industrialized countries with poverty levels of 21 and 27 percent .
unicef , however , is most alarmed by the rapid rise in child poverty in many wealthy nations .
only one third of countries have made progress in the last year with britain making the biggest strides being able to reduce numbers by more than 3 percent .
unicef warned that child poverty will have lasting effects on the countries ‘ economic competitiveness and social cohesion . " children who grow up in poverty are at a marked and measurable disadvantage in their future lives , " adamson said .
" there is a strong statistical correlation between poverty in childhood and a variety of very well documented problems in later life .
the likelihood of poor health , of educational underachievement , of dropping out of school early and of long-term welfare dependence . " calls for german government to act the authors of the study urge national governments to make a stronger commitment to fighting child poverty .
germany , where about 10 percent of children are categorized as poor , has also seen a strong 2.7 percent rise in the past decade . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children of single mothers are especially affected here poverty is rampant among single mothers and immigrant families especially from the former soviet union .
altogether , about 1.5 million children in germany grow up in relative poverty . reinhard schlagintweit of unicef germany demanded swift action from the government of chancellor gerhard schröder , which was expected to discuss the report during a cabinet meeting on wednesday . " first there must be better opportunities for women with children to return to their jobs , " he said .
" secondly we must improve our education system at the lowest levels , including greater efforts to integrate non-german-speaking children .
the british example shows that when you target your subsidies on poor children you can improve child poverty . " renate schmidt , germany 's family minister , said on tuesday she planned on widening the group of people who receive extra money from the state for their children . " i 'll make suggestions within the year , " she said . uwe hessler -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de making germany child-friendlier the cabinet has approved a plan to make germany one of europe 's most child-friendly countries by 2010 .

when bauhaus founder walter gropius fitted out the mess hall of the famous architecture college in dessau with the elegant , curved stool back in the 1920s , he launched the career of a design classic . decades later , the humble seat is at the heart of an acrimonious legal tussle . tecta vs. knoll tecta , a company based in the german state of lower saxony , is no longer allowed to sell the tubular steel stool it began marketing in 1982 .
moreover , the court ordered the company hand over all its profits from sales of the chair - as well as its matching table , the ' c4 ' - to rival business knoll international , which has an older claim to the design rights . knoll international sells a stool known as the ' laccio , ' which closely resembles breuer 's 1925 b9 model .
its sole difference is that while the b9 is sheer white , ' laccio ' is raven black . furniture feuds the dispute over the highly lucrative licence for the b9 has been dragging on for years . tecta argues it owns the rights because it signed a contract with the berlin bauhaus archive based on an agreement with breuer 's widow constanze .
in court , however , knoll was able to go one further , producing contracts personally signed by breuer in the 1960s .
the company came into possession of the documents when almost 50 years ago it acquired gavina , an italian company which had bought the rights to the b9 from the designer himself . bildunterschrift : dino gavina has revealed that the contract was considered valid for only ten years at the time of signing , which has prompted tecta to announce it will file an appeal . not the first time if so , it wo n't be the first time .
three years ago , the company won a legal battle with another company , l & c stendal , which manufactured copies of the breuer stool .
in court , l & c stendal argued that a stool is a household object rather than a work of art and therefore not subject to licencing laws .
in its final ruling , the court deemed the stool was indeed a work of art , and upheld the contract between tecta and breuer 's heirs . the battle over breuer one of the most influential designers of the 20th century , breuer both studied and taught at germany 's bauhaus school of architecture and design -lrb- photo -rrb- , which pioneered modern principles , technologies and the application of new materials in both the industrial and fine arts . an early fan of tubular steel , breuer designed a whole range of metal furniture including chairs , tables , stools and cupboards .

but there is growing opposition to the proposals . a controversy is gathering pace in germany over proposals put forward by the regional state government of hesse to offer tax breaks to high-paid corporate executives , primarily in the banking sector , at a time when unemployment is at postwar highs . the bundesrat , or upper house of german parliament , on thursday is to examine proposals drawn up by hesse 's conservative state premier , roland koch , to cut the tax rate for super-rich executives to 35 percent from 42 percent for a period of three years . beneficiaries of the tax breaks would be corporate executives grossing more than € 77,000 -lrb- $ 101,000 -rrb- per year or € 151,000 for married bosses .
the aim would be to attract foreign managers and top employees to hesse and its financial centre , frankfurt . bad timing the timing of koch 's initiative could not be worse .
this week , jobless data showed that the number of people out of work in the eurozone 's biggest economy stands at a postwar high of 5.216 million , or 12.6 percent of the workforce . the draft proposals have been dubbed the " ackermann law " after josef ackermann , the head of germany 's biggest bank deutsche bank and the best-paid corporate chief in the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ackermann was also one of the fat cats involved in the high profile mannesmann trial in 2004 along with former mannesmann chairman klaus esser , mannesmann 's former supervisory board chief joachim funk , the former head of the powerful ig metall trade union , klaus zwickel , and two others . they were accused of approving 111.5 million deutsche marks -lrb- $ 71 million -rrb- in bonuses to management board members during the multi-billion-euro takeover of mannesmann by british mobile phone giant vodafone in 2000 .
esser alone pocketed more than € 15 million . all of those involved were cleared of any wrongdoing but the case raised serious questions about the virtual untouchable status of germany 's top executives and the rules governing their money . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no tax breaks for the super rich says hans eichel .
the tax break proposals have run into widespread resistance .
german finance minister hans eichel said : " there will be no tax breaks for the super rich with this government . "
even the liberal fdp party was critical .
" new tax exemptions will neither attract top managers nor create new jobs , " said the fdp 's finance expert carl-ludwig thiele . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de flat tax revolution puts europe on edge in bratislava last week , george w. bush praised slovakia 's new flat tax .

in tv ads , most people are young and beautiful .
but this is changing in germany and elsewhere in europe as businesses discover that seniors have lots of money they 'd prefer to spend on products created for their needs . in the reality portrayed by tv advertisers , a 30-year-old man can afford to buy the latest mercedes-benz , only young people drink € 15 -lrb- $ 20 -rrb- bottles of champagne and even anti-wrinkle cream is applied by beautiful women who do n't look a day over 30 .
thus , when older people go shopping they often feel they 've been overlooked . eve fear , 65 , does n't feel tempted to buy anything when she goes to fashionable stores at home in birmingham in britain , she says .
young women look down at her from the large posters as if to say : " this is not for you , you 're too old for that . " " certainly we are not catered for within the fashion world and lots of older people do have a lot of money to spend , " eve fear said .
" there 's certainly still poverty amongst older people in britain but they like their holidays .
that kind of thing can all affect the economy . " for too long , business has only cared about the 14- 49 year olds , eve fear says .
but the politicians , businesspeople and seniors who met recently for an international conference in bonn to discuss seniors ' needs for new products determined that the future may just be in consumers beyond 50 , an ever larger part of society in industrialized countries . taking advantage of demographic change " in the year 2040 a third of the german citizens will be older than 60 , " birgit fischer , minister for family and seniors in the german state of north rhine-westphalia pointed out .

additionally , health-care costs increase as society ages .
but by focusing only on problems , society risks missing the opportunities that " demographic change " offers . take spending power , for instance .
the spending capacity of germany 's seniors alone is € 90 billion - the gross domestic product of venezuela .
and people over 50 own half of germany 's wealth , according to a study by allensbach demographic institute .
of course , some do only live off € 400 a month , a minimum to exist .
but generally older people live much more comfortably than , say , many single mothers .
on average , a pensioner in a two-person household has € 1,600 to spend each month , about € 100 more than a member of a family with children under 17 .
a young , single mother with one child lives off only € 800 monthly on average . and older people have the time to spend their money , too . time and money on their hands " the impression is that older people are not interesting for the market because they often think they are old so they do n't spend a lot of money , they do n't have a lot of activities , " says the senior citizen 's representative in the dutch city of maastricht , salden stella .
but stella says the opposite is true .

but there is growing opposition to the proposals . a controversy is gathering pace in germany over proposals put forward by the regional state government of hesse to offer tax breaks to high-paid corporate executives , primarily in the banking sector , at a time when unemployment is at postwar highs . the bundesrat , or upper house of german parliament , on thursday is to examine proposals drawn up by hesse 's conservative state premier , roland koch , to cut the tax rate for super-rich executives to 35 percent from 42 percent for a period of three years . beneficiaries of the tax breaks would be corporate executives grossing more than € 77,000 -lrb- $ 101,000 -rrb- per year or € 151,000 for married bosses .
the aim would be to attract foreign managers and top employees to hesse and its financial centre , frankfurt . bad timing the timing of koch 's initiative could not be worse .
this week , jobless data showed that the number of people out of work in the eurozone 's biggest economy stands at a postwar high of 5.216 million , or 12.6 percent of the workforce . the draft proposals have been dubbed the " ackermann law " after josef ackermann , the head of germany 's biggest bank deutsche bank and the best-paid corporate chief in the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ackermann was also one of the fat cats involved in the high profile mannesmann trial in 2004 along with former mannesmann chairman klaus esser , mannesmann 's former supervisory board chief joachim funk , the former head of the powerful ig metall trade union , klaus zwickel , and two others . they were accused of approving 111.5 million deutsche marks -lrb- $ 71 million -rrb- in bonuses to management board members during the multi-billion-euro takeover of mannesmann by british mobile phone giant vodafone in 2000 .
esser alone pocketed more than € 15 million . all of those involved were cleared of any wrongdoing but the case raised serious questions about the virtual untouchable status of germany 's top executives and the rules governing their money . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no tax breaks for the super rich says hans eichel .
the tax break proposals have run into widespread resistance .
german finance minister hans eichel said : " there will be no tax breaks for the super rich with this government . "
even the liberal fdp party was critical .
" new tax exemptions will neither attract top managers nor create new jobs , " said the fdp 's finance expert carl-ludwig thiele . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de flat tax revolution puts europe on edge in bratislava last week , george w. bush praised slovakia 's new flat tax .

in tv ads , most people are young and beautiful .
but this is changing in germany and elsewhere in europe as businesses discover that seniors have lots of money they 'd prefer to spend on products created for their needs . in the reality portrayed by tv advertisers , a 30-year-old man can afford to buy the latest mercedes-benz , only young people drink € 15 -lrb- $ 20 -rrb- bottles of champagne and even anti-wrinkle cream is applied by beautiful women who do n't look a day over 30 .
thus , when older people go shopping they often feel they 've been overlooked . eve fear , 65 , does n't feel tempted to buy anything when she goes to fashionable stores at home in birmingham in britain , she says .
young women look down at her from the large posters as if to say : " this is not for you , you 're too old for that . " " certainly we are not catered for within the fashion world and lots of older people do have a lot of money to spend , " eve fear said .
" there 's certainly still poverty amongst older people in britain but they like their holidays .
that kind of thing can all affect the economy . " for too long , business has only cared about the 14- 49 year olds , eve fear says .
but the politicians , businesspeople and seniors who met recently for an international conference in bonn to discuss seniors ' needs for new products determined that the future may just be in consumers beyond 50 , an ever larger part of society in industrialized countries . taking advantage of demographic change " in the year 2040 a third of the german citizens will be older than 60 , " birgit fischer , minister for family and seniors in the german state of north rhine-westphalia pointed out .
" there are already cities and communities where we have more 70- than seven-year olds .
because of that we need another perspective on the older generation .
economic growth and opportunities for society depend on that . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 've got the money still , political and economic views of seniors are often one-sided in germany , where older people are largely seen as an expense .
it 's true that the growing number of old people will have to rely on a decreasing number of younger people to finance old-age pensions .
additionally , health-care costs increase as society ages .
but by focusing only on problems , society risks missing the opportunities that " demographic change " offers . take spending power , for instance .
the spending capacity of germany 's seniors alone is € 90 billion - the gross domestic product of venezuela .
and people over 50 own half of germany 's wealth , according to a study by allensbach demographic institute .
of course , some do only live off € 400 a month , a minimum to exist .
but generally older people live much more comfortably than , say , many single mothers .
on average , a pensioner in a two-person household has € 1,600 to spend each month , about € 100 more than a member of a family with children under 17 .
a young , single mother with one child lives off only € 800 monthly on average . and older people have the time to spend their money , too . time and money on their hands " the impression is that older people are not interesting for the market because they often think they are old so they do n't spend a lot of money , they do n't have a lot of activities , " says the senior citizen 's representative in the dutch city of maastricht , salden stella .
but stella says the opposite is true .
" we see now that older people are very active . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who says seniors are n't active ?
as european business discovers seniors as a target group , they 're changing their tactics .
even the youth-obsessed advertising industry has begun trying to attract the older customers ; the " best agers " and " 50plus " are the heroes of the " silver economy . "
big companies have started employing so-called senior scouts , older people who test particular products in supermarkets for seniors .
can a coffee package be opened easily without agile young fingers ?
are the keys of a mobile phone big enough to call the doctor in an emergency ? " the sale of cars could be increased by 5 to 8 percent if the industry would offer cars that are senior-compatible , if they would care for the aged as a consumer group , " says klaus gretschmann of the council of the european union . " these are restraints that we have to remove and if we erase them the whole seniors sector will contribute to european economic growth . " manfred götzke -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's graying gangsters criminality among german senior citizens is on the rise .
many offenses are petty , such as shoplifting and traffic violations , but some are more serious .
one state plans to open a prison designed for older offenders .

but there is growing opposition to the proposals . a controversy is gathering pace in germany over proposals put forward by the regional state government of hesse to offer tax breaks to high-paid corporate executives , primarily in the banking sector , at a time when unemployment is at postwar highs . the bundesrat , or upper house of german parliament , on thursday is to examine proposals drawn up by hesse 's conservative state premier , roland koch , to cut the tax rate for super-rich executives to 35 percent from 42 percent for a period of three years . beneficiaries of the tax breaks would be corporate executives grossing more than € 77,000 -lrb- $ 101,000 -rrb- per year or € 151,000 for married bosses .
the aim would be to attract foreign managers and top employees to hesse and its financial centre , frankfurt . bad timing the timing of koch 's initiative could not be worse .
this week , jobless data showed that the number of people out of work in the eurozone 's biggest economy stands at a postwar high of 5.216 million , or 12.6 percent of the workforce . the draft proposals have been dubbed the " ackermann law " after josef ackermann , the head of germany 's biggest bank deutsche bank and the best-paid corporate chief in the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ackermann was also one of the fat cats involved in the high profile mannesmann trial in 2004 along with former mannesmann chairman klaus esser , mannesmann 's former supervisory board chief joachim funk , the former head of the powerful ig metall trade union , klaus zwickel , and two others . they were accused of approving 111.5 million deutsche marks -lrb- $ 71 million -rrb- in bonuses to management board members during the multi-billion-euro takeover of mannesmann by british mobile phone giant vodafone in 2000 .

that 's why their handlers are pampering them . many people have called in sick in recent weeks because of the flu that 's swept across the country .
at berlin 's zoo , officials are making sure that their animals do n't fall prey to viruses by boosting their immune systems . " we have to watch carefully that no animal gets sick or suffers from frost bites , " rudofl reinhard , a berlin zoologist , told dpa news service . while monkeys get fed a lot of fruit at the moment , " we 've ordered bags and bags of vitamin c for rhinos , " reinhard said . but zoo officials are n't just thinking of protective measures that work from the inside .
they cover paths with sand so that antelopes do n't break their ankles and regularly check rhino ears and elephant tails , which easily get frostbite . another trick to keep animals happy during those dark winter days is one that the majority of germans use too : sunbeds .
the zoo folks have n't resorted to it yet , but they say if it gets too dark , the rhinos at least will benefit from a little uv therapy . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de when business gets the flu anti-virus programs , security updates , firewalls – companies invest millions to protect computers from damaging viruses while little is done to prevent influenza , an equally costly bug in terms of lost productivity .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : graying germany germany 's graying gangsters german models come of age growing old gracefully in germany german seniors say no to nursing homes business -pipe- 02.03.2005 discovering the silver economy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : have advertisers got their focus all wrong ?
in tv ads , most people are young and beautiful .
but this is changing in germany and elsewhere in europe as businesses discover that seniors have lots of money they 'd prefer to spend on products created for their needs . in the reality portrayed by tv advertisers , a 30-year-old man can afford to buy the latest mercedes-benz , only young people drink € 15 -lrb- $ 20 -rrb- bottles of champagne and even anti-wrinkle cream is applied by beautiful women who do n't look a day over 30 .
thus , when older people go shopping they often feel they 've been overlooked . eve fear , 65 , does n't feel tempted to buy anything when she goes to fashionable stores at home in birmingham in britain , she says .
young women look down at her from the large posters as if to say : " this is not for you , you 're too old for that . " " certainly we are not catered for within the fashion world and lots of older people do have a lot of money to spend , " eve fear said .
" there 's certainly still poverty amongst older people in britain but they like their holidays .
that kind of thing can all affect the economy . " for too long , business has only cared about the 14- 49 year olds , eve fear says .
but the politicians , businesspeople and seniors who met recently for an international conference in bonn to discuss seniors ' needs for new products determined that the future may just be in consumers beyond 50 , an ever larger part of society in industrialized countries . taking advantage of demographic change " in the year 2040 a third of the german citizens will be older than 60 , " birgit fischer , minister for family and seniors in the german state of north rhine-westphalia pointed out .
" there are already cities and communities where we have more 70- than seven-year olds .
because of that we need another perspective on the older generation .
economic growth and opportunities for society depend on that . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 've got the money still , political and economic views of seniors are often one-sided in germany , where older people are largely seen as an expense .
it 's true that the growing number of old people will have to rely on a decreasing number of younger people to finance old-age pensions .
additionally , health-care costs increase as society ages .
but by focusing only on problems , society risks missing the opportunities that " demographic change " offers . take spending power , for instance .
the spending capacity of germany 's seniors alone is € 90 billion - the gross domestic product of venezuela .
and people over 50 own half of germany 's wealth , according to a study by allensbach demographic institute .
of course , some do only live off € 400 a month , a minimum to exist .
but generally older people live much more comfortably than , say , many single mothers .
on average , a pensioner in a two-person household has € 1,600 to spend each month , about € 100 more than a member of a family with children under 17 .
a young , single mother with one child lives off only € 800 monthly on average . and older people have the time to spend their money , too . time and money on their hands " the impression is that older people are not interesting for the market because they often think they are old so they do n't spend a lot of money , they do n't have a lot of activities , " says the senior citizen 's representative in the dutch city of maastricht , salden stella .
but stella says the opposite is true .
" we see now that older people are very active . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who says seniors are n't active ?
as european business discovers seniors as a target group , they 're changing their tactics .
even the youth-obsessed advertising industry has begun trying to attract the older customers ; the " best agers " and " 50plus " are the heroes of the " silver economy . "
big companies have started employing so-called senior scouts , older people who test particular products in supermarkets for seniors .
can a coffee package be opened easily without agile young fingers ?
are the keys of a mobile phone big enough to call the doctor in an emergency ? " the sale of cars could be increased by 5 to 8 percent if the industry would offer cars that are senior-compatible , if they would care for the aged as a consumer group , " says klaus gretschmann of the council of the european union . " these are restraints that we have to remove and if we erase them the whole seniors sector will contribute to european economic growth .

but there is growing opposition to the proposals . a controversy is gathering pace in germany over proposals put forward by the regional state government of hesse to offer tax breaks to high-paid corporate executives , primarily in the banking sector , at a time when unemployment is at postwar highs . the bundesrat , or upper house of german parliament , on thursday is to examine proposals drawn up by hesse 's conservative state premier , roland koch , to cut the tax rate for super-rich executives to 35 percent from 42 percent for a period of three years . beneficiaries of the tax breaks would be corporate executives grossing more than € 77,000 -lrb- $ 101,000 -rrb- per year or € 151,000 for married bosses .
the aim would be to attract foreign managers and top employees to hesse and its financial centre , frankfurt . bad timing the timing of koch 's initiative could not be worse .
this week , jobless data showed that the number of people out of work in the eurozone 's biggest economy stands at a postwar high of 5.216 million , or 12.6 percent of the workforce . the draft proposals have been dubbed the " ackermann law " after josef ackermann , the head of germany 's biggest bank deutsche bank and the best-paid corporate chief in the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ackermann was also one of the fat cats involved in the high profile mannesmann trial in 2004 along with former mannesmann chairman klaus esser , mannesmann 's former supervisory board chief joachim funk , the former head of the powerful ig metall trade union , klaus zwickel , and two others . they were accused of approving 111.5 million deutsche marks -lrb- $ 71 million -rrb- in bonuses to management board members during the multi-billion-euro takeover of mannesmann by british mobile phone giant vodafone in 2000 .
esser alone pocketed more than € 15 million . all of those involved were cleared of any wrongdoing but the case raised serious questions about the virtual untouchable status of germany 's top executives and the rules governing their money . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no tax breaks for the super rich says hans eichel .
the tax break proposals have run into widespread resistance .
german finance minister hans eichel said : " there will be no tax breaks for the super rich with this government . "

in tv ads , most people are young and beautiful .
but this is changing in germany and elsewhere in europe as businesses discover that seniors have lots of money they 'd prefer to spend on products created for their needs . in the reality portrayed by tv advertisers , a 30-year-old man can afford to buy the latest mercedes-benz , only young people drink € 15 -lrb- $ 20 -rrb- bottles of champagne and even anti-wrinkle cream is applied by beautiful women who do n't look a day over 30 .
thus , when older people go shopping they often feel they 've been overlooked . eve fear , 65 , does n't feel tempted to buy anything when she goes to fashionable stores at home in birmingham in britain , she says .
young women look down at her from the large posters as if to say : " this is not for you , you 're too old for that . " " certainly we are not catered for within the fashion world and lots of older people do have a lot of money to spend , " eve fear said .
" there 's certainly still poverty amongst older people in britain but they like their holidays .
that kind of thing can all affect the economy . " for too long , business has only cared about the 14- 49 year olds , eve fear says .
but the politicians , businesspeople and seniors who met recently for an international conference in bonn to discuss seniors ' needs for new products determined that the future may just be in consumers beyond 50 , an ever larger part of society in industrialized countries . taking advantage of demographic change " in the year 2040 a third of the german citizens will be older than 60 , " birgit fischer , minister for family and seniors in the german state of north rhine-westphalia pointed out .
" there are already cities and communities where we have more 70- than seven-year olds .
because of that we need another perspective on the older generation .
economic growth and opportunities for society depend on that . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 've got the money still , political and economic views of seniors are often one-sided in germany , where older people are largely seen as an expense .
it 's true that the growing number of old people will have to rely on a decreasing number of younger people to finance old-age pensions .
additionally , health-care costs increase as society ages .
but by focusing only on problems , society risks missing the opportunities that " demographic change " offers . take spending power , for instance .
the spending capacity of germany 's seniors alone is € 90 billion - the gross domestic product of venezuela .
and people over 50 own half of germany 's wealth , according to a study by allensbach demographic institute .
of course , some do only live off € 400 a month , a minimum to exist .
but generally older people live much more comfortably than , say , many single mothers .
on average , a pensioner in a two-person household has € 1,600 to spend each month , about € 100 more than a member of a family with children under 17 .
a young , single mother with one child lives off only € 800 monthly on average . and older people have the time to spend their money , too . time and money on their hands " the impression is that older people are not interesting for the market because they often think they are old so they do n't spend a lot of money , they do n't have a lot of activities , " says the senior citizen 's representative in the dutch city of maastricht , salden stella .
but stella says the opposite is true .
" we see now that older people are very active . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who says seniors are n't active ?
as european business discovers seniors as a target group , they 're changing their tactics .
even the youth-obsessed advertising industry has begun trying to attract the older customers ; the " best agers " and " 50plus " are the heroes of the " silver economy . "
big companies have started employing so-called senior scouts , older people who test particular products in supermarkets for seniors .
can a coffee package be opened easily without agile young fingers ?
are the keys of a mobile phone big enough to call the doctor in an emergency ? " the sale of cars could be increased by 5 to 8 percent if the industry would offer cars that are senior-compatible , if they would care for the aged as a consumer group , " says klaus gretschmann of the council of the european union .

but there is growing opposition to the proposals . a controversy is gathering pace in germany over proposals put forward by the regional state government of hesse to offer tax breaks to high-paid corporate executives , primarily in the banking sector , at a time when unemployment is at postwar highs . the bundesrat , or upper house of german parliament , on thursday is to examine proposals drawn up by hesse 's conservative state premier , roland koch , to cut the tax rate for super-rich executives to 35 percent from 42 percent for a period of three years . beneficiaries of the tax breaks would be corporate executives grossing more than € 77,000 -lrb- $ 101,000 -rrb- per year or € 151,000 for married bosses .
the aim would be to attract foreign managers and top employees to hesse and its financial centre , frankfurt . bad timing the timing of koch 's initiative could not be worse .
this week , jobless data showed that the number of people out of work in the eurozone 's biggest economy stands at a postwar high of 5.216 million , or 12.6 percent of the workforce . the draft proposals have been dubbed the " ackermann law " after josef ackermann , the head of germany 's biggest bank deutsche bank and the best-paid corporate chief in the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ackermann was also one of the fat cats involved in the high profile mannesmann trial in 2004 along with former mannesmann chairman klaus esser , mannesmann 's former supervisory board chief joachim funk , the former head of the powerful ig metall trade union , klaus zwickel , and two others . they were accused of approving 111.5 million deutsche marks -lrb- $ 71 million -rrb- in bonuses to management board members during the multi-billion-euro takeover of mannesmann by british mobile phone giant vodafone in 2000 .

that 's why their handlers are pampering them . many people have called in sick in recent weeks because of the flu that 's swept across the country .
at berlin 's zoo , officials are making sure that their animals do n't fall prey to viruses by boosting their immune systems . " we have to watch carefully that no animal gets sick or suffers from frost bites , " rudofl reinhard , a berlin zoologist , told dpa news service . while monkeys get fed a lot of fruit at the moment , " we 've ordered bags and bags of vitamin c for rhinos , " reinhard said . but zoo officials are n't just thinking of protective measures that work from the inside .
they cover paths with sand so that antelopes do n't break their ankles and regularly check rhino ears and elephant tails , which easily get frostbite . another trick to keep animals happy during those dark winter days is one that the majority of germans use too : sunbeds .
the zoo folks have n't resorted to it yet , but they say if it gets too dark , the rhinos at least will benefit from a little uv therapy . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de when business gets the flu anti-virus programs , security updates , firewalls – companies invest millions to protect computers from damaging viruses while little is done to prevent influenza , an equally costly bug in terms of lost productivity .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 02.03.2005 child poverty rises in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one in 10 children in germany lives in relative poverty the number of children in german living in poverty is rising faster than in most other industrialized nations , according to a new report .
children of single parents and immigrant families are especially threatened . the report , released by the united nations children 's fund -lrb- unicef -rrb- on tuesday , found that in three quarters of the richest countries in the world child poverty has risen sometimes dramatically over the last 10 years .
it also said child poverty was on the increase because efforts of governments in the 26 most industrialized countries has waned in the past decades . the marked increase in child poverty in rich countries comes as a surprise and shatters popular perceptions that recent increases in wealth in the first world would be evenly spread among all people in society , according to the report 's authors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unicef logo peter adamson from unicef said that western governments appear to have dropped former ideals of creating equal living standards and argues that birth circumstances should not determine the life-time opportunities of children today . " there is a legitimate concern that progress towards that ideal has slowed , that some kind of barrier has been lowered , " he said .
" that barrier may well be the level and persistence of poverty and disadvantage in childhood . " nordic countries fare best according to the study compiled by unicef ’ s institute in florence , italy , the northern european states of denmark and finland have the lowest levels of child poverty with 2.4 percent and 2.8 percent respectively .
the poverty line has been fixed at about € 8,000 -lrb- $ 10,500 -rrb- family income a year or less than half of the average income of a normal national houshold . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : begging for money on a mexican street the united states and mexico are at the bottom of the list of 25 industrialized countries with poverty levels of 21 and 27 percent .
unicef , however , is most alarmed by the rapid rise in child poverty in many wealthy nations .
only one third of countries have made progress in the last year with britain making the biggest strides being able to reduce numbers by more than 3 percent .
unicef warned that child poverty will have lasting effects on the countries ‘ economic competitiveness and social cohesion . " children who grow up in poverty are at a marked and measurable disadvantage in their future lives , " adamson said .
" there is a strong statistical correlation between poverty in childhood and a variety of very well documented problems in later life .
the likelihood of poor health , of educational underachievement , of dropping out of school early and of long-term welfare dependence . " calls for german government to act the authors of the study urge national governments to make a stronger commitment to fighting child poverty .
germany , where about 10 percent of children are categorized as poor , has also seen a strong 2.7 percent rise in the past decade . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children of single mothers are especially affected here poverty is rampant among single mothers and immigrant families especially from the former soviet union .
altogether , about 1.5 million children in germany grow up in relative poverty . reinhard schlagintweit of unicef germany demanded swift action from the government of chancellor gerhard schröder , which was expected to discuss the report during a cabinet meeting on wednesday . " first there must be better opportunities for women with children to return to their jobs , " he said .
" secondly we must improve our education system at the lowest levels , including greater efforts to integrate non-german-speaking children .
the british example shows that when you target your subsidies on poor children you can improve child poverty . " renate schmidt , germany 's family minister , said on tuesday she planned on widening the group of people who receive extra money from the state for their children .

in tv ads , most people are young and beautiful .
but this is changing in germany and elsewhere in europe as businesses discover that seniors have lots of money they 'd prefer to spend on products created for their needs . in the reality portrayed by tv advertisers , a 30-year-old man can afford to buy the latest mercedes-benz , only young people drink € 15 -lrb- $ 20 -rrb- bottles of champagne and even anti-wrinkle cream is applied by beautiful women who do n't look a day over 30 .
thus , when older people go shopping they often feel they 've been overlooked . eve fear , 65 , does n't feel tempted to buy anything when she goes to fashionable stores at home in birmingham in britain , she says .
young women look down at her from the large posters as if to say : " this is not for you , you 're too old for that . " " certainly we are not catered for within the fashion world and lots of older people do have a lot of money to spend , " eve fear said .
" there 's certainly still poverty amongst older people in britain but they like their holidays .
that kind of thing can all affect the economy . " for too long , business has only cared about the 14- 49 year olds , eve fear says .

but generally older people live much more comfortably than , say , many single mothers .
on average , a pensioner in a two-person household has € 1,600 to spend each month , about € 100 more than a member of a family with children under 17 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 02.03.2005 design classic lands on scrap heap großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the seat of the problem in a controversial ruling wednesday , a court in düsseldorf barred a company from selling the ' b9 ' chair originally designed by bauhaus architect marcel breuer and ordered it destroy all existing stocks . canteen chairs do n't often get noticed , but the ' b9 ' is a notable exception .
when bauhaus founder walter gropius fitted out the mess hall of the famous architecture college in dessau with the elegant , curved stool back in the 1920s , he launched the career of a design classic . decades later , the humble seat is at the heart of an acrimonious legal tussle . tecta vs. knoll tecta , a company based in the german state of lower saxony , is no longer allowed to sell the tubular steel stool it began marketing in 1982 .
moreover , the court ordered the company hand over all its profits from sales of the chair - as well as its matching table , the ' c4 ' - to rival business knoll international , which has an older claim to the design rights . knoll international sells a stool known as the ' laccio , ' which closely resembles breuer 's 1925 b9 model .
its sole difference is that while the b9 is sheer white , ' laccio ' is raven black . furniture feuds the dispute over the highly lucrative licence for the b9 has been dragging on for years . tecta argues it owns the rights because it signed a contract with the berlin bauhaus archive based on an agreement with breuer 's widow constanze .
in court , however , knoll was able to go one further , producing contracts personally signed by breuer in the 1960s .
the company came into possession of the documents when almost 50 years ago it acquired gavina , an italian company which had bought the rights to the b9 from the designer himself . bildunterschrift : dino gavina has revealed that the contract was considered valid for only ten years at the time of signing , which has prompted tecta to announce it will file an appeal . not the first time if so , it wo n't be the first time .

but there is growing opposition to the proposals . a controversy is gathering pace in germany over proposals put forward by the regional state government of hesse to offer tax breaks to high-paid corporate executives , primarily in the banking sector , at a time when unemployment is at postwar highs . the bundesrat , or upper house of german parliament , on thursday is to examine proposals drawn up by hesse 's conservative state premier , roland koch , to cut the tax rate for super-rich executives to 35 percent from 42 percent for a period of three years . beneficiaries of the tax breaks would be corporate executives grossing more than € 77,000 -lrb- $ 101,000 -rrb- per year or € 151,000 for married bosses .
the aim would be to attract foreign managers and top employees to hesse and its financial centre , frankfurt . bad timing the timing of koch 's initiative could not be worse .
this week , jobless data showed that the number of people out of work in the eurozone 's biggest economy stands at a postwar high of 5.216 million , or 12.6 percent of the workforce . the draft proposals have been dubbed the " ackermann law " after josef ackermann , the head of germany 's biggest bank deutsche bank and the best-paid corporate chief in the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ackermann was also one of the fat cats involved in the high profile mannesmann trial in 2004 along with former mannesmann chairman klaus esser , mannesmann 's former supervisory board chief joachim funk , the former head of the powerful ig metall trade union , klaus zwickel , and two others . they were accused of approving 111.5 million deutsche marks -lrb- $ 71 million -rrb- in bonuses to management board members during the multi-billion-euro takeover of mannesmann by british mobile phone giant vodafone in 2000 .
esser alone pocketed more than € 15 million . all of those involved were cleared of any wrongdoing but the case raised serious questions about the virtual untouchable status of germany 's top executives and the rules governing their money . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no tax breaks for the super rich says hans eichel .
the tax break proposals have run into widespread resistance .
german finance minister hans eichel said : " there will be no tax breaks for the super rich with this government . "
even the liberal fdp party was critical .

children of single parents and immigrant families are especially threatened . the report , released by the united nations children 's fund -lrb- unicef -rrb- on tuesday , found that in three quarters of the richest countries in the world child poverty has risen sometimes dramatically over the last 10 years .
it also said child poverty was on the increase because efforts of governments in the 26 most industrialized countries has waned in the past decades . the marked increase in child poverty in rich countries comes as a surprise and shatters popular perceptions that recent increases in wealth in the first world would be evenly spread among all people in society , according to the report 's authors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unicef logo peter adamson from unicef said that western governments appear to have dropped former ideals of creating equal living standards and argues that birth circumstances should not determine the life-time opportunities of children today . " there is a legitimate concern that progress towards that ideal has slowed , that some kind of barrier has been lowered , " he said .
" that barrier may well be the level and persistence of poverty and disadvantage in childhood . " nordic countries fare best according to the study compiled by unicef ’ s institute in florence , italy , the northern european states of denmark and finland have the lowest levels of child poverty with 2.4 percent and 2.8 percent respectively .
the poverty line has been fixed at about € 8,000 -lrb- $ 10,500 -rrb- family income a year or less than half of the average income of a normal national houshold . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : begging for money on a mexican street the united states and mexico are at the bottom of the list of 25 industrialized countries with poverty levels of 21 and 27 percent .
unicef , however , is most alarmed by the rapid rise in child poverty in many wealthy nations .
only one third of countries have made progress in the last year with britain making the biggest strides being able to reduce numbers by more than 3 percent .
unicef warned that child poverty will have lasting effects on the countries ‘ economic competitiveness and social cohesion . " children who grow up in poverty are at a marked and measurable disadvantage in their future lives , " adamson said .
" there is a strong statistical correlation between poverty in childhood and a variety of very well documented problems in later life .
the likelihood of poor health , of educational underachievement , of dropping out of school early and of long-term welfare dependence . " calls for german government to act the authors of the study urge national governments to make a stronger commitment to fighting child poverty .
germany , where about 10 percent of children are categorized as poor , has also seen a strong 2.7 percent rise in the past decade . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children of single mothers are especially affected here poverty is rampant among single mothers and immigrant families especially from the former soviet union .
altogether , about 1.5 million children in germany grow up in relative poverty . reinhard schlagintweit of unicef germany demanded swift action from the government of chancellor gerhard schröder , which was expected to discuss the report during a cabinet meeting on wednesday . " first there must be better opportunities for women with children to return to their jobs , " he said .
" secondly we must improve our education system at the lowest levels , including greater efforts to integrate non-german-speaking children .
the british example shows that when you target your subsidies on poor children you can improve child poverty . " renate schmidt , germany 's family minister , said on tuesday she planned on widening the group of people who receive extra money from the state for their children . " i 'll make suggestions within the year , " she said . uwe hessler -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de making germany child-friendlier the cabinet has approved a plan to make germany one of europe 's most child-friendly countries by 2010 .

in court , however , knoll was able to go one further , producing contracts personally signed by breuer in the 1960s .

but there is growing opposition to the proposals . a controversy is gathering pace in germany over proposals put forward by the regional state government of hesse to offer tax breaks to high-paid corporate executives , primarily in the banking sector , at a time when unemployment is at postwar highs . the bundesrat , or upper house of german parliament , on thursday is to examine proposals drawn up by hesse 's conservative state premier , roland koch , to cut the tax rate for super-rich executives to 35 percent from 42 percent for a period of three years . beneficiaries of the tax breaks would be corporate executives grossing more than € 77,000 -lrb- $ 101,000 -rrb- per year or € 151,000 for married bosses .
the aim would be to attract foreign managers and top employees to hesse and its financial centre , frankfurt . bad timing the timing of koch 's initiative could not be worse .
this week , jobless data showed that the number of people out of work in the eurozone 's biggest economy stands at a postwar high of 5.216 million , or 12.6 percent of the workforce . the draft proposals have been dubbed the " ackermann law " after josef ackermann , the head of germany 's biggest bank deutsche bank and the best-paid corporate chief in the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ackermann was also one of the fat cats involved in the high profile mannesmann trial in 2004 along with former mannesmann chairman klaus esser , mannesmann 's former supervisory board chief joachim funk , the former head of the powerful ig metall trade union , klaus zwickel , and two others . they were accused of approving 111.5 million deutsche marks -lrb- $ 71 million -rrb- in bonuses to management board members during the multi-billion-euro takeover of mannesmann by british mobile phone giant vodafone in 2000 .

when bauhaus founder walter gropius fitted out the mess hall of the famous architecture college in dessau with the elegant , curved stool back in the 1920s , he launched the career of a design classic . decades later , the humble seat is at the heart of an acrimonious legal tussle . tecta vs. knoll tecta , a company based in the german state of lower saxony , is no longer allowed to sell the tubular steel stool it began marketing in 1982 .
moreover , the court ordered the company hand over all its profits from sales of the chair - as well as its matching table , the ' c4 ' - to rival business knoll international , which has an older claim to the design rights . knoll international sells a stool known as the ' laccio , ' which closely resembles breuer 's 1925 b9 model .
its sole difference is that while the b9 is sheer white , ' laccio ' is raven black . furniture feuds the dispute over the highly lucrative licence for the b9 has been dragging on for years . tecta argues it owns the rights because it signed a contract with the berlin bauhaus archive based on an agreement with breuer 's widow constanze .
in court , however , knoll was able to go one further , producing contracts personally signed by breuer in the 1960s .
the company came into possession of the documents when almost 50 years ago it acquired gavina , an italian company which had bought the rights to the b9 from the designer himself . bildunterschrift : dino gavina has revealed that the contract was considered valid for only ten years at the time of signing , which has prompted tecta to announce it will file an appeal . not the first time if so , it wo n't be the first time .
three years ago , the company won a legal battle with another company , l & c stendal , which manufactured copies of the breuer stool .
in court , l & c stendal argued that a stool is a household object rather than a work of art and therefore not subject to licencing laws .
in its final ruling , the court deemed the stool was indeed a work of art , and upheld the contract between tecta and breuer 's heirs . the battle over breuer one of the most influential designers of the 20th century , breuer both studied and taught at germany 's bauhaus school of architecture and design -lrb- photo -rrb- , which pioneered modern principles , technologies and the application of new materials in both the industrial and fine arts . an early fan of tubular steel , breuer designed a whole range of metal furniture including chairs , tables , stools and cupboards .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : graying germany germany 's graying gangsters german models come of age growing old gracefully in germany german seniors say no to nursing homes business -pipe- 02.03.2005 discovering the silver economy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : have advertisers got their focus all wrong ?
in tv ads , most people are young and beautiful .
but this is changing in germany and elsewhere in europe as businesses discover that seniors have lots of money they 'd prefer to spend on products created for their needs . in the reality portrayed by tv advertisers , a 30-year-old man can afford to buy the latest mercedes-benz , only young people drink € 15 -lrb- $ 20 -rrb- bottles of champagne and even anti-wrinkle cream is applied by beautiful women who do n't look a day over 30 .
thus , when older people go shopping they often feel they 've been overlooked . eve fear , 65 , does n't feel tempted to buy anything when she goes to fashionable stores at home in birmingham in britain , she says .
young women look down at her from the large posters as if to say : " this is not for you , you 're too old for that . " " certainly we are not catered for within the fashion world and lots of older people do have a lot of money to spend , " eve fear said .
" there 's certainly still poverty amongst older people in britain but they like their holidays .
that kind of thing can all affect the economy . " for too long , business has only cared about the 14- 49 year olds , eve fear says .
but the politicians , businesspeople and seniors who met recently for an international conference in bonn to discuss seniors ' needs for new products determined that the future may just be in consumers beyond 50 , an ever larger part of society in industrialized countries . taking advantage of demographic change " in the year 2040 a third of the german citizens will be older than 60 , " birgit fischer , minister for family and seniors in the german state of north rhine-westphalia pointed out .
" there are already cities and communities where we have more 70- than seven-year olds .
because of that we need another perspective on the older generation .
economic growth and opportunities for society depend on that . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 've got the money still , political and economic views of seniors are often one-sided in germany , where older people are largely seen as an expense .
it 's true that the growing number of old people will have to rely on a decreasing number of younger people to finance old-age pensions .
additionally , health-care costs increase as society ages .
but by focusing only on problems , society risks missing the opportunities that " demographic change " offers . take spending power , for instance .
the spending capacity of germany 's seniors alone is € 90 billion - the gross domestic product of venezuela .
and people over 50 own half of germany 's wealth , according to a study by allensbach demographic institute .
of course , some do only live off € 400 a month , a minimum to exist .
but generally older people live much more comfortably than , say , many single mothers .
on average , a pensioner in a two-person household has € 1,600 to spend each month , about € 100 more than a member of a family with children under 17 .
a young , single mother with one child lives off only € 800 monthly on average . and older people have the time to spend their money , too . time and money on their hands " the impression is that older people are not interesting for the market because they often think they are old so they do n't spend a lot of money , they do n't have a lot of activities , " says the senior citizen 's representative in the dutch city of maastricht , salden stella .
but stella says the opposite is true .
" we see now that older people are very active . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who says seniors are n't active ?
as european business discovers seniors as a target group , they 're changing their tactics .
even the youth-obsessed advertising industry has begun trying to attract the older customers ; the " best agers " and " 50plus " are the heroes of the " silver economy . "
big companies have started employing so-called senior scouts , older people who test particular products in supermarkets for seniors .
can a coffee package be opened easily without agile young fingers ?
are the keys of a mobile phone big enough to call the doctor in an emergency ? " the sale of cars could be increased by 5 to 8 percent if the industry would offer cars that are senior-compatible , if they would care for the aged as a consumer group , " says klaus gretschmann of the council of the european union . " these are restraints that we have to remove and if we erase them the whole seniors sector will contribute to european economic growth . " manfred götzke -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's graying gangsters criminality among german senior citizens is on the rise .
many offenses are petty , such as shoplifting and traffic violations , but some are more serious .

children of single parents and immigrant families are especially threatened . the report , released by the united nations children 's fund -lrb- unicef -rrb- on tuesday , found that in three quarters of the richest countries in the world child poverty has risen sometimes dramatically over the last 10 years .
it also said child poverty was on the increase because efforts of governments in the 26 most industrialized countries has waned in the past decades . the marked increase in child poverty in rich countries comes as a surprise and shatters popular perceptions that recent increases in wealth in the first world would be evenly spread among all people in society , according to the report 's authors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unicef logo peter adamson from unicef said that western governments appear to have dropped former ideals of creating equal living standards and argues that birth circumstances should not determine the life-time opportunities of children today . " there is a legitimate concern that progress towards that ideal has slowed , that some kind of barrier has been lowered , " he said .
" that barrier may well be the level and persistence of poverty and disadvantage in childhood . " nordic countries fare best according to the study compiled by unicef ’ s institute in florence , italy , the northern european states of denmark and finland have the lowest levels of child poverty with 2.4 percent and 2.8 percent respectively .
the poverty line has been fixed at about € 8,000 -lrb- $ 10,500 -rrb- family income a year or less than half of the average income of a normal national houshold . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : begging for money on a mexican street the united states and mexico are at the bottom of the list of 25 industrialized countries with poverty levels of 21 and 27 percent .
unicef , however , is most alarmed by the rapid rise in child poverty in many wealthy nations .
only one third of countries have made progress in the last year with britain making the biggest strides being able to reduce numbers by more than 3 percent .
unicef warned that child poverty will have lasting effects on the countries ‘ economic competitiveness and social cohesion . " children who grow up in poverty are at a marked and measurable disadvantage in their future lives , " adamson said .
" there is a strong statistical correlation between poverty in childhood and a variety of very well documented problems in later life .
the likelihood of poor health , of educational underachievement , of dropping out of school early and of long-term welfare dependence . " calls for german government to act the authors of the study urge national governments to make a stronger commitment to fighting child poverty .
germany , where about 10 percent of children are categorized as poor , has also seen a strong 2.7 percent rise in the past decade . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children of single mothers are especially affected here poverty is rampant among single mothers and immigrant families especially from the former soviet union .
altogether , about 1.5 million children in germany grow up in relative poverty . reinhard schlagintweit of unicef germany demanded swift action from the government of chancellor gerhard schröder , which was expected to discuss the report during a cabinet meeting on wednesday . " first there must be better opportunities for women with children to return to their jobs , " he said .
" secondly we must improve our education system at the lowest levels , including greater efforts to integrate non-german-speaking children .
the british example shows that when you target your subsidies on poor children you can improve child poverty . " renate schmidt , germany 's family minister , said on tuesday she planned on widening the group of people who receive extra money from the state for their children .

" is it art or nonsense ?
to contemplate the answer to this question , people from all over the world accumulate here once every five years for three months to experience the world 's most important modern art show : documenta . the city transforms itself overnight into a busy metropolis , comparable to london or new york .
artists like picasso , de maria , christo and warhol have displayed here works here . protestant roots and a divine overseer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wilhelmshöhe castle despite having a hand in the modern art scene , kassel is not a new city .
it dates back to the 16th century , when it was regarded as the center of german protestantism . the protestant church shaped the city from the beginning , from both inside and out , and strong fortifications were built in order to fend off catholic invaders . during world war two , 90 percent of the city center was destroyed by allied bombs and some 10,000 civilians lost their lives .
in the aftermath , people worked relentlessly to reconstruct their city .
the restoration was so successful that kassel was even considered as a potential new capital for west germany before losing out to bonn . many damaged buildings and castles were restored in their original style after the war and kassel 's residents are proud of their 17th and 18th century castles of wilhelmshöhe , wilhelmstal , löwenburg and karlsruhe . kassel 's most important landmark is the 9 meter -lrb- 30 foot -rrb- tall statue of hercules overlooking the city form a pedestal at the zenith of a mountain .

it was in kassel that the brothers wilhelm and jakob grimm compiled most of their world famous collection of fairy tales : snow white , little red riding hood , frau holle and many more . known the world over , these fairy tales have been translated into 140 different languages and are known across the globe .
one can admire the works of the grimm brothers in the museum at palais bellevue . another must-see museum in kassel is the hessian state museum , which contains works by rembrandt , rubens and other masters . if performing arts are more your thing , you can expect to find a diverse range of everything from classical to experimental productions in the world of opera , drama and choreographic arts .

visitors will quickly feel transported back in time , especially since cars are prohibited in the city 's walled old quarters . after stepping through the massive " holsentor " -lrb- holsten gate -rrb- , the visitor is surrounded by well-preserved gable houses built with red bricks and decorated with clinkers .
the city 's popular shopping streets are lined with town houses from the gothic , renaissance , baroque and classic periods .
the streets are still paved with cobblestones , and alleys and courtyards branch off in all directions , beckoning to be explored . streets within streets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas mann in front of the buddenbrook house in lübeck many of the neighborhoods around the old city used to be lübeck 's artisan and craftsmen quarters , where the hand workers and small tradesmen lived and worked .
a housing shortage hit the town in the middle ages , and lübeck needed a creative solution to accommodate the growing numbers of workers . the solution was to create streets within streets .
city planners used the narrow passageways between existing buildings as mini-streets , where they built one- or two-story homes .
a hundred of these hidden , back-alley streets still exist .
today they have a cozy , dollhouse kind of charm . many of germany 's historical city centers were bombed during world war two and lübeck was no exception .
the gothic st. marienkirche , germany 's third largest church , was burned down completely .
when the building went up in flames , the church bell fell on the stone floor and melted under the extreme heat . the melted bell still remains on the ground , a silent reminder of those who lost their lives during the war . literary legends bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cafe niederegger in lübeck since 1806 lübeck is intricately connected to the life of the mann family , whose most famous son , thomas mann , received the nobel prize for literature .
his novel " buddenbrooks " is set in lübeck and those who have read it will easily fall into the footsteps of the famous characters when they walk through the city . in addition to literature , the people of lübeck love to cultivate their cultural traditions .
the city beckons visitors with its twenty museums and galleries and innumerable exhibitions .
in the evenings there are poetry readings at the " buddenbrook " house .
artists like dave brubeck , juliette gréco and anne sophie mutter have all performed in lübeck ’ s modern music and congress hall .
the acoustics of the 2,000-seat concert hall are comparable to those of carnegie hall in new york . the local residents are proud of what their small city offers : " kiel may be the state capital , but we are the cultural capital , " they often boast . no trip to lübeck is complete without tasting the city 's marzipan , an almond and sugar paste that has delighted bon vivants for centuries .
there are many stories about the origin of this specialty .

the city ’ s annual music festival is named after him , as is the handel house museum , which showcases the life and work of handel and other local composers . the city ’ s new concert hall also bears the name of halle ’ s most famous son .
the george friedrich handel hall , which opened in october 1998 , is a contemporary architectural composition housing a state-of-the-art concert hall with seating for 2,000 guests and several smaller conference rooms . a piece of abbey road bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : handel hall in halle but halle ’ s music tradition goes beyond handel .
the boys ' choir , which was founded in a local monastery , dates back to 1116 and is germany ’ s oldest continually existing boys ' choir .
today the choir gives concerts of works by both classical and modern composers . and lest one think halle is only associated with classical music , the city is also the home of germany ’ s biggest beatles museum .
the collection traces the life of the beatles members all the way up to their solo careers and features music clippings , fan memorabilia and historic posters . island theaters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the famous " stadtsingechor " boy 's choir stages in halle are n't just for musicians .
for a city of its size -lrb- about 245,000 -rrb- halle packs quite a wide choice of theaters .
steintor varieté , for example , was founded in 1889 and is the oldest variety and cabaret-type theater of its kind in germany . the city ’ s cultural heart is the kulturinsel or cultural island in the center of the city .
with its concentration of performing and visual arts , this small district offers something for everyone .
the neues theater forms the anchor of the cultural complex , and its four stages showcase everything from classical productions and contemporary drama to musical reviews and dance parties . for those looking for a socially critical laugh , halle ’ s kiebitzensteiner kabarett is the place to be .

since then , it has undergone continual transformation , from being a darling of the prussian kings to facing the step-motherly treatment of the gdr before being reconstructed after the german reunification . the name of potsdam was first recorded in 993 , though it was then called " potztumpimi . "
it gained importance much later when king friedrich willhelm , also known as the " the great elector , " declared potsdam as his second residence next to berlin in the year 1660 . he commissioned the construction of the sanssouci castle , built in dutch style and surrounding by a park .
in the following decades , successive prussian emperors added castles and parks and , in 1990 , the whole area was added to the unesco world heritage list . melting pot at the heart of europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new hans otto theater opened in 2006 during the 18th century , potsdam life centered around splendor and belle esprit .
famous visitors from all over europe gathered here .
some of them , like french huguenots or jews , came as religious refugees .
at one point , one third of the inhabitants were french .
others , like the dutch , flemish and swiss were called in especially for their craftsmanship . for the dutch immigrants , a settlement of 134 red brick houses was built .
the mostly three-storey houses have roofs in typical dutch style .
this district , known as the " holländisches viertel , " is a popular tourist destination . in the 19th century , members of a russian military choir came to potsdam to entertain the troops stationed there and in 1826 frederick william ii ordered the construction of a new neighborhood for these soldiers .
this " russian town " was named alexandrowka after the tsarina .
in total 12 picturesque wooden houses were built .
a small russian-orthodox chapel , the alexander-newski kirche was added later . after the world war two , potsdam witnessed a significant change in population .

in the middle of the 19th century , it emerged as the center of the largest coal and steel area in europe .
for many decades , coal - the ruhr region 's black gold - powered the german post-war economic miracle .
but those days are long gone .
in 1986 , essen 's last mine was shut down .
as one local adverting campaign put it , " essen has wiped the coal dust from its face . "
from coal to culture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rwe is headquartered in düsseldorf today the city is an international economic hub , with nine of germany 's top one hundred companies calling essen home .
several headquarters of regional institutions are also based in the city due to its central location .
institutions such as the association of ruhr district local authorities , the state environment agency , the german meteorological service , and the ruhr diocese are all located in essen .
the city 's transformation from a mining to a service industry center can best be seen in the changes the colliery has undergone .
the zeche zollverein , shut down in 1986 , was a highly efficient production site when it first opened in 1932 .
today , the zollverein houses artists ' studios , offices , and workshops .
in 2001 unesco listed the colliery as a world cultural heritage site .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the zeche zollverein is a unesco landmark the zeche zollverein was designed by the architects schupp and kremmer and is regarded as one of the most stunning collieries in the world .
tourists now are able to take guided tours through this industrial monument , while the design center nrw exhibits award-winning design in the former boiler house .
other collieries have also experienced a revival , for example the zeche carl in altenessen , shut down in 1970 , and now one of the largest socio-cultural centers in germany .
concerts and cabaret performances , exhibitions , and panel discussions also take place in its former engine room and washhouse .
venues and arenas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the folkwang school for music , theater and dance is an architectural highlight in its day , the krupp industrial site was seven times larger than the city center .
all that 's left of the site today is the viii mechanical workshop .
in 1996 , the former gateway into the cast steel works were transformed into a musical temple .
the colosseum has a capacity of 1,550 spectators .
the grugahalle , the largest event venue in essen , can accommodate up to 10,000 people and is used as a congress forum , a party location , an arena for major sports events and performances by international stars .
the alto theater , a masterpiece by famous finnish architect alvar aalto , is another great venue for opera and ballet performances , while the old synagogue built between 1911 and 1913 was once one of the most beautiful and largest jewish synagogues in germany .
in 1938 , during the pogrom night in november , it was set ablaze by the nazis .
since 1980 the old synagogue has been used as a place of remembrance and as a historical and political documentation forum . lillian urio send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de love parade leaves berlin for ruhr region the love parade , the infamous street party for techno music fans , has found a new home in germany 's ruhr region after berlin rejected it .

in the middle of the 19th century , it emerged as the center of the largest coal and steel area in europe .
for many decades , coal - the ruhr region 's black gold - powered the german post-war economic miracle .
but those days are long gone .
in 1986 , essen 's last mine was shut down .
as one local adverting campaign put it , " essen has wiped the coal dust from its face . "
from coal to culture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rwe is headquartered in düsseldorf today the city is an international economic hub , with nine of germany 's top one hundred companies calling essen home .
several headquarters of regional institutions are also based in the city due to its central location .
institutions such as the association of ruhr district local authorities , the state environment agency , the german meteorological service , and the ruhr diocese are all located in essen .
the city 's transformation from a mining to a service industry center can best be seen in the changes the colliery has undergone .
the zeche zollverein , shut down in 1986 , was a highly efficient production site when it first opened in 1932 .
today , the zollverein houses artists ' studios , offices , and workshops .
in 2001 unesco listed the colliery as a world cultural heritage site .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the zeche zollverein is a unesco landmark the zeche zollverein was designed by the architects schupp and kremmer and is regarded as one of the most stunning collieries in the world .
tourists now are able to take guided tours through this industrial monument , while the design center nrw exhibits award-winning design in the former boiler house .
other collieries have also experienced a revival , for example the zeche carl in altenessen , shut down in 1970 , and now one of the largest socio-cultural centers in germany .
concerts and cabaret performances , exhibitions , and panel discussions also take place in its former engine room and washhouse .

in 1996 , the former gateway into the cast steel works were transformed into a musical temple .
the colosseum has a capacity of 1,550 spectators .
the grugahalle , the largest event venue in essen , can accommodate up to 10,000 people and is used as a congress forum , a party location , an arena for major sports events and performances by international stars .
the alto theater , a masterpiece by famous finnish architect alvar aalto , is another great venue for opera and ballet performances , while the old synagogue built between 1911 and 1913 was once one of the most beautiful and largest jewish synagogues in germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 02.03.2005 child poverty rises in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one in 10 children in germany lives in relative poverty the number of children in german living in poverty is rising faster than in most other industrialized nations , according to a new report .
children of single parents and immigrant families are especially threatened . the report , released by the united nations children 's fund -lrb- unicef -rrb- on tuesday , found that in three quarters of the richest countries in the world child poverty has risen sometimes dramatically over the last 10 years .
it also said child poverty was on the increase because efforts of governments in the 26 most industrialized countries has waned in the past decades . the marked increase in child poverty in rich countries comes as a surprise and shatters popular perceptions that recent increases in wealth in the first world would be evenly spread among all people in society , according to the report 's authors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unicef logo peter adamson from unicef said that western governments appear to have dropped former ideals of creating equal living standards and argues that birth circumstances should not determine the life-time opportunities of children today . " there is a legitimate concern that progress towards that ideal has slowed , that some kind of barrier has been lowered , " he said .
" that barrier may well be the level and persistence of poverty and disadvantage in childhood . " nordic countries fare best according to the study compiled by unicef ’ s institute in florence , italy , the northern european states of denmark and finland have the lowest levels of child poverty with 2.4 percent and 2.8 percent respectively .
the poverty line has been fixed at about € 8,000 -lrb- $ 10,500 -rrb- family income a year or less than half of the average income of a normal national houshold . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : begging for money on a mexican street the united states and mexico are at the bottom of the list of 25 industrialized countries with poverty levels of 21 and 27 percent .
unicef , however , is most alarmed by the rapid rise in child poverty in many wealthy nations .
only one third of countries have made progress in the last year with britain making the biggest strides being able to reduce numbers by more than 3 percent .
unicef warned that child poverty will have lasting effects on the countries ‘ economic competitiveness and social cohesion . " children who grow up in poverty are at a marked and measurable disadvantage in their future lives , " adamson said .
" there is a strong statistical correlation between poverty in childhood and a variety of very well documented problems in later life .
the likelihood of poor health , of educational underachievement , of dropping out of school early and of long-term welfare dependence . " calls for german government to act the authors of the study urge national governments to make a stronger commitment to fighting child poverty .
germany , where about 10 percent of children are categorized as poor , has also seen a strong 2.7 percent rise in the past decade . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children of single mothers are especially affected here poverty is rampant among single mothers and immigrant families especially from the former soviet union .
altogether , about 1.5 million children in germany grow up in relative poverty . reinhard schlagintweit of unicef germany demanded swift action from the government of chancellor gerhard schröder , which was expected to discuss the report during a cabinet meeting on wednesday . " first there must be better opportunities for women with children to return to their jobs , " he said .
" secondly we must improve our education system at the lowest levels , including greater efforts to integrate non-german-speaking children .

children of single parents and immigrant families are especially threatened . the report , released by the united nations children 's fund -lrb- unicef -rrb- on tuesday , found that in three quarters of the richest countries in the world child poverty has risen sometimes dramatically over the last 10 years .
it also said child poverty was on the increase because efforts of governments in the 26 most industrialized countries has waned in the past decades . the marked increase in child poverty in rich countries comes as a surprise and shatters popular perceptions that recent increases in wealth in the first world would be evenly spread among all people in society , according to the report 's authors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unicef logo peter adamson from unicef said that western governments appear to have dropped former ideals of creating equal living standards and argues that birth circumstances should not determine the life-time opportunities of children today . " there is a legitimate concern that progress towards that ideal has slowed , that some kind of barrier has been lowered , " he said .
" that barrier may well be the level and persistence of poverty and disadvantage in childhood . " nordic countries fare best according to the study compiled by unicef ’ s institute in florence , italy , the northern european states of denmark and finland have the lowest levels of child poverty with 2.4 percent and 2.8 percent respectively .
the poverty line has been fixed at about € 8,000 -lrb- $ 10,500 -rrb- family income a year or less than half of the average income of a normal national houshold . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : begging for money on a mexican street the united states and mexico are at the bottom of the list of 25 industrialized countries with poverty levels of 21 and 27 percent .
unicef , however , is most alarmed by the rapid rise in child poverty in many wealthy nations .
only one third of countries have made progress in the last year with britain making the biggest strides being able to reduce numbers by more than 3 percent .
unicef warned that child poverty will have lasting effects on the countries ‘ economic competitiveness and social cohesion . " children who grow up in poverty are at a marked and measurable disadvantage in their future lives , " adamson said .

when bauhaus founder walter gropius fitted out the mess hall of the famous architecture college in dessau with the elegant , curved stool back in the 1920s , he launched the career of a design classic . decades later , the humble seat is at the heart of an acrimonious legal tussle . tecta vs. knoll tecta , a company based in the german state of lower saxony , is no longer allowed to sell the tubular steel stool it began marketing in 1982 .
moreover , the court ordered the company hand over all its profits from sales of the chair - as well as its matching table , the ' c4 ' - to rival business knoll international , which has an older claim to the design rights . knoll international sells a stool known as the ' laccio , ' which closely resembles breuer 's 1925 b9 model .
its sole difference is that while the b9 is sheer white , ' laccio ' is raven black . furniture feuds the dispute over the highly lucrative licence for the b9 has been dragging on for years . tecta argues it owns the rights because it signed a contract with the berlin bauhaus archive based on an agreement with breuer 's widow constanze .
in court , however , knoll was able to go one further , producing contracts personally signed by breuer in the 1960s .
the company came into possession of the documents when almost 50 years ago it acquired gavina , an italian company which had bought the rights to the b9 from the designer himself . bildunterschrift : dino gavina has revealed that the contract was considered valid for only ten years at the time of signing , which has prompted tecta to announce it will file an appeal . not the first time if so , it wo n't be the first time .
three years ago , the company won a legal battle with another company , l & c stendal , which manufactured copies of the breuer stool .
in court , l & c stendal argued that a stool is a household object rather than a work of art and therefore not subject to licencing laws .
in its final ruling , the court deemed the stool was indeed a work of art , and upheld the contract between tecta and breuer 's heirs . the battle over breuer one of the most influential designers of the 20th century , breuer both studied and taught at germany 's bauhaus school of architecture and design -lrb- photo -rrb- , which pioneered modern principles , technologies and the application of new materials in both the industrial and fine arts . an early fan of tubular steel , breuer designed a whole range of metal furniture including chairs , tables , stools and cupboards .

when bauhaus founder walter gropius fitted out the mess hall of the famous architecture college in dessau with the elegant , curved stool back in the 1920s , he launched the career of a design classic . decades later , the humble seat is at the heart of an acrimonious legal tussle . tecta vs. knoll tecta , a company based in the german state of lower saxony , is no longer allowed to sell the tubular steel stool it began marketing in 1982 .
moreover , the court ordered the company hand over all its profits from sales of the chair - as well as its matching table , the ' c4 ' - to rival business knoll international , which has an older claim to the design rights . knoll international sells a stool known as the ' laccio , ' which closely resembles breuer 's 1925 b9 model .
its sole difference is that while the b9 is sheer white , ' laccio ' is raven black . furniture feuds the dispute over the highly lucrative licence for the b9 has been dragging on for years . tecta argues it owns the rights because it signed a contract with the berlin bauhaus archive based on an agreement with breuer 's widow constanze .
in court , however , knoll was able to go one further , producing contracts personally signed by breuer in the 1960s .
the company came into possession of the documents when almost 50 years ago it acquired gavina , an italian company which had bought the rights to the b9 from the designer himself . bildunterschrift : dino gavina has revealed that the contract was considered valid for only ten years at the time of signing , which has prompted tecta to announce it will file an appeal . not the first time if so , it wo n't be the first time .
three years ago , the company won a legal battle with another company , l & c stendal , which manufactured copies of the breuer stool .
in court , l & c stendal argued that a stool is a household object rather than a work of art and therefore not subject to licencing laws .
in its final ruling , the court deemed the stool was indeed a work of art , and upheld the contract between tecta and breuer 's heirs . the battle over breuer one of the most influential designers of the 20th century , breuer both studied and taught at germany 's bauhaus school of architecture and design -lrb- photo -rrb- , which pioneered modern principles , technologies and the application of new materials in both the industrial and fine arts . an early fan of tubular steel , breuer designed a whole range of metal furniture including chairs , tables , stools and cupboards .

in tv ads , most people are young and beautiful .
but this is changing in germany and elsewhere in europe as businesses discover that seniors have lots of money they 'd prefer to spend on products created for their needs . in the reality portrayed by tv advertisers , a 30-year-old man can afford to buy the latest mercedes-benz , only young people drink € 15 -lrb- $ 20 -rrb- bottles of champagne and even anti-wrinkle cream is applied by beautiful women who do n't look a day over 30 .
thus , when older people go shopping they often feel they 've been overlooked . eve fear , 65 , does n't feel tempted to buy anything when she goes to fashionable stores at home in birmingham in britain , she says .
young women look down at her from the large posters as if to say : " this is not for you , you 're too old for that . " " certainly we are not catered for within the fashion world and lots of older people do have a lot of money to spend , " eve fear said .
" there 's certainly still poverty amongst older people in britain but they like their holidays .
that kind of thing can all affect the economy . " for too long , business has only cared about the 14- 49 year olds , eve fear says .
but the politicians , businesspeople and seniors who met recently for an international conference in bonn to discuss seniors ' needs for new products determined that the future may just be in consumers beyond 50 , an ever larger part of society in industrialized countries . taking advantage of demographic change " in the year 2040 a third of the german citizens will be older than 60 , " birgit fischer , minister for family and seniors in the german state of north rhine-westphalia pointed out .
" there are already cities and communities where we have more 70- than seven-year olds .
because of that we need another perspective on the older generation .
economic growth and opportunities for society depend on that . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 've got the money still , political and economic views of seniors are often one-sided in germany , where older people are largely seen as an expense .
it 's true that the growing number of old people will have to rely on a decreasing number of younger people to finance old-age pensions .
additionally , health-care costs increase as society ages .
but by focusing only on problems , society risks missing the opportunities that " demographic change " offers . take spending power , for instance .
the spending capacity of germany 's seniors alone is € 90 billion - the gross domestic product of venezuela .
and people over 50 own half of germany 's wealth , according to a study by allensbach demographic institute .
of course , some do only live off € 400 a month , a minimum to exist .
but generally older people live much more comfortably than , say , many single mothers .
on average , a pensioner in a two-person household has € 1,600 to spend each month , about € 100 more than a member of a family with children under 17 .
a young , single mother with one child lives off only € 800 monthly on average . and older people have the time to spend their money , too . time and money on their hands " the impression is that older people are not interesting for the market because they often think they are old so they do n't spend a lot of money , they do n't have a lot of activities , " says the senior citizen 's representative in the dutch city of maastricht , salden stella .
but stella says the opposite is true .
" we see now that older people are very active . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who says seniors are n't active ?
as european business discovers seniors as a target group , they 're changing their tactics .
even the youth-obsessed advertising industry has begun trying to attract the older customers ; the " best agers " and " 50plus " are the heroes of the " silver economy . "
big companies have started employing so-called senior scouts , older people who test particular products in supermarkets for seniors .
can a coffee package be opened easily without agile young fingers ?
are the keys of a mobile phone big enough to call the doctor in an emergency ? " the sale of cars could be increased by 5 to 8 percent if the industry would offer cars that are senior-compatible , if they would care for the aged as a consumer group , " says klaus gretschmann of the council of the european union .

young women look down at her from the large posters as if to say : " this is not for you , you 're too old for that . " " certainly we are not catered for within the fashion world and lots of older people do have a lot of money to spend , " eve fear said .
" there 's certainly still poverty amongst older people in britain but they like their holidays .

in tv ads , most people are young and beautiful .
but this is changing in germany and elsewhere in europe as businesses discover that seniors have lots of money they 'd prefer to spend on products created for their needs . in the reality portrayed by tv advertisers , a 30-year-old man can afford to buy the latest mercedes-benz , only young people drink € 15 -lrb- $ 20 -rrb- bottles of champagne and even anti-wrinkle cream is applied by beautiful women who do n't look a day over 30 .
thus , when older people go shopping they often feel they 've been overlooked . eve fear , 65 , does n't feel tempted to buy anything when she goes to fashionable stores at home in birmingham in britain , she says .
young women look down at her from the large posters as if to say : " this is not for you , you 're too old for that . " " certainly we are not catered for within the fashion world and lots of older people do have a lot of money to spend , " eve fear said .
" there 's certainly still poverty amongst older people in britain but they like their holidays .
that kind of thing can all affect the economy . " for too long , business has only cared about the 14- 49 year olds , eve fear says .
but the politicians , businesspeople and seniors who met recently for an international conference in bonn to discuss seniors ' needs for new products determined that the future may just be in consumers beyond 50 , an ever larger part of society in industrialized countries . taking advantage of demographic change " in the year 2040 a third of the german citizens will be older than 60 , " birgit fischer , minister for family and seniors in the german state of north rhine-westphalia pointed out .
" there are already cities and communities where we have more 70- than seven-year olds .
because of that we need another perspective on the older generation .
economic growth and opportunities for society depend on that . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 've got the money still , political and economic views of seniors are often one-sided in germany , where older people are largely seen as an expense .
it 's true that the growing number of old people will have to rely on a decreasing number of younger people to finance old-age pensions .
additionally , health-care costs increase as society ages .
but by focusing only on problems , society risks missing the opportunities that " demographic change " offers . take spending power , for instance .
the spending capacity of germany 's seniors alone is € 90 billion - the gross domestic product of venezuela .
and people over 50 own half of germany 's wealth , according to a study by allensbach demographic institute .
of course , some do only live off € 400 a month , a minimum to exist .
but generally older people live much more comfortably than , say , many single mothers .
on average , a pensioner in a two-person household has € 1,600 to spend each month , about € 100 more than a member of a family with children under 17 .
a young , single mother with one child lives off only € 800 monthly on average . and older people have the time to spend their money , too . time and money on their hands " the impression is that older people are not interesting for the market because they often think they are old so they do n't spend a lot of money , they do n't have a lot of activities , " says the senior citizen 's representative in the dutch city of maastricht , salden stella .
but stella says the opposite is true .
" we see now that older people are very active . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who says seniors are n't active ?
as european business discovers seniors as a target group , they 're changing their tactics .
even the youth-obsessed advertising industry has begun trying to attract the older customers ; the " best agers " and " 50plus " are the heroes of the " silver economy . "
big companies have started employing so-called senior scouts , older people who test particular products in supermarkets for seniors .
can a coffee package be opened easily without agile young fingers ?
are the keys of a mobile phone big enough to call the doctor in an emergency ? " the sale of cars could be increased by 5 to 8 percent if the industry would offer cars that are senior-compatible , if they would care for the aged as a consumer group , " says klaus gretschmann of the council of the european union .

but there is growing opposition to the proposals . a controversy is gathering pace in germany over proposals put forward by the regional state government of hesse to offer tax breaks to high-paid corporate executives , primarily in the banking sector , at a time when unemployment is at postwar highs . the bundesrat , or upper house of german parliament , on thursday is to examine proposals drawn up by hesse 's conservative state premier , roland koch , to cut the tax rate for super-rich executives to 35 percent from 42 percent for a period of three years . beneficiaries of the tax breaks would be corporate executives grossing more than € 77,000 -lrb- $ 101,000 -rrb- per year or € 151,000 for married bosses .
the aim would be to attract foreign managers and top employees to hesse and its financial centre , frankfurt . bad timing the timing of koch 's initiative could not be worse .
this week , jobless data showed that the number of people out of work in the eurozone 's biggest economy stands at a postwar high of 5.216 million , or 12.6 percent of the workforce . the draft proposals have been dubbed the " ackermann law " after josef ackermann , the head of germany 's biggest bank deutsche bank and the best-paid corporate chief in the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ackermann was also one of the fat cats involved in the high profile mannesmann trial in 2004 along with former mannesmann chairman klaus esser , mannesmann 's former supervisory board chief joachim funk , the former head of the powerful ig metall trade union , klaus zwickel , and two others . they were accused of approving 111.5 million deutsche marks -lrb- $ 71 million -rrb- in bonuses to management board members during the multi-billion-euro takeover of mannesmann by british mobile phone giant vodafone in 2000 .

this week , jobless data showed that the number of people out of work in the eurozone 's biggest economy stands at a postwar high of 5.216 million , or 12.6 percent of the workforce . the draft proposals have been dubbed the " ackermann law " after josef ackermann , the head of germany 's biggest bank deutsche bank and the best-paid corporate chief in the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ackermann was also one of the fat cats involved in the high profile mannesmann trial in 2004 along with former mannesmann chairman klaus esser , mannesmann 's former supervisory board chief joachim funk , the former head of the powerful ig metall trade union , klaus zwickel , and two others . they were accused of approving 111.5 million deutsche marks -lrb- $ 71 million -rrb- in bonuses to management board members during the multi-billion-euro takeover of mannesmann by british mobile phone giant vodafone in 2000 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 02.03.2005 child poverty rises in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one in 10 children in germany lives in relative poverty the number of children in german living in poverty is rising faster than in most other industrialized nations , according to a new report .
children of single parents and immigrant families are especially threatened . the report , released by the united nations children 's fund -lrb- unicef -rrb- on tuesday , found that in three quarters of the richest countries in the world child poverty has risen sometimes dramatically over the last 10 years .
it also said child poverty was on the increase because efforts of governments in the 26 most industrialized countries has waned in the past decades . the marked increase in child poverty in rich countries comes as a surprise and shatters popular perceptions that recent increases in wealth in the first world would be evenly spread among all people in society , according to the report 's authors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unicef logo peter adamson from unicef said that western governments appear to have dropped former ideals of creating equal living standards and argues that birth circumstances should not determine the life-time opportunities of children today . " there is a legitimate concern that progress towards that ideal has slowed , that some kind of barrier has been lowered , " he said .
" that barrier may well be the level and persistence of poverty and disadvantage in childhood . " nordic countries fare best according to the study compiled by unicef ’ s institute in florence , italy , the northern european states of denmark and finland have the lowest levels of child poverty with 2.4 percent and 2.8 percent respectively .
the poverty line has been fixed at about € 8,000 -lrb- $ 10,500 -rrb- family income a year or less than half of the average income of a normal national houshold . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : begging for money on a mexican street the united states and mexico are at the bottom of the list of 25 industrialized countries with poverty levels of 21 and 27 percent .
unicef , however , is most alarmed by the rapid rise in child poverty in many wealthy nations .
only one third of countries have made progress in the last year with britain making the biggest strides being able to reduce numbers by more than 3 percent .
unicef warned that child poverty will have lasting effects on the countries ‘ economic competitiveness and social cohesion . " children who grow up in poverty are at a marked and measurable disadvantage in their future lives , " adamson said .
" there is a strong statistical correlation between poverty in childhood and a variety of very well documented problems in later life .
the likelihood of poor health , of educational underachievement , of dropping out of school early and of long-term welfare dependence . " calls for german government to act the authors of the study urge national governments to make a stronger commitment to fighting child poverty .
germany , where about 10 percent of children are categorized as poor , has also seen a strong 2.7 percent rise in the past decade . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children of single mothers are especially affected here poverty is rampant among single mothers and immigrant families especially from the former soviet union .
altogether , about 1.5 million children in germany grow up in relative poverty . reinhard schlagintweit of unicef germany demanded swift action from the government of chancellor gerhard schröder , which was expected to discuss the report during a cabinet meeting on wednesday . " first there must be better opportunities for women with children to return to their jobs , " he said .
" secondly we must improve our education system at the lowest levels , including greater efforts to integrate non-german-speaking children .
the british example shows that when you target your subsidies on poor children you can improve child poverty . " renate schmidt , germany 's family minister , said on tuesday she planned on widening the group of people who receive extra money from the state for their children . " i 'll make suggestions within the year , " she said . uwe hessler -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de making germany child-friendlier the cabinet has approved a plan to make germany one of europe 's most child-friendly countries by 2010 .

children of single parents and immigrant families are especially threatened . the report , released by the united nations children 's fund -lrb- unicef -rrb- on tuesday , found that in three quarters of the richest countries in the world child poverty has risen sometimes dramatically over the last 10 years .
it also said child poverty was on the increase because efforts of governments in the 26 most industrialized countries has waned in the past decades . the marked increase in child poverty in rich countries comes as a surprise and shatters popular perceptions that recent increases in wealth in the first world would be evenly spread among all people in society , according to the report 's authors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unicef logo peter adamson from unicef said that western governments appear to have dropped former ideals of creating equal living standards and argues that birth circumstances should not determine the life-time opportunities of children today . " there is a legitimate concern that progress towards that ideal has slowed , that some kind of barrier has been lowered , " he said .
" that barrier may well be the level and persistence of poverty and disadvantage in childhood . " nordic countries fare best according to the study compiled by unicef ’ s institute in florence , italy , the northern european states of denmark and finland have the lowest levels of child poverty with 2.4 percent and 2.8 percent respectively .
the poverty line has been fixed at about € 8,000 -lrb- $ 10,500 -rrb- family income a year or less than half of the average income of a normal national houshold . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : begging for money on a mexican street the united states and mexico are at the bottom of the list of 25 industrialized countries with poverty levels of 21 and 27 percent .
unicef , however , is most alarmed by the rapid rise in child poverty in many wealthy nations .
only one third of countries have made progress in the last year with britain making the biggest strides being able to reduce numbers by more than 3 percent .
unicef warned that child poverty will have lasting effects on the countries ‘ economic competitiveness and social cohesion . " children who grow up in poverty are at a marked and measurable disadvantage in their future lives , " adamson said .
" there is a strong statistical correlation between poverty in childhood and a variety of very well documented problems in later life .
the likelihood of poor health , of educational underachievement , of dropping out of school early and of long-term welfare dependence . " calls for german government to act the authors of the study urge national governments to make a stronger commitment to fighting child poverty .
germany , where about 10 percent of children are categorized as poor , has also seen a strong 2.7 percent rise in the past decade . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children of single mothers are especially affected here poverty is rampant among single mothers and immigrant families especially from the former soviet union .
altogether , about 1.5 million children in germany grow up in relative poverty . reinhard schlagintweit of unicef germany demanded swift action from the government of chancellor gerhard schröder , which was expected to discuss the report during a cabinet meeting on wednesday . " first there must be better opportunities for women with children to return to their jobs , " he said .
" secondly we must improve our education system at the lowest levels , including greater efforts to integrate non-german-speaking children .
the british example shows that when you target your subsidies on poor children you can improve child poverty . " renate schmidt , germany 's family minister , said on tuesday she planned on widening the group of people who receive extra money from the state for their children . " i 'll make suggestions within the year , " she said . uwe hessler -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de making germany child-friendlier the cabinet has approved a plan to make germany one of europe 's most child-friendly countries by 2010 .

but there is growing opposition to the proposals . a controversy is gathering pace in germany over proposals put forward by the regional state government of hesse to offer tax breaks to high-paid corporate executives , primarily in the banking sector , at a time when unemployment is at postwar highs . the bundesrat , or upper house of german parliament , on thursday is to examine proposals drawn up by hesse 's conservative state premier , roland koch , to cut the tax rate for super-rich executives to 35 percent from 42 percent for a period of three years . beneficiaries of the tax breaks would be corporate executives grossing more than € 77,000 -lrb- $ 101,000 -rrb- per year or € 151,000 for married bosses .
the aim would be to attract foreign managers and top employees to hesse and its financial centre , frankfurt . bad timing the timing of koch 's initiative could not be worse .
this week , jobless data showed that the number of people out of work in the eurozone 's biggest economy stands at a postwar high of 5.216 million , or 12.6 percent of the workforce . the draft proposals have been dubbed the " ackermann law " after josef ackermann , the head of germany 's biggest bank deutsche bank and the best-paid corporate chief in the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ackermann was also one of the fat cats involved in the high profile mannesmann trial in 2004 along with former mannesmann chairman klaus esser , mannesmann 's former supervisory board chief joachim funk , the former head of the powerful ig metall trade union , klaus zwickel , and two others . they were accused of approving 111.5 million deutsche marks -lrb- $ 71 million -rrb- in bonuses to management board members during the multi-billion-euro takeover of mannesmann by british mobile phone giant vodafone in 2000 .
esser alone pocketed more than € 15 million . all of those involved were cleared of any wrongdoing but the case raised serious questions about the virtual untouchable status of germany 's top executives and the rules governing their money . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no tax breaks for the super rich says hans eichel .
the tax break proposals have run into widespread resistance .
german finance minister hans eichel said : " there will be no tax breaks for the super rich with this government . "

in tv ads , most people are young and beautiful .
but this is changing in germany and elsewhere in europe as businesses discover that seniors have lots of money they 'd prefer to spend on products created for their needs . in the reality portrayed by tv advertisers , a 30-year-old man can afford to buy the latest mercedes-benz , only young people drink € 15 -lrb- $ 20 -rrb- bottles of champagne and even anti-wrinkle cream is applied by beautiful women who do n't look a day over 30 .
thus , when older people go shopping they often feel they 've been overlooked . eve fear , 65 , does n't feel tempted to buy anything when she goes to fashionable stores at home in birmingham in britain , she says .
young women look down at her from the large posters as if to say : " this is not for you , you 're too old for that . " " certainly we are not catered for within the fashion world and lots of older people do have a lot of money to spend , " eve fear said .
" there 's certainly still poverty amongst older people in britain but they like their holidays .
that kind of thing can all affect the economy . " for too long , business has only cared about the 14- 49 year olds , eve fear says .
but the politicians , businesspeople and seniors who met recently for an international conference in bonn to discuss seniors ' needs for new products determined that the future may just be in consumers beyond 50 , an ever larger part of society in industrialized countries . taking advantage of demographic change " in the year 2040 a third of the german citizens will be older than 60 , " birgit fischer , minister for family and seniors in the german state of north rhine-westphalia pointed out .
" there are already cities and communities where we have more 70- than seven-year olds .
because of that we need another perspective on the older generation .
economic growth and opportunities for society depend on that . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 've got the money still , political and economic views of seniors are often one-sided in germany , where older people are largely seen as an expense .
it 's true that the growing number of old people will have to rely on a decreasing number of younger people to finance old-age pensions .
additionally , health-care costs increase as society ages .
but by focusing only on problems , society risks missing the opportunities that " demographic change " offers . take spending power , for instance .
the spending capacity of germany 's seniors alone is € 90 billion - the gross domestic product of venezuela .
and people over 50 own half of germany 's wealth , according to a study by allensbach demographic institute .
of course , some do only live off € 400 a month , a minimum to exist .
but generally older people live much more comfortably than , say , many single mothers .
on average , a pensioner in a two-person household has € 1,600 to spend each month , about € 100 more than a member of a family with children under 17 .
a young , single mother with one child lives off only € 800 monthly on average . and older people have the time to spend their money , too . time and money on their hands " the impression is that older people are not interesting for the market because they often think they are old so they do n't spend a lot of money , they do n't have a lot of activities , " says the senior citizen 's representative in the dutch city of maastricht , salden stella .
but stella says the opposite is true .
" we see now that older people are very active . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who says seniors are n't active ?
as european business discovers seniors as a target group , they 're changing their tactics .
even the youth-obsessed advertising industry has begun trying to attract the older customers ; the " best agers " and " 50plus " are the heroes of the " silver economy . "
big companies have started employing so-called senior scouts , older people who test particular products in supermarkets for seniors .
can a coffee package be opened easily without agile young fingers ?
are the keys of a mobile phone big enough to call the doctor in an emergency ? " the sale of cars could be increased by 5 to 8 percent if the industry would offer cars that are senior-compatible , if they would care for the aged as a consumer group , " says klaus gretschmann of the council of the european union .

in tv ads , most people are young and beautiful .
but this is changing in germany and elsewhere in europe as businesses discover that seniors have lots of money they 'd prefer to spend on products created for their needs . in the reality portrayed by tv advertisers , a 30-year-old man can afford to buy the latest mercedes-benz , only young people drink € 15 -lrb- $ 20 -rrb- bottles of champagne and even anti-wrinkle cream is applied by beautiful women who do n't look a day over 30 .
thus , when older people go shopping they often feel they 've been overlooked . eve fear , 65 , does n't feel tempted to buy anything when she goes to fashionable stores at home in birmingham in britain , she says .
young women look down at her from the large posters as if to say : " this is not for you , you 're too old for that . " " certainly we are not catered for within the fashion world and lots of older people do have a lot of money to spend , " eve fear said .
" there 's certainly still poverty amongst older people in britain but they like their holidays .
that kind of thing can all affect the economy . " for too long , business has only cared about the 14- 49 year olds , eve fear says .
but the politicians , businesspeople and seniors who met recently for an international conference in bonn to discuss seniors ' needs for new products determined that the future may just be in consumers beyond 50 , an ever larger part of society in industrialized countries . taking advantage of demographic change " in the year 2040 a third of the german citizens will be older than 60 , " birgit fischer , minister for family and seniors in the german state of north rhine-westphalia pointed out .
" there are already cities and communities where we have more 70- than seven-year olds .
because of that we need another perspective on the older generation .
economic growth and opportunities for society depend on that . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 've got the money still , political and economic views of seniors are often one-sided in germany , where older people are largely seen as an expense .
it 's true that the growing number of old people will have to rely on a decreasing number of younger people to finance old-age pensions .
additionally , health-care costs increase as society ages .
but by focusing only on problems , society risks missing the opportunities that " demographic change " offers . take spending power , for instance .
the spending capacity of germany 's seniors alone is € 90 billion - the gross domestic product of venezuela .
and people over 50 own half of germany 's wealth , according to a study by allensbach demographic institute .
of course , some do only live off € 400 a month , a minimum to exist .
but generally older people live much more comfortably than , say , many single mothers .
on average , a pensioner in a two-person household has € 1,600 to spend each month , about € 100 more than a member of a family with children under 17 .
a young , single mother with one child lives off only € 800 monthly on average . and older people have the time to spend their money , too . time and money on their hands " the impression is that older people are not interesting for the market because they often think they are old so they do n't spend a lot of money , they do n't have a lot of activities , " says the senior citizen 's representative in the dutch city of maastricht , salden stella .
but stella says the opposite is true .
" we see now that older people are very active . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who says seniors are n't active ?
as european business discovers seniors as a target group , they 're changing their tactics .
even the youth-obsessed advertising industry has begun trying to attract the older customers ; the " best agers " and " 50plus " are the heroes of the " silver economy . "
big companies have started employing so-called senior scouts , older people who test particular products in supermarkets for seniors .
can a coffee package be opened easily without agile young fingers ?
are the keys of a mobile phone big enough to call the doctor in an emergency ? " the sale of cars could be increased by 5 to 8 percent if the industry would offer cars that are senior-compatible , if they would care for the aged as a consumer group , " says klaus gretschmann of the council of the european union .

but there is growing opposition to the proposals . a controversy is gathering pace in germany over proposals put forward by the regional state government of hesse to offer tax breaks to high-paid corporate executives , primarily in the banking sector , at a time when unemployment is at postwar highs . the bundesrat , or upper house of german parliament , on thursday is to examine proposals drawn up by hesse 's conservative state premier , roland koch , to cut the tax rate for super-rich executives to 35 percent from 42 percent for a period of three years . beneficiaries of the tax breaks would be corporate executives grossing more than € 77,000 -lrb- $ 101,000 -rrb- per year or € 151,000 for married bosses .
the aim would be to attract foreign managers and top employees to hesse and its financial centre , frankfurt . bad timing the timing of koch 's initiative could not be worse .

that 's why their handlers are pampering them . many people have called in sick in recent weeks because of the flu that 's swept across the country .
at berlin 's zoo , officials are making sure that their animals do n't fall prey to viruses by boosting their immune systems . " we have to watch carefully that no animal gets sick or suffers from frost bites , " rudofl reinhard , a berlin zoologist , told dpa news service . while monkeys get fed a lot of fruit at the moment , " we 've ordered bags and bags of vitamin c for rhinos , " reinhard said . but zoo officials are n't just thinking of protective measures that work from the inside .
they cover paths with sand so that antelopes do n't break their ankles and regularly check rhino ears and elephant tails , which easily get frostbite . another trick to keep animals happy during those dark winter days is one that the majority of germans use too : sunbeds .
the zoo folks have n't resorted to it yet , but they say if it gets too dark , the rhinos at least will benefit from a little uv therapy . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de when business gets the flu anti-virus programs , security updates , firewalls – companies invest millions to protect computers from damaging viruses while little is done to prevent influenza , an equally costly bug in terms of lost productivity .

when bauhaus founder walter gropius fitted out the mess hall of the famous architecture college in dessau with the elegant , curved stool back in the 1920s , he launched the career of a design classic . decades later , the humble seat is at the heart of an acrimonious legal tussle . tecta vs. knoll tecta , a company based in the german state of lower saxony , is no longer allowed to sell the tubular steel stool it began marketing in 1982 .
moreover , the court ordered the company hand over all its profits from sales of the chair - as well as its matching table , the ' c4 ' - to rival business knoll international , which has an older claim to the design rights . knoll international sells a stool known as the ' laccio , ' which closely resembles breuer 's 1925 b9 model .
its sole difference is that while the b9 is sheer white , ' laccio ' is raven black . furniture feuds the dispute over the highly lucrative licence for the b9 has been dragging on for years . tecta argues it owns the rights because it signed a contract with the berlin bauhaus archive based on an agreement with breuer 's widow constanze .
in court , however , knoll was able to go one further , producing contracts personally signed by breuer in the 1960s .
the company came into possession of the documents when almost 50 years ago it acquired gavina , an italian company which had bought the rights to the b9 from the designer himself . bildunterschrift : dino gavina has revealed that the contract was considered valid for only ten years at the time of signing , which has prompted tecta to announce it will file an appeal . not the first time if so , it wo n't be the first time .
three years ago , the company won a legal battle with another company , l & c stendal , which manufactured copies of the breuer stool .
in court , l & c stendal argued that a stool is a household object rather than a work of art and therefore not subject to licencing laws .
in its final ruling , the court deemed the stool was indeed a work of art , and upheld the contract between tecta and breuer 's heirs . the battle over breuer one of the most influential designers of the 20th century , breuer both studied and taught at germany 's bauhaus school of architecture and design -lrb- photo -rrb- , which pioneered modern principles , technologies and the application of new materials in both the industrial and fine arts . an early fan of tubular steel , breuer designed a whole range of metal furniture including chairs , tables , stools and cupboards .

when bauhaus founder walter gropius fitted out the mess hall of the famous architecture college in dessau with the elegant , curved stool back in the 1920s , he launched the career of a design classic . decades later , the humble seat is at the heart of an acrimonious legal tussle . tecta vs. knoll tecta , a company based in the german state of lower saxony , is no longer allowed to sell the tubular steel stool it began marketing in 1982 .
moreover , the court ordered the company hand over all its profits from sales of the chair - as well as its matching table , the ' c4 ' - to rival business knoll international , which has an older claim to the design rights . knoll international sells a stool known as the ' laccio , ' which closely resembles breuer 's 1925 b9 model .
its sole difference is that while the b9 is sheer white , ' laccio ' is raven black . furniture feuds the dispute over the highly lucrative licence for the b9 has been dragging on for years . tecta argues it owns the rights because it signed a contract with the berlin bauhaus archive based on an agreement with breuer 's widow constanze .
in court , however , knoll was able to go one further , producing contracts personally signed by breuer in the 1960s .
the company came into possession of the documents when almost 50 years ago it acquired gavina , an italian company which had bought the rights to the b9 from the designer himself . bildunterschrift : dino gavina has revealed that the contract was considered valid for only ten years at the time of signing , which has prompted tecta to announce it will file an appeal . not the first time if so , it wo n't be the first time .
three years ago , the company won a legal battle with another company , l & c stendal , which manufactured copies of the breuer stool .
in court , l & c stendal argued that a stool is a household object rather than a work of art and therefore not subject to licencing laws .
in its final ruling , the court deemed the stool was indeed a work of art , and upheld the contract between tecta and breuer 's heirs . the battle over breuer one of the most influential designers of the 20th century , breuer both studied and taught at germany 's bauhaus school of architecture and design -lrb- photo -rrb- , which pioneered modern principles , technologies and the application of new materials in both the industrial and fine arts . an early fan of tubular steel , breuer designed a whole range of metal furniture including chairs , tables , stools and cupboards .
breuer considered all of his designs to be essential for the masses and mass production of modern living .

children of single parents and immigrant families are especially threatened . the report , released by the united nations children 's fund -lrb- unicef -rrb- on tuesday , found that in three quarters of the richest countries in the world child poverty has risen sometimes dramatically over the last 10 years .
it also said child poverty was on the increase because efforts of governments in the 26 most industrialized countries has waned in the past decades . the marked increase in child poverty in rich countries comes as a surprise and shatters popular perceptions that recent increases in wealth in the first world would be evenly spread among all people in society , according to the report 's authors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unicef logo peter adamson from unicef said that western governments appear to have dropped former ideals of creating equal living standards and argues that birth circumstances should not determine the life-time opportunities of children today .

in tv ads , most people are young and beautiful .
but this is changing in germany and elsewhere in europe as businesses discover that seniors have lots of money they 'd prefer to spend on products created for their needs . in the reality portrayed by tv advertisers , a 30-year-old man can afford to buy the latest mercedes-benz , only young people drink € 15 -lrb- $ 20 -rrb- bottles of champagne and even anti-wrinkle cream is applied by beautiful women who do n't look a day over 30 .
thus , when older people go shopping they often feel they 've been overlooked . eve fear , 65 , does n't feel tempted to buy anything when she goes to fashionable stores at home in birmingham in britain , she says .
young women look down at her from the large posters as if to say : " this is not for you , you 're too old for that . " " certainly we are not catered for within the fashion world and lots of older people do have a lot of money to spend , " eve fear said .
" there 's certainly still poverty amongst older people in britain but they like their holidays .
that kind of thing can all affect the economy . " for too long , business has only cared about the 14- 49 year olds , eve fear says .
but the politicians , businesspeople and seniors who met recently for an international conference in bonn to discuss seniors ' needs for new products determined that the future may just be in consumers beyond 50 , an ever larger part of society in industrialized countries . taking advantage of demographic change " in the year 2040 a third of the german citizens will be older than 60 , " birgit fischer , minister for family and seniors in the german state of north rhine-westphalia pointed out .
" there are already cities and communities where we have more 70- than seven-year olds .
because of that we need another perspective on the older generation .
economic growth and opportunities for society depend on that . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 've got the money still , political and economic views of seniors are often one-sided in germany , where older people are largely seen as an expense .
it 's true that the growing number of old people will have to rely on a decreasing number of younger people to finance old-age pensions .
additionally , health-care costs increase as society ages .
but by focusing only on problems , society risks missing the opportunities that " demographic change " offers . take spending power , for instance .
the spending capacity of germany 's seniors alone is € 90 billion - the gross domestic product of venezuela .
and people over 50 own half of germany 's wealth , according to a study by allensbach demographic institute .
of course , some do only live off € 400 a month , a minimum to exist .
but generally older people live much more comfortably than , say , many single mothers .
on average , a pensioner in a two-person household has € 1,600 to spend each month , about € 100 more than a member of a family with children under 17 .
a young , single mother with one child lives off only € 800 monthly on average . and older people have the time to spend their money , too . time and money on their hands " the impression is that older people are not interesting for the market because they often think they are old so they do n't spend a lot of money , they do n't have a lot of activities , " says the senior citizen 's representative in the dutch city of maastricht , salden stella .
but stella says the opposite is true .
" we see now that older people are very active . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who says seniors are n't active ?
as european business discovers seniors as a target group , they 're changing their tactics .
even the youth-obsessed advertising industry has begun trying to attract the older customers ; the " best agers " and " 50plus " are the heroes of the " silver economy . "
big companies have started employing so-called senior scouts , older people who test particular products in supermarkets for seniors .
can a coffee package be opened easily without agile young fingers ?
are the keys of a mobile phone big enough to call the doctor in an emergency ? " the sale of cars could be increased by 5 to 8 percent if the industry would offer cars that are senior-compatible , if they would care for the aged as a consumer group , " says klaus gretschmann of the council of the european union . " these are restraints that we have to remove and if we erase them the whole seniors sector will contribute to european economic growth .

of course , some do only live off € 400 a month , a minimum to exist .
but generally older people live much more comfortably than , say , many single mothers .
on average , a pensioner in a two-person household has € 1,600 to spend each month , about € 100 more than a member of a family with children under 17 .
a young , single mother with one child lives off only € 800 monthly on average . and older people have the time to spend their money , too . time and money on their hands " the impression is that older people are not interesting for the market because they often think they are old so they do n't spend a lot of money , they do n't have a lot of activities , " says the senior citizen 's representative in the dutch city of maastricht , salden stella .
but stella says the opposite is true .
" we see now that older people are very active . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who says seniors are n't active ?
as european business discovers seniors as a target group , they 're changing their tactics .
even the youth-obsessed advertising industry has begun trying to attract the older customers ; the " best agers " and " 50plus " are the heroes of the " silver economy . "
big companies have started employing so-called senior scouts , older people who test particular products in supermarkets for seniors .
can a coffee package be opened easily without agile young fingers ?
are the keys of a mobile phone big enough to call the doctor in an emergency ? " the sale of cars could be increased by 5 to 8 percent if the industry would offer cars that are senior-compatible , if they would care for the aged as a consumer group , " says klaus gretschmann of the council of the european union . " these are restraints that we have to remove and if we erase them the whole seniors sector will contribute to european economic growth .

it was first mentioned in a document of 1031 as " bruno 's wiek " or brunesguik .
legend has it that the brothers bruno and dankward , both dukes of saxony , started building the " villa brunesguik -lrb- brunsweik -rrb- on a site of a former saxon village which had supposedly been laid waste by emperor charlemagne . duke bruno founded the " weik " -lrb- a resting place for traveling merchants -rrb- on the right bank of the oker river .
the city was located at the junction of major medieval trade routes and thanks to the oker river , its water routes stretched to the city of bremen as well to the north sea . a member of the hanseatic league , braunschweig was also the main base for saxon merchants .

in 1160 henry the lion , the duke of saxony and bavaria , made braunschweig the seat of his court and transformed it into a political and cultural centre of the duchy of saxony . today a lion statue , which is also the city ’ s emblem , stands at the ‘ burgplatz ’ in the heart of the city .
it symbolizes impressive strength and secular as well as ecclesiastical power . the city of about 250,000 residents is situated about 60 kilometers east of the capital of hanover in the state of lower saxony .
the cityscape is still largely dictated by its earlier mediaeval structure .
however , signs of modernity are also visible , such as the recent addition of attractive glass-roofed shopping passages and a pedestrian zone at the traditional marketplace . traces of the past can be seen in the dankwarderode castle , built in the romanesque style , surrounded by several half-timbered houses that survived allied bombings in world war two .
before the war braunschweig had the largest homogeneous group of half-timbered buildings in germany . other historic gems include the medieval burgplatz with the 12th century romanesque cathedral of st. blasius and the burg dankwarderode , a castle containing a collection of medieval art treasures and precious reliquaries that is unparalleled in lower saxony . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : staatstheater braunschweig in 1829 , the state theater of braunschweig , now more than 300 years old , hosted the premiere of a true masterpiece of german literature : the first part of goethe ’ s " faust .

the theater today focuses on four main areas covering music , drama and ballet and also manages the state orchestra and the children ’ s and young people ’ s theater . home to science and metal works braunschweig is also a major center for science .
the oldest technical university in germany , the technical university carolo wilhelmina , was founded as the collegium carolinum , in 1745 .

it was first mentioned in a document of 1031 as " bruno 's wiek " or brunesguik .
legend has it that the brothers bruno and dankward , both dukes of saxony , started building the " villa brunesguik -lrb- brunsweik -rrb- on a site of a former saxon village which had supposedly been laid waste by emperor charlemagne . duke bruno founded the " weik " -lrb- a resting place for traveling merchants -rrb- on the right bank of the oker river .
the city was located at the junction of major medieval trade routes and thanks to the oker river , its water routes stretched to the city of bremen as well to the north sea . a member of the hanseatic league , braunschweig was also the main base for saxon merchants .
it enjoyed major trade ties with the important cities of northern europe . henry the lion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : burgplatz braunschweig is known as the city of henry the lion .
in 1160 henry the lion , the duke of saxony and bavaria , made braunschweig the seat of his court and transformed it into a political and cultural centre of the duchy of saxony . today a lion statue , which is also the city ’ s emblem , stands at the ‘ burgplatz ’ in the heart of the city .
it symbolizes impressive strength and secular as well as ecclesiastical power . the city of about 250,000 residents is situated about 60 kilometers east of the capital of hanover in the state of lower saxony .
the cityscape is still largely dictated by its earlier mediaeval structure .
however , signs of modernity are also visible , such as the recent addition of attractive glass-roofed shopping passages and a pedestrian zone at the traditional marketplace . traces of the past can be seen in the dankwarderode castle , built in the romanesque style , surrounded by several half-timbered houses that survived allied bombings in world war two .
before the war braunschweig had the largest homogeneous group of half-timbered buildings in germany . other historic gems include the medieval burgplatz with the 12th century romanesque cathedral of st. blasius and the burg dankwarderode , a castle containing a collection of medieval art treasures and precious reliquaries that is unparalleled in lower saxony . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : staatstheater braunschweig in 1829 , the state theater of braunschweig , now more than 300 years old , hosted the premiere of a true masterpiece of german literature : the first part of goethe ’ s " faust . "
before that in 1772 , gotthold ephraim lessing ’ s tragedy " emilia galotti " opened in the same theater .
the theater today focuses on four main areas covering music , drama and ballet and also manages the state orchestra and the children ’ s and young people ’ s theater . home to science and metal works braunschweig is also a major center for science .
the oldest technical university in germany , the technical university carolo wilhelmina , was founded as the collegium carolinum , in 1745 .
today braunschweig boasts the largest numbers of scientists among german cities . even the federal ministry of consumer protection , food and agriculture and the federal government research institute responsible for supervision of the aviation industry , have their headquarters here . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rizzi-house was designed by us pop artist james rizzi the city is also a leading german market for sugar products and is famous for its sausages , asparagus , and gingerbread .
away from its famed goodies , braunschweig boasts a rail network and an airport and its chief industry centers around metal works .
machinery , motor vehicles , office and calculating machines , and pianos are manufactured here .
most recently , publishing and electronics have also emerged as forces to reckon in the city 's economy . city 's image sullied by hitler link but , the city 's industrious image is also tarnished by a stain . braunschweig achieved inglorious fame by making adolf hitler , the nazi dictator , a german citizen , allowing him to run as a candidate for the german reichstag and become leader of the state .
hitler was employed by the brunswick state government in february 1932 and thereby got german citizenship . lillian urio -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world 's most expensive book makes rare appearance it 's so fragile that it 's displayed for only six weeks per year and the rare gem - prince henry the lion 's highly ornate 12th century book of holy gospels - can now be viewed by the public until march 18 .

in the middle of the 19th century , it emerged as the center of the largest coal and steel area in europe .

institutions such as the association of ruhr district local authorities , the state environment agency , the german meteorological service , and the ruhr diocese are all located in essen .
the city 's transformation from a mining to a service industry center can best be seen in the changes the colliery has undergone .

it was first mentioned in a document of 1031 as " bruno 's wiek " or brunesguik .
legend has it that the brothers bruno and dankward , both dukes of saxony , started building the " villa brunesguik -lrb- brunsweik -rrb- on a site of a former saxon village which had supposedly been laid waste by emperor charlemagne . duke bruno founded the " weik " -lrb- a resting place for traveling merchants -rrb- on the right bank of the oker river .
the city was located at the junction of major medieval trade routes and thanks to the oker river , its water routes stretched to the city of bremen as well to the north sea . a member of the hanseatic league , braunschweig was also the main base for saxon merchants .

it was first mentioned in a document of 1031 as " bruno 's wiek " or brunesguik .
legend has it that the brothers bruno and dankward , both dukes of saxony , started building the " villa brunesguik -lrb- brunsweik -rrb- on a site of a former saxon village which had supposedly been laid waste by emperor charlemagne . duke bruno founded the " weik " -lrb- a resting place for traveling merchants -rrb- on the right bank of the oker river .
the city was located at the junction of major medieval trade routes and thanks to the oker river , its water routes stretched to the city of bremen as well to the north sea . a member of the hanseatic league , braunschweig was also the main base for saxon merchants .
it enjoyed major trade ties with the important cities of northern europe . henry the lion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : burgplatz braunschweig is known as the city of henry the lion .
in 1160 henry the lion , the duke of saxony and bavaria , made braunschweig the seat of his court and transformed it into a political and cultural centre of the duchy of saxony . today a lion statue , which is also the city ’ s emblem , stands at the ‘ burgplatz ’ in the heart of the city .
it symbolizes impressive strength and secular as well as ecclesiastical power . the city of about 250,000 residents is situated about 60 kilometers east of the capital of hanover in the state of lower saxony .

in the middle of the 19th century , it emerged as the center of the largest coal and steel area in europe .
for many decades , coal - the ruhr region 's black gold - powered the german post-war economic miracle .
but those days are long gone .
in 1986 , essen 's last mine was shut down .
as one local adverting campaign put it , " essen has wiped the coal dust from its face . "
from coal to culture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rwe is headquartered in düsseldorf today the city is an international economic hub , with nine of germany 's top one hundred companies calling essen home .
several headquarters of regional institutions are also based in the city due to its central location .
institutions such as the association of ruhr district local authorities , the state environment agency , the german meteorological service , and the ruhr diocese are all located in essen .
the city 's transformation from a mining to a service industry center can best be seen in the changes the colliery has undergone .
the zeche zollverein , shut down in 1986 , was a highly efficient production site when it first opened in 1932 .
today , the zollverein houses artists ' studios , offices , and workshops .
in 2001 unesco listed the colliery as a world cultural heritage site .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the zeche zollverein is a unesco landmark the zeche zollverein was designed by the architects schupp and kremmer and is regarded as one of the most stunning collieries in the world .
tourists now are able to take guided tours through this industrial monument , while the design center nrw exhibits award-winning design in the former boiler house .
other collieries have also experienced a revival , for example the zeche carl in altenessen , shut down in 1970 , and now one of the largest socio-cultural centers in germany .
concerts and cabaret performances , exhibitions , and panel discussions also take place in its former engine room and washhouse .
venues and arenas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the folkwang school for music , theater and dance is an architectural highlight in its day , the krupp industrial site was seven times larger than the city center .
all that 's left of the site today is the viii mechanical workshop .
in 1996 , the former gateway into the cast steel works were transformed into a musical temple .
the colosseum has a capacity of 1,550 spectators .
the grugahalle , the largest event venue in essen , can accommodate up to 10,000 people and is used as a congress forum , a party location , an arena for major sports events and performances by international stars .
the alto theater , a masterpiece by famous finnish architect alvar aalto , is another great venue for opera and ballet performances , while the old synagogue built between 1911 and 1913 was once one of the most beautiful and largest jewish synagogues in germany .
in 1938 , during the pogrom night in november , it was set ablaze by the nazis .

but the people of both towns are already thinking in terms of one city . founded around 1200 , görlitz became the capital of the duchy of görlitz in 1377 .
in those days it was an important cloth-weaving and trade center .
the city was passed on to the habsburg empire in 1526 , and in 1635 it was once again turned over to saxony .
prussia annexed the city in 1815 and after world war ii , the city found itself divided .
one side remained in germany and the other side in poland , with the river neisse river separating the two .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an old plan of the city from 1730 the german city continued to be known as görlitz , while the polish city became zgorzelec , autonomous since 1945 .
the two cities were separated as retreating german troops blew up all the bridges across the neisse river .
several weeks later , the river was used as a border between poland and the soviet zone of germany , when leaders from the soviet union , britain , us and france carved up the area . unification and restoration with the re-unification of germany in 1989 and european union enlargement in 2004 , the people of görlitz and zgorzelec reached out to each other in a bid to join their cities culturally and economically .

in the middle of the 19th century , it emerged as the center of the largest coal and steel area in europe .

but the people of both towns are already thinking in terms of one city . founded around 1200 , görlitz became the capital of the duchy of görlitz in 1377 .
in those days it was an important cloth-weaving and trade center .
the city was passed on to the habsburg empire in 1526 , and in 1635 it was once again turned over to saxony .
prussia annexed the city in 1815 and after world war ii , the city found itself divided .
one side remained in germany and the other side in poland , with the river neisse river separating the two .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an old plan of the city from 1730 the german city continued to be known as görlitz , while the polish city became zgorzelec , autonomous since 1945 .
the two cities were separated as retreating german troops blew up all the bridges across the neisse river .
several weeks later , the river was used as a border between poland and the soviet zone of germany , when leaders from the soviet union , britain , us and france carved up the area . unification and restoration with the re-unification of germany in 1989 and european union enlargement in 2004 , the people of görlitz and zgorzelec reached out to each other in a bid to join their cities culturally and economically .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a view through a window from tower to the market below görlitz was able to restore a lot of its buildings with money provided by an anonymous donor .
the donor 's contribution came to the city each spring with one condition : the money had to be spent on renovation projects .
as a result , görlitz ' old town boasts a lot of well preserved renaissance , gothic and baroque buildings .
the " karstadt-warenhaus , " for example , dates back to about 1912 and was built by architect carl schumann .
today it is a department store - one of europe 's only big department stores preserved in its original style .
another much older building is the " frauenkirche " or church of our lady , dating back to 1494 .
touched by napoleon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renovation in the city was funded by an anonymous donor the " obermarkt , " the main market , had served for hundreds of years as a center for trading salt and grain .
the northern side is lined with baroque houses modeled after similar merchant houses in dresden and leipzig .
number 29 is especially impressive .
it is also known as napoleon house because the french emperor himself allegedly stood on its balcony in 1813 to review his troops .
today the house is home to the tourist information center .
on the other end of the market stands the " dreifaltigkeitkirche , " the trinity church .
it belongs to franciscan friars and was constructed between 1234 and 1245 .
in the 14th and 15th centuries it was extended to its present form , and is now home to some of the most valuable church and art treasures in görlitz .
at 475 meters -lrb- 1,560 feet -rrb- long and 35 meters -lrb- 115 feet -rrb- high , the viaduct bridge is considered one of the largest in germany .
the bridge with its 35 arches was constructed from 1844 to 1847 . it commands and impressive view over the river and links the twin cities . lillian urio send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the generous giver in görlitz every year in spring the small city of görlitz gets a giant cash windfall .

moreover , the court ordered the company hand over all its profits from sales of the chair - as well as its matching table , the ' c4 ' - to rival business knoll international , which has an older claim to the design rights . knoll international sells a stool known as the ' laccio , ' which closely resembles breuer 's 1925 b9 model .
its sole difference is that while the b9 is sheer white , ' laccio ' is raven black . furniture feuds the dispute over the highly lucrative licence for the b9 has been dragging on for years . tecta argues it owns the rights because it signed a contract with the berlin bauhaus archive based on an agreement with breuer 's widow constanze .
in court , however , knoll was able to go one further , producing contracts personally signed by breuer in the 1960s .
the company came into possession of the documents when almost 50 years ago it acquired gavina , an italian company which had bought the rights to the b9 from the designer himself . bildunterschrift : dino gavina has revealed that the contract was considered valid for only ten years at the time of signing , which has prompted tecta to announce it will file an appeal . not the first time if so , it wo n't be the first time .

but there is growing opposition to the proposals . a controversy is gathering pace in germany over proposals put forward by the regional state government of hesse to offer tax breaks to high-paid corporate executives , primarily in the banking sector , at a time when unemployment is at postwar highs . the bundesrat , or upper house of german parliament , on thursday is to examine proposals drawn up by hesse 's conservative state premier , roland koch , to cut the tax rate for super-rich executives to 35 percent from 42 percent for a period of three years . beneficiaries of the tax breaks would be corporate executives grossing more than € 77,000 -lrb- $ 101,000 -rrb- per year or € 151,000 for married bosses .
the aim would be to attract foreign managers and top employees to hesse and its financial centre , frankfurt . bad timing the timing of koch 's initiative could not be worse .
this week , jobless data showed that the number of people out of work in the eurozone 's biggest economy stands at a postwar high of 5.216 million , or 12.6 percent of the workforce . the draft proposals have been dubbed the " ackermann law " after josef ackermann , the head of germany 's biggest bank deutsche bank and the best-paid corporate chief in the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ackermann was also one of the fat cats involved in the high profile mannesmann trial in 2004 along with former mannesmann chairman klaus esser , mannesmann 's former supervisory board chief joachim funk , the former head of the powerful ig metall trade union , klaus zwickel , and two others . they were accused of approving 111.5 million deutsche marks -lrb- $ 71 million -rrb- in bonuses to management board members during the multi-billion-euro takeover of mannesmann by british mobile phone giant vodafone in 2000 .
esser alone pocketed more than € 15 million . all of those involved were cleared of any wrongdoing but the case raised serious questions about the virtual untouchable status of germany 's top executives and the rules governing their money . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no tax breaks for the super rich says hans eichel .
the tax break proposals have run into widespread resistance .
german finance minister hans eichel said : " there will be no tax breaks for the super rich with this government . "
even the liberal fdp party was critical .
" new tax exemptions will neither attract top managers nor create new jobs , " said the fdp 's finance expert carl-ludwig thiele . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de flat tax revolution puts europe on edge in bratislava last week , george w. bush praised slovakia 's new flat tax .

when bauhaus founder walter gropius fitted out the mess hall of the famous architecture college in dessau with the elegant , curved stool back in the 1920s , he launched the career of a design classic . decades later , the humble seat is at the heart of an acrimonious legal tussle . tecta vs. knoll tecta , a company based in the german state of lower saxony , is no longer allowed to sell the tubular steel stool it began marketing in 1982 .
moreover , the court ordered the company hand over all its profits from sales of the chair - as well as its matching table , the ' c4 ' - to rival business knoll international , which has an older claim to the design rights . knoll international sells a stool known as the ' laccio , ' which closely resembles breuer 's 1925 b9 model .
its sole difference is that while the b9 is sheer white , ' laccio ' is raven black . furniture feuds the dispute over the highly lucrative licence for the b9 has been dragging on for years . tecta argues it owns the rights because it signed a contract with the berlin bauhaus archive based on an agreement with breuer 's widow constanze .
in court , however , knoll was able to go one further , producing contracts personally signed by breuer in the 1960s .
the company came into possession of the documents when almost 50 years ago it acquired gavina , an italian company which had bought the rights to the b9 from the designer himself . bildunterschrift : dino gavina has revealed that the contract was considered valid for only ten years at the time of signing , which has prompted tecta to announce it will file an appeal . not the first time if so , it wo n't be the first time .
three years ago , the company won a legal battle with another company , l & c stendal , which manufactured copies of the breuer stool .
in court , l & c stendal argued that a stool is a household object rather than a work of art and therefore not subject to licencing laws .
in its final ruling , the court deemed the stool was indeed a work of art , and upheld the contract between tecta and breuer 's heirs . the battle over breuer one of the most influential designers of the 20th century , breuer both studied and taught at germany 's bauhaus school of architecture and design -lrb- photo -rrb- , which pioneered modern principles , technologies and the application of new materials in both the industrial and fine arts . an early fan of tubular steel , breuer designed a whole range of metal furniture including chairs , tables , stools and cupboards .
breuer considered all of his designs to be essential for the masses and mass production of modern living .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 02.03.2005 winter wellness at german zoos großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a sucker for vitamins sub-zero temperatures in germany have made humans shiver for the past couple of days , but many four-legged creatures in the country 's zoos are also suffering .
that 's why their handlers are pampering them . many people have called in sick in recent weeks because of the flu that 's swept across the country .
at berlin 's zoo , officials are making sure that their animals do n't fall prey to viruses by boosting their immune systems .

but there is growing opposition to the proposals . a controversy is gathering pace in germany over proposals put forward by the regional state government of hesse to offer tax breaks to high-paid corporate executives , primarily in the banking sector , at a time when unemployment is at postwar highs . the bundesrat , or upper house of german parliament , on thursday is to examine proposals drawn up by hesse 's conservative state premier , roland koch , to cut the tax rate for super-rich executives to 35 percent from 42 percent for a period of three years . beneficiaries of the tax breaks would be corporate executives grossing more than € 77,000 -lrb- $ 101,000 -rrb- per year or € 151,000 for married bosses .
the aim would be to attract foreign managers and top employees to hesse and its financial centre , frankfurt . bad timing the timing of koch 's initiative could not be worse .
this week , jobless data showed that the number of people out of work in the eurozone 's biggest economy stands at a postwar high of 5.216 million , or 12.6 percent of the workforce . the draft proposals have been dubbed the " ackermann law " after josef ackermann , the head of germany 's biggest bank deutsche bank and the best-paid corporate chief in the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ackermann was also one of the fat cats involved in the high profile mannesmann trial in 2004 along with former mannesmann chairman klaus esser , mannesmann 's former supervisory board chief joachim funk , the former head of the powerful ig metall trade union , klaus zwickel , and two others . they were accused of approving 111.5 million deutsche marks -lrb- $ 71 million -rrb- in bonuses to management board members during the multi-billion-euro takeover of mannesmann by british mobile phone giant vodafone in 2000 .
esser alone pocketed more than € 15 million . all of those involved were cleared of any wrongdoing but the case raised serious questions about the virtual untouchable status of germany 's top executives and the rules governing their money . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no tax breaks for the super rich says hans eichel .
the tax break proposals have run into widespread resistance .
german finance minister hans eichel said : " there will be no tax breaks for the super rich with this government . "
even the liberal fdp party was critical .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 02.03.2005 design classic lands on scrap heap großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the seat of the problem in a controversial ruling wednesday , a court in düsseldorf barred a company from selling the ' b9 ' chair originally designed by bauhaus architect marcel breuer and ordered it destroy all existing stocks . canteen chairs do n't often get noticed , but the ' b9 ' is a notable exception .
when bauhaus founder walter gropius fitted out the mess hall of the famous architecture college in dessau with the elegant , curved stool back in the 1920s , he launched the career of a design classic . decades later , the humble seat is at the heart of an acrimonious legal tussle . tecta vs. knoll tecta , a company based in the german state of lower saxony , is no longer allowed to sell the tubular steel stool it began marketing in 1982 .
moreover , the court ordered the company hand over all its profits from sales of the chair - as well as its matching table , the ' c4 ' - to rival business knoll international , which has an older claim to the design rights . knoll international sells a stool known as the ' laccio , ' which closely resembles breuer 's 1925 b9 model .
its sole difference is that while the b9 is sheer white , ' laccio ' is raven black . furniture feuds the dispute over the highly lucrative licence for the b9 has been dragging on for years . tecta argues it owns the rights because it signed a contract with the berlin bauhaus archive based on an agreement with breuer 's widow constanze .
in court , however , knoll was able to go one further , producing contracts personally signed by breuer in the 1960s .
the company came into possession of the documents when almost 50 years ago it acquired gavina , an italian company which had bought the rights to the b9 from the designer himself . bildunterschrift : dino gavina has revealed that the contract was considered valid for only ten years at the time of signing , which has prompted tecta to announce it will file an appeal . not the first time if so , it wo n't be the first time .
three years ago , the company won a legal battle with another company , l & c stendal , which manufactured copies of the breuer stool .
in court , l & c stendal argued that a stool is a household object rather than a work of art and therefore not subject to licencing laws .

but there is growing opposition to the proposals . a controversy is gathering pace in germany over proposals put forward by the regional state government of hesse to offer tax breaks to high-paid corporate executives , primarily in the banking sector , at a time when unemployment is at postwar highs . the bundesrat , or upper house of german parliament , on thursday is to examine proposals drawn up by hesse 's conservative state premier , roland koch , to cut the tax rate for super-rich executives to 35 percent from 42 percent for a period of three years . beneficiaries of the tax breaks would be corporate executives grossing more than € 77,000 -lrb- $ 101,000 -rrb- per year or € 151,000 for married bosses .
the aim would be to attract foreign managers and top employees to hesse and its financial centre , frankfurt . bad timing the timing of koch 's initiative could not be worse .
this week , jobless data showed that the number of people out of work in the eurozone 's biggest economy stands at a postwar high of 5.216 million , or 12.6 percent of the workforce . the draft proposals have been dubbed the " ackermann law " after josef ackermann , the head of germany 's biggest bank deutsche bank and the best-paid corporate chief in the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ackermann was also one of the fat cats involved in the high profile mannesmann trial in 2004 along with former mannesmann chairman klaus esser , mannesmann 's former supervisory board chief joachim funk , the former head of the powerful ig metall trade union , klaus zwickel , and two others . they were accused of approving 111.5 million deutsche marks -lrb- $ 71 million -rrb- in bonuses to management board members during the multi-billion-euro takeover of mannesmann by british mobile phone giant vodafone in 2000 .
esser alone pocketed more than € 15 million . all of those involved were cleared of any wrongdoing but the case raised serious questions about the virtual untouchable status of germany 's top executives and the rules governing their money . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no tax breaks for the super rich says hans eichel .
the tax break proposals have run into widespread resistance .
german finance minister hans eichel said : " there will be no tax breaks for the super rich with this government . "
even the liberal fdp party was critical .
" new tax exemptions will neither attract top managers nor create new jobs , " said the fdp 's finance expert carl-ludwig thiele . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de flat tax revolution puts europe on edge in bratislava last week , george w. bush praised slovakia 's new flat tax .

in tv ads , most people are young and beautiful .
but this is changing in germany and elsewhere in europe as businesses discover that seniors have lots of money they 'd prefer to spend on products created for their needs . in the reality portrayed by tv advertisers , a 30-year-old man can afford to buy the latest mercedes-benz , only young people drink € 15 -lrb- $ 20 -rrb- bottles of champagne and even anti-wrinkle cream is applied by beautiful women who do n't look a day over 30 .
thus , when older people go shopping they often feel they 've been overlooked . eve fear , 65 , does n't feel tempted to buy anything when she goes to fashionable stores at home in birmingham in britain , she says .
young women look down at her from the large posters as if to say : " this is not for you , you 're too old for that . " " certainly we are not catered for within the fashion world and lots of older people do have a lot of money to spend , " eve fear said .
" there 's certainly still poverty amongst older people in britain but they like their holidays .
that kind of thing can all affect the economy . " for too long , business has only cared about the 14- 49 year olds , eve fear says .
but the politicians , businesspeople and seniors who met recently for an international conference in bonn to discuss seniors ' needs for new products determined that the future may just be in consumers beyond 50 , an ever larger part of society in industrialized countries . taking advantage of demographic change " in the year 2040 a third of the german citizens will be older than 60 , " birgit fischer , minister for family and seniors in the german state of north rhine-westphalia pointed out .
" there are already cities and communities where we have more 70- than seven-year olds .

in tv ads , most people are young and beautiful .
but this is changing in germany and elsewhere in europe as businesses discover that seniors have lots of money they 'd prefer to spend on products created for their needs . in the reality portrayed by tv advertisers , a 30-year-old man can afford to buy the latest mercedes-benz , only young people drink € 15 -lrb- $ 20 -rrb- bottles of champagne and even anti-wrinkle cream is applied by beautiful women who do n't look a day over 30 .
thus , when older people go shopping they often feel they 've been overlooked . eve fear , 65 , does n't feel tempted to buy anything when she goes to fashionable stores at home in birmingham in britain , she says .
young women look down at her from the large posters as if to say : " this is not for you , you 're too old for that . " " certainly we are not catered for within the fashion world and lots of older people do have a lot of money to spend , " eve fear said .
" there 's certainly still poverty amongst older people in britain but they like their holidays .
that kind of thing can all affect the economy . " for too long , business has only cared about the 14- 49 year olds , eve fear says .
but the politicians , businesspeople and seniors who met recently for an international conference in bonn to discuss seniors ' needs for new products determined that the future may just be in consumers beyond 50 , an ever larger part of society in industrialized countries . taking advantage of demographic change " in the year 2040 a third of the german citizens will be older than 60 , " birgit fischer , minister for family and seniors in the german state of north rhine-westphalia pointed out .
" there are already cities and communities where we have more 70- than seven-year olds .
because of that we need another perspective on the older generation .
economic growth and opportunities for society depend on that . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 've got the money still , political and economic views of seniors are often one-sided in germany , where older people are largely seen as an expense .
it 's true that the growing number of old people will have to rely on a decreasing number of younger people to finance old-age pensions .
additionally , health-care costs increase as society ages .
but by focusing only on problems , society risks missing the opportunities that " demographic change " offers . take spending power , for instance .
the spending capacity of germany 's seniors alone is € 90 billion - the gross domestic product of venezuela .
and people over 50 own half of germany 's wealth , according to a study by allensbach demographic institute .
of course , some do only live off € 400 a month , a minimum to exist .
but generally older people live much more comfortably than , say , many single mothers .
on average , a pensioner in a two-person household has € 1,600 to spend each month , about € 100 more than a member of a family with children under 17 .

children of single parents and immigrant families are especially threatened . the report , released by the united nations children 's fund -lrb- unicef -rrb- on tuesday , found that in three quarters of the richest countries in the world child poverty has risen sometimes dramatically over the last 10 years .
it also said child poverty was on the increase because efforts of governments in the 26 most industrialized countries has waned in the past decades . the marked increase in child poverty in rich countries comes as a surprise and shatters popular perceptions that recent increases in wealth in the first world would be evenly spread among all people in society , according to the report 's authors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unicef logo peter adamson from unicef said that western governments appear to have dropped former ideals of creating equal living standards and argues that birth circumstances should not determine the life-time opportunities of children today .

but the people of both towns are already thinking in terms of one city . founded around 1200 , görlitz became the capital of the duchy of görlitz in 1377 .
in those days it was an important cloth-weaving and trade center .
the city was passed on to the habsburg empire in 1526 , and in 1635 it was once again turned over to saxony .
prussia annexed the city in 1815 and after world war ii , the city found itself divided .
one side remained in germany and the other side in poland , with the river neisse river separating the two .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an old plan of the city from 1730 the german city continued to be known as görlitz , while the polish city became zgorzelec , autonomous since 1945 .
the two cities were separated as retreating german troops blew up all the bridges across the neisse river .
several weeks later , the river was used as a border between poland and the soviet zone of germany , when leaders from the soviet union , britain , us and france carved up the area . unification and restoration with the re-unification of germany in 1989 and european union enlargement in 2004 , the people of görlitz and zgorzelec reached out to each other in a bid to join their cities culturally and economically .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a view through a window from tower to the market below görlitz was able to restore a lot of its buildings with money provided by an anonymous donor .
the donor 's contribution came to the city each spring with one condition : the money had to be spent on renovation projects .
as a result , görlitz ' old town boasts a lot of well preserved renaissance , gothic and baroque buildings .
the " karstadt-warenhaus , " for example , dates back to about 1912 and was built by architect carl schumann .
today it is a department store - one of europe 's only big department stores preserved in its original style .
another much older building is the " frauenkirche " or church of our lady , dating back to 1494 .
touched by napoleon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renovation in the city was funded by an anonymous donor the " obermarkt , " the main market , had served for hundreds of years as a center for trading salt and grain .
the northern side is lined with baroque houses modeled after similar merchant houses in dresden and leipzig .
number 29 is especially impressive .
it is also known as napoleon house because the french emperor himself allegedly stood on its balcony in 1813 to review his troops .
today the house is home to the tourist information center .
on the other end of the market stands the " dreifaltigkeitkirche , " the trinity church .
it belongs to franciscan friars and was constructed between 1234 and 1245 .
in the 14th and 15th centuries it was extended to its present form , and is now home to some of the most valuable church and art treasures in görlitz .
at 475 meters -lrb- 1,560 feet -rrb- long and 35 meters -lrb- 115 feet -rrb- high , the viaduct bridge is considered one of the largest in germany .
the bridge with its 35 arches was constructed from 1844 to 1847 . it commands and impressive view over the river and links the twin cities . lillian urio send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the generous giver in görlitz every year in spring the small city of görlitz gets a giant cash windfall .

but the people of both towns are already thinking in terms of one city . founded around 1200 , görlitz became the capital of the duchy of görlitz in 1377 .
in those days it was an important cloth-weaving and trade center .
the city was passed on to the habsburg empire in 1526 , and in 1635 it was once again turned over to saxony .
prussia annexed the city in 1815 and after world war ii , the city found itself divided .
one side remained in germany and the other side in poland , with the river neisse river separating the two .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an old plan of the city from 1730 the german city continued to be known as görlitz , while the polish city became zgorzelec , autonomous since 1945 .
the two cities were separated as retreating german troops blew up all the bridges across the neisse river .
several weeks later , the river was used as a border between poland and the soviet zone of germany , when leaders from the soviet union , britain , us and france carved up the area . unification and restoration with the re-unification of germany in 1989 and european union enlargement in 2004 , the people of görlitz and zgorzelec reached out to each other in a bid to join their cities culturally and economically .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a view through a window from tower to the market below görlitz was able to restore a lot of its buildings with money provided by an anonymous donor .
the donor 's contribution came to the city each spring with one condition : the money had to be spent on renovation projects .
as a result , görlitz ' old town boasts a lot of well preserved renaissance , gothic and baroque buildings .
the " karstadt-warenhaus , " for example , dates back to about 1912 and was built by architect carl schumann .
today it is a department store - one of europe 's only big department stores preserved in its original style .
another much older building is the " frauenkirche " or church of our lady , dating back to 1494 .
touched by napoleon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renovation in the city was funded by an anonymous donor the " obermarkt , " the main market , had served for hundreds of years as a center for trading salt and grain .
the northern side is lined with baroque houses modeled after similar merchant houses in dresden and leipzig .
number 29 is especially impressive .
it is also known as napoleon house because the french emperor himself allegedly stood on its balcony in 1813 to review his troops .
today the house is home to the tourist information center .
on the other end of the market stands the " dreifaltigkeitkirche , " the trinity church .
it belongs to franciscan friars and was constructed between 1234 and 1245 .
in the 14th and 15th centuries it was extended to its present form , and is now home to some of the most valuable church and art treasures in görlitz .
at 475 meters -lrb- 1,560 feet -rrb- long and 35 meters -lrb- 115 feet -rrb- high , the viaduct bridge is considered one of the largest in germany .
the bridge with its 35 arches was constructed from 1844 to 1847 . it commands and impressive view over the river and links the twin cities . lillian urio send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the generous giver in görlitz every year in spring the small city of görlitz gets a giant cash windfall .

" is it art or nonsense ?
to contemplate the answer to this question , people from all over the world accumulate here once every five years for three months to experience the world 's most important modern art show : documenta . the city transforms itself overnight into a busy metropolis , comparable to london or new york .
artists like picasso , de maria , christo and warhol have displayed here works here . protestant roots and a divine overseer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wilhelmshöhe castle despite having a hand in the modern art scene , kassel is not a new city .
it dates back to the 16th century , when it was regarded as the center of german protestantism . the protestant church shaped the city from the beginning , from both inside and out , and strong fortifications were built in order to fend off catholic invaders . during world war two , 90 percent of the city center was destroyed by allied bombs and some 10,000 civilians lost their lives .
in the aftermath , people worked relentlessly to reconstruct their city .
the restoration was so successful that kassel was even considered as a potential new capital for west germany before losing out to bonn . many damaged buildings and castles were restored in their original style after the war and kassel 's residents are proud of their 17th and 18th century castles of wilhelmshöhe , wilhelmstal , löwenburg and karlsruhe . kassel 's most important landmark is the 9 meter -lrb- 30 foot -rrb- tall statue of hercules overlooking the city form a pedestal at the zenith of a mountain .
the palace of wilhelmshöhe , built in 1785 by wilhelm ix , lies majestically below .
it was here that napoleon iii was kept as a prisoner of war after having lost the war of 1870-71 . fairy tale brothers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the grimm memorial kassel lies along germany 's romantic sounding " fairy tale road , " which stretches from hanau to bremen .
it was in kassel that the brothers wilhelm and jakob grimm compiled most of their world famous collection of fairy tales : snow white , little red riding hood , frau holle and many more . known the world over , these fairy tales have been translated into 140 different languages and are known across the globe .
one can admire the works of the grimm brothers in the museum at palais bellevue . another must-see museum in kassel is the hessian state museum , which contains works by rembrandt , rubens and other masters . if performing arts are more your thing , you can expect to find a diverse range of everything from classical to experimental productions in the world of opera , drama and choreographic arts .
and with a 500-year tradition to its name , kassel 's orchestra is nearly as old as the city itself . sunanda rao-erdem send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de kassel breaks ground for documenta expo despite uncertain funding , preparations for the international art expo documenta 12 are now underway in the city of kassel .

it was first mentioned in a document of 1031 as " bruno 's wiek " or brunesguik .
legend has it that the brothers bruno and dankward , both dukes of saxony , started building the " villa brunesguik -lrb- brunsweik -rrb- on a site of a former saxon village which had supposedly been laid waste by emperor charlemagne . duke bruno founded the " weik " -lrb- a resting place for traveling merchants -rrb- on the right bank of the oker river .
the city was located at the junction of major medieval trade routes and thanks to the oker river , its water routes stretched to the city of bremen as well to the north sea . a member of the hanseatic league , braunschweig was also the main base for saxon merchants .
it enjoyed major trade ties with the important cities of northern europe . henry the lion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : burgplatz braunschweig is known as the city of henry the lion .
in 1160 henry the lion , the duke of saxony and bavaria , made braunschweig the seat of his court and transformed it into a political and cultural centre of the duchy of saxony . today a lion statue , which is also the city ’ s emblem , stands at the ‘ burgplatz ’ in the heart of the city .
it symbolizes impressive strength and secular as well as ecclesiastical power . the city of about 250,000 residents is situated about 60 kilometers east of the capital of hanover in the state of lower saxony .
the cityscape is still largely dictated by its earlier mediaeval structure .
however , signs of modernity are also visible , such as the recent addition of attractive glass-roofed shopping passages and a pedestrian zone at the traditional marketplace . traces of the past can be seen in the dankwarderode castle , built in the romanesque style , surrounded by several half-timbered houses that survived allied bombings in world war two .
before the war braunschweig had the largest homogeneous group of half-timbered buildings in germany . other historic gems include the medieval burgplatz with the 12th century romanesque cathedral of st. blasius and the burg dankwarderode , a castle containing a collection of medieval art treasures and precious reliquaries that is unparalleled in lower saxony . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : staatstheater braunschweig in 1829 , the state theater of braunschweig , now more than 300 years old , hosted the premiere of a true masterpiece of german literature : the first part of goethe ’ s " faust . "
before that in 1772 , gotthold ephraim lessing ’ s tragedy " emilia galotti " opened in the same theater .
the theater today focuses on four main areas covering music , drama and ballet and also manages the state orchestra and the children ’ s and young people ’ s theater . home to science and metal works braunschweig is also a major center for science .
the oldest technical university in germany , the technical university carolo wilhelmina , was founded as the collegium carolinum , in 1745 .
today braunschweig boasts the largest numbers of scientists among german cities . even the federal ministry of consumer protection , food and agriculture and the federal government research institute responsible for supervision of the aviation industry , have their headquarters here . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rizzi-house was designed by us pop artist james rizzi the city is also a leading german market for sugar products and is famous for its sausages , asparagus , and gingerbread .
away from its famed goodies , braunschweig boasts a rail network and an airport and its chief industry centers around metal works .
machinery , motor vehicles , office and calculating machines , and pianos are manufactured here .
most recently , publishing and electronics have also emerged as forces to reckon in the city 's economy . city 's image sullied by hitler link but , the city 's industrious image is also tarnished by a stain . braunschweig achieved inglorious fame by making adolf hitler , the nazi dictator , a german citizen , allowing him to run as a candidate for the german reichstag and become leader of the state .
hitler was employed by the brunswick state government in february 1932 and thereby got german citizenship . lillian urio -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world 's most expensive book makes rare appearance it 's so fragile that it 's displayed for only six weeks per year and the rare gem - prince henry the lion 's highly ornate 12th century book of holy gospels - can now be viewed by the public until march 18 .

since then , it has undergone continual transformation , from being a darling of the prussian kings to facing the step-motherly treatment of the gdr before being reconstructed after the german reunification . the name of potsdam was first recorded in 993 , though it was then called " potztumpimi . "
it gained importance much later when king friedrich willhelm , also known as the " the great elector , " declared potsdam as his second residence next to berlin in the year 1660 . he commissioned the construction of the sanssouci castle , built in dutch style and surrounding by a park .
in the following decades , successive prussian emperors added castles and parks and , in 1990 , the whole area was added to the unesco world heritage list . melting pot at the heart of europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new hans otto theater opened in 2006 during the 18th century , potsdam life centered around splendor and belle esprit .
famous visitors from all over europe gathered here .
some of them , like french huguenots or jews , came as religious refugees .
at one point , one third of the inhabitants were french .
others , like the dutch , flemish and swiss were called in especially for their craftsmanship . for the dutch immigrants , a settlement of 134 red brick houses was built .
the mostly three-storey houses have roofs in typical dutch style .
this district , known as the " holländisches viertel , " is a popular tourist destination . in the 19th century , members of a russian military choir came to potsdam to entertain the troops stationed there and in 1826 frederick william ii ordered the construction of a new neighborhood for these soldiers .
this " russian town " was named alexandrowka after the tsarina .
in total 12 picturesque wooden houses were built .
a small russian-orthodox chapel , the alexander-newski kirche was added later . after the world war two , potsdam witnessed a significant change in population .
many residents had fled due to the war and the invading soviet troops .
the war had also damaged large parts of the historical architecture .
despites protests , however , the city was redesigned according to socialist architectural style instead of restoring the old buildings to their original form . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : babelsberg filmstudios after the reunification of germany , the new and freely elected city council decided to create a historical center .
today , potsdam is one of the few former east german cities that people want to move to , instead of away from .
some 30,000 new residents have settled there within the past 10 years . lights , camera , action ! another attraction in potsdam is the " filmpark babelsberg , " which is still rewarding for film enthusiasts today .
some of germany 's most famous films were created here , including the 1927 masterpiece " metropolis " and the 1930 film " the blue angel , " which catapulted marlene dietrich to international stardom . the film museum onsite traces the history of german motion pictures .
film sets from old films , including the submarine u-boat can be admired .

in tv ads , most people are young and beautiful .
but this is changing in germany and elsewhere in europe as businesses discover that seniors have lots of money they 'd prefer to spend on products created for their needs . in the reality portrayed by tv advertisers , a 30-year-old man can afford to buy the latest mercedes-benz , only young people drink € 15 -lrb- $ 20 -rrb- bottles of champagne and even anti-wrinkle cream is applied by beautiful women who do n't look a day over 30 .
thus , when older people go shopping they often feel they 've been overlooked . eve fear , 65 , does n't feel tempted to buy anything when she goes to fashionable stores at home in birmingham in britain , she says .
young women look down at her from the large posters as if to say : " this is not for you , you 're too old for that . " " certainly we are not catered for within the fashion world and lots of older people do have a lot of money to spend , " eve fear said .
" there 's certainly still poverty amongst older people in britain but they like their holidays .
that kind of thing can all affect the economy . " for too long , business has only cared about the 14- 49 year olds , eve fear says .
but the politicians , businesspeople and seniors who met recently for an international conference in bonn to discuss seniors ' needs for new products determined that the future may just be in consumers beyond 50 , an ever larger part of society in industrialized countries . taking advantage of demographic change " in the year 2040 a third of the german citizens will be older than 60 , " birgit fischer , minister for family and seniors in the german state of north rhine-westphalia pointed out .
" there are already cities and communities where we have more 70- than seven-year olds .
because of that we need another perspective on the older generation .
economic growth and opportunities for society depend on that . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 've got the money still , political and economic views of seniors are often one-sided in germany , where older people are largely seen as an expense .
it 's true that the growing number of old people will have to rely on a decreasing number of younger people to finance old-age pensions .
additionally , health-care costs increase as society ages .
but by focusing only on problems , society risks missing the opportunities that " demographic change " offers . take spending power , for instance .
the spending capacity of germany 's seniors alone is € 90 billion - the gross domestic product of venezuela .
and people over 50 own half of germany 's wealth , according to a study by allensbach demographic institute .
of course , some do only live off € 400 a month , a minimum to exist .
but generally older people live much more comfortably than , say , many single mothers .
on average , a pensioner in a two-person household has € 1,600 to spend each month , about € 100 more than a member of a family with children under 17 .
a young , single mother with one child lives off only € 800 monthly on average . and older people have the time to spend their money , too . time and money on their hands " the impression is that older people are not interesting for the market because they often think they are old so they do n't spend a lot of money , they do n't have a lot of activities , " says the senior citizen 's representative in the dutch city of maastricht , salden stella .
but stella says the opposite is true .
" we see now that older people are very active . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who says seniors are n't active ?
as european business discovers seniors as a target group , they 're changing their tactics .
even the youth-obsessed advertising industry has begun trying to attract the older customers ; the " best agers " and " 50plus " are the heroes of the " silver economy . "
big companies have started employing so-called senior scouts , older people who test particular products in supermarkets for seniors .
can a coffee package be opened easily without agile young fingers ?
are the keys of a mobile phone big enough to call the doctor in an emergency ? " the sale of cars could be increased by 5 to 8 percent if the industry would offer cars that are senior-compatible , if they would care for the aged as a consumer group , " says klaus gretschmann of the council of the european union . " these are restraints that we have to remove and if we erase them the whole seniors sector will contribute to european economic growth .

visitors will quickly feel transported back in time , especially since cars are prohibited in the city 's walled old quarters . after stepping through the massive " holsentor " -lrb- holsten gate -rrb- , the visitor is surrounded by well-preserved gable houses built with red bricks and decorated with clinkers .
the city 's popular shopping streets are lined with town houses from the gothic , renaissance , baroque and classic periods .
the streets are still paved with cobblestones , and alleys and courtyards branch off in all directions , beckoning to be explored . streets within streets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas mann in front of the buddenbrook house in lübeck many of the neighborhoods around the old city used to be lübeck 's artisan and craftsmen quarters , where the hand workers and small tradesmen lived and worked .
a housing shortage hit the town in the middle ages , and lübeck needed a creative solution to accommodate the growing numbers of workers . the solution was to create streets within streets .
city planners used the narrow passageways between existing buildings as mini-streets , where they built one- or two-story homes .
a hundred of these hidden , back-alley streets still exist .
today they have a cozy , dollhouse kind of charm . many of germany 's historical city centers were bombed during world war two and lübeck was no exception .
the gothic st. marienkirche , germany 's third largest church , was burned down completely .
when the building went up in flames , the church bell fell on the stone floor and melted under the extreme heat . the melted bell still remains on the ground , a silent reminder of those who lost their lives during the war . literary legends bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cafe niederegger in lübeck since 1806 lübeck is intricately connected to the life of the mann family , whose most famous son , thomas mann , received the nobel prize for literature .
his novel " buddenbrooks " is set in lübeck and those who have read it will easily fall into the footsteps of the famous characters when they walk through the city . in addition to literature , the people of lübeck love to cultivate their cultural traditions .
the city beckons visitors with its twenty museums and galleries and innumerable exhibitions .
in the evenings there are poetry readings at the " buddenbrook " house .
artists like dave brubeck , juliette gréco and anne sophie mutter have all performed in lübeck ’ s modern music and congress hall .
the acoustics of the 2,000-seat concert hall are comparable to those of carnegie hall in new york . the local residents are proud of what their small city offers : " kiel may be the state capital , but we are the cultural capital , " they often boast . no trip to lübeck is complete without tasting the city 's marzipan , an almond and sugar paste that has delighted bon vivants for centuries .
there are many stories about the origin of this specialty .

" is it art or nonsense ?
to contemplate the answer to this question , people from all over the world accumulate here once every five years for three months to experience the world 's most important modern art show : documenta . the city transforms itself overnight into a busy metropolis , comparable to london or new york .
artists like picasso , de maria , christo and warhol have displayed here works here . protestant roots and a divine overseer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wilhelmshöhe castle despite having a hand in the modern art scene , kassel is not a new city .
it dates back to the 16th century , when it was regarded as the center of german protestantism . the protestant church shaped the city from the beginning , from both inside and out , and strong fortifications were built in order to fend off catholic invaders . during world war two , 90 percent of the city center was destroyed by allied bombs and some 10,000 civilians lost their lives .
in the aftermath , people worked relentlessly to reconstruct their city .
the restoration was so successful that kassel was even considered as a potential new capital for west germany before losing out to bonn . many damaged buildings and castles were restored in their original style after the war and kassel 's residents are proud of their 17th and 18th century castles of wilhelmshöhe , wilhelmstal , löwenburg and karlsruhe . kassel 's most important landmark is the 9 meter -lrb- 30 foot -rrb- tall statue of hercules overlooking the city form a pedestal at the zenith of a mountain .

it was in kassel that the brothers wilhelm and jakob grimm compiled most of their world famous collection of fairy tales : snow white , little red riding hood , frau holle and many more . known the world over , these fairy tales have been translated into 140 different languages and are known across the globe .
one can admire the works of the grimm brothers in the museum at palais bellevue . another must-see museum in kassel is the hessian state museum , which contains works by rembrandt , rubens and other masters . if performing arts are more your thing , you can expect to find a diverse range of everything from classical to experimental productions in the world of opera , drama and choreographic arts .

dangerous drugs are being sold without prescription in a virtual marketplace that is difficult to control , says the international narcotics control board .
in its annual report , it says that 90 % of online drugs sales take place without a medical prescription .
legal suppliers were fuelling the trade , it says , by providing unlicensed internet pharmacies with drugs .
the incb warn the web is increasingly a source of illicit drugs for children offering access which is not restricted by age .
" the illicit trade over the internet has been identified as one of the major sources for prescription medicines abused by children and adolescents in certain countries such as the united states , " it says .
mind-altering drugs the us , it says , remains the largest market in the world for illegal drugs with 8.2 % of its population of 293 million people using them .
the most common sales are of mind-altering substances such as amphetamines .
