the move is part of a nationwide crackdown on neo-nazi groups and organizations - two of which were also banned this week . the ruling now upheld by germany 's highest administrative court goes back to a case brought against regener -lrb- photo below -rrb- , who was handed a prison sentence for inciting racial hatred and spreading nazi propaganda . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael regener prosecutions have often been brought against individuals in germany under laws banning nazi propaganda and the incitement of public unrest .
but this was the first time a collective prosecution of this kind had been brought against a music group .
jürgen lampe , spokesman for the federal prosecutor , said the band was planning what they called an " aryan revolution " and was operating in a highly secretive manner . " the primary goal of this band was to commit crimes , " he said .
" its organizational structure bears the hallmarks of organized crime . " court : racism sole purpose of band the supreme administrative court said that landser was founded solely to produce and distribute racist songs and nazi ideology .
inflammatory lyrics such as " turks and commies and all that scum will soon be forever gone " from a song called " the reich will be back , " it said , were clearly meant to incite hatred and violence against foreigners and political opponents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo-nazis at a 2000 demonstration the band did n't make public appearances and for a long time its members had remained unknown .
experts have long been warning that neo-nazi organizations are spreading their hate messages through music distributed often for free especially among younger germans at schools .
a network of so-called " comradeships " has been established primarily in eastern germany fostering a cult of violence and hatred . latent feelings frank jantzen , an expert on the right-wing scene here , said this ideology often blends with latent racism among the population at large . " i fear this structural link between every-day racism and a perpetrator image cherished by rightist youths is the core problem , " he said .
" no-one has so far been able to sever this link which has fostered an extreme right-wing scene .
young neo-nazis are enmeshed in a culture of blood and violence that is promoted also through music and eventually seeks a vent .
democratic forces in germany are simply at a loss to effectively counter an ideology of dumb violence that is infesting more and more young minds . " in an effort to stop rightist violence - which has been rising in eastern germany again last year - authorities banned two more neo-nazi groups in the region on thursday .
they were among the most active of the " comradeships " in and around berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in raids on several homes police discovered neo-nazi pamphlets and t-shirts glorifying former nazi leaders as heroes and martyrs . earlier in the week , a group of young neo-nazis in brandenburg were classified as terrorists by a court in potsdam which handed down jail sentences to the members for attacking and burning immigrant-owned shops and fast food outlets . uwe hessler -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany moves to curb neo-nazi protests germany 's lower house of parliament friday voted by a large majority to tighten the right of assembly , thus making it easier in future to ban neo-nazi demonstrations at historic landmarks .

he asked doctors to build him a new one , which they did in a berlin clinic . however , doctors left the first reconstruction attached , just to make sure the new one took and was properly supplied with blood .
suddenly , gruber was the proud owner of two willies .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 12.03.2005 germany cracks down on neo-nazi music großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still sold on the black market germany 's supreme administrative court has ruled that a neo-nazi rock group that spread racial hatred was a criminal organization , upholding a first such statement in germany against a music band . the court also upheld a three and a half year prison sentence against the lead singer of the band , michael regener - argueing his lyrics would incite public hatred against foreigners and minorities in germany .
the move is part of a nationwide crackdown on neo-nazi groups and organizations - two of which were also banned this week . the ruling now upheld by germany 's highest administrative court goes back to a case brought against regener -lrb- photo below -rrb- , who was handed a prison sentence for inciting racial hatred and spreading nazi propaganda . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael regener prosecutions have often been brought against individuals in germany under laws banning nazi propaganda and the incitement of public unrest .
but this was the first time a collective prosecution of this kind had been brought against a music group .
jürgen lampe , spokesman for the federal prosecutor , said the band was planning what they called an " aryan revolution " and was operating in a highly secretive manner . " the primary goal of this band was to commit crimes , " he said .
" its organizational structure bears the hallmarks of organized crime . " court : racism sole purpose of band the supreme administrative court said that landser was founded solely to produce and distribute racist songs and nazi ideology .
inflammatory lyrics such as " turks and commies and all that scum will soon be forever gone " from a song called " the reich will be back , " it said , were clearly meant to incite hatred and violence against foreigners and political opponents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo-nazis at a 2000 demonstration the band did n't make public appearances and for a long time its members had remained unknown .
experts have long been warning that neo-nazi organizations are spreading their hate messages through music distributed often for free especially among younger germans at schools .
a network of so-called " comradeships " has been established primarily in eastern germany fostering a cult of violence and hatred . latent feelings frank jantzen , an expert on the right-wing scene here , said this ideology often blends with latent racism among the population at large . " i fear this structural link between every-day racism and a perpetrator image cherished by rightist youths is the core problem , " he said .
" no-one has so far been able to sever this link which has fostered an extreme right-wing scene .

he lost the penis he was born with in the smashup , but thanks to modern science doctors were able to keep him from living the life of a monk . they reconstructed the organ using a mixture of skin , bone and other tissues from his own body and from all accounts , it was a smashing success .
gruber even fathered a child with his wife , bianca , using the new appendage . but gruber began complaining that the prosthetic was frequently infected and it became almost impossible for he and his wife to have sex .
he asked doctors to build him a new one , which they did in a berlin clinic . however , doctors left the first reconstruction attached , just to make sure the new one took and was properly supplied with blood .
suddenly , gruber was the proud owner of two willies .
one might think he 'd be the envy of every male on the planet . but when wife bianca got a look at the duo , she packed her backs and left , taking son etienne with her . " i 've got two penises , but no wife , but i am hoping when i get rid of the one of the penises i will get her back , " gruber said from his hospital bed . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the best of " from the fringe " it 's the best of the weird , wonderful and wonderfully quirky from around germany .

its legal successor , the " deutsche dienststelle , " still works to come to terms with world war ii 's consequences . the information office is a world war ii relict .
founded just days before the war started , on aug .
26 , 1939 , the wehrmacht agency 's tasks were ostensibly humanitarian : the geneva convention in 1929 required the signatories to keep an account of prisoners in the event of war and to inform the red cross .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german army in prague , 1939 first of all though , the information office helped the wehrmacht to keep tabs on its own soldiers .
the agency documented every instance of german soldiers falling ill , suffering injuries or going missing .
when soldiers died , it notified the relatives .
besides these humanitarian aspects , the office was responsible , above all , for keeping track of troop numbers .
after world war ii , the us army wanted to destroy the wehrmacht archive out of fear that germany could use it to rebuild its army .
but the french blocked the move , arguing that the archive could help them free frenchmen conscripted by the wehrmacht from russian prisoner-of-war camps .
the allies agreed in 1946 that the french should be in charge of the information office , and it moved to the french sector if berlin .
responding to history in 1949 , britain transferred its files on german prisoners of war to west germany .
france handed over its files in 1952 , and the united states did so in 1962 .
after german unification in 1990 , the information office verified claims pensions for former wehrmacht members from east germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the geneva convention required signatories to inform the red cross of prisoners sixty years after the end of the war , the office continues to deal with its consequences .
since the collapse of the eastern bloc , former soviet archives that can shed light on the fate of missing soldiers have become accessible .
for years in eastern europe individual soldiers ' graves have been dug up and shifted to collective graves .
the information office notifies relatives of the changes and updates its index of war graves .
all told , the information office has over 45 tons of files that fill rooms and rooms of shelves with more than 10 million individual notes .
still , the fates of innumerable soldiers are still waiting to be unravelled .
alive archives " we are possibly the only agency that has worked constantly since its establishment in 1939 until today , " peter gerhardt , deputy director of the deutsche dienststelle , also called the information office , said during a recent conversation in his office in a former ammunition factory in northern berlin .
oil paintings showing german navy warships hang on the walls .
gerhardt has been working for the enquiry office for more than 40 years .
he got his start as an intern in the navy 's archive .
" the archives are alive , " gerhardt said .
" we 're sitting in the so-called central card index , in which 18 million soldiers are filed alphabetically , one card per soldier .
" the central card index is the heart of the information office , " he said .
each tracing request starts here and refers to other cards .
office employees keep the cards up to date by making handwritten notes on them when authorities or relatives request traces .
genealogical searches bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the collapse of the eastern bloc led to new cases for the information office over the past four years , the number of inquiries from abroad has grown as the children of occupation soldiers hunt for their fathers .
" often they do n't know more about their fathers than the forename , sometimes the rank , possibly his hometown , " gerhardt said .
" in such a case , the investigation is downright criminological .
processing time can take between six and 12 months . "
the information office gets 10-15 tracing requests each month , gerhardt said .
they come from norway , denmark , the netherlands , belgium and france , countries formerly occupied by germany .
but tracing requests have never come from italy or eastern europe .
" i spoke to an italian camera team recently , " he said .

after world war ii , the us army wanted to destroy the wehrmacht archive out of fear that germany could use it to rebuild its army .

the move is part of a nationwide crackdown on neo-nazi groups and organizations - two of which were also banned this week . the ruling now upheld by germany 's highest administrative court goes back to a case brought against regener -lrb- photo below -rrb- , who was handed a prison sentence for inciting racial hatred and spreading nazi propaganda . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael regener prosecutions have often been brought against individuals in germany under laws banning nazi propaganda and the incitement of public unrest .
but this was the first time a collective prosecution of this kind had been brought against a music group .
jürgen lampe , spokesman for the federal prosecutor , said the band was planning what they called an " aryan revolution " and was operating in a highly secretive manner . " the primary goal of this band was to commit crimes , " he said .
" its organizational structure bears the hallmarks of organized crime . " court : racism sole purpose of band the supreme administrative court said that landser was founded solely to produce and distribute racist songs and nazi ideology .
inflammatory lyrics such as " turks and commies and all that scum will soon be forever gone " from a song called " the reich will be back , " it said , were clearly meant to incite hatred and violence against foreigners and political opponents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo-nazis at a 2000 demonstration the band did n't make public appearances and for a long time its members had remained unknown .
experts have long been warning that neo-nazi organizations are spreading their hate messages through music distributed often for free especially among younger germans at schools .
a network of so-called " comradeships " has been established primarily in eastern germany fostering a cult of violence and hatred . latent feelings frank jantzen , an expert on the right-wing scene here , said this ideology often blends with latent racism among the population at large . " i fear this structural link between every-day racism and a perpetrator image cherished by rightist youths is the core problem , " he said .
" no-one has so far been able to sever this link which has fostered an extreme right-wing scene .
young neo-nazis are enmeshed in a culture of blood and violence that is promoted also through music and eventually seeks a vent .
democratic forces in germany are simply at a loss to effectively counter an ideology of dumb violence that is infesting more and more young minds . " in an effort to stop rightist violence - which has been rising in eastern germany again last year - authorities banned two more neo-nazi groups in the region on thursday .
they were among the most active of the " comradeships " in and around berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in raids on several homes police discovered neo-nazi pamphlets and t-shirts glorifying former nazi leaders as heroes and martyrs . earlier in the week , a group of young neo-nazis in brandenburg were classified as terrorists by a court in potsdam which handed down jail sentences to the members for attacking and burning immigrant-owned shops and fast food outlets . uwe hessler -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany moves to curb neo-nazi protests germany 's lower house of parliament friday voted by a large majority to tighten the right of assembly , thus making it easier in future to ban neo-nazi demonstrations at historic landmarks .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 12.03.2005 germany cracks down on neo-nazi music großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still sold on the black market germany 's supreme administrative court has ruled that a neo-nazi rock group that spread racial hatred was a criminal organization , upholding a first such statement in germany against a music band . the court also upheld a three and a half year prison sentence against the lead singer of the band , michael regener - argueing his lyrics would incite public hatred against foreigners and minorities in germany .
the move is part of a nationwide crackdown on neo-nazi groups and organizations - two of which were also banned this week . the ruling now upheld by germany 's highest administrative court goes back to a case brought against regener -lrb- photo below -rrb- , who was handed a prison sentence for inciting racial hatred and spreading nazi propaganda . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael regener prosecutions have often been brought against individuals in germany under laws banning nazi propaganda and the incitement of public unrest .
but this was the first time a collective prosecution of this kind had been brought against a music group .
jürgen lampe , spokesman for the federal prosecutor , said the band was planning what they called an " aryan revolution " and was operating in a highly secretive manner . " the primary goal of this band was to commit crimes , " he said .
" its organizational structure bears the hallmarks of organized crime . " court : racism sole purpose of band the supreme administrative court said that landser was founded solely to produce and distribute racist songs and nazi ideology .
inflammatory lyrics such as " turks and commies and all that scum will soon be forever gone " from a song called " the reich will be back , " it said , were clearly meant to incite hatred and violence against foreigners and political opponents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo-nazis at a 2000 demonstration the band did n't make public appearances and for a long time its members had remained unknown .
experts have long been warning that neo-nazi organizations are spreading their hate messages through music distributed often for free especially among younger germans at schools .
a network of so-called " comradeships " has been established primarily in eastern germany fostering a cult of violence and hatred . latent feelings frank jantzen , an expert on the right-wing scene here , said this ideology often blends with latent racism among the population at large . " i fear this structural link between every-day racism and a perpetrator image cherished by rightist youths is the core problem , " he said .
" no-one has so far been able to sever this link which has fostered an extreme right-wing scene .
young neo-nazis are enmeshed in a culture of blood and violence that is promoted also through music and eventually seeks a vent .
democratic forces in germany are simply at a loss to effectively counter an ideology of dumb violence that is infesting more and more young minds . " in an effort to stop rightist violence - which has been rising in eastern germany again last year - authorities banned two more neo-nazi groups in the region on thursday .
they were among the most active of the " comradeships " in and around berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in raids on several homes police discovered neo-nazi pamphlets and t-shirts glorifying former nazi leaders as heroes and martyrs . earlier in the week , a group of young neo-nazis in brandenburg were classified as terrorists by a court in potsdam which handed down jail sentences to the members for attacking and burning immigrant-owned shops and fast food outlets . uwe hessler -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany moves to curb neo-nazi protests germany 's lower house of parliament friday voted by a large majority to tighten the right of assembly , thus making it easier in future to ban neo-nazi demonstrations at historic landmarks .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 12.03.2005 lufthansa , swiss to cooperate ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : potential partners following the merger of air france and dutch airline klm last year , europe 's airline industry could consolidate further amid renewed speculation that germany 's lufthansa is about to tie the knot with swiss . sources close to the matter said lufthansa and swiss executives were meeting in zurich friday for advanced talks that could eventually lead to a merger later this year . banking sources quizzed by the swiss financial newswire awp said that a takeover of swiss by lufthansa was " practically a done deal . "
both airlines declined to comment .
but lufthansa and swiss have long been seen as potential partners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swiss plans to join the oneworld alliance , which also includes american airlines , failed previous merger talks between the two in 2003 failed because of strong resistance in switzerland to such a deal .
as a result , swiss tried - ultimately unsucessfully - to join british airways ' oneworld alliance . pertinently , swiss chairman christoph franz is a former lufthansa executive . swiss needs partner lufthansa for its part has always insisted that it has never closed the door completely on a deal with swiss , as long as the terms and conditions were right . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : firemen welcome the last swissair plane arriving from new york , by jets of water , at the cointrin airport in geneva , switzerland , sunday march 31 , 2002 .
and while swiss , the successor company to former flag carrier swissair which went bust in 2001 , has managed to narrow its losses , experts say the airline is unlikely to be able to survive on its own in the long term . financial times deutschland reported on friday that lufthansa had now come to the conclusion that the time was right to buy swiss , which is currently in better financial health than it had been in 2003 , at a lower price . swiss narrowed its full-year loss of 140 million swiss francs -lrb- € 90.3 million , $ 121.6 million -rrb- last year from 687 million swiss francs a year earlier and it hopes to break even at operating level this year . lufthansa 's door remains open lufthansa also declined to comment , but a spokesman reiterated the airline 's position that it had never shut the door completely on a tie-up . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang mayrhuber sources said the talks in zurich on friday were follow-up negotiations after lufthansa chief executive wolfgang mayrhuber -lrb- photo -rrb- and his swiss counterpart franz had outlined the broad brush-strokes of a merger at a recent meeting held in the secrecy of a remote mountain-top chalet . the negotiations were expected to lead to a cooperation between the two carriers beginning in the second or third quarter of this year and then possibly to a fully fledged merger later , the sources added . swiss will survive the business daily handelsblatt said lufthansa had agreed to maintain the swiss brand on condition the swiss airline implement additional belt-tightening measures and transfer control of its route network to frankfurt . analysts said lufthansa 's second attempt to gets its hands on swiss might be more successful . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lufthansa planes at frankfurt airport " airlines are under pressure to consolidate because of overcapacity , " said merck finck analyst robert heberger .
" there are still too many airlines and low-cost carriers are ruining prices .
lufthansa is one of the stronger players in a generally weak sector .
airlines are still suffering from the fallout of sept .
11 , 2001 .
and then there are rising kerosene prices , which carriers like swiss have not hedged against very much . " greater synergies alhough lufthansa has steered clear of big acquisitions in the past , opting instead for code-sharing agreements under the umbrella of its star alliance grouping , greater synergies would be gained in the case of swiss from a straight-forward takeover , the analyst argued . " lufthansa would have access to swiss 's zurich hub and it would be better able to fill its airbus a380 jets with swiss customers , " heberger said . nordlb analyst martina noss agreed . " strategically , a merger would make sense , not only in terms of synergies , but lufthansa would also be buying a rival whose routes in southern germany and in switzerland overlapped with its own , " she said , adding that she was maintaining her " buy " recommendation the stock . still a sick patient but heberger was more skeptical . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will lufthansa help swiss to get off the ground again ?
" swiss is still a sick patient , " he said , adding that he has a " hold " recommendation on the stock .
" and then there are the political considerations .

"
both airlines declined to comment .
but lufthansa and swiss have long been seen as potential partners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swiss plans to join the oneworld alliance , which also includes american airlines , failed previous merger talks between the two in 2003 failed because of strong resistance in switzerland to such a deal .
as a result , swiss tried - ultimately unsucessfully - to join british airways ' oneworld alliance . pertinently , swiss chairman christoph franz is a former lufthansa executive . swiss needs partner lufthansa for its part has always insisted that it has never closed the door completely on a deal with swiss , as long as the terms and conditions were right . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : firemen welcome the last swissair plane arriving from new york , by jets of water , at the cointrin airport in geneva , switzerland , sunday march 31 , 2002 .
and while swiss , the successor company to former flag carrier swissair which went bust in 2001 , has managed to narrow its losses , experts say the airline is unlikely to be able to survive on its own in the long term . financial times deutschland reported on friday that lufthansa had now come to the conclusion that the time was right to buy swiss , which is currently in better financial health than it had been in 2003 , at a lower price . swiss narrowed its full-year loss of 140 million swiss francs -lrb- € 90.3 million , $ 121.6 million -rrb- last year from 687 million swiss francs a year earlier and it hopes to break even at operating level this year . lufthansa 's door remains open lufthansa also declined to comment , but a spokesman reiterated the airline 's position that it had never shut the door completely on a tie-up . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang mayrhuber sources said the talks in zurich on friday were follow-up negotiations after lufthansa chief executive wolfgang mayrhuber -lrb- photo -rrb- and his swiss counterpart franz had outlined the broad brush-strokes of a merger at a recent meeting held in the secrecy of a remote mountain-top chalet . the negotiations were expected to lead to a cooperation between the two carriers beginning in the second or third quarter of this year and then possibly to a fully fledged merger later , the sources added . swiss will survive the business daily handelsblatt said lufthansa had agreed to maintain the swiss brand on condition the swiss airline implement additional belt-tightening measures and transfer control of its route network to frankfurt . analysts said lufthansa 's second attempt to gets its hands on swiss might be more successful . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lufthansa planes at frankfurt airport " airlines are under pressure to consolidate because of overcapacity , " said merck finck analyst robert heberger .
" there are still too many airlines and low-cost carriers are ruining prices .
lufthansa is one of the stronger players in a generally weak sector .
airlines are still suffering from the fallout of sept .
11 , 2001 .
and then there are rising kerosene prices , which carriers like swiss have not hedged against very much . " greater synergies alhough lufthansa has steered clear of big acquisitions in the past , opting instead for code-sharing agreements under the umbrella of its star alliance grouping , greater synergies would be gained in the case of swiss from a straight-forward takeover , the analyst argued . " lufthansa would have access to swiss 's zurich hub and it would be better able to fill its airbus a380 jets with swiss customers , " heberger said . nordlb analyst martina noss agreed . " strategically , a merger would make sense , not only in terms of synergies , but lufthansa would also be buying a rival whose routes in southern germany and in switzerland overlapped with its own , " she said , adding that she was maintaining her " buy " recommendation the stock . still a sick patient but heberger was more skeptical . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will lufthansa help swiss to get off the ground again ?
" swiss is still a sick patient , " he said , adding that he has a " hold " recommendation on the stock .
" and then there are the political considerations .

the move is part of a nationwide crackdown on neo-nazi groups and organizations - two of which were also banned this week . the ruling now upheld by germany 's highest administrative court goes back to a case brought against regener -lrb- photo below -rrb- , who was handed a prison sentence for inciting racial hatred and spreading nazi propaganda . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael regener prosecutions have often been brought against individuals in germany under laws banning nazi propaganda and the incitement of public unrest .
but this was the first time a collective prosecution of this kind had been brought against a music group .
jürgen lampe , spokesman for the federal prosecutor , said the band was planning what they called an " aryan revolution " and was operating in a highly secretive manner . " the primary goal of this band was to commit crimes , " he said .
" its organizational structure bears the hallmarks of organized crime . " court : racism sole purpose of band the supreme administrative court said that landser was founded solely to produce and distribute racist songs and nazi ideology .
inflammatory lyrics such as " turks and commies and all that scum will soon be forever gone " from a song called " the reich will be back , " it said , were clearly meant to incite hatred and violence against foreigners and political opponents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo-nazis at a 2000 demonstration the band did n't make public appearances and for a long time its members had remained unknown .
experts have long been warning that neo-nazi organizations are spreading their hate messages through music distributed often for free especially among younger germans at schools .
a network of so-called " comradeships " has been established primarily in eastern germany fostering a cult of violence and hatred . latent feelings frank jantzen , an expert on the right-wing scene here , said this ideology often blends with latent racism among the population at large . " i fear this structural link between every-day racism and a perpetrator image cherished by rightist youths is the core problem , " he said .
" no-one has so far been able to sever this link which has fostered an extreme right-wing scene .
young neo-nazis are enmeshed in a culture of blood and violence that is promoted also through music and eventually seeks a vent .
democratic forces in germany are simply at a loss to effectively counter an ideology of dumb violence that is infesting more and more young minds . " in an effort to stop rightist violence - which has been rising in eastern germany again last year - authorities banned two more neo-nazi groups in the region on thursday .
they were among the most active of the " comradeships " in and around berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in raids on several homes police discovered neo-nazi pamphlets and t-shirts glorifying former nazi leaders as heroes and martyrs . earlier in the week , a group of young neo-nazis in brandenburg were classified as terrorists by a court in potsdam which handed down jail sentences to the members for attacking and burning immigrant-owned shops and fast food outlets . uwe hessler -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany moves to curb neo-nazi protests germany 's lower house of parliament friday voted by a large majority to tighten the right of assembly , thus making it easier in future to ban neo-nazi demonstrations at historic landmarks .

evidently not a german man who lost his penis in a motorcycle accident ended up getting two new ones .
but instead his wife being thrilled about the erotic possibilities , she up and left him . michael gruber loved his bike , until an accident on it eight years ago cost him his manhood , literally .
he lost the penis he was born with in the smashup , but thanks to modern science doctors were able to keep him from living the life of a monk . they reconstructed the organ using a mixture of skin , bone and other tissues from his own body and from all accounts , it was a smashing success .
gruber even fathered a child with his wife , bianca , using the new appendage . but gruber began complaining that the prosthetic was frequently infected and it became almost impossible for he and his wife to have sex .
he asked doctors to build him a new one , which they did in a berlin clinic . however , doctors left the first reconstruction attached , just to make sure the new one took and was properly supplied with blood .
suddenly , gruber was the proud owner of two willies .
one might think he 'd be the envy of every male on the planet . but when wife bianca got a look at the duo , she packed her backs and left , taking son etienne with her . " i 've got two penises , but no wife , but i am hoping when i get rid of the one of the penises i will get her back , " gruber said from his hospital bed . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the best of " from the fringe " it 's the best of the weird , wonderful and wonderfully quirky from around germany .

the move is part of a nationwide crackdown on neo-nazi groups and organizations - two of which were also banned this week . the ruling now upheld by germany 's highest administrative court goes back to a case brought against regener -lrb- photo below -rrb- , who was handed a prison sentence for inciting racial hatred and spreading nazi propaganda . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael regener prosecutions have often been brought against individuals in germany under laws banning nazi propaganda and the incitement of public unrest .
but this was the first time a collective prosecution of this kind had been brought against a music group .
jürgen lampe , spokesman for the federal prosecutor , said the band was planning what they called an " aryan revolution " and was operating in a highly secretive manner . " the primary goal of this band was to commit crimes , " he said .
" its organizational structure bears the hallmarks of organized crime . " court : racism sole purpose of band the supreme administrative court said that landser was founded solely to produce and distribute racist songs and nazi ideology .
inflammatory lyrics such as " turks and commies and all that scum will soon be forever gone " from a song called " the reich will be back , " it said , were clearly meant to incite hatred and violence against foreigners and political opponents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo-nazis at a 2000 demonstration the band did n't make public appearances and for a long time its members had remained unknown .
experts have long been warning that neo-nazi organizations are spreading their hate messages through music distributed often for free especially among younger germans at schools .
a network of so-called " comradeships " has been established primarily in eastern germany fostering a cult of violence and hatred . latent feelings frank jantzen , an expert on the right-wing scene here , said this ideology often blends with latent racism among the population at large . " i fear this structural link between every-day racism and a perpetrator image cherished by rightist youths is the core problem , " he said .
" no-one has so far been able to sever this link which has fostered an extreme right-wing scene .
young neo-nazis are enmeshed in a culture of blood and violence that is promoted also through music and eventually seeks a vent .
democratic forces in germany are simply at a loss to effectively counter an ideology of dumb violence that is infesting more and more young minds . " in an effort to stop rightist violence - which has been rising in eastern germany again last year - authorities banned two more neo-nazi groups in the region on thursday .
they were among the most active of the " comradeships " in and around berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in raids on several homes police discovered neo-nazi pamphlets and t-shirts glorifying former nazi leaders as heroes and martyrs . earlier in the week , a group of young neo-nazis in brandenburg were classified as terrorists by a court in potsdam which handed down jail sentences to the members for attacking and burning immigrant-owned shops and fast food outlets . uwe hessler -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany moves to curb neo-nazi protests germany 's lower house of parliament friday voted by a large majority to tighten the right of assembly , thus making it easier in future to ban neo-nazi demonstrations at historic landmarks .

evidently not a german man who lost his penis in a motorcycle accident ended up getting two new ones .
but instead his wife being thrilled about the erotic possibilities , she up and left him . michael gruber loved his bike , until an accident on it eight years ago cost him his manhood , literally .
he lost the penis he was born with in the smashup , but thanks to modern science doctors were able to keep him from living the life of a monk . they reconstructed the organ using a mixture of skin , bone and other tissues from his own body and from all accounts , it was a smashing success .
gruber even fathered a child with his wife , bianca , using the new appendage . but gruber began complaining that the prosthetic was frequently infected and it became almost impossible for he and his wife to have sex .
he asked doctors to build him a new one , which they did in a berlin clinic . however , doctors left the first reconstruction attached , just to make sure the new one took and was properly supplied with blood .
suddenly , gruber was the proud owner of two willies .
one might think he 'd be the envy of every male on the planet . but when wife bianca got a look at the duo , she packed her backs and left , taking son etienne with her . " i 've got two penises , but no wife , but i am hoping when i get rid of the one of the penises i will get her back , " gruber said from his hospital bed . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the best of " from the fringe " it 's the best of the weird , wonderful and wonderfully quirky from around germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 12.03.2005 lufthansa , swiss to cooperate ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : potential partners following the merger of air france and dutch airline klm last year , europe 's airline industry could consolidate further amid renewed speculation that germany 's lufthansa is about to tie the knot with swiss . sources close to the matter said lufthansa and swiss executives were meeting in zurich friday for advanced talks that could eventually lead to a merger later this year . banking sources quizzed by the swiss financial newswire awp said that a takeover of swiss by lufthansa was " practically a done deal . "
both airlines declined to comment .
but lufthansa and swiss have long been seen as potential partners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swiss plans to join the oneworld alliance , which also includes american airlines , failed previous merger talks between the two in 2003 failed because of strong resistance in switzerland to such a deal .
as a result , swiss tried - ultimately unsucessfully - to join british airways ' oneworld alliance . pertinently , swiss chairman christoph franz is a former lufthansa executive . swiss needs partner lufthansa for its part has always insisted that it has never closed the door completely on a deal with swiss , as long as the terms and conditions were right . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : firemen welcome the last swissair plane arriving from new york , by jets of water , at the cointrin airport in geneva , switzerland , sunday march 31 , 2002 .
and while swiss , the successor company to former flag carrier swissair which went bust in 2001 , has managed to narrow its losses , experts say the airline is unlikely to be able to survive on its own in the long term . financial times deutschland reported on friday that lufthansa had now come to the conclusion that the time was right to buy swiss , which is currently in better financial health than it had been in 2003 , at a lower price . swiss narrowed its full-year loss of 140 million swiss francs -lrb- € 90.3 million , $ 121.6 million -rrb- last year from 687 million swiss francs a year earlier and it hopes to break even at operating level this year . lufthansa 's door remains open lufthansa also declined to comment , but a spokesman reiterated the airline 's position that it had never shut the door completely on a tie-up . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang mayrhuber sources said the talks in zurich on friday were follow-up negotiations after lufthansa chief executive wolfgang mayrhuber -lrb- photo -rrb- and his swiss counterpart franz had outlined the broad brush-strokes of a merger at a recent meeting held in the secrecy of a remote mountain-top chalet . the negotiations were expected to lead to a cooperation between the two carriers beginning in the second or third quarter of this year and then possibly to a fully fledged merger later , the sources added . swiss will survive the business daily handelsblatt said lufthansa had agreed to maintain the swiss brand on condition the swiss airline implement additional belt-tightening measures and transfer control of its route network to frankfurt . analysts said lufthansa 's second attempt to gets its hands on swiss might be more successful . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lufthansa planes at frankfurt airport " airlines are under pressure to consolidate because of overcapacity , " said merck finck analyst robert heberger .
" there are still too many airlines and low-cost carriers are ruining prices .
lufthansa is one of the stronger players in a generally weak sector .
airlines are still suffering from the fallout of sept .
11 , 2001 .
and then there are rising kerosene prices , which carriers like swiss have not hedged against very much . " greater synergies alhough lufthansa has steered clear of big acquisitions in the past , opting instead for code-sharing agreements under the umbrella of its star alliance grouping , greater synergies would be gained in the case of swiss from a straight-forward takeover , the analyst argued . " lufthansa would have access to swiss 's zurich hub and it would be better able to fill its airbus a380 jets with swiss customers , " heberger said . nordlb analyst martina noss agreed . " strategically , a merger would make sense , not only in terms of synergies , but lufthansa would also be buying a rival whose routes in southern germany and in switzerland overlapped with its own , " she said , adding that she was maintaining her " buy " recommendation the stock . still a sick patient but heberger was more skeptical . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will lufthansa help swiss to get off the ground again ?
" swiss is still a sick patient , " he said , adding that he has a " hold " recommendation on the stock .
" and then there are the political considerations .

the move is part of a nationwide crackdown on neo-nazi groups and organizations - two of which were also banned this week . the ruling now upheld by germany 's highest administrative court goes back to a case brought against regener -lrb- photo below -rrb- , who was handed a prison sentence for inciting racial hatred and spreading nazi propaganda . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael regener prosecutions have often been brought against individuals in germany under laws banning nazi propaganda and the incitement of public unrest .

the move is part of a nationwide crackdown on neo-nazi groups and organizations - two of which were also banned this week . the ruling now upheld by germany 's highest administrative court goes back to a case brought against regener -lrb- photo below -rrb- , who was handed a prison sentence for inciting racial hatred and spreading nazi propaganda . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael regener prosecutions have often been brought against individuals in germany under laws banning nazi propaganda and the incitement of public unrest .
but this was the first time a collective prosecution of this kind had been brought against a music group .
jürgen lampe , spokesman for the federal prosecutor , said the band was planning what they called an " aryan revolution " and was operating in a highly secretive manner . " the primary goal of this band was to commit crimes , " he said .
" its organizational structure bears the hallmarks of organized crime . " court : racism sole purpose of band the supreme administrative court said that landser was founded solely to produce and distribute racist songs and nazi ideology .

experts have long been warning that neo-nazi organizations are spreading their hate messages through music distributed often for free especially among younger germans at schools .
a network of so-called " comradeships " has been established primarily in eastern germany fostering a cult of violence and hatred . latent feelings frank jantzen , an expert on the right-wing scene here , said this ideology often blends with latent racism among the population at large . " i fear this structural link between every-day racism and a perpetrator image cherished by rightist youths is the core problem , " he said .
" no-one has so far been able to sever this link which has fostered an extreme right-wing scene .
young neo-nazis are enmeshed in a culture of blood and violence that is promoted also through music and eventually seeks a vent .
democratic forces in germany are simply at a loss to effectively counter an ideology of dumb violence that is infesting more and more young minds .

evidently not a german man who lost his penis in a motorcycle accident ended up getting two new ones .
but instead his wife being thrilled about the erotic possibilities , she up and left him . michael gruber loved his bike , until an accident on it eight years ago cost him his manhood , literally .
he lost the penis he was born with in the smashup , but thanks to modern science doctors were able to keep him from living the life of a monk . they reconstructed the organ using a mixture of skin , bone and other tissues from his own body and from all accounts , it was a smashing success .
gruber even fathered a child with his wife , bianca , using the new appendage . but gruber began complaining that the prosthetic was frequently infected and it became almost impossible for he and his wife to have sex .
he asked doctors to build him a new one , which they did in a berlin clinic . however , doctors left the first reconstruction attached , just to make sure the new one took and was properly supplied with blood .
suddenly , gruber was the proud owner of two willies .
one might think he 'd be the envy of every male on the planet . but when wife bianca got a look at the duo , she packed her backs and left , taking son etienne with her . " i 've got two penises , but no wife , but i am hoping when i get rid of the one of the penises i will get her back , " gruber said from his hospital bed . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the best of " from the fringe " it 's the best of the weird , wonderful and wonderfully quirky from around germany .

suddenly , gruber was the proud owner of two willies .
one might think he 'd be the envy of every male on the planet . but when wife bianca got a look at the duo , she packed her backs and left , taking son etienne with her .

"
both airlines declined to comment .
but lufthansa and swiss have long been seen as potential partners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swiss plans to join the oneworld alliance , which also includes american airlines , failed previous merger talks between the two in 2003 failed because of strong resistance in switzerland to such a deal .
as a result , swiss tried - ultimately unsucessfully - to join british airways ' oneworld alliance . pertinently , swiss chairman christoph franz is a former lufthansa executive . swiss needs partner lufthansa for its part has always insisted that it has never closed the door completely on a deal with swiss , as long as the terms and conditions were right . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : firemen welcome the last swissair plane arriving from new york , by jets of water , at the cointrin airport in geneva , switzerland , sunday march 31 , 2002 .
and while swiss , the successor company to former flag carrier swissair which went bust in 2001 , has managed to narrow its losses , experts say the airline is unlikely to be able to survive on its own in the long term . financial times deutschland reported on friday that lufthansa had now come to the conclusion that the time was right to buy swiss , which is currently in better financial health than it had been in 2003 , at a lower price . swiss narrowed its full-year loss of 140 million swiss francs -lrb- € 90.3 million , $ 121.6 million -rrb- last year from 687 million swiss francs a year earlier and it hopes to break even at operating level this year . lufthansa 's door remains open lufthansa also declined to comment , but a spokesman reiterated the airline 's position that it had never shut the door completely on a tie-up . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang mayrhuber sources said the talks in zurich on friday were follow-up negotiations after lufthansa chief executive wolfgang mayrhuber -lrb- photo -rrb- and his swiss counterpart franz had outlined the broad brush-strokes of a merger at a recent meeting held in the secrecy of a remote mountain-top chalet . the negotiations were expected to lead to a cooperation between the two carriers beginning in the second or third quarter of this year and then possibly to a fully fledged merger later , the sources added . swiss will survive the business daily handelsblatt said lufthansa had agreed to maintain the swiss brand on condition the swiss airline implement additional belt-tightening measures and transfer control of its route network to frankfurt . analysts said lufthansa 's second attempt to gets its hands on swiss might be more successful . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lufthansa planes at frankfurt airport " airlines are under pressure to consolidate because of overcapacity , " said merck finck analyst robert heberger .
" there are still too many airlines and low-cost carriers are ruining prices .
lufthansa is one of the stronger players in a generally weak sector .
airlines are still suffering from the fallout of sept .
11 , 2001 .
and then there are rising kerosene prices , which carriers like swiss have not hedged against very much . " greater synergies alhough lufthansa has steered clear of big acquisitions in the past , opting instead for code-sharing agreements under the umbrella of its star alliance grouping , greater synergies would be gained in the case of swiss from a straight-forward takeover , the analyst argued . " lufthansa would have access to swiss 's zurich hub and it would be better able to fill its airbus a380 jets with swiss customers , " heberger said . nordlb analyst martina noss agreed . " strategically , a merger would make sense , not only in terms of synergies , but lufthansa would also be buying a rival whose routes in southern germany and in switzerland overlapped with its own , " she said , adding that she was maintaining her " buy " recommendation the stock . still a sick patient but heberger was more skeptical . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will lufthansa help swiss to get off the ground again ?
" swiss is still a sick patient , " he said , adding that he has a " hold " recommendation on the stock .
" and then there are the political considerations .

the move is part of a nationwide crackdown on neo-nazi groups and organizations - two of which were also banned this week . the ruling now upheld by germany 's highest administrative court goes back to a case brought against regener -lrb- photo below -rrb- , who was handed a prison sentence for inciting racial hatred and spreading nazi propaganda . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael regener prosecutions have often been brought against individuals in germany under laws banning nazi propaganda and the incitement of public unrest .
but this was the first time a collective prosecution of this kind had been brought against a music group .
jürgen lampe , spokesman for the federal prosecutor , said the band was planning what they called an " aryan revolution " and was operating in a highly secretive manner . " the primary goal of this band was to commit crimes , " he said .
" its organizational structure bears the hallmarks of organized crime . " court : racism sole purpose of band the supreme administrative court said that landser was founded solely to produce and distribute racist songs and nazi ideology .
inflammatory lyrics such as " turks and commies and all that scum will soon be forever gone " from a song called " the reich will be back , " it said , were clearly meant to incite hatred and violence against foreigners and political opponents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo-nazis at a 2000 demonstration the band did n't make public appearances and for a long time its members had remained unknown .
experts have long been warning that neo-nazi organizations are spreading their hate messages through music distributed often for free especially among younger germans at schools .
a network of so-called " comradeships " has been established primarily in eastern germany fostering a cult of violence and hatred . latent feelings frank jantzen , an expert on the right-wing scene here , said this ideology often blends with latent racism among the population at large . " i fear this structural link between every-day racism and a perpetrator image cherished by rightist youths is the core problem , " he said .
" no-one has so far been able to sever this link which has fostered an extreme right-wing scene .
young neo-nazis are enmeshed in a culture of blood and violence that is promoted also through music and eventually seeks a vent .
democratic forces in germany are simply at a loss to effectively counter an ideology of dumb violence that is infesting more and more young minds . " in an effort to stop rightist violence - which has been rising in eastern germany again last year - authorities banned two more neo-nazi groups in the region on thursday .
they were among the most active of the " comradeships " in and around berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in raids on several homes police discovered neo-nazi pamphlets and t-shirts glorifying former nazi leaders as heroes and martyrs . earlier in the week , a group of young neo-nazis in brandenburg were classified as terrorists by a court in potsdam which handed down jail sentences to the members for attacking and burning immigrant-owned shops and fast food outlets . uwe hessler -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany moves to curb neo-nazi protests germany 's lower house of parliament friday voted by a large majority to tighten the right of assembly , thus making it easier in future to ban neo-nazi demonstrations at historic landmarks .

its legal successor , the " deutsche dienststelle , " still works to come to terms with world war ii 's consequences . the information office is a world war ii relict .
founded just days before the war started , on aug .
26 , 1939 , the wehrmacht agency 's tasks were ostensibly humanitarian : the geneva convention in 1929 required the signatories to keep an account of prisoners in the event of war and to inform the red cross .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german army in prague , 1939 first of all though , the information office helped the wehrmacht to keep tabs on its own soldiers .
the agency documented every instance of german soldiers falling ill , suffering injuries or going missing .
when soldiers died , it notified the relatives .
besides these humanitarian aspects , the office was responsible , above all , for keeping track of troop numbers .
after world war ii , the us army wanted to destroy the wehrmacht archive out of fear that germany could use it to rebuild its army .
but the french blocked the move , arguing that the archive could help them free frenchmen conscripted by the wehrmacht from russian prisoner-of-war camps .
the allies agreed in 1946 that the french should be in charge of the information office , and it moved to the french sector if berlin .
responding to history in 1949 , britain transferred its files on german prisoners of war to west germany .
france handed over its files in 1952 , and the united states did so in 1962 .
after german unification in 1990 , the information office verified claims pensions for former wehrmacht members from east germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the geneva convention required signatories to inform the red cross of prisoners sixty years after the end of the war , the office continues to deal with its consequences .
since the collapse of the eastern bloc , former soviet archives that can shed light on the fate of missing soldiers have become accessible .
for years in eastern europe individual soldiers ' graves have been dug up and shifted to collective graves .
the information office notifies relatives of the changes and updates its index of war graves .
all told , the information office has over 45 tons of files that fill rooms and rooms of shelves with more than 10 million individual notes .
still , the fates of innumerable soldiers are still waiting to be unravelled .
alive archives " we are possibly the only agency that has worked constantly since its establishment in 1939 until today , " peter gerhardt , deputy director of the deutsche dienststelle , also called the information office , said during a recent conversation in his office in a former ammunition factory in northern berlin .
oil paintings showing german navy warships hang on the walls .
gerhardt has been working for the enquiry office for more than 40 years .
he got his start as an intern in the navy 's archive .
" the archives are alive , " gerhardt said .
" we 're sitting in the so-called central card index , in which 18 million soldiers are filed alphabetically , one card per soldier .
" the central card index is the heart of the information office , " he said .
each tracing request starts here and refers to other cards .
office employees keep the cards up to date by making handwritten notes on them when authorities or relatives request traces .
genealogical searches bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the collapse of the eastern bloc led to new cases for the information office over the past four years , the number of inquiries from abroad has grown as the children of occupation soldiers hunt for their fathers .
" often they do n't know more about their fathers than the forename , sometimes the rank , possibly his hometown , " gerhardt said .
" in such a case , the investigation is downright criminological .
processing time can take between six and 12 months . "
the information office gets 10-15 tracing requests each month , gerhardt said .
they come from norway , denmark , the netherlands , belgium and france , countries formerly occupied by germany .
but tracing requests have never come from italy or eastern europe .
" i spoke to an italian camera team recently , " he said .
" they said that the civil war-like situation in italy after the war had obscured memory of the occupation .
but catholicism could also be a reason : families covered for the mothers and their occupation children . "
but gerhardt said he suspects the reasons are different in eastern europe .
until 1990 , it was politically undesirable there to look into one 's ancestry , he said .
but if that were to change , it would be a question of time .

its legal successor , the " deutsche dienststelle , " still works to come to terms with world war ii 's consequences . the information office is a world war ii relict .
founded just days before the war started , on aug .
26 , 1939 , the wehrmacht agency 's tasks were ostensibly humanitarian : the geneva convention in 1929 required the signatories to keep an account of prisoners in the event of war and to inform the red cross .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german army in prague , 1939 first of all though , the information office helped the wehrmacht to keep tabs on its own soldiers .
the agency documented every instance of german soldiers falling ill , suffering injuries or going missing .
when soldiers died , it notified the relatives .
besides these humanitarian aspects , the office was responsible , above all , for keeping track of troop numbers .
after world war ii , the us army wanted to destroy the wehrmacht archive out of fear that germany could use it to rebuild its army .
but the french blocked the move , arguing that the archive could help them free frenchmen conscripted by the wehrmacht from russian prisoner-of-war camps .
the allies agreed in 1946 that the french should be in charge of the information office , and it moved to the french sector if berlin .
responding to history in 1949 , britain transferred its files on german prisoners of war to west germany .
france handed over its files in 1952 , and the united states did so in 1962 .
after german unification in 1990 , the information office verified claims pensions for former wehrmacht members from east germany .

instead exhibitors are focusing on making the small smaller , the big bigger and the fast faster . it would be fair to expect more than a handful of new , whiz-bang products in the 27 exhibition hall that look better suited to hold commercial airlines rather than electronics , but the 6,270 companies from 69 countries , up from 6,109 companies and 64 countries in 2004 , at the annual cebit have something else on their minds .
whether dealing with how we watch tv , listen to music , talk with our friends and family , exercise or get through airport security , exhibitors improved on the old instead of brining in the new to show the 500,000 visitors expected at the week-long event .
faster , lighter , easier to use bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dvds ran over the world 's largest lcd tv at samsung 's cebit 2005 booth televisions are larger and clearer .
mp3 players store more songs and can fit in the smallest of pockets .
cell phones have shrunk in size and take higher quality pictures .
shoes auto-adjust cushioning and resistance while running , and facial scans no longer require you to stand still .
mobile phones long stopped being just for talking and the trend continued at cebit .
now they can send pictures and videos along with playing and downloading mp3 audio files .
whether it 's actually a digital camera with a mobile phone or a mobile phone with a digital camera is an open question , but the samsung sch-v770 lets users talk and take seven megapixel digital pictures .
available in asia by in june , the phone has neither a european nor north american release date nor even a price as of yet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosch security systems scans cebit 2005 visitors ' faces to show how their facefinder package compares and recognizes facial features a quick swipe of the id card and the boss knows you 're at work .
thanks to biometrics , a glance at a video camera will be enough for bosch security systems ' facefinder to scan your face and determine your identity by comparing it to an established database .
" people do not have to do anything , " said stefan steinert of bosch security systems of the setup that has already found its way into some shopping malls and casinos .
" their faces can automatically be recognized . "

he lost the penis he was born with in the smashup , but thanks to modern science doctors were able to keep him from living the life of a monk . they reconstructed the organ using a mixture of skin , bone and other tissues from his own body and from all accounts , it was a smashing success .
gruber even fathered a child with his wife , bianca , using the new appendage . but gruber began complaining that the prosthetic was frequently infected and it became almost impossible for he and his wife to have sex .
he asked doctors to build him a new one , which they did in a berlin clinic . however , doctors left the first reconstruction attached , just to make sure the new one took and was properly supplied with blood .
suddenly , gruber was the proud owner of two willies .
one might think he 'd be the envy of every male on the planet . but when wife bianca got a look at the duo , she packed her backs and left , taking son etienne with her . " i 've got two penises , but no wife , but i am hoping when i get rid of the one of the penises i will get her back , " gruber said from his hospital bed . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the best of " from the fringe " it 's the best of the weird , wonderful and wonderfully quirky from around germany .

the move is part of a nationwide crackdown on neo-nazi groups and organizations - two of which were also banned this week . the ruling now upheld by germany 's highest administrative court goes back to a case brought against regener -lrb- photo below -rrb- , who was handed a prison sentence for inciting racial hatred and spreading nazi propaganda . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael regener prosecutions have often been brought against individuals in germany under laws banning nazi propaganda and the incitement of public unrest .
but this was the first time a collective prosecution of this kind had been brought against a music group .
jürgen lampe , spokesman for the federal prosecutor , said the band was planning what they called an " aryan revolution " and was operating in a highly secretive manner . " the primary goal of this band was to commit crimes , " he said .
" its organizational structure bears the hallmarks of organized crime . " court : racism sole purpose of band the supreme administrative court said that landser was founded solely to produce and distribute racist songs and nazi ideology .
inflammatory lyrics such as " turks and commies and all that scum will soon be forever gone " from a song called " the reich will be back , " it said , were clearly meant to incite hatred and violence against foreigners and political opponents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo-nazis at a 2000 demonstration the band did n't make public appearances and for a long time its members had remained unknown .
experts have long been warning that neo-nazi organizations are spreading their hate messages through music distributed often for free especially among younger germans at schools .
a network of so-called " comradeships " has been established primarily in eastern germany fostering a cult of violence and hatred . latent feelings frank jantzen , an expert on the right-wing scene here , said this ideology often blends with latent racism among the population at large . " i fear this structural link between every-day racism and a perpetrator image cherished by rightist youths is the core problem , " he said .
" no-one has so far been able to sever this link which has fostered an extreme right-wing scene .
young neo-nazis are enmeshed in a culture of blood and violence that is promoted also through music and eventually seeks a vent .
democratic forces in germany are simply at a loss to effectively counter an ideology of dumb violence that is infesting more and more young minds . " in an effort to stop rightist violence - which has been rising in eastern germany again last year - authorities banned two more neo-nazi groups in the region on thursday .
they were among the most active of the " comradeships " in and around berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in raids on several homes police discovered neo-nazi pamphlets and t-shirts glorifying former nazi leaders as heroes and martyrs . earlier in the week , a group of young neo-nazis in brandenburg were classified as terrorists by a court in potsdam which handed down jail sentences to the members for attacking and burning immigrant-owned shops and fast food outlets . uwe hessler -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany moves to curb neo-nazi protests germany 's lower house of parliament friday voted by a large majority to tighten the right of assembly , thus making it easier in future to ban neo-nazi demonstrations at historic landmarks .

the move is part of a nationwide crackdown on neo-nazi groups and organizations - two of which were also banned this week . the ruling now upheld by germany 's highest administrative court goes back to a case brought against regener -lrb- photo below -rrb- , who was handed a prison sentence for inciting racial hatred and spreading nazi propaganda . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael regener prosecutions have often been brought against individuals in germany under laws banning nazi propaganda and the incitement of public unrest .
but this was the first time a collective prosecution of this kind had been brought against a music group .
jürgen lampe , spokesman for the federal prosecutor , said the band was planning what they called an " aryan revolution " and was operating in a highly secretive manner . " the primary goal of this band was to commit crimes , " he said .
" its organizational structure bears the hallmarks of organized crime . " court : racism sole purpose of band the supreme administrative court said that landser was founded solely to produce and distribute racist songs and nazi ideology .
inflammatory lyrics such as " turks and commies and all that scum will soon be forever gone " from a song called " the reich will be back , " it said , were clearly meant to incite hatred and violence against foreigners and political opponents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo-nazis at a 2000 demonstration the band did n't make public appearances and for a long time its members had remained unknown .
experts have long been warning that neo-nazi organizations are spreading their hate messages through music distributed often for free especially among younger germans at schools .
a network of so-called " comradeships " has been established primarily in eastern germany fostering a cult of violence and hatred . latent feelings frank jantzen , an expert on the right-wing scene here , said this ideology often blends with latent racism among the population at large . " i fear this structural link between every-day racism and a perpetrator image cherished by rightist youths is the core problem , " he said .
" no-one has so far been able to sever this link which has fostered an extreme right-wing scene .
young neo-nazis are enmeshed in a culture of blood and violence that is promoted also through music and eventually seeks a vent .
democratic forces in germany are simply at a loss to effectively counter an ideology of dumb violence that is infesting more and more young minds .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 12.03.2005 lufthansa , swiss to cooperate ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : potential partners following the merger of air france and dutch airline klm last year , europe 's airline industry could consolidate further amid renewed speculation that germany 's lufthansa is about to tie the knot with swiss . sources close to the matter said lufthansa and swiss executives were meeting in zurich friday for advanced talks that could eventually lead to a merger later this year . banking sources quizzed by the swiss financial newswire awp said that a takeover of swiss by lufthansa was " practically a done deal . "
both airlines declined to comment .
but lufthansa and swiss have long been seen as potential partners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swiss plans to join the oneworld alliance , which also includes american airlines , failed previous merger talks between the two in 2003 failed because of strong resistance in switzerland to such a deal .
as a result , swiss tried - ultimately unsucessfully - to join british airways ' oneworld alliance . pertinently , swiss chairman christoph franz is a former lufthansa executive . swiss needs partner lufthansa for its part has always insisted that it has never closed the door completely on a deal with swiss , as long as the terms and conditions were right . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : firemen welcome the last swissair plane arriving from new york , by jets of water , at the cointrin airport in geneva , switzerland , sunday march 31 , 2002 .
and while swiss , the successor company to former flag carrier swissair which went bust in 2001 , has managed to narrow its losses , experts say the airline is unlikely to be able to survive on its own in the long term . financial times deutschland reported on friday that lufthansa had now come to the conclusion that the time was right to buy swiss , which is currently in better financial health than it had been in 2003 , at a lower price . swiss narrowed its full-year loss of 140 million swiss francs -lrb- € 90.3 million , $ 121.6 million -rrb- last year from 687 million swiss francs a year earlier and it hopes to break even at operating level this year . lufthansa 's door remains open lufthansa also declined to comment , but a spokesman reiterated the airline 's position that it had never shut the door completely on a tie-up . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang mayrhuber sources said the talks in zurich on friday were follow-up negotiations after lufthansa chief executive wolfgang mayrhuber -lrb- photo -rrb- and his swiss counterpart franz had outlined the broad brush-strokes of a merger at a recent meeting held in the secrecy of a remote mountain-top chalet . the negotiations were expected to lead to a cooperation between the two carriers beginning in the second or third quarter of this year and then possibly to a fully fledged merger later , the sources added . swiss will survive the business daily handelsblatt said lufthansa had agreed to maintain the swiss brand on condition the swiss airline implement additional belt-tightening measures and transfer control of its route network to frankfurt . analysts said lufthansa 's second attempt to gets its hands on swiss might be more successful . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lufthansa planes at frankfurt airport " airlines are under pressure to consolidate because of overcapacity , " said merck finck analyst robert heberger .
" there are still too many airlines and low-cost carriers are ruining prices .
lufthansa is one of the stronger players in a generally weak sector .
airlines are still suffering from the fallout of sept .
11 , 2001 .
and then there are rising kerosene prices , which carriers like swiss have not hedged against very much . " greater synergies alhough lufthansa has steered clear of big acquisitions in the past , opting instead for code-sharing agreements under the umbrella of its star alliance grouping , greater synergies would be gained in the case of swiss from a straight-forward takeover , the analyst argued . " lufthansa would have access to swiss 's zurich hub and it would be better able to fill its airbus a380 jets with swiss customers , " heberger said . nordlb analyst martina noss agreed . " strategically , a merger would make sense , not only in terms of synergies , but lufthansa would also be buying a rival whose routes in southern germany and in switzerland overlapped with its own , " she said , adding that she was maintaining her " buy " recommendation the stock . still a sick patient but heberger was more skeptical . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will lufthansa help swiss to get off the ground again ?
" swiss is still a sick patient , " he said , adding that he has a " hold " recommendation on the stock .
" and then there are the political considerations .

instead exhibitors are focusing on making the small smaller , the big bigger and the fast faster . it would be fair to expect more than a handful of new , whiz-bang products in the 27 exhibition hall that look better suited to hold commercial airlines rather than electronics , but the 6,270 companies from 69 countries , up from 6,109 companies and 64 countries in 2004 , at the annual cebit have something else on their minds .
whether dealing with how we watch tv , listen to music , talk with our friends and family , exercise or get through airport security , exhibitors improved on the old instead of brining in the new to show the 500,000 visitors expected at the week-long event .

mobile phones long stopped being just for talking and the trend continued at cebit .
now they can send pictures and videos along with playing and downloading mp3 audio files .

the move is part of a nationwide crackdown on neo-nazi groups and organizations - two of which were also banned this week . the ruling now upheld by germany 's highest administrative court goes back to a case brought against regener -lrb- photo below -rrb- , who was handed a prison sentence for inciting racial hatred and spreading nazi propaganda . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael regener prosecutions have often been brought against individuals in germany under laws banning nazi propaganda and the incitement of public unrest .
but this was the first time a collective prosecution of this kind had been brought against a music group .
jürgen lampe , spokesman for the federal prosecutor , said the band was planning what they called an " aryan revolution " and was operating in a highly secretive manner . " the primary goal of this band was to commit crimes , " he said .
" its organizational structure bears the hallmarks of organized crime . " court : racism sole purpose of band the supreme administrative court said that landser was founded solely to produce and distribute racist songs and nazi ideology .
inflammatory lyrics such as " turks and commies and all that scum will soon be forever gone " from a song called " the reich will be back , " it said , were clearly meant to incite hatred and violence against foreigners and political opponents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo-nazis at a 2000 demonstration the band did n't make public appearances and for a long time its members had remained unknown .
experts have long been warning that neo-nazi organizations are spreading their hate messages through music distributed often for free especially among younger germans at schools .
a network of so-called " comradeships " has been established primarily in eastern germany fostering a cult of violence and hatred . latent feelings frank jantzen , an expert on the right-wing scene here , said this ideology often blends with latent racism among the population at large . " i fear this structural link between every-day racism and a perpetrator image cherished by rightist youths is the core problem , " he said .
" no-one has so far been able to sever this link which has fostered an extreme right-wing scene .
young neo-nazis are enmeshed in a culture of blood and violence that is promoted also through music and eventually seeks a vent .
democratic forces in germany are simply at a loss to effectively counter an ideology of dumb violence that is infesting more and more young minds . " in an effort to stop rightist violence - which has been rising in eastern germany again last year - authorities banned two more neo-nazi groups in the region on thursday .
they were among the most active of the " comradeships " in and around berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in raids on several homes police discovered neo-nazi pamphlets and t-shirts glorifying former nazi leaders as heroes and martyrs . earlier in the week , a group of young neo-nazis in brandenburg were classified as terrorists by a court in potsdam which handed down jail sentences to the members for attacking and burning immigrant-owned shops and fast food outlets . uwe hessler -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany moves to curb neo-nazi protests germany 's lower house of parliament friday voted by a large majority to tighten the right of assembly , thus making it easier in future to ban neo-nazi demonstrations at historic landmarks .

"
both airlines declined to comment .
but lufthansa and swiss have long been seen as potential partners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swiss plans to join the oneworld alliance , which also includes american airlines , failed previous merger talks between the two in 2003 failed because of strong resistance in switzerland to such a deal .
as a result , swiss tried - ultimately unsucessfully - to join british airways ' oneworld alliance . pertinently , swiss chairman christoph franz is a former lufthansa executive . swiss needs partner lufthansa for its part has always insisted that it has never closed the door completely on a deal with swiss , as long as the terms and conditions were right . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : firemen welcome the last swissair plane arriving from new york , by jets of water , at the cointrin airport in geneva , switzerland , sunday march 31 , 2002 .
and while swiss , the successor company to former flag carrier swissair which went bust in 2001 , has managed to narrow its losses , experts say the airline is unlikely to be able to survive on its own in the long term . financial times deutschland reported on friday that lufthansa had now come to the conclusion that the time was right to buy swiss , which is currently in better financial health than it had been in 2003 , at a lower price . swiss narrowed its full-year loss of 140 million swiss francs -lrb- € 90.3 million , $ 121.6 million -rrb- last year from 687 million swiss francs a year earlier and it hopes to break even at operating level this year . lufthansa 's door remains open lufthansa also declined to comment , but a spokesman reiterated the airline 's position that it had never shut the door completely on a tie-up . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang mayrhuber sources said the talks in zurich on friday were follow-up negotiations after lufthansa chief executive wolfgang mayrhuber -lrb- photo -rrb- and his swiss counterpart franz had outlined the broad brush-strokes of a merger at a recent meeting held in the secrecy of a remote mountain-top chalet . the negotiations were expected to lead to a cooperation between the two carriers beginning in the second or third quarter of this year and then possibly to a fully fledged merger later , the sources added . swiss will survive the business daily handelsblatt said lufthansa had agreed to maintain the swiss brand on condition the swiss airline implement additional belt-tightening measures and transfer control of its route network to frankfurt . analysts said lufthansa 's second attempt to gets its hands on swiss might be more successful . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lufthansa planes at frankfurt airport " airlines are under pressure to consolidate because of overcapacity , " said merck finck analyst robert heberger .
" there are still too many airlines and low-cost carriers are ruining prices .
lufthansa is one of the stronger players in a generally weak sector .
airlines are still suffering from the fallout of sept .
11 , 2001 .
and then there are rising kerosene prices , which carriers like swiss have not hedged against very much . " greater synergies alhough lufthansa has steered clear of big acquisitions in the past , opting instead for code-sharing agreements under the umbrella of its star alliance grouping , greater synergies would be gained in the case of swiss from a straight-forward takeover , the analyst argued . " lufthansa would have access to swiss 's zurich hub and it would be better able to fill its airbus a380 jets with swiss customers , " heberger said . nordlb analyst martina noss agreed . " strategically , a merger would make sense , not only in terms of synergies , but lufthansa would also be buying a rival whose routes in southern germany and in switzerland overlapped with its own , " she said , adding that she was maintaining her " buy " recommendation the stock . still a sick patient but heberger was more skeptical . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will lufthansa help swiss to get off the ground again ?
" swiss is still a sick patient , " he said , adding that he has a " hold " recommendation on the stock .
" and then there are the political considerations .

he lost the penis he was born with in the smashup , but thanks to modern science doctors were able to keep him from living the life of a monk . they reconstructed the organ using a mixture of skin , bone and other tissues from his own body and from all accounts , it was a smashing success .
gruber even fathered a child with his wife , bianca , using the new appendage . but gruber began complaining that the prosthetic was frequently infected and it became almost impossible for he and his wife to have sex .
he asked doctors to build him a new one , which they did in a berlin clinic . however , doctors left the first reconstruction attached , just to make sure the new one took and was properly supplied with blood .
suddenly , gruber was the proud owner of two willies .
one might think he 'd be the envy of every male on the planet . but when wife bianca got a look at the duo , she packed her backs and left , taking son etienne with her . " i 've got two penises , but no wife , but i am hoping when i get rid of the one of the penises i will get her back , " gruber said from his hospital bed . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the best of " from the fringe " it 's the best of the weird , wonderful and wonderfully quirky from around germany .

instead exhibitors are focusing on making the small smaller , the big bigger and the fast faster . it would be fair to expect more than a handful of new , whiz-bang products in the 27 exhibition hall that look better suited to hold commercial airlines rather than electronics , but the 6,270 companies from 69 countries , up from 6,109 companies and 64 countries in 2004 , at the annual cebit have something else on their minds .
whether dealing with how we watch tv , listen to music , talk with our friends and family , exercise or get through airport security , exhibitors improved on the old instead of brining in the new to show the 500,000 visitors expected at the week-long event .

shoes auto-adjust cushioning and resistance while running , and facial scans no longer require you to stand still .
mobile phones long stopped being just for talking and the trend continued at cebit .
now they can send pictures and videos along with playing and downloading mp3 audio files .
whether it 's actually a digital camera with a mobile phone or a mobile phone with a digital camera is an open question , but the samsung sch-v770 lets users talk and take seven megapixel digital pictures .
available in asia by in june , the phone has neither a european nor north american release date nor even a price as of yet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosch security systems scans cebit 2005 visitors ' faces to show how their facefinder package compares and recognizes facial features a quick swipe of the id card and the boss knows you 're at work .
thanks to biometrics , a glance at a video camera will be enough for bosch security systems ' facefinder to scan your face and determine your identity by comparing it to an established database .
" people do not have to do anything , " said stefan steinert of bosch security systems of the setup that has already found its way into some shopping malls and casinos .
" their faces can automatically be recognized . "

topbit software also presented a program that keeps track of people 's actions .
in its scaled down model the " un-stupidest house in the world " the living room computer controls actions all over the house .
with enough other devices and monitors installed throughout the house , the company 's software can close windows when the weather dictates , lock doors , record tv shoes you may like based on the ones you watch and end the nightmare of " did i turn off the iron " by turning off its power outlet after a set amount of time .
adidas presented a sneaker that will be of interest to next year 's visitors when they 're walking through the fair 's nearly 309,000 square meters -lrb- 730,800 square yards -rrb- of exhibits .

games light up high-definition displays an exhibit hall dedicated to computer gaming broke up the sea of beige-toned electronic office devices .
though a surprising number of lcd panels and computer monitor exhibitors still used solitaire as their default display of choice , it was fast-moving computer games most companies used to show off their high definition video equipment , offering plenty of chances to try out new releases on equipment well out of the average game player 's price range .
the public will have until march 16 to try out all the cutting-edge of electronic gadgets free of charge - after that they 'll be available in stores around the world . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de goodbye copper wire , hello internet phone the days of phone calls being jammed down copper cables are long gone .

the move is part of a nationwide crackdown on neo-nazi groups and organizations - two of which were also banned this week . the ruling now upheld by germany 's highest administrative court goes back to a case brought against regener -lrb- photo below -rrb- , who was handed a prison sentence for inciting racial hatred and spreading nazi propaganda . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael regener prosecutions have often been brought against individuals in germany under laws banning nazi propaganda and the incitement of public unrest .
but this was the first time a collective prosecution of this kind had been brought against a music group .
jürgen lampe , spokesman for the federal prosecutor , said the band was planning what they called an " aryan revolution " and was operating in a highly secretive manner . " the primary goal of this band was to commit crimes , " he said .
" its organizational structure bears the hallmarks of organized crime . " court : racism sole purpose of band the supreme administrative court said that landser was founded solely to produce and distribute racist songs and nazi ideology .

young neo-nazis are enmeshed in a culture of blood and violence that is promoted also through music and eventually seeks a vent .
democratic forces in germany are simply at a loss to effectively counter an ideology of dumb violence that is infesting more and more young minds .

the march of several hundred is led by gandhi 's great-grandson tushar gandhi .
mahatma gandhi undertook the 24-day walk from ahmedabad to the coastal village of dandi to manufacture salt .
it sparked india 's civil disobedience movement as thousands joined him on the beach to pick up salt , the production of which was under government control .
the italian-born president of india 's governing congress party , sonia gandhi , launched the march in a ceremony at sabarmati ashram , once mahatma gandhi 's commune in ahmedabad , gujarat .
the bbc 's sanjeev srivastava said the ceremony was solemn , almost subdued , and was interspersed with the independence leader 's favourite prayers .
mrs gandhi urged those carrying out the 380km -lrb- 240 miles -rrb- to take forward mahatma gandhi 's message of " peace and non-violence " .
few similarities mahatma gandhi 's aim at the end of the dandi walk was to manufacture salt and defy the monopoly on salt production by the british colonial rulers .
the unique , non-violent protest forced the british to take note of the growing civil disobedience movement in the country .
march route mahatma 's great-grandson tushar and several hundred fellow marchers will follow the same route and take a similar length of time to walk it .
but there the similarities with the 1930 march end , says our correspondent .
the values that mahatma gandhi lived and died for - such as non-violence , religious tolerance and honesty in public life - are as alien to today 's india as the days of the raj , says our correspondent .
gandhi was known for his simple ways , but the sequel march was something of an extravaganza .
saturday 's march was attended by nearly half of the indian cabinet , many of whom walked for a few kilometres before returning to their hotels , our correspondent observed .
tushar gandhi acknowledged there was little to compare his march to his great-grandfather 's , although he said they carried the same message of religious harmony , brotherhood and peace .
" the comparison is that all the dandi walkers who have come from all over the world are volunteers .
they came ... because they identified with this battle and i think that is the spirit , " he told the bbc .

tushar gandhi acknowledged there was little to compare his march to his great-grandfather 's , although he said they carried the same message of religious harmony , brotherhood and peace .
" the comparison is that all the dandi walkers who have come from all over the world are volunteers .
they came ... because they identified with this battle and i think that is the spirit , " he told the bbc .

the march of several hundred is led by gandhi 's great-grandson tushar gandhi .
mahatma gandhi undertook the 24-day walk from ahmedabad to the coastal village of dandi to manufacture salt .
it sparked india 's civil disobedience movement as thousands joined him on the beach to pick up salt , the production of which was under government control .
the italian-born president of india 's governing congress party , sonia gandhi , launched the march in a ceremony at sabarmati ashram , once mahatma gandhi 's commune in ahmedabad , gujarat .
the bbc 's sanjeev srivastava said the ceremony was solemn , almost subdued , and was interspersed with the independence leader 's favourite prayers .
mrs gandhi urged those carrying out the 380km -lrb- 240 miles -rrb- to take forward mahatma gandhi 's message of " peace and non-violence " .
few similarities mahatma gandhi 's aim at the end of the dandi walk was to manufacture salt and defy the monopoly on salt production by the british colonial rulers .
the unique , non-violent protest forced the british to take note of the growing civil disobedience movement in the country .
march route mahatma 's great-grandson tushar and several hundred fellow marchers will follow the same route and take a similar length of time to walk it .
but there the similarities with the 1930 march end , says our correspondent .
the values that mahatma gandhi lived and died for - such as non-violence , religious tolerance and honesty in public life - are as alien to today 's india as the days of the raj , says our correspondent .
gandhi was known for his simple ways , but the sequel march was something of an extravaganza .
saturday 's march was attended by nearly half of the indian cabinet , many of whom walked for a few kilometres before returning to their hotels , our correspondent observed .
tushar gandhi acknowledged there was little to compare his march to his great-grandfather 's , although he said they carried the same message of religious harmony , brotherhood and peace .

council bosses and police are bringing in new measures to tackle the problem , which accounts for 40 % of all break-ins in hartlepool .
the town has now launched one of its biggest ever anti-burglary campaigns .
the campaign has even led to the creation of a new animated crime fighter - in the shape of a cartoon character called willie walk-in .
the government-funded safer hartlepool partnership is offering to supply and fit a range of household security devices , including locks , bolts and intruder alarms .
determined burglars alison mawson , hartlepool council 's head of community safety and prevention , said : " statistics show that walk-in burglaries account for nearly 40 % of all break-ins that occur in the town .
" so this campaign to encourage people to always lock their doors - even when they are at home - has the potential to really make a difference .
" it 's a fact of life that many residents become complacent over security whilst in their own homes because they do n't think that burglars will take the risk of entering and being caught .
" however , it can take just a few seconds for determined burglars to sneak-in and help themselves to property . "
residents ' groups can apply for help up until 2 april by contacting hartlepool borough council .

the collapse left the port with only two berths big enough for large cross-channel ferries , one of which will be closed for repairs from monday .
p & o said its services from dover would be subject to more delays and cancellations on monday and tuesday .
seafrance said 10 of its 15 scheduled crossings would be unaffected .
all our customers have been inconvenienced william gibbons its other services may be subject to some delays .
it comes after french strike action caused two days of ferry disruption .
no p & o or seafrance ferries were able to leave dover from wednesday afternoon until thursday evening due to the 24-hour french national strike .
the ferry service between dover and calais has been badly disrupted since the loading bay collapse in early february .
there are regular delays of between two and four hours for passengers heading to calais and lorry traffic through the port has been badly affected .
p & o said the disruption had cost the company millions and it would be seeking compensation from the port of calais .
catamaran crossing william gibbons , head of the passenger shipping association , said the hold-ups were not good news for the industry .
" all our customers have been inconvenienced , " he said .
" luckily it has happened at a time of year when passenger traffic is relatively low .
" we do see it as a temporary problem which will be resolved shortly . "
hoverspeed 's catamaran crossing , which resumes on wednesday after the winter break , uses a different terminal so should be unaffected .
